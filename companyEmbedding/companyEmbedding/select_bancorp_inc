(GlobeNewswire) - Select Bancorp, Inc. (Select) (NASDAQ:SLCT), the holding company for Select Bank & Trust Company, and Premara Financial, Inc. (Premara) (OTC:PARA), the holding company of Carolina Premier Bank, jointly announced today a definitive agreement for Select to acquire Premara, in a stock and cash transaction. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the Boards of Directors of each company and is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2017, subject to the approval of federal and state regulatory agencies and the receipt of required shareholder approvals.
Carolina Premier Bank, a North Carolina chartered community bank, operates four banking offices, one in Charlotte and three in the South Carolina communities of Rock Hill, Blacksburg and Six Mile. The merger will expand Selects presence and will allow Select to offer its product line and services to Carolina Premiers customers. The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to Selects earnings per share excluding merger costs, increasing its stand-alone EPS by 10.1% beginning in 2018.
Under the terms of the merger agreement, Premara shareholders will receive merger consideration consisting of approximately 70% stock, with a fixed exchange ratio of 1.0463 shares of Select common stock for each share of Premara common stock, and 30% cash, or $12.65 for each share of Premara common stock. Premara shareholders will have an election option on the type of merger consideration that they would prefer to receive, subject to proration of such elections in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement. The transaction is currently valued at approximately $40 million based on Selects closing price of $11.89 per share on July 20, 2017.
Select, which first opened for business in 2000, operates 13 branches in the North Carolina communities of Burlington, Clinton, Dunn, Elizabeth City, Fayetteville, Goldsboro, Greenville, Leland, Lillington, Lumberton, Morehead City, Raleigh and Washington. Select also plans to open a full-service branch in Wilmington in October 2017, pending final regulatory approval, which, with the contemplated addition of the Carolina Premier Bank branches, would bring Selects total branch offices to 18.
Select is extremely excited to enter the Charlotte, N.C. and northern S.C. markets through the acquisition of Carolina Premier Bank, said William L. Hedgepeth II, president and CEO. The acquisition of Carolina Premier Bank will move Select Bank & Trust to over $1 billion in assets and our footprint will expand west to Charlotte and into northern South Carolina. Since our founding in 2000, we have worked hard to become a high-performing community bank in eastern and central North Carolina. We have experienced and local bankers that are dedicated to delivering competitive banking products and services, as well as quality customer service, to our customers and prospective customers in the markets that we are privileged to serve. We think our success is the direct result of that dedication to the markets we serve.
Our success and market share in cities and towns such as Dunn, Greenville, Goldsboro and Fayetteville and other locations in North Carolina allow us to continue to expand into markets such as Raleigh, the Wilmington area, and now, Charlotte and northern South Carolina. Our focused efforts on what a community bank should be and our efficiencies allow us the opportunity for expansion. We believe this strategic acquisition will allow us to build out our Raleigh and Wilmington area markets while establishing a presence in western North Carolina and northern South Carolina. We will leverage our resources, expertise, knowledge and commitment to continue as a high-performing community bank while we continue to grow.
Hedgepeth added, We look forward to providing the customers and employees of Carolina Premier Bank with the resources to help them be successful. Our banks mission is, To be the bank of choice in the communities we serve, by providing exceptional customer service, superior products and experienced bankers using a common sense approach to banking.
Carolina Premier Chief Executive Officer David P. Barksdale stated, We are excited to join the Select Bank & Trust team. Carolina Premiers customers will find that Select shares our focus on outstanding personalized service. Select is a high-performing bank and their performance measures put them in the Top 10 in the state.

And then there were 2 – The number of Charlotte-based banks sinks again

Charlotte is set to lose the headquarters of yet another bank, shrinking the figure to just two, in an acquisition announced Friday of community lender Carolina Premier Bank.
The planned purchase by Select Bancorp, headquartered in the North Carolina city of Dunn about 130 miles east of Charlotte, is expected to close before the end of the year. Boards of both companies have already approved the approximately $40 million deal, which still needs regulatory and shareholder approvals.
For Charlotte, it means Bank of America and NewDominion Bank are poised to be the only banks headquartered in a city known for its large financial services sector. That could be the case if two other deals announced this year – one involving Capital Bank, the other involving Park Sterling Bank – go through as planned.

Former Carolina Premier chief executive John Kreighbaum launched the Ballantyne-based company in 2007, with a focus on the growing south Charlotte market. Carolina Premier has four banking offices: one in Charlotte and three in Rock Hill, Blacksburg and Six Mile, S.C.




The deal is expected to grow Select Bank, which has no branches in the Charlotte area, to 18 branches from 13 currently as its footprint spreads west and into northern South Carolina. Its assets are expected to expand to more than $1 billion when combined with those of Carolina Premier, which reported $259 million in the first three months of this year. 
Carolina Premier CEO David Barksdale told the Observer the deal resulted from the company’s focus on ways to maximize shareholder value. He said the combined company will still be a community bank but a larger one positioned to better serve customers. 
He said it’s too early to tell how Charlotte-area employees might be affected by the deal. He also said the companies have not disclosed whether he will have a role with the combined company. 
The dwindling number of banks headquartered in Charlotte has been a key factor in the city’s loss of its title as the nation’s second-largest banking center to San Francisco. As the Observer first reported in May, growth in San Francisco’s financial sector enabled it to push Charlotte to No. 3, based on value of loans and other assets held by banks headquartered in the respective cities.
In 2007, Charlotte was home base to eight banks – a list that included Wachovia, which nearly collapsed in the 2008 financial crisis before San Francisco-based Wells Fargo bought it.



“Charlotte is an attractive market for banks, regardless of where folks are headquartered,” Barksdale said. “Which is why you are seeing banks want to come in here.”

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

DUNN, N.C. and GREENVILLE, N.C., Sept. 30, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- New Century Bancorp, Inc. ("New Century") (NASDAQ:   NCBC), the holding company for New Century Bank, and Select Bancorp, Inc. ("Select"), the holding company for Select Bank & Trust Company, have announced the signing of a strategic merger agreement. 
The agreement was approved by the boards of directors of both companies and provides for a partnership between Dunn, North Carolina-based New Century Bank and Greenville, North Carolina-based Select Bank & Trust Company, announced William L. Hedgepeth II, president and CEO of both New Century Bancorp and New Century Bank, and Mark A. Holmes, president and CEO of Select Bancorp and CEO of Select Bank & Trust Company.
The transaction is expected to close mid-2014 subject to the approval of federal and state regulatory agencies and shareholders of both companies.
New Century Bank, which first opened for business in 2000, operates seven branches in the eastern North Carolina communities of Dunn, Fayetteville (2), Goldsboro, Clinton, Lillington, and Lumberton and two loan production offices (LPOs) located in Raleigh and Greenville. New Century Bank plans to open a full-service branch in Raleigh in October 2013, which will replace the current LPO. Total assets, deposits, and loans for New Century Bancorp as of June 30, 2013, were $550.0 million, $465.5 million, and $355.7 million, respectively.
Select Bank & Trust Company, which opened for business in 2004, maintains six offices in Greenville (2), Elizabeth City, Washington, Gibsonville and Burlington. Select Bancorp, Inc. reported total assets, deposits and loans of $265.3 million, $213.7 million and $209.7 million, respectively, as of June 30, 2013.
The projected total assets of the combined company are $815.3 million, projected total deposits $679.2 million and projected total loans $565.4 million.
"This partnership creates a strong community bank committed to serving personal and business customers in our markets, as well as the communities in which we operate," said Hedgepeth. "Together, we believe we will be able to expand into new markets, offering new customers the same high value and personal service both banks have given their customers."
According to Holmes, "We are combining two banks that have almost no market overlap, but are located in a number of adjacent markets, into one strong financial institution that should allow us to serve more customers and communities in meaningful ways."
Under the terms of the agreement, shareholders of Select common stock will receive 1.8264 shares of New Century common stock for each share of Select common stock, for an implied value of approximately $31.1 million in the aggregate, based on 2,475,000 shares of Select common stock outstanding and the $6.87 per share closing price of New Century common stock on September 27, 2013, valuing each share of Select common stock at approximately $12.55 per share.
In addition, each share of Select's issued and outstanding preferred stock will be exchanged for one share of newly issued New Century preferred stock having terms substantially identical to the Select preferred stock. All of the issued and outstanding shares of Select's preferred stock are held by the Secretary of the United States Treasury and were issued in connection with Select's participation in the Small Business Lending Fund.
New Century Bancorp, Inc was advised by Janney Montgomery Scott LLC and Wyrick Robbins Yates & Ponton LLP served as New Century's legal counsel. Select Bancorp, Inc. was advised by Smith Capital, Inc. and Williams Mullen served as Select's legal counsel.

We have experienced and local bankers that are dedicated to delivering competitive banking products and services, as well as quality customer service, to our customers and prospective customers in the markets that we are privileged to serve. We think our success is the direct result of that dedication to the markets we serve.”“Our success and market share in cities and towns such as Dunn, Greenville, Goldsboro and Fayetteville and other locations in North Carolina allow us to continue to expand into markets such as Raleigh, the Wilmington area, and now, Charlotte and northern South Carolina. Our focused efforts on what a community bank should be and our efficiencies allow us the opportunity for expansion. We believe this strategic acquisition will allow us to build out our Raleigh and Wilmington area markets while establishing a presence in western North Carolina and northern South Carolina. We will leverage our resources, expertise, knowledge and commitment to continue as a high-performing community bank while we continue to grow.”Hedgepeth added, “We look forward to providing the customers and employees of Carolina Premier Bank with the resources to help them be successful.
