PERSONAL BANKING

Personal Banking at Pacific Mercantile Bank is convenient, safe and secure.  And with online access, we put you in control of your financial resources.
Personal Checking: Write checks, make deposits. Choose the account that’s right for you based on your volume. Have complete flexibility to use the funds as needed.
Personal Savings: Designed for your excess cash so every dollar can be working to earn interest. Savings accounts allow deposits and withdrawals at any time and for any amount.
Personal Certificates of Deposit: If you know you have extra cash you won’t need for a specific amount of time, choose a certificate of deposit for a fixed term and you will earn a higher rate of interest.
Personal Money Market Accounts: Designed for the individual that saves money regularly but only withdraws cash a few times each month. Earn a higher rate of interest when you can plan your withdrawal needs.
Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs): Earn the highest interest on funds you save for retirement, home purchase or college tuition. If you are eligible to establish an IRA (your tax advisor should confirm your eligibility), you can begin saving for the future now.
Visa Debit Card/ATM Card

Online Banking: Managing your accounts online is easy and convenient.

FRAUD PREVENTION

The protection of your accounts is a partnership between your company and Pacific Mercantile Bank.
Let’s work together to safeguard your company’s cash assets. Leverage the services and solutions Pacific Mercantile Bank offers to prevent fraud.
Are you spending too much of your valuable time worrying about fraud hitting your business? Or, worse, not enough time? New technologies in payments have made payment fraud a moving target.  Fortunately, you can put best practices and fraud protection tools in place to minimize the impact of payment fraud on your business. This paper examines the trends in payment fraud, the types of fraud that businesses are exposed to, and the practices and services that can be implemented to greatly reduce the likelihood that your business will fall victim.
Payment Fraud White Paper (PDF)
It has been called Imposter Fraud, Business Email Compromise, and CEO Fraud. It is a disturbing trend in fraud that has grown at epidemic rates since it was first identified by the FBI in 2013. While this threat is real and growing, there are simple steps you can take to prevent Imposter Fraud from affecting your business. This white paper examines the trends in Imposter Fraud and provides the tools and best practices you can employ to protect your business.
Imposter Fraud White Paper (PDF)
Payment fraud continues to be a dominant source of fraud nationwide. A recent AFP survey found that 75% of companies surveyed were victims of payment fraud in 2016. At Pacific Mercantile Bank, we provide safe and secure solutions to help combat payment fraud. Our cash management team is ready to work with you to identify the best solutions and practices to help minimize your risk of payment fraud.

CLIENTS

We are proud that our clients look to us for business banking beyond the obvious. Our clients choose Pacific Mercantile for experienced perspective and wise counsel on enterprise issues critical to their business success. They enjoy a more valuable banking relationship than a simple line of credit. They benefit from sound advice on a wide range of topics, including:

Company growth strategy
Optimizing capital structure
Rent vs. buy decisions
Financial modeling for the business
Business succession planning

Their goal is not just to get by, but to master unique challenges and leverage rare opportunities not addressed by “once size fits all” banking.  Our clients want to achieve their business vision, and they seek experienced, empowered bankers to be their partners in success.

Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
