George's Organics International


George's Organics International - we supply bulk certified organic ingredients to food manufacturers and food service companies. We act not as a broker, but as a sourcing agent on behalf of our clients, which means we earn a commission based on a predetermined rate. Our long-term relationships have led to strategic alliances which allow us to offer high-quality products with aggressive pricing. Many times, we're able to get lower prices than you could if you "went direct". And because we don't have a retail line of our own, we never compete with our clients over often-limited organic ingredients. We work for you.

How does the Annual Paid Membership and Free 30 Day Trial work?


The Membership
By joining Thrive Market as an annual member, you’ll be joining hundreds of thousands of Americans across the country who are already enjoying wholesome products at wholesale prices. Because of the membership, we don’t have to mark up our products like other retailers and can pass along those savings to our members. As a result, the average member makes back their $59.95 annual membership fee (that’s just $5/month) in savings in just 2 orders. For each paid membership, Thrive Market provides a free membership to a family in need, teacher, veteran, or first responder. Together we can make healthy options affordable and accessible to everyone.


The Free 30 Day Trial
We’re so confident in the value of the annual membership, that we let new shoppers try Thrive Market for free for the first 30 days. We’ve found overwhelmingly that this allows first time Thrivers to shop, discover, save, and quickly see the value of becoming an annual paid member at just $59.95 for the full year.

Is your question more specific?

Yes
No

What is Thrive Gives?


Thrive Gives is our way of making healthy living affordable and accessible to everyone. We understand that paying our annual membership fee may not be possible for everyone, so for every paid membership we sell, we give a free membership to someone in need. Thrive Market members and Thrive Gives members enjoy the same access to wholesome products at wholesale prices. We distribute these free memberships through our Thrive Gives program and our nonprofit partners. Learn more  here.

For each person you invite who becomes a paid member, you'll earn $25 in Thrive Cash. There is no limit to the number of friends you can invite to join—the more the merrier!

Nature's Path "Smart Bran"

Nature's Path "Smart Bran" is the BEST!!!!! I have intestinal issues and can control it with Smart Bran; I recommend it to all my friends (for constipation or diarrhea) and every- one loves it because it works; I eat it everyday with a touch of yoghurt, fruit and a bit of milk...........thank you, thank you.......

Delicious!

Smart Bran is the only bran cereal that I like the taste of. Other bran cereals on the grocer's shelves taste like haystacks or cardboard, but not Smart Bran. It is so delicious, that I actually look forward to eating it most mornings. I like it with a little cinnamon and some sunflower seeds on top, but it's great the way it is. The side benefits are wonderful too! Thank you, Nature's Path!

No soy, thank you!

I am a breast cancer survivor of almost 7 years and am still doing oral chemo. The drug messes with my digestive track and this cereal is the only thing I have found without soy that completely does the trick for me. I am lucky to live in the area were this cereal is produced and would love to see more stores carry this product. I give this product 5 stars not only for what it does but I really do love the flavor the of cereal as well! Thank you Nature's Path!

Nature's Path Pumpkin-N-Spice™ Flax Plus® Granola Bars | 7.4 oz. box | Real, organic pumpkin seeds and sweet cinnamon; all made with good stuff like whole grain oats and flax. Our Pumpkin Flax bar still has the flax and pumpkin seeds you know and love and is still an excellent source of Omega 3's! No wonder this is our classic, best seller (with a small name change)! And….All our bars now come in the EnviroBox, which is 36% smaller box than a standard 6.2 ounce box.

								Real, organic pumpkin seeds and sweet cinnamon; all made with good stuff like whole grain oats and flax. Our Pumpkin Flax bar still has the flax and pumpkin seeds you know and love and is still an excellent source of Omega 3's! No wonder this is our classic, best seller (with a small name change)! And….All our bars now come in the EnviroBox, which is 36% smaller box than a standard 6.2 ounce box.
								


Ingredients:
Granola* (rolled oats*, evaporated cane juice*, soy oil*), tapioca syrup*, brown rice flour*, pumpkin seeds* (pumpkin seeds*, salt), invert cane syrup*, flaxseeds*, acacia gum*, soy oil*, evaporated cane juice*, sea salt, spice*, molasses*. *Organic. Contains soy. Produced in a facility that uses dairy, peanuts, and tree nuts.

These are the best bars on the market!! I usually dip them in Greek yogurt, all flavors but I have found apple flavors are the best. Unfortunately I have to drive 30 miles to get them, my local store does not carry them.

Excellent tasting for picky eaters

I did a blind taste test for my 4 and 7 year olds with 4 different granola bars- Health Warrior Chia coconut bars, Earnest eats - maple almond crunch bars and Nature's Valley Oats and Honey granola bars and these bars. Both kids ending up not liking the other bars and loving these and asking for more. I was glad since I had just paid for a case of them. Even my picky husband likes them. They have a high amount of iron- great before donating blood! They are not dry and stiff like you would sadly come to expect with a granola bar. They are delicious and moist!

wonderful taste 
3/6/2017

I love this granola better than any other granola I have tasted. I eat a serving every morning to start my day. I have one complaint about it. The flax seed is whole so it is not doing the body much good. In order for our body's to absorb the nutrients from flax, the hard outer shell need to be off. If the flax was ground it would give us more omega 3.

great flavor if a bit on the sweet side

This granola would be absolutely perfect if the sweetness was dialed back a bit. Seems it would bring out the nuttiness of the pumpkin seeds and flax seed.
