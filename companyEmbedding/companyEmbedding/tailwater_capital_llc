 GROWTH MINDSET, PARTNERSHIP ORIENTED  What makes Tailwater Capital different is the firm’s natural orientation to see things from the perspective of the entrepreneur. Instead of sitting on the other side of the table from our industry partners, we like to sit on the same side, take time to understand what motivates them and forge strong alignment of interests. 

We believe that alignment of interest and a long-term partnership approach are two of the key components to creating a strong foundation for a successful investment. We target investments in the midstream and upstream sectors where we can utilize our significant transaction experience to complement our management partners’ operating expertise in a true “win/win” fashion.
