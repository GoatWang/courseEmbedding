Examining Gartner’s 2017 Market Guide for Product-Centric Cloud ERP Solutions
Posted on July 20, 2017 by Elizabeth Quirk in Best Practices, ERP News, Featured, Staff Pick 



Gartner Inc., the world’s leading enterprise technology research and analyst firm, has published the 2017 edition of its Market Guide for Product-Centric Cloud ERP Solutions. The guide provides a concise look at everything from the ERP market direction to some of the space’s representative vendors.
Gartner defines product-centric organizations as those who manufacture, sell and/or distribute products. Some also sell services, such as installation or maintenance, delivered by direct employees and contractors, but this is not their primary focus. However, Gartner has published a Market Guide for Service-Centric ERP that focuses on this.
Product-centric organizations are usually either manufacturing or distribution companies.
According to Gartner, the landscape for cloud ERP for product-centric organizations is in transition as cloud becomes more prevalent and offers multiple deployment models. CIO’s and application leaders responsible for ERP strategy should use this guide to identify the types of solutions available in the market today.
This trend towards cloud deployment doesn’t show any signs of stopping, and nowhere is this more evident than in modern ERP solutions. Businesses once scrambled through disorganized spreadsheets to manage operations, ERP systems now provide one central database with the ability to manage a plethora of business processes.
Key Takeaways
The guide notes that, “Product-centric companies are increasingly directly impacted by the emergence of digital business, which is disrupting many of the traditional business models in product-centric industries. Consequently, some product-centric organizations view the move to cloud ERP applications as a way of transforming business processes to support the shift to digital business.”
Cloud ERP solutions for product-centric companies are maturing, which in turn, will be adopted by midsize organizations over the next three years, eventually influencing larger organizations to adopt them.
As the market grows, vendors seek to push their clients to new-generation cloud ERP solutions. This means many organizations will have to face a choice between on-premise products or new cloud solutions that are still early in their lifecycle.
Some vendors mentioned in the market guide report include: Acumatica, Epicor Software, IFS, Infor, IQMS, Microsoft, NetSuite, Oracle, QAD, Ramco Systems, Rootstock Software and SAP, just to name a few.
