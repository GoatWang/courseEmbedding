Local student receives O.C.E.A.N., Inc. Board of Directors Scholarship
Ms. Daniela Madriz, a student at Lakewood High School is the recipient of the O.C.E.A.N., Inc. Board of Directors Scholarship in the amount of $5,000. Ms. Madriz was accepted at numerous colleges and has decided to attend Ocean County College in the Fall of 2017.
During her time at Lakewood High School, she was a member of the National Honors Society and the Spanish National Honors Society with honors in History and English AP. Her community activities included volunteering in after school activities, assisting at church activities, fundraising and participating in activities with special needs children.
Daniela’s ultimate goal is to become a neonatal nurse, a subspecialty of nursing that works with newborn infants born with challenges. “ This job is what I have always wanted to do, to work with newborn babies that need help or saving because they cannot help themselves,” said Ms. Madriz. “My educational objectives are to stay focused throughout all years at college where I can study to become the best neonatal nurse to make my family proud and to have a secure future.”
Ms. Madriz’s scholarship was made possible through CSBG grant funding by the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs. On behalf of the O.C.E.A.N., Inc. Board of Trustees and agency staff we wish Daniela the best in her future.
