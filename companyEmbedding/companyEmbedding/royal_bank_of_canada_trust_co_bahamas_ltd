 The Bahamas is an archipelago of some 700 islands and cays spread 
over 100,000 square miles of incredibly beautiful turquoise blue water. The Bahamas 
achieved Independence in 1973 and remains a member of the British Commonwealth. 
It enjoys a stable legal and political foundation that dates back more than three 
centuries.  Extending over 500 miles between a point 50 miles off the southeast 
Florida coast to just north of Hispaniola (Haiti and Dominican Republic), 29 of 
the islands are populated. Nassau, the capital city is located on the island of 
New Providence and Freeport, known locally as "the second city," is situated on 
Grand Bahama island. RBC operates officies on seven islands. The economy 
of the Bahamas is largely dependent on tourism and the financial services sectors. 
Tourism accounts for 50 per cent of GDP. Its tropical climate and picture-postcard 
beauty are obvious advantages; over three million visitors travel to the islands 
annually.  The financial services sector took root commencing in the late 
1950's. High tax rates and currency controls in many industrial countries around 
the globe caused an ever increasing number of banks and trust companies to establish 
operations in the Bahamas. Close proximity to North America, strict bank secrecy 
and confidentiality laws and the absence of direct taxation make the Bahamas one 
of the most important financial centres in the Western Hemisphere.  RBC 
Royal Bank of Canada opened its first branch in 1908 on Bay Street in Nassau. 
It acquired the assets of its only competitor, a locally owned bank, in 1917. 
From then until 1947, it was the only bank in the Bahamas, growing with the country 
and providing the expanding economy and population with a stable and internationally 
recognized banking foundation.  In 1998, RBC Royal Bank of Canada celebrated 
its 90th anniversary. Despite increased competition, RBC Financial Group has retained 
its leadership position and provides a full range of financial services to domestic 
and international clients through four entities:  RBC 
Royal Bank of Canada - A full range of commercial and consumer lending 
and deposit services to domestic and international clients through a branch network 
of 21 units spread throughout the major islands of the Bahamas.  Royal 
Bank of Canada Trust Company (Bahamas) Limited - A wholly-owned subsidiary 
of Royal Bank of Canada, provides a full range of banking, deposit, trust and 
company management services in all major currencies to international clients under 
its Global Private Banking brand. Click 
here for more information. Finance Corporation 
of Bahamas Limited (RBC FINCO) - 75 per cent owned by Royal Bank of Canada, 
RBC FINCO provides deposit and mortgage financing to domestic clients in Nassau 
and Freeport.  RBC Dominion Securities (Global) 
Limited - Is a personal, private, professional full-services investment 
dealer. Click here for more information.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
