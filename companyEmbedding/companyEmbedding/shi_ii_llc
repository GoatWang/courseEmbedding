You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.

data center optimization, IT asset management and cloud computing, SHI offers custom 
IT solutions for every aspect of your environment.

highly-skilled and tenured sales force with software volume licensing experts, hardware 
procurement specialists and certified IT services professionals. 
SHI's goal is to foster long-term and mutually-beneficial relationships with 
our customers and partners, every single day.
