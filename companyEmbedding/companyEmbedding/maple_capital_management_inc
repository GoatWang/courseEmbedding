Investment Philosophy - Maple Capital Management

Maple Capital Management





effectively managing client assets


Investment Philosophy
Maple Capital believes the key to effectively managing client assets is to first gain a thorough understanding of the client’s goals and objectives. Once this framework has been established, we construct a portfolio designed to meet these goals while also minimizing risk.
Core Equity Philosophy:
We believe that the key to superior investment returns is to invest in companies with high quality products & services, strong cash flows, solid balance sheets, and sustainable competitive advantages.
Recognizing that great companies are not always great investments, we seek to avoid this pitfall by rigorously modeling the prices we pay for securities. We believe that our fundamental research and strict valuation discipline can consistently and repeatedly identify attractive investment opportunities. The companies we invest in tend to have the following characteristics:

Attractive long-term growth prospects
Sustainable competitive position or high barriers to entry
Stable, high quality cash flow and earnings
Consistently high or increasing returns on equity and capital
Low risk, high quality balance sheets

Fixed Income Philosophy:
We utilize a consistent research process to identify fixed income investment opportunities suited to client goals and objectives. Our process combines our top down views on the economy and the direction of interest rates with fundamental security analysis. We believe active bond management can capture additional yield through minor differences in bond maturity, priority, or ratings. Active management is also a primary tool for portfolio risk control.







 

Strategies - Maple Capital Management

Maple Capital Management








Balanced Strategies:
Traditional Balanced Strategy — This strategy combines one or more of the equity strategies below with the appropriate fixed income strategy for a given client. This strategy is suitable for institutions seeking a combination of capital appreciation and preservation of capital.
Equity Strategies:
Core Equity Strategy —This strategy emphasizes common stock of high quality companies with strong market positions, attractive balance sheets, and substantial long-term earnings momentum that are trading at a reasonable discount to their intrinsic value. This strategy is suitable for investors seeking the growth of common stocks.
Equity Income Strategy —This strategy utilizes dividend-paying securities, including common and preferred stocks, real estate investment trusts (REITs), closed-end mutual funds and exchange-traded master limited partnerships (MLPs), to provide above-average income yields. This strategy is suitable for investors seeking high current income while retaining opportunities for future gains.
Diversified Equity Strategy —This strategy includes multiple asset classes. It typically combines our Core Equity or Equity Income strategies with one or more of the outsourced strategies listed below to achieve a diversified multi-asset class portfolio.
Fixed-Income Strategies:
Taxable Fixed Income Strategy — This strategy utilizes direct U.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. Agency securities, Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS), Corporate bonds, negotiable CD’s and Asset-Backed securities. This is an investment grade vehicle, and can be structured to pre-fund any specific cash flow needs.
Tax-Exempt Fixed Income Strategy — Tax-free municipal bonds will be the primary instrument used in this strategy, although taxable bonds described in the prior strategy (Taxable Fixed Income) may be used if they are appropriate on an after-tax basis. This is an investment grade vehicle; however, non-rated bonds may be purchased under appropriate circumstances. Portfolios can be structured to pre-fund any specific cash flow needs.
Enhanced Cash Management Strategy — This strategy provides a money-market alternative used primarily by large institutional clients. We structure these portfolios to provide the specific liquidity and cash flows requirements of each account.
External Managed Strategies:
In order to achieve a level of portfolio diversification beyond what can be achieved through Maple Capital’s proprietary investment capabilities, we have selected a number of “outsourced” investments designed to complement our own strategies. These investments include: small-cap equities, international equities, emerging markets and high-yield fixed income. In each case, we have performed detailed screening and have identified investment managers with a proven level of success in their niche.
