At Pulmatrix, we are developing innovative inhaled therapies to address serious pulmonary disease using our clinically validated, proprietary iSPERSE technology.  Leveraging the unique capabilities of iSPERSE to dramatically advance inhalation technology, we can create new therapies to improve patient outcomes.  

Our pipeline of inhaled therapies rrepresents innovative, first-in-class products. Our proprietary pipeline of novel, therapies for respiratory diseases is led by PUR1900, PUR1800 and PUR5700.  PUR1900 is an inhaled anti-infective to treat ABPA in severe asthmatics and cystic fibrosis patients. PUR1800 and PUR5700 are novel inhaled anti-inflammatory compounds that selectively inhibit kinases involved in inflammation.  PUR1800 is being developed to treat and prevent exacerbations in patients with COPD and PUR5700 is being explored as a therapy for COPD, asthma and IPF. Our pipeline in major pulmonary diseases developed in collaboration with partners is led by PUR0200, a branded generic in clinical development for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  

iSPERSE is a, dry powder technology developed, patented and validated by Pulmatrix scientists and engineers to improve how drugs are directed into the lungs.  iSPERSE products are designed to maximize local drug concentrations and reduce systemic side effects, in order to make possible a new generation of inhaled therapies to improve patient outcomes.

LEXINGTON, Mass., May 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Pulmatrix, Inc. (NASDAQ: PULM), a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative inhaled therapies to address serious pulmonary diseases, today announced that it has received a key patent in the United States for its lead drug candidate, PUR0200, which is intended to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD). 



"This patent ensures that the product is protected by intellectual property until 2033," said Robert W. Clarke, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer for Pulmatrix. "It also is further recognition of the potential medical advances offered by our innovative iSPERSE™ technology for delivering drugs to the lungs more efficiently."
The new patent, US 9642798, follows both an earlier patent granted in Japan in 2016 (JP 5877204) for the composition of PUR0200 and several broader patents (such as US 9061352, 9119778, 9233158, 9238005 and 9433576) that provide protection for Pulmatrix's technology platform and its use to treat a wide variety of diseases.
The new patent covers PUR0200, an inhaled drug made by combining Pulmatrix's technology platform with tiotropium bromide. Tiotropium bromide is the active ingredient in Spiriva, a blockbuster inhaled drug with annual global sales of approximately €3 billion in 2016. 
The limitation with current inhaled products is that a significant amount of the drugs get stuck in the mouth or throat, causing side effects and poor delivery efficiency to the intended site of action in the lungs. Pulmatrix has tackled this problem by creating a dry powder that 'flies' more easily into the lungs. Drugs like tiotropium bromide that are incorporated into the iSPERSE powder thus are far more likely to reach their intended target, offering a major medical benefit. 
In fact, clinical trials of PUR0200 have shown that the product is up to five times more efficient at delivering the drug to the lungs than are the currently marketed alternatives. 
Pulmatrix is now developing PUR0200 in both Europe and the United States, following regulatory pathways that offer quicker approvals and lower costs.
"This new patent is another step forward to bringing PUR0200 to market—and to be able to offer new benefits to patients suffering from COPD," added Dr. Clarke. 
About Pulmatrix        Pulmatrix is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company developing innovative inhaled therapies to address serious pulmonary disease using its patented iSPERSE™ technology. The Company's proprietary product pipeline is focused on advancing treatments for lung diseases, including  opportunities in major pulmonary diseases through collaborations, like PUR0200, a branded generic in clinical development for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and PUR1900, an inhaled antifungal that could benefit severe asthmatics and patients with rare diseases like cystic fibrosis.  Pulmatrix's product candidates are based on iSPERSE™, its proprietary dry powder delivery platform, which seeks to improve therapeutic delivery to the lungs by maximizing local concentrations and reducing systemic side effects to improve patient outcomes.
