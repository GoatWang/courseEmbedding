Get payroll services for the way you work.

Payroll isn’t just about a paycheck. Labor is likely your biggest cost, and it touches many parts of your business. Do it right with ADP.
Better payroll services mean:

Lower risk of compliance-related issues and penalties
Vast reductions in administrative time, effort, and money
Anytime, anywhere access for HR managers and employees
Increased efficiency across every areas of your business that intersects with payroll




“Not having to worry about payroll really allows us to focus on our core competencies and servicing our customers.”
Brandon McKennon 
Partner, BreezeIT



 



Boost productivity with time and attendance.




ADP’s automated tracking can save 40 minutes per week per manager.
Source: Nucleus Research, K60 Guidebook ADP, October 2010




Tracking time can be a hassle—but it doesn’t have to be. In fact, smart time and labor management lead to better decision-making for your business overall. 
We’ll help you:

Figure out if you have the right number of employees
Control costs through enhanced time and attendance tracking
Accommodate and multi-language workforce
Understand what Health Care Reform means for time and attendance tracking




 



Make HR a strategic part of your business.

By streamlining administrative HR processes, we’ll help you focus on empowering your people, and aligning individual performance to your business objectives.
You’ll get:

Simple HR processes and workflows
Strategies that you can implement today, and protect you for tomorrow
Ways to connect your workforce to your company goals






69% of businesses that migrated from an in-house solution to an outsourced model reported favorable results.
Source: 2011 BlessingWhite Employee Engagement Report, Hewitt Associates






 



Simplify benefits administration for yourself – and your staff.

Benefits should support your overall talent strategy, and simply must stay up-to-date with changing Affordable Care Act (ACA) regulations. 
We’ll help you:

Attract the best and the bright with world-class retirement and insurance plans
Achieve higher employee satisfaction through better benefits administration worldwide
Access more affordable benefits for your workforce
Provide an open enrollment experience that’s as easy as online shopping
Reduce the time, energy, and headcount associated with benefits administration
Take control of ACA regulations




“ADP has provided a lot of resources to us in understanding the Affordable Care Act. It’s the information we need in one source – it saves us time trying to research all those subjects we need to understand.”
David Laverentz 
VP Finance and Administration, Kansas City Royals



 



Build a company of superstars with talent management.

Good talent management means looking ahead, removing obstacles, and fostering excellence—no matter how big or small your business is.
Imagine being able to:

Recognize a new hire’s potential before they even start
Spot small holes in your organization’s talent before they become big ones
Chart a course for every employee that aligns with your company’s larger vision
Ensure that your best people grow – and stay – with you
Have a plan and a process for managing the entire talent lifecycle, including succession management






Lost productivity of actively disengaged employees costs the U.S. economy $370 billion annually.

LAKE SUCCESS, N.Y., May  15, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Newtek Business Services Corp. ("Newtek" or the "Company"), (Nasdaq:NEWT), an internally managed business development company ("BDC"), today announced that Newtek Small Business Finance, LLC, ("NSBF") the Company's nationally licensed SBA lender subsidiary, increased its existing revolving credit facility through Capital One, National Association ("Capital One")  by $50.0 million to $100.0 million.  Concurrent with the line increase, NSBF received a reduction in the interest rate from its present facility of 1.125% when NSBF utilizes the facility to fund the unguaranteed portion of SBA loans and 1.25% when NSBF utilizes the facility to fund the guaranteed portion of SBA loans.  The term of this loan has been extended three years, through May 2020.
Barry Sloane, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer said, "We are appreciative of our nine-year relationship with Capital One, who has provided us with financing through multiple credit cycles. We have worked with Capital One through seven separate Standard and Poor's rated securitizations, all of which were rated ‘A' or better, which have enabled us to replenish our capital availability.  Over time, we have proven that our credit quality and 14-year track record as an issuer, loan assembler and underwriter of small business credit can withstand differing interest rate and credit cycles and have allowed for the continued improvement in lending terms for our revolving credit facility. We have now further established ourselves with in-house pre-closing, post-closing, legal, underwriting and loan assembly teams that are dedicated to ensuring strong loan credit quality and embody the desire to continually improve the lending process and client experience."
Mr. Sloane continued, "We expect to launch our new mobile application for financial and business solution referrals within the next 30 days with the goal to further grow our total loan referral business.   While Newtek employs a FinTech strategy to acquire its clients, that strategy is supported by a dedicated, experienced in-house team who handles the entire credit underwriting process.  Newtek uses technology to enhance client experience and work flow without sacrificing credit quality or collateral provisions, which are necessary to mitigate loan losses."
Mr. Sloane concluded, "I would like to thank Peter Downs, Chief Lending Officer and President of Newtek Small Business Finance who, with the dedicated effort of his senior management team, has built a first-class true retail national lending platform for small- to medium-sized businesses.  I would also like to thank Capital One for this successful partnership that has withstood the test of time." 
John Walsh, Managing Director, Capital One said, "Newtek has been successfully executing its small business strategy for many years, and Capital One is pleased to be a partner in that success."

All kinds of businesses choose ADP.



Save valuable time
“Running payroll for a small business is a headache. For me to have switched over to ADP, it’s saved…hours and hours every week. It could come out to days a month!”
Chris Bredesen 
                Owner, The Rockefeller and Captain Kidds 



Pay employees promptly
“With [another payroll processor], our employees weren’t getting paid on the day that payroll was due. When we moved back to ADP, it was beyond easy. The transition was great. It was flawless.”
Brandon McKennon 
                Co-Founder/Partner, BreezeIT 



Accurate from the start
“As a small business, we operate in 5 or 6 different states…so there are a lot of requirements for filing taxes in each one. ADP does an excellent job of helping us maintain that.”
Kevin Jennings 
                President & CEO, Millennium Corp.

“ADP has provided a lot of resources to us in understanding the Affordable Care Act. It’s the information we need in one source – it saves us time trying to research all those subjects we need to understand.”
David Laverentz 
VP Finance and Administration, Kansas City Royals



 



Build a company of superstars with talent management.

Good talent management means looking ahead, removing obstacles, and fostering excellence—no matter how big or small your business is.
Imagine being able to:

Recognize a new hire’s potential before they even start
Spot small holes in your organization’s talent before they become big ones
Chart a course for every employee that aligns with your company’s larger vision
Ensure that your best people grow – and stay – with you
Have a plan and a process for managing the entire talent lifecycle, including succession management






Lost productivity of actively disengaged employees costs the U.S. economy $370 billion annually.

Save valuable time
“Running payroll for a small business is a headache. For me to have switched over to ADP, it’s saved…hours and hours every week. It could come out to days a month!”
Chris Bredesen 
                Owner, The Rockefeller and Captain Kidds 



Pay employees promptly
“With [another payroll processor], our employees weren’t getting paid on the day that payroll was due. When we moved back to ADP, it was beyond easy. The transition was great. It was flawless.”
Brandon McKennon 
                Co-Founder/Partner, BreezeIT 



Accurate from the start
“As a small business, we operate in 5 or 6 different states…so there are a lot of requirements for filing taxes in each one. ADP does an excellent job of helping us maintain that.”
Kevin Jennings 
                President & CEO, Millennium Corp.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.
                    





Mail Returned









                        BBB reports when mail sent to the business was returned by the Postal Service.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        LegalZoom.com has received 3.76 out of 5 stars based on 32 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Before approaching a lender, educate yourself on the types of loans available, the terms you can expect, and what documentation will be required to determine eligibility.Applying for a Small Business Loan: Common ReasonsWhether you’re just starting out or you have an established small business with a strong history, there are many reasons why you may wish to apply for a business loan. Loans provide money for:Funding startup costsPaying off bills from a recent launchPaying employees during slow seasonsCovering accounts payable when cash flow is slowStocking up on inventory in anticipation of a holiday rushLaunching new productsRunning seasonal marketing campaignsPurchasing new equipment to improve business performanceCovering emergency expensesPlanning for future improvements or expansionsIt’s important to have a clear understanding of how you’re going to use the money you obtain from a business loan. Banks aren’t interested in lending to companies with only vague notions of how the funding is going to be put to work. They want to ensure that their investment creates growth within a company, big or small, so that they can be assured of repayment.How Do Business Loans Work?Acquiring a business loan for a small business can be more difficult than obtaining funding for other purposes. Business loans represent a big risk to lenders because of the volatility of the consumer market. Although marketing analytics are making it easier to predict customer behavior, many unknown variables still affect small business cash flow and profits. This is another reason why banks want to know exactly what you plan to do with the loan should your application be approved.When applying for a loan, you’ll discuss terms, interest rates, and other details with the lender. It can be a long process requiring a lot of detailed financial information from both personal and company accounts, and you’ll likely need to speak with more than one lender to find the right fit for your small business. Remember, a loan is a binding agreement for a given period of time, and once you sign the documentation, you’re committed to paying the money back according to the agreed-upon terms. Make sure you know exactly what you’re getting into before the loan is finalized.Questions to Ask About Small Business Loans and Small Business GrantsBecause of the time and expense involved, consider whether you actually need a business loan and if it will benefit your small company before applying. If you determine that a loan may not be right for you, you may want to consider a small business grant. Grants for small businesses have a more difficult application process, and businesses need to meet certain requirements in order to qualify.  If you determine that a loan is necessary, prepare a list of questions to bring along when you compare loans from different lenders. Your list should help you narrow down your choices to banks and other lending institutions offering options closely aligned with your growing business needs. You may want to ask:If the lender has experience lending to your type of businessHow much the lender typically loans to businesses of similar sizeWho is in charge of application review and approvalWhat documentation is required to apply for a loanHow long a typical application-and-approval process lastsWhether interest rates are fixed or variableIf there’s a penalty for paying the balance off earlyIf you determine that a small business grant is the right track for you, it's important to research the requirements and see that you fit the lender's wants. Unlike small business loans, grants for small businesses are awarded without interest rates or repayment expectations. You can apply for small business grants from government entities or private organizations. It's important to keep in mind when doing due diligence that small business grant providers have different requirements. What Are the Types of Business Loans?Lenders offer a variety of loans for businesses depending on what the money is going to be used for and how companies are able to guarantee payment.Secured loans require collateral to back up the amount of the loan, meaning you could lose what you put up if you fail to pay in full.Unsecured loans are granted to companies with solid credit ratings and may offer lower interest rates than secured loans.Lines of credit work like a credit card, allowing you to borrow against a set amount as needed and only requiring interest payments on the money you use.Merchant cash advances are based on your volume of monthly credit card sales and are paid back using a percentage of each future sale.Accounts receivable loans use outstanding invoices as collateral to help pay off short-term debts.Equipment loans are granted specifically for the purchase of new equipment, using what you purchase as collateral.Construction loans provide funding to expand your existing location or build a new facility, and the building is considered collateral.Each loan type has a specific payment structure, term length, and interest rate. Some are more difficult to qualify for than others, and most require you to present detailed paperwork when applying.Small business owners may also apply for a government loan from the Small Business Administration (sba). An SBA loan includes microloans, real estate loans, disaster loans, loans to purchase equipment, and more. There are 2 types of SBA loans: 7(a) loans and SBA 504 loans. Both types of loans have different SBA requirements and SBA interest rates. It’s important to keep in mind that the loan rates vary depending on the loan size and type. Current SBA loan rates ranges from 6%-8%.How to Apply for a Business Loan for Your Small BusinessOnce you decide what type of loan you need, your lender will request certain documents and financial records to determine if your small business qualifies. These documents may include:A business plan showing your intentions for the loanTax returns for your businessThree to five years of company revenue figuresPersonal and business credit informationPersonal and business bank statementsCash flow history and future projectionsBusiness licenses and certificatesCurrent profit and loss statementsDetailed resumes of key executive staff membersFranchise, partnership, and other legal agreementsThe lender will review this information along with your application. However, before taking the time to gather such an extensive amount of paperwork, review the specifics of the loan one more time. Ask questions about anything you still don’t understand, and be ready to move on to another lender if something doesn’t sound right. If the cost of the loan is more than the benefit you’ll get from it, you’re better off seeking alternative options.A business loan can give your company the boost it needs to make it through a difficult time or fund growth to catapult you to future success. Talk to a variety of lenders before making your final decision to find the terms and conditions compatible with your financial situation. Structure your budget so that you stay on top of loan payments to ensure your business winds up stronger and more profitable once the balance is paid off.On this page, you’ll find a list of some of the highest-rated lenders in the industry. Check out their reviews, compare their features, and find the lender that’s best suited to meet the needs of your business.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
