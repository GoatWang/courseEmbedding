   	Coverage Options to Ease Your Worries



   	We believe insurance should ease your concerns, not cause them. After all, what good is insurance if you have to worry about using it? Having the confidence that you're covered today can help you stay ahead of the unexpected, whether that’s damage from a rogue shopping cart or something more serious, like emergency medical costs.    Every Liberty Mutual Auto Insurance policy begins with valuable protection against costs associated with injuries to others and damage to their property if you are legally responsible for a car accident. From there, we offer options to cover the cost of damage from collision and non-collision related incidents. When you create a customized quote you'll be able to choose the coverage types and amounts that make the most sense to you, including:








   	New Car Replacement


Additional Coverage


   	Get the money for a brand new car when your totaled car is under a year old and has fewer than 15,000 miles.1









   	Better Car Replacement™


Additional Coverage


   	Get the money for a car that's one model year newer with 15,000 fewer miles than your totaled car.1









   	Accident Forgiveness


Additional Coverage


   	When you're involved in your first accident, we won't raise your insurance rates.2









   	Deductible Fund™


Additional Feature


   	Lowers and eventually eliminates your collision deductible.3









   	Medical Payments


Standard Coverage


   	Pays the initial medical expenses of people injured in your car.









   	Rental Car Reimbursement


Additional Coverage


   	Pays for a rental while your car is being repaired at an approved repair facility.4













   	Many Ways to Save Money



   	Better coverage doesn't have to break your budget. That's why we offer many car insurance discounts, some of which are built right into your policy, while others are determined on an individual basis. When you quote online or over the phone, we'll make sure you get all the discounts you qualify for and the lowest price possible. You can save in the following ways:










   	Bundle and Save


   	Save when you bundle your auto and home policies together.5











   	Multi-Car Discount


   	Save when you add multiple vehicles to your policy.6











   	Vehicle Safety Features Discount


   	Save when your car has certain features designed to keep you safe.6











   	New Vehicle Discount


   	Save when you add or change a vehicle on your policy.

Recently relocated to the bay area and a friend of mine recommended Ravi.  Thank goodness because prior to that I was in complete shock at how expensive insurance can be in this part of the country.  Ravi was able to find me multiple discounts for home and auto  that I never thought about asking for, at the end of the day his quote was significantly less than everyone's.  He explained to me very patiently exactly what I needed and didn't need . It was a no-brainer to go with him especially knowing that I was getting top-notch liberty mutual insurance.  Thanks Ravi!!!







I recently moved to California. I was looking to buy a car and a home. My friend suggested me to contact Ravi to get quote for both car and home. I met him to discuss about different insurance plans and coverages. 

He was patient enough to give me detail description of various coverages. Eventually I ended up taking the best coverage according to my budget and that too at very less price compared to other insurance companies. He also helped me switched the insurance of my old car to liberty mutual very easily.

I will definitely recommend Ravi to anyone who wants best coverages at affordable pricing.







I appreciate the timely response and guidance offered by Ravi while purchasing the insurance for a car. He even offered me a discount based on my affiliation with a university. He was very patient and helpful when I needed some changes in the insurance as well. I would highly recommend Ravi for your auto insurance requirements.







I recently moved to US and Ravi helped a lot in getting the right car and home insurance. He provided very good rates even though I did not had any driving record in US. I would recommend everyone to contact him for any insurance requirement. I am sure he will beat any quote!







Ravi was awesome, He helped us reduce our Insurance bills by over 30%/year and actually increased our coverage so that we are adequately insured. I will recommend him to everyone.







I  just moved to California from Florida. Ravi  was very helpful. He took the time to explain good coverage's and he gave me good coverage for the best price.He is very friendly and patience to explain every thing about coverage's.I really recommend ravi as some one who takes the efforts.







Ravi is a trusted insurance adviser. He'd go extra mile to find the right product(s) for you and save you money. While other agents would try to over insure you, Ravi would try to find the best possible coverage. In my case he ended up saving me over $500 annually on Home/Auto/Life yet keeping the same level of coverage. I'd high recommend Ravi to anyone shopping for insurance or looking for a trusted adviser.







I switched to Liberty Mutual for all my insurance needs (Primary residence, Auto, Umbrella and two rentals) and the process was seamless. Ravi was very patience in explaining different options and letting me pick the one which suites my needs. I would highly recommend Liberty Mutual and especially Ravi for your insurance needs.

Ravi is a trusted insurance adviser. He'd go extra mile to find the right product(s) for you and save you money. While other agents would try to over insure you, Ravi would try to find the best possible coverage. In my case he ended up saving me over $500 annually on Home/Auto/Life yet keeping the same level of coverage. I'd high recommend Ravi to anyone shopping for insurance or looking for a trusted adviser.

I switched to Liberty Mutual for all my insurance needs (Primary residence, Auto, Umbrella and two rentals) and the process was seamless. Ravi was very patience in explaining different options and letting me pick the one which suites my needs. I would highly recommend Liberty Mutual and especially Ravi for your insurance needs.

Welcome

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Liberty Mutual was founded in 1912 as the Massachusetts Employees Insurance Association (MEIA), following passage of a Massachusetts state law requiring employers to protect their employees with workers’ compensation insurance in 1911.[11] The first branch office was opened in 1914, and later that year, the company wrote its first automobile insurance policy. The company was founded as a Massachusetts Mutual Company, where its insureds have ownership in the company. The name was changed in 1917 to the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company and, through partnerships, the company began offering full-coverage auto policies.
Structural changes[edit]
In 1964, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company began offering life insurance through its Liberty Life Assurance Branch. In 2002, the company converted into its current mutual holding company structure. The conversion was controversial, as it proposed to give policyholders an interest in the mutual insurance company, which some policyholders believed would dilute their interest in the overall company and limit their dividends.[12] A lawsuit was filed, alleging that information provided to policyholders was misleading. Liberty Mutual settled the lawsuit in December 2001, which required additional disclosure and limited certain compensation to company officers and directors.[13] Despite these concerns, the plan was approved by voting policyholders around November 2001.[14] Leveraging the greater flexibility of the mutual company structure, Liberty Mutual transformed from a single-line, highly regional insurer to one of the world's leading property and casualty insurance companies.
Growth and acquisitions[edit]
Liberty Mutual's growth has been both organic and through acquisition. Early acquisitions were small, but Liberty Mutual has made several large acquisitions over the past decade, including the high-profile acquisition of Safeco Corporation in 2008. Liberty Mutual agreed to acquire all outstanding shares of Safeco for $68.25 per share, for a total transaction price of approximately $6.2 billion. The result of this activity was an increase in revenue from $6 billion to over $30 billion in twelve years. In 1999, the company purchased Wausau Insurance Cos.[15]
Liberty Mutual created a television commercial in 2006 about people doing good things for strangers, reporting that the "overwhelming" positive response they received for the ad led to their decision to create the website The Responsibility Project.[16]
Liberty Mutual is also the sole corporate sponsor of the long-running PBS documentary series, American Experience, and has produced special commercial messages for airing during American Experience broadcasts. In 2011, as part of the company's "Real America" campaign, the company introduced two new commercials featuring Sacagawea and Paul Revere.
In 2011, the company began construction of the Liberty Mutual Tower, a 22-story skyscraper as part of its World Headquarters Expansion Project.[17] The building received its certificate of occupancy in June 2013.[18]
Organizational structure[edit]
Strategic business units[edit]
Liberty Mutual conducts all of its business through four strategic business units: US Consumer Markets, Commercial Insurance, Global Consumer Markets, and Global Specialty.[19]

US Consumer Markets[edit]
Passenger automobile, homeowners, life, annuity, and other property and casualty insurance products are available via Liberty Mutual's US Consumer Markets line. These products are branded under the Liberty Mutual Insurance and Safeco names, and are distributed via a vast network of over 2,300 sales professionals. Other distribution means are call centers, third-party producers, and the company's own website. Over 10,000 insurance agencies across the United States carry Safeco-branded products.[20]
Commercial insurance[edit]
Property and casualty, as well as group benefits commercial insurance products fall into two distinct categories: Business Insurance and National Insurance. The former caters to businesses with fewer than 1,000 employees, while the latter serves businesses in certain industries or which have greater than 1,000 employees. Group benefits products include disability insurance and group life insurance.[20]
Global Consumer Markets[edit]
Localized insurance companies sell Liberty International's products in 18 different countries and markets. International products are offered to both individual and business customers, and include property and casualty insurance, as well as health and life insurance products. The largest international product offering is passenger automobile insurance for private individuals.[20]
Global Specialty[edit]
The Global Specialty insurance line offers specialty products, such as marine, energy, aviation, professional liability, and crisis management, offered through 40 Liberty International Underwriters offices worldwide. In addition, Liberty International Underwriters provides global multi-line insurance and reinsurance written on its Lloyd's Syndicate 4472 platform. Global Specialty also includes reinsurance products offered through Liberty Mutual Reinsurance.[20]

Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety[edit]
Founded in 1954, the Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety has studied the occupational safety and health of workers. Its scientific contributions include machine safeguarding guidelines, the Cornell-Liberty Survival Car, and ergonomic guidelines that have informed the basis for national and international safety standards. More recently, the Institute developed the Workplace Safety Index, which is an annual ranking of the leading causes of the most disabling occupational injuries in the United States.
The Institute's scientists conduct field and laboratory experiments to study the major causes of work-related injury and disability, publishing their results in peer-reviewed scientific literature. Institute findings are the basis for safety programs, recommendations, and software used by Liberty Mutual loss control consultants in order to help policyholders enhance worker safety. The Institute’s work is non-proprietary, and is available to the public.[21][22][23][24][25][26][27]
Controversy[edit]

In 2012 and 2013, a series of investigative articles were published in Liberty Mutual's hometown newspaper: The Boston Globe. These reports were written by Brian McGrory who later became the editor of The Boston Globe. It reported issues related to excessive compensation and questionable weekend trips using the fleet of five long-range corporate jets by its executives.[28] In the investigative reporting series, as a columnist, a number of questions related to the company were discovered; among them- (all cited):
In 2006, Liberty Mutual claims employees in the Los Angeles area desired overtime pay for work and labor accomplished related to claims work. The situation escalated, and Liberty Mutual accepted a legal question which was originally in the form of four class action lawsuits filed by its own claims representatives and employees. Some questions started in 2006 in North Carolina.[29]
Questions of this particular suit, from Liberty Mutual employees, resulted from the company's desired service to a claim, versus claim outcomes. Liberty Mutual worked on specific metrics. This case provided the company with legal precedent to claims handling and ability to process claims based on values from third party information outside of claims that repair or replace property without having to view the physical property insured. As such, Liberty Mutual closed all its locations in Los Angeles, the nation's second largest insurance market, following this action at the behest of its employees.
In late 2012, the company won an appeal granting it the ability not to pay employees for work performed on an overtime basis. Pursuit was considered an award for the insurance industry as a whole.[30] In this specific case, Liberty Mutual failed to appear. Instead, they relied on an Amicus Brief filed on behalf of the US Department of Labor.[31] The Court decided, based on the Amicus Brief, that claims personnel are exempt "Administrative Employees" and not subject to overtime pay, further supporting the mutual company's goals. In late 2012, the California Supreme Court also redacted court documents.[32]
"The benefits of political friendship" provides a newspaper published report on Liberty Mutual's political ties, including ties to Deval Patrick, the then Governor of Massachusetts. This friendship is alleged to have resulted in Liberty Mutual's receipt of tax breaks in the amount of $41M.[33]
"Perspectives Can Change at Liberty Mutual" provides a newspaper published look at Liberty Mutual's claims process; where Liberty Mutual sued its own insured for filing a claim; and forced an award against Liberty Mutual. The article also disclosed that Liberty Mutual's legal team that represented the case usually paid less than half of the judgements.[34]
"Liberty Mutual: Your premiums, his premium office" provides a newspaper published account of CEO David H Long's desire to redecorate his 1,000sq foot office at a price of $4.5M. The article also discusses the need of the insurance company to have four corporate jets.[35]
"An Untimely Award" provides a newspaper published report of corporate governance at Liberty Mutual.[36]
"View from the top at Liberty Mutual" provides a newspaper published report from Boston Globe editor, Brian McGrory who was invited to the recently renovated CEO suite at Liberty Mutual.[37]
"Lots more to Liberty Mutual pay story" provides a newspaper published report of a comparative analysis of other executives' pay in Boston.[38]
"At Liberty Mutual, Accounting To No One For Executive Privileges" provides a newspaper published report and review of itineraries of the fleet of corporate jets, and executive compensation which includes "Make believe stock options". By virtue of a Mutual-Company setup, its customers own stock in the company.[39]

Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety[edit]
Founded in 1954, the Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety has studied the occupational safety and health of workers. Its scientific contributions include machine safeguarding guidelines, the Cornell-Liberty Survival Car, and ergonomic guidelines that have informed the basis for national and international safety standards. More recently, the Institute developed the Workplace Safety Index, which is an annual ranking of the leading causes of the most disabling occupational injuries in the United States.
The Institute's scientists conduct field and laboratory experiments to study the major causes of work-related injury and disability, publishing their results in peer-reviewed scientific literature. Institute findings are the basis for safety programs, recommendations, and software used by Liberty Mutual loss control consultants in order to help policyholders enhance worker safety. The Institute’s work is non-proprietary, and is available to the public.[21][22][23][24][25][26][27]
Controversy[edit]

In 2012 and 2013, a series of investigative articles were published in Liberty Mutual's hometown newspaper: The Boston Globe. These reports were written by Brian McGrory who later became the editor of The Boston Globe. It reported issues related to excessive compensation and questionable weekend trips using the fleet of five long-range corporate jets by its executives.[28] In the investigative reporting series, as a columnist, a number of questions related to the company were discovered; among them- (all cited):
In 2006, Liberty Mutual claims employees in the Los Angeles area desired overtime pay for work and labor accomplished related to claims work. The situation escalated, and Liberty Mutual accepted a legal question which was originally in the form of four class action lawsuits filed by its own claims representatives and employees. Some questions started in 2006 in North Carolina.[29]
Questions of this particular suit, from Liberty Mutual employees, resulted from the company's desired service to a claim, versus claim outcomes. Liberty Mutual worked on specific metrics. This case provided the company with legal precedent to claims handling and ability to process claims based on values from third party information outside of claims that repair or replace property without having to view the physical property insured. As such, Liberty Mutual closed all its locations in Los Angeles, the nation's second largest insurance market, following this action at the behest of its employees.
In late 2012, the company won an appeal granting it the ability not to pay employees for work performed on an overtime basis. Pursuit was considered an award for the insurance industry as a whole.[30] In this specific case, Liberty Mutual failed to appear. Instead, they relied on an Amicus Brief filed on behalf of the US Department of Labor.[31] The Court decided, based on the Amicus Brief, that claims personnel are exempt "Administrative Employees" and not subject to overtime pay, further supporting the mutual company's goals. In late 2012, the California Supreme Court also redacted court documents.[32]
"The benefits of political friendship" provides a newspaper published report on Liberty Mutual's political ties, including ties to Deval Patrick, the then Governor of Massachusetts. This friendship is alleged to have resulted in Liberty Mutual's receipt of tax breaks in the amount of $41M.[33]
"Perspectives Can Change at Liberty Mutual" provides a newspaper published look at Liberty Mutual's claims process; where Liberty Mutual sued its own insured for filing a claim; and forced an award against Liberty Mutual. The article also disclosed that Liberty Mutual's legal team that represented the case usually paid less than half of the judgements.[34]
"Liberty Mutual: Your premiums, his premium office" provides a newspaper published account of CEO David H Long's desire to redecorate his 1,000sq foot office at a price of $4.5M. The article also discusses the need of the insurance company to have four corporate jets.[35]
"An Untimely Award" provides a newspaper published report of corporate governance at Liberty Mutual.[36]
"View from the top at Liberty Mutual" provides a newspaper published report from Boston Globe editor, Brian McGrory who was invited to the recently renovated CEO suite at Liberty Mutual.[37]
"Lots more to Liberty Mutual pay story" provides a newspaper published report of a comparative analysis of other executives' pay in Boston.[38]
"At Liberty Mutual, Accounting To No One For Executive Privileges" provides a newspaper published report and review of itineraries of the fleet of corporate jets, and executive compensation which includes "Make believe stock options". By virtue of a Mutual-Company setup, its customers own stock in the company.[39]

As of December 31, 2015, Liberty Mutual Insurance had $121.7 billion in consolidated assets, $102.5 billion in consolidated liabilities, and $37.6 billion in annual consolidated revenue.[1][4] The company, founded in 1912, offers a wide range of insurance products and services, including personal automobile, homeowners, workers' compensation, commercial multiple peril, commercial automobile, general liability, global specialty, group disability, fire and surety.[5][6]

In the United States, Liberty Mutual remains a mutual company where policyholders holding contracts for insurance are considered shareholders in the company. However, Liberty Mutual Group's brand usually operates as a separate entity outside the United States. In other countries, subsidiaries are often created in countries where legally recognized mutual company benefits cannot be enjoyed.
The current CEO is David H. Long. He succeeded his predecessor Edmund (Ted) F. Kelly on June 29, 2011.[7][8] Ted Kelly was appointed CEO in 1998.[9] In April 2013, Ted Kelly stepped down from the board of directors, as chairman.[10]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Liberty Mutual was founded in 1912 as the Massachusetts Employees Insurance Association (MEIA), following passage of a Massachusetts state law requiring employers to protect their employees with workers’ compensation insurance in 1911.[11] The first branch office was opened in 1914, and later that year, the company wrote its first automobile insurance policy. The company was founded as a Massachusetts Mutual Company, where its insureds have ownership in the company. The name was changed in 1917 to the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company and, through partnerships, the company began offering full-coverage auto policies.
Structural changes[edit]
In 1964, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company began offering life insurance through its Liberty Life Assurance Branch. In 2002, the company converted into its current mutual holding company structure. The conversion was controversial, as it proposed to give policyholders an interest in the mutual insurance company, which some policyholders believed would dilute their interest in the overall company and limit their dividends.[12] A lawsuit was filed, alleging that information provided to policyholders was misleading. Liberty Mutual settled the lawsuit in December 2001, which required additional disclosure and limited certain compensation to company officers and directors.[13] Despite these concerns, the plan was approved by voting policyholders around November 2001.[14] Leveraging the greater flexibility of the mutual company structure, Liberty Mutual transformed from a single-line, highly regional insurer to one of the world's leading property and casualty insurance companies.
Growth and acquisitions[edit]
Liberty Mutual's growth has been both organic and through acquisition. Early acquisitions were small, but Liberty Mutual has made several large acquisitions over the past decade, including the high-profile acquisition of Safeco Corporation in 2008. Liberty Mutual agreed to acquire all outstanding shares of Safeco for $68.25 per share, for a total transaction price of approximately $6.2 billion. The result of this activity was an increase in revenue from $6 billion to over $30 billion in twelve years. In 1999, the company purchased Wausau Insurance Cos.[15]
Liberty Mutual created a television commercial in 2006 about people doing good things for strangers, reporting that the "overwhelming" positive response they received for the ad led to their decision to create the website The Responsibility Project.[16]
Liberty Mutual is also the sole corporate sponsor of the long-running PBS documentary series, American Experience, and has produced special commercial messages for airing during American Experience broadcasts. In 2011, as part of the company's "Real America" campaign, the company introduced two new commercials featuring Sacagawea and Paul Revere.
In 2011, the company began construction of the Liberty Mutual Tower, a 22-story skyscraper as part of its World Headquarters Expansion Project.[17] The building received its certificate of occupancy in June 2013.[18]
Organizational structure[edit]
Strategic business units[edit]
Liberty Mutual conducts all of its business through four strategic business units: US Consumer Markets, Commercial Insurance, Global Consumer Markets, and Global Specialty.[19]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Liberty Mutual was founded in 1912 as the Massachusetts Employees Insurance Association (MEIA), following passage of a Massachusetts state law requiring employers to protect their employees with workers’ compensation insurance in 1911.[11] The first branch office was opened in 1914, and later that year, the company wrote its first automobile insurance policy. The company was founded as a Massachusetts Mutual Company, where its insureds have ownership in the company. The name was changed in 1917 to the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company and, through partnerships, the company began offering full-coverage auto policies.
Structural changes[edit]
In 1964, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company began offering life insurance through its Liberty Life Assurance Branch. In 2002, the company converted into its current mutual holding company structure. The conversion was controversial, as it proposed to give policyholders an interest in the mutual insurance company, which some policyholders believed would dilute their interest in the overall company and limit their dividends.[12] A lawsuit was filed, alleging that information provided to policyholders was misleading. Liberty Mutual settled the lawsuit in December 2001, which required additional disclosure and limited certain compensation to company officers and directors.[13] Despite these concerns, the plan was approved by voting policyholders around November 2001.[14] Leveraging the greater flexibility of the mutual company structure, Liberty Mutual transformed from a single-line, highly regional insurer to one of the world's leading property and casualty insurance companies.
Growth and acquisitions[edit]
Liberty Mutual's growth has been both organic and through acquisition. Early acquisitions were small, but Liberty Mutual has made several large acquisitions over the past decade, including the high-profile acquisition of Safeco Corporation in 2008. Liberty Mutual agreed to acquire all outstanding shares of Safeco for $68.25 per share, for a total transaction price of approximately $6.2 billion. The result of this activity was an increase in revenue from $6 billion to over $30 billion in twelve years. In 1999, the company purchased Wausau Insurance Cos.[15]
Liberty Mutual created a television commercial in 2006 about people doing good things for strangers, reporting that the "overwhelming" positive response they received for the ad led to their decision to create the website The Responsibility Project.[16]
Liberty Mutual is also the sole corporate sponsor of the long-running PBS documentary series, American Experience, and has produced special commercial messages for airing during American Experience broadcasts. In 2011, as part of the company's "Real America" campaign, the company introduced two new commercials featuring Sacagawea and Paul Revere.
In 2011, the company began construction of the Liberty Mutual Tower, a 22-story skyscraper as part of its World Headquarters Expansion Project.[17] The building received its certificate of occupancy in June 2013.[18]
Organizational structure[edit]
Strategic business units[edit]
Liberty Mutual conducts all of its business through four strategic business units: US Consumer Markets, Commercial Insurance, Global Consumer Markets, and Global Specialty.[19]

US Consumer Markets[edit]
Passenger automobile, homeowners, life, annuity, and other property and casualty insurance products are available via Liberty Mutual's US Consumer Markets line. These products are branded under the Liberty Mutual Insurance and Safeco names, and are distributed via a vast network of over 2,300 sales professionals. Other distribution means are call centers, third-party producers, and the company's own website. Over 10,000 insurance agencies across the United States carry Safeco-branded products.[20]
Commercial insurance[edit]
Property and casualty, as well as group benefits commercial insurance products fall into two distinct categories: Business Insurance and National Insurance. The former caters to businesses with fewer than 1,000 employees, while the latter serves businesses in certain industries or which have greater than 1,000 employees. Group benefits products include disability insurance and group life insurance.[20]
Global Consumer Markets[edit]
Localized insurance companies sell Liberty International's products in 18 different countries and markets. International products are offered to both individual and business customers, and include property and casualty insurance, as well as health and life insurance products. The largest international product offering is passenger automobile insurance for private individuals.[20]
Global Specialty[edit]
The Global Specialty insurance line offers specialty products, such as marine, energy, aviation, professional liability, and crisis management, offered through 40 Liberty International Underwriters offices worldwide. In addition, Liberty International Underwriters provides global multi-line insurance and reinsurance written on its Lloyd's Syndicate 4472 platform. Global Specialty also includes reinsurance products offered through Liberty Mutual Reinsurance.[20]

Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety[edit]
Founded in 1954, the Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety has studied the occupational safety and health of workers. Its scientific contributions include machine safeguarding guidelines, the Cornell-Liberty Survival Car, and ergonomic guidelines that have informed the basis for national and international safety standards. More recently, the Institute developed the Workplace Safety Index, which is an annual ranking of the leading causes of the most disabling occupational injuries in the United States.
The Institute's scientists conduct field and laboratory experiments to study the major causes of work-related injury and disability, publishing their results in peer-reviewed scientific literature. Institute findings are the basis for safety programs, recommendations, and software used by Liberty Mutual loss control consultants in order to help policyholders enhance worker safety. The Institute’s work is non-proprietary, and is available to the public.[21][22][23][24][25][26][27]
Controversy[edit]

In 2012 and 2013, a series of investigative articles were published in Liberty Mutual's hometown newspaper: The Boston Globe. These reports were written by Brian McGrory who later became the editor of The Boston Globe. It reported issues related to excessive compensation and questionable weekend trips using the fleet of five long-range corporate jets by its executives.[28] In the investigative reporting series, as a columnist, a number of questions related to the company were discovered; among them- (all cited):
In 2006, Liberty Mutual claims employees in the Los Angeles area desired overtime pay for work and labor accomplished related to claims work. The situation escalated, and Liberty Mutual accepted a legal question which was originally in the form of four class action lawsuits filed by its own claims representatives and employees. Some questions started in 2006 in North Carolina.[29]
Questions of this particular suit, from Liberty Mutual employees, resulted from the company's desired service to a claim, versus claim outcomes. Liberty Mutual worked on specific metrics. This case provided the company with legal precedent to claims handling and ability to process claims based on values from third party information outside of claims that repair or replace property without having to view the physical property insured. As such, Liberty Mutual closed all its locations in Los Angeles, the nation's second largest insurance market, following this action at the behest of its employees.
In late 2012, the company won an appeal granting it the ability not to pay employees for work performed on an overtime basis. Pursuit was considered an award for the insurance industry as a whole.[30] In this specific case, Liberty Mutual failed to appear. Instead, they relied on an Amicus Brief filed on behalf of the US Department of Labor.[31] The Court decided, based on the Amicus Brief, that claims personnel are exempt "Administrative Employees" and not subject to overtime pay, further supporting the mutual company's goals. In late 2012, the California Supreme Court also redacted court documents.[32]
"The benefits of political friendship" provides a newspaper published report on Liberty Mutual's political ties, including ties to Deval Patrick, the then Governor of Massachusetts. This friendship is alleged to have resulted in Liberty Mutual's receipt of tax breaks in the amount of $41M.[33]
"Perspectives Can Change at Liberty Mutual" provides a newspaper published look at Liberty Mutual's claims process; where Liberty Mutual sued its own insured for filing a claim; and forced an award against Liberty Mutual. The article also disclosed that Liberty Mutual's legal team that represented the case usually paid less than half of the judgements.[34]
"Liberty Mutual: Your premiums, his premium office" provides a newspaper published account of CEO David H Long's desire to redecorate his 1,000sq foot office at a price of $4.5M. The article also discusses the need of the insurance company to have four corporate jets.[35]
"An Untimely Award" provides a newspaper published report of corporate governance at Liberty Mutual.[36]
"View from the top at Liberty Mutual" provides a newspaper published report from Boston Globe editor, Brian McGrory who was invited to the recently renovated CEO suite at Liberty Mutual.[37]
"Lots more to Liberty Mutual pay story" provides a newspaper published report of a comparative analysis of other executives' pay in Boston.[38]
"At Liberty Mutual, Accounting To No One For Executive Privileges" provides a newspaper published report and review of itineraries of the fleet of corporate jets, and executive compensation which includes "Make believe stock options". By virtue of a Mutual-Company setup, its customers own stock in the company.[39]

In 2012 and 2013, a series of investigative articles were published in Liberty Mutual's hometown newspaper: The Boston Globe. These reports were written by Brian McGrory who later became the editor of The Boston Globe. It reported issues related to excessive compensation and questionable weekend trips using the fleet of five long-range corporate jets by its executives.[28] In the investigative reporting series, as a columnist, a number of questions related to the company were discovered; among them- (all cited):
In 2006, Liberty Mutual claims employees in the Los Angeles area desired overtime pay for work and labor accomplished related to claims work. The situation escalated, and Liberty Mutual accepted a legal question which was originally in the form of four class action lawsuits filed by its own claims representatives and employees. Some questions started in 2006 in North Carolina.[29]
Questions of this particular suit, from Liberty Mutual employees, resulted from the company's desired service to a claim, versus claim outcomes. Liberty Mutual worked on specific metrics. This case provided the company with legal precedent to claims handling and ability to process claims based on values from third party information outside of claims that repair or replace property without having to view the physical property insured. As such, Liberty Mutual closed all its locations in Los Angeles, the nation's second largest insurance market, following this action at the behest of its employees.
In late 2012, the company won an appeal granting it the ability not to pay employees for work performed on an overtime basis. Pursuit was considered an award for the insurance industry as a whole.[30] In this specific case, Liberty Mutual failed to appear. Instead, they relied on an Amicus Brief filed on behalf of the US Department of Labor.[31] The Court decided, based on the Amicus Brief, that claims personnel are exempt "Administrative Employees" and not subject to overtime pay, further supporting the mutual company's goals. In late 2012, the California Supreme Court also redacted court documents.[32]
"The benefits of political friendship" provides a newspaper published report on Liberty Mutual's political ties, including ties to Deval Patrick, the then Governor of Massachusetts. This friendship is alleged to have resulted in Liberty Mutual's receipt of tax breaks in the amount of $41M.[33]
"Perspectives Can Change at Liberty Mutual" provides a newspaper published look at Liberty Mutual's claims process; where Liberty Mutual sued its own insured for filing a claim; and forced an award against Liberty Mutual. The article also disclosed that Liberty Mutual's legal team that represented the case usually paid less than half of the judgements.[34]
"Liberty Mutual: Your premiums, his premium office" provides a newspaper published account of CEO David H Long's desire to redecorate his 1,000sq foot office at a price of $4.5M. The article also discusses the need of the insurance company to have four corporate jets.[35]
"An Untimely Award" provides a newspaper published report of corporate governance at Liberty Mutual.[36]
"View from the top at Liberty Mutual" provides a newspaper published report from Boston Globe editor, Brian McGrory who was invited to the recently renovated CEO suite at Liberty Mutual.[37]
"Lots more to Liberty Mutual pay story" provides a newspaper published report of a comparative analysis of other executives' pay in Boston.[38]
"At Liberty Mutual, Accounting To No One For Executive Privileges" provides a newspaper published report and review of itineraries of the fleet of corporate jets, and executive compensation which includes "Make believe stock options". By virtue of a Mutual-Company setup, its customers own stock in the company.[39]

How do I report a claim?


Claims must be reported as soon as reasonably possible.  Please contact us by mail, email, or fax.  
Medmarc Insurance GroupAttn: Claims Reporting14280 Park Meadow Drive, Suite 300Chantilly, Virginia 20151
Email:  ClaimsReporting@Medmarc.com
Fax: (703) 652-1389
If you have questions about whether to report a claim, please refer to your policy, which includes requirements for reporting occurrences, claims, and lawsuits.  Medmarc's claims staff are also available to answer your questions and provide reporting advice.
Please contact our Claims Department at (800) 356-6886.


How do I access my loss information?


You can request a loss run via our Loss Run Request page. Please select “Loss Run Request” in the subject line and submit dates and name of insured in the additional information box.  You must be the Insured or the current Broker of Record to make this request.  You will receive your loss run report within one business day of request. 
Online loss run access is temporarily disabled until we go live with a new online portal later this year. 


How does Medmarc help me select the best defense attorney for my claim?


We have built a network of top-tier attorneys to defend your cases.  All of our attorneys are selected for their expertise in defending medical device and pharmaceutical companies in products liability litigation.  We leverage our buying power in order to secure you with reasonable hourly rates, and our attorneys are required to communicate with you regularly on the status of your claim.
Many of our network counsel have written and lectured on various aspects of product liability.  Some have medical or nursing degrees.  Many also have medical malpractice defense expertise.They are skilled trial attorneys, but they also have negotiating and case resolution skills that can achieve rational business outcomes at mediation and settlement conferences. 


How do I submit changes to our contact information?


Please select subject "Contact Underwriting" in the Request More Information Form on this page. 
Please provide information for your “primary contact,” including your contact’s first and last name, title, address, phone number, fax number, and email address.  If applicable, please also provide this information for any additional contacts for SIR billing, claims, risk management, and loss runs.


How does Medmarc handle a claim or lawsuit outside of the United States?


We have approved network counsel in many foreign countries.  In addition, when servicing foreign claims, we rely on a number of international resources for loss investigation and litigation control.  These include: 

GAB Robins Worldwide
Baker & McKenzie Worldwide Legal Network
Lex Mundi Directory of Foreign Counsel
American Law Firm Association (ALFA)
International Legal Network



What types of coverages does Medmarc provide?




Medmarc offers Products/Completed Operations Liability (“Products Liability”) and Manufacturers’ Errors and Omissions Liability (“E&O”) for medical technology and life sciences companies.
For more information on each coverage type, go to our Insurance Solutions


What kind of product recall coverage is available through Medmarc?


Coverage for FDA recalls may be found in two types of Medmarc coverage offerings. 

Products Liability — Medmarc offers product-withdrawal-expense coverage as an endorsement to our products liability policy.  This endorsement, subject to terms and exclusions, covers expenses incurred by the insured to remove its product from the marketplace due to a Class I product recall, including expenses associated with communicating the recall to the public. 
Manufacturers’ Errors & Omissions (E&O) — Medmarc offers recall coverage for third-party financial loss that results from the insured’s error or omission, such as when the insured’s customer incurs expenses for undertaking a recall that arises as a result of the insured’s negligence in manufacturing or servicing of a product.

Please talk to your Medmarc underwriter if your client has a need for this coverage or would like to learn more. 


What happens when I report a claim?


We typically assign the claim to a claim examiner upon receiving it.  The claim examiner will review and analyze the claim for coverage, liability, and damages issues and contact you normally within 24 hours.  
In litigated cases, we assist you in the selection of defense counsel, with whom we work closely until your matter is resolved.  Your input is crucial to a successful defense strategy, and your claim examiner will update you throughout the life of your claim—but no less frequently than on a quarterly basis—about the progress of bringing your claim to resolution.


Do Medmarc claim examiners specialize in life sciences?


Yes.  Medmarc has a team of experienced claim examiners dedicated to the life sciences industry, who handle only life sciences claims.  Each examiner has a minimum of ten years’ experience and hold a variety of degrees and designations including law degrees, actuarial degrees, and Associate in Claims (AIC) designations.  To remain on the cutting edge of developments in the law and the life sciences, Medmarc’s claim examiners participate regularly in industry educational programs. Medmarc is a proud corporate member of DRI, ALFA, and USLAW organizations.


I am not an insured, but may I still receive risk management assistance from Medmarc?




Our risk management services are intended for use by our insureds.  On a limited basis, however, we will provide products liability risk management services on a fee-for-service basis. 
For more information, please contact our Risk Management Department at RiskManagement@Medmarc.com or at 703-652-1362.


Is the fact that a product is approved by the FDA sufficient enough information about the product to obtain a quote from Medmarc?




FDA approval of a product is important to the underwriting analysis, as is the regulatory history of the company, but it is not sufficient information for Medmarc’s underwriters to provide a coverage quote. In order to understand the company’s risk profile and coverage needs, underwriters also will require information about the company’s size, financial condition, management team, operations, loss history, and other information related to the company’s history and product lines.


What is Medmarc’s capacity?




For Medmarc’s products liability policy, our capacity is $10 million per policy.  For our manufacturers’ errors and omissions (E&O) policy, our capacity is $5 million.  
Capacity is subject to underwriting and is not available for all applicants. 


What is Medmarc's target risk?




Medmarc provides coverage for the manufacturers and distributors of medical devices, pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, in vitro diagnostics, personal hygiene products, and animal care products.  We cover both original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and contract manufacturers.  We cover companies at every stage of their evolution—from clinical trial-stage startups to multi-national companies with extensive product lines.


What risk management services does Medmarc provide?




Through our Risk Management Department, Medmarc helps medical technology and life sciences companies manage their products liability risks.  We can identify your potential products liability exposures through our risk assessment process and then help you develop and implement strategies to mitigate your risk.  
We provide assistance with areas of your operations that tend to give rise to products liability, such as supply chains, product warnings and instructions for use, and manufacturing procedures.  There is a close association between regulatory compliance and products liability.  For this reason, we offer a variety of services designed to help companies comply with FDA requirements. 
We also provide employee training that is designed to heighten awareness about products liability risk and the impact that it can have on your operations and bottom line.


Will Medmarc accept other carriers’ applications?




Yes.  Medmarc is happy to accept applications from other carriers, but please be aware that we may require additional information.


As a distributor, do I need products liability coverage?




We recommend that distributors purchase their own products liability insurance policies.  If a distributor is required to repackage or install a product, or if the distributor provides training on the use of the product, the distributor may have a potential exposure that is not typically covered under the manufacturer’s policy.  Furthermore, independent acts of negligence on the part of the distributor typically would not be covered under the manufacturer’s policy or by contractual indemnification agreements. A U.S. distributor that imports products from a manufacturer located outside of the United States should be aware that the foreign manufacturer’s policy may not provide coverage in the U.S. or may not provide coverage for the defense of claims in the U.S., which could become very costly.  Medmarc’s Risk Management Department has published an article that explains distributor risks. The article is titled, “Why Distributors May Be More  Vulnerable to Products Liability than They Realize,” and it is available on Medmarc’s website in our Resource Library.


Does your policy cover sales representatives (“sales reps”)?




The actions or omissions of sales reps when acting in the scope of their employment are covered under Medmarc’s products liability insurance coverage. Such circumstances include when sales reps: (1) provide product consultations; (2) make device technical adjustments; (3) are present in operating rooms during surgeries to answer questions deemed essential for patient care; or (4) are present during patient monitoring visits to ensure compliance with clinical trial protocols by surgical staff and nurses.
For more information, see the Ask an Expert by Fran Stockwell, “Do distributors require professional liability insurance coverage in addition to products liability insurance coverage?”
 


Does your policy cover explants of implantable devices?




Our products liability policy covers explantations (i.e., the surgical removal of implantable devices) only when the product causes the patient harm.


What is the difference between a claims-made policy and an occurrence policy?



Insurance coverage can either be on a "claims made" or "occurrence" basis. These terms refer to what the policy covers during the policy period. A claims-made policy provides insurance for claims made during a policy year (or tail period) regardless of when the loss occurred, and an occurrence policy provides insurance for losses that occurred only during the policy year (as specified on the declarations form). A "claims made" policy provides coverage for claims made (and reported) during the policy term as long as they were made after the "retroactive date." (The retroactive date is the start date of the first claims-made policy obtained, so long as it has been kept active (via renewal).) That date remains the same and is not advanced as long as the policy is renewed. For example, if a client first obtains claims-made coverage on October 1, 2008, and it is now 2013 and they've maintained the same coverage, their claims-made policy covers all incidents since October 1, 2008. If the client no longer has coverage in 2014, and a patient sues in 2014 for an incident that occurred in 2008, the client does not have coverage for that incident (unless they purchased tail coverage). 
An "occurrence" policy, in contrast, covers incidents that occur (but are not necessarily reported) during the term the policy is in force. For example, if a client obtained an occurrence policy covering 2008-2009, and a patient is injured by the client's product in 2009, but does not sue for their injuries until 2011, the client has coverage from their 2008-2009 policy, even if they are no longer insured.


Will Medmarc provide coverage for non-medical products?




Because of our familiarity and long-standing connection with this industry, we recognize that life sciences companies sometimes have product lines that include non-medical products. Often, we can accommodate this coverage need.  Your Medmarc underwriter can answer any questions you might have about covering non-medical products and will walk you through specific coverage options for your insureds.


What information do you need to assess a clinical trial risk?




For clinical trial submissions, include the draft or final study protocol and the patient informed consent document in order to expedite our review.


How do I obtain a quote for manufacturers' errors and omissions (E&O) coverage from Medmarc?




The E&O application can be found here. Along with a completed application, your Medmarc underwriter simply needs a sample of your client’s contracts or purchase orders that they use with their customers.


How does Medmarc calculate minimum premiums?




Minimum premiums differ depending on several factors, such as a product’s risk profile and the state in which the company is located. 
If you have a small account and are interested discussing the cost of coverage in greater detail, please call George Ayd at (703) 652-1309.

Mobile Home Insurance


If you live in a mobile home, you have access to insurance coverage that will protect your property. Mobile home insurance quotes are as accessible as other types of home insurance, making it easy to protect your home and your assets. Even though the coverage is slightly different due to the type of dwelling, mobile home insurance offers many options that allow you to find an affordable solution to your coverage needs. In spite of the fact that mobile homes are much less expensive than traditional homes, they are still valuable assets that must be protected from loss. Finding the right coverage will keep your family financially secure even if disaster strikes and your property is damaged or destroyed.
If you own a mobile home, be aware that there is a specific type of home insurance to protect your valuable asset. Mobile homes are different from ordinary houses because they are built in factories. They are delivered upon purchase and can be uprooted and transferred to a different location later.
Mobile Home Insurance Coverage
Mobile home insurance helps protect your mobile home from many forms of loss. This can apply to a great variety of damages resulting from fire, storms, accidents and more. Just like other types of insurance policies, the fine print dictates how broad the coverage is.
Many mobile home insurance policies also cover adjacent structures which are not necessarily connected to your mobile home. These can include the patio, garden, or garage. However, several policies do not include coverage to the mobile home while it is being transferred from one location to another.
Coverage for Your Personal Assets
Mobile home insurance not only helps to protect your actual dwelling but also your personal property. It protects your personal property from theft and other criminal activities. Personal property coverage is included in a typical policy but the limits and coverage vary widely between different insurance plans so be sure to comparison shop.
Coverage for Yourself and Your Family
Mobile home insurance also protects individuals from a host of personal liabilities. This helps provide protection in case you cause somebody else bodily harm or damage their property. It usually covers guests to your home as well as individuals far from your property. Typically, the personal liability should not be automobile-related to be included in the coverage.
Mobile Home Insurance – More Reasons to Get Them
This comprehensive insurance plan helps cover you from a broad range of risks. It provides coverage for your home, your possessions, and even personal liabilities. Individuals can opt to extend their mobile home insurance plans with add-ons too.
Other popular extensions at additional costs include collision insurance and extended coverage on certain possessions typically not included in the coverage. Collision insurance covers your mobile home when it is being moved to another location.
Choosing the Best Mobile Home Insurance Coverage
When searching for mobile home insurance companies, you’ll find many coverage options at various rates. Created to cover many types of loss, mobile home insurance quotes can be from many providers and cover many types of property. Typically, this type of coverage will compensate you for losses caused by fire, storms, theft, accidents, and other forms of loss. It’s important to understand the policy in order to assess exactly what is covered before you decide on a specific provider. Often, the coverage extends to connecting property like porches, patios, storage sheds, and garages. You may also be able to include coverage for adjacent structures, even if they are not attached to the mobile home. Depending on your structure and your specific needs, you may be able to find coverage that meets your specific needs with ease.
When reviewing mobile home insurance quotes, the policies will also cover personal property contained in the home. Furnishings, appliances, and other personal belongings may also be covered in most policies. You may also be able to add items like collectibles, art work, and jewelry depending on the provider. When you’re making the decision on which insurance quote to choose, it’s important to read the fine print in order to find the right coverage for your home.
Mobile Home Renters Insurance
Like home insurance, mobile home insurance is designed to provide coverage for renters and homeowners. You can search for mobile home renters insurance quotes in order to protect your property as a renter. Searching for quotes online presents you with endless options and customizable features to ensure you find the coverage that is ideal for your situation. USInsuranceOnline.com makes it simple. With access to multiple quotes from the leading providers in your area, it’s easy to select the best policy for your mobile home.

Home‌ Insurance‌ Quotes‌ Online, ‌We’ve‌ Got‌ It‌ Covered
 
Taking a couple of minutes out of your day for great savings on your home insurance rates sounds like a no-brainer, right? Well, you're only steps away from potential savings regardless of the type of home or rental you have. Simply fill out the quick form above and we'll connect you with licensed agents who can provide you with home insurance quotes that you can compare.
What Are Home Insurance Benefits?
How much a homeowners insurance policy will benefit someone depends on the person. Many household items are covered and some people don't even realize the extent of coverage they have. To get the most out of it, you have to stay on top of things. Preforming regular maintenance could be the difference between whether or not your central AC unit gets fully covered or not, for example.
Is Home Insurance for New or Old Homes?
It doesn't matter if the home is old or new, home insurance may help you. Defective items and work can be discovered at any time regardless of old or new. You can custom tailor your plan to cover what you need it to by getting home insurance quotes from licensed agents.
Home Insurance Quotes From Leading Providers
Securing the proper insurance coverage is important in all areas of life. Life insurance, health insurance, and home insurance are all crucial to protecting your financial well-being no matter what happens. Important both for home owners and renters, this type of insurance can help protect your finances in the face of a disaster or other form of loss. Before you decide which provider is best for your needs, you'll want to review home insurance quotes from the leading providers in your area. You'll also want to learn about the coverage options so that you are able to select the best policy for your needs. A home insurance comparison can be simple when you choose USInsuranceOnline.com to help with your search. By reviewing quotes online, you can save time in your search and find the ideal type of coverage for your situation.
Types of Home Insurance
Depending on the type of dwelling you wish to cover, you can opt for various coverage types and levels. Mobile home insurance, renters insurance, condo insurance, and homeowners insurance are just a few of the options based on the type of home in which you reside. You will also be able to select coverage based on the specific risks you face in your area. Flood, high risk, and home warranty insurance will also be available to you in most areas.
Who Needs Home Insurance?
Home insurance quotes are designed for old and new homes of all kinds. You can choose policies that will protect the structure itself as well as specified contents in the home. In case of a covered disaster or other forms of loss, homeowners insurance will provide financial compensation for the loss. This coverage is necessary for all types of home owners and renters, no matter the age of the home. Home warranty insurance is more specifically focused on the structure of the home and certain maintenance issues, like the AC. When it's time to select the best possible coverage for your home, you may benefit from reviewing home insurance articles, which will educate you about the many available options in order to ensure you find the right coverage for your financial needs.

Homeowners Insurance Rate Discounts


Home insurance covers damage and replacement costs to property, structures and possessions. Depending on the amount of property insured, the cost of insuring a house and possessions can become expensive. If an individual is insuring a house that is in a “high risk” area such as an earthquake zone or flood plain, the costs of insuring the home can be even more expensive.
Guidelines for Saving Money on Rates
There are steps homeowners can take to help reduce costs of homeowners insurance rates. Not all of these will be applicable in all states. Home insurance discounts and lower prices can usually be obtained by following a few general guidelines:

Compare prices – Different insurance companies charge different rates. Collecting a few quotes from different companies gives a homeowner the ability to choose the plan that best suits their financial needs. Also, by visiting with agents or calling different companies, homeowners can get a feel for how the company may interact with them should there be a claim. 
Raise the deductible – A higher deductible means lower premiums      to pay. Keep in mind that should disaster hit, an individual should be able to pay the higher deductible if he or she wants to fully repair or restore property damage. Also, depending on the location of the home, the      homeowner may be required to own separate insurance for different types of disasters. These separate policies each have their own deductible which can also be raised to provide lower premiums. 
Purchase multiple insurance policies from the same company – Most      companies will provide discounts on home insurance policies if the homeowner also purchases their auto insurance from the same company. Usually, the more policies purchased from the company, the more each individual policy is discounted. 
Build in protection – Making small and large improvements to a      home in order to make it stronger and less vulnerable to common disasters can lower the home insurance rate. Reinforcing roofs in windstorm-prone areas or retrofitting an older home in an earthquake zone are two examples. 
Insure the house, not the land – The purchase price of a house      includes the land value as well. Since land cannot be stolen and is generally less prone to damage than a house, its value doesn’t need to be included with insurance rebuilding costs. Insure the house, not the land. 
Security systems – Fire alarms and monitored security systems often      provide homeowners a discount through the insurance company. Some locking systems and sprinkler systems for fire also qualify. Since not all security systems and measures qualify for discounts and others are expensive, a homeowner should check with the insurance company to see what      systems qualify for a discount before purchasing or installing the system. 
Ask – Ask the insurance company what kinds of discounts they offer. Different companies offer different discounts and incentives. 
Group insurance coverage – Some homeowners insurance rate      discounts is available through groups such as alumni organizations or professional associations. 
Long-term discounts – Some insurance companies offer discounts to      homeowners who stay with them for long periods. Homeowners should still periodically compare their insurance price with that of other companies. 
Review policies annually – If improvements have been made or      expensive furnishings acquired, then the amount of coverage on a home insurance policy needs to reflect these changes. Furthermore, if certain possessions have lost value or are no longer around, then there is no reason for the insurance policy to protect their value. 
Private vs. Government – Some homeowners in high-risk areas can      purchase insurance through the government. Sometimes homeowners insurance rate discounts can be found by searching out private companies that may be able to sell in the area and comparing prices. 
Calculate insurance before purchasing – by investigating risks      before purchasing a house, a homeowner (or in this case, prospective buyer) can determine the approximate cost of insurance before purchase.

Next, we provide an overview on the components of home insurance. This section helps explain each of the major components that make up a policy and determine your rates. This discussion includes the physical structure of your property, the contents of your home, the level of liability protection you choose, and the cost of possible displacement due to a natural disaster.
We then explore home insurance coverage and limitations of home owners insurance. This will help you understand what is and is not covered by a typical policy and when you may need to purchase additional or supplemental coverage for your home.

Renters Insurance Quotes


The two of you are living together and engaged to be married. You've entered into the, "What's mine is yours and what's yours is mine" frame of mind. You borrow his bike, his clothes; he plays your CDs and uses your laptop. Sometimes, you leave your engagement ring at home, afraid of losing or damaging or, perish the thought, giving someone the chance to steal it. But you aren't sure if it's covered by your betrothed's home contents insurance. You've only been living together a few months in what used to be exclusively his apartment. Is any of your stuff insured under his policy? It may be time to look up renters insurance quotes.
Now is the time for the two of you to create an actual home inventory, not a guesstimate, of all the personal property in the apartment you'd like to insure against damage or loss. Even though you aren't married yet, some states and insurers will allow you to obtain apartment renters insurance together-one policy, both of your names-while others will make each of you get your own policy.
To create a home inventory, which will help you decide how much home contents insurance you need and make filing a claim easier, add up the cost of everything you would want to replace if it were damaged or stolen. Record model numbers, dates and places of purchase. Take photographs or make a video of these items and place a copy of the inventory in a safe place away from your home.
Bear in mind when you look up renters insurance quotes that most policies have standard coverage limits, i.e., a dollar limit on jewelry that is stolen. Be sure to review these limits and, for expensive jewelry and other valuables you may want to consider buying additional coverage. These additions to your policy provide higher limits and broader coverage.
As for home owners, it isn't difficult for unmarried couples to buy homeowner's insurance together at the same rates offered to the married, as long as both partners own the house. If the title to the property bears only one name, the personal property of the other will not be automatically covered by the policy. The non-owner can perhaps be added as an occupant-check with your insurer about this-or may need to get separate policies when getting renters insurance quotes.
Finally, if you or your mate work out of your home, you may need a special policy to cover expensive equipment, not to mention extra liability coverage if you receive clients in your home. Just one more thing to think about as you merge households and begin to acquire property of real as well as symbolic value.

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Liberty Mutual was founded in 1912 as the Massachusetts Employees Insurance Association (MEIA), following passage of a Massachusetts state law requiring employers to protect their employees with workers’ compensation insurance in 1911.[11] The first branch office was opened in 1914, and later that year, the company wrote its first automobile insurance policy. The company was founded as a Massachusetts Mutual Company, where its insureds have ownership in the company. The name was changed in 1917 to the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company and, through partnerships, the company began offering full-coverage auto policies.
Structural changes[edit]
In 1964, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company began offering life insurance through its Liberty Life Assurance Branch. In 2002, the company converted into its current mutual holding company structure. The conversion was controversial, as it proposed to give policyholders an interest in the mutual insurance company, which some policyholders believed would dilute their interest in the overall company and limit their dividends.[12] A lawsuit was filed, alleging that information provided to policyholders was misleading. Liberty Mutual settled the lawsuit in December 2001, which required additional disclosure and limited certain compensation to company officers and directors.[13] Despite these concerns, the plan was approved by voting policyholders around November 2001.[14] Leveraging the greater flexibility of the mutual company structure, Liberty Mutual transformed from a single-line, highly regional insurer to one of the world's leading property and casualty insurance companies.
Growth and acquisitions[edit]
Liberty Mutual's growth has been both organic and through acquisition. Early acquisitions were small, but Liberty Mutual has made several large acquisitions over the past decade, including the high-profile acquisition of Safeco Corporation in 2008. Liberty Mutual agreed to acquire all outstanding shares of Safeco for $68.25 per share, for a total transaction price of approximately $6.2 billion. The result of this activity was an increase in revenue from $6 billion to over $30 billion in twelve years. In 1999, the company purchased Wausau Insurance Cos.[15]
Liberty Mutual created a television commercial in 2006 about people doing good things for strangers, reporting that the "overwhelming" positive response they received for the ad led to their decision to create the website The Responsibility Project.[16]
Liberty Mutual is also the sole corporate sponsor of the long-running PBS documentary series, American Experience, and has produced special commercial messages for airing during American Experience broadcasts. In 2011, as part of the company's "Real America" campaign, the company introduced two new commercials featuring Sacagawea and Paul Revere.
In 2011, the company began construction of the Liberty Mutual Tower, a 22-story skyscraper as part of its World Headquarters Expansion Project.[17] The building received its certificate of occupancy in June 2013.[18]
Organizational structure[edit]
Strategic business units[edit]
Liberty Mutual conducts all of its business through four strategic business units: US Consumer Markets, Commercial Insurance, Global Consumer Markets, and Global Specialty.[19]

US Consumer Markets[edit]
Passenger automobile, homeowners, life, annuity, and other property and casualty insurance products are available via Liberty Mutual's US Consumer Markets line. These products are branded under the Liberty Mutual Insurance and Safeco names, and are distributed via a vast network of over 2,300 sales professionals. Other distribution means are call centers, third-party producers, and the company's own website. Over 10,000 insurance agencies across the United States carry Safeco-branded products.[20]
Commercial insurance[edit]
Property and casualty, as well as group benefits commercial insurance products fall into two distinct categories: Business Insurance and National Insurance. The former caters to businesses with fewer than 1,000 employees, while the latter serves businesses in certain industries or which have greater than 1,000 employees. Group benefits products include disability insurance and group life insurance.[20]
Global Consumer Markets[edit]
Localized insurance companies sell Liberty International's products in 18 different countries and markets. International products are offered to both individual and business customers, and include property and casualty insurance, as well as health and life insurance products. The largest international product offering is passenger automobile insurance for private individuals.[20]
Global Specialty[edit]
The Global Specialty insurance line offers specialty products, such as marine, energy, aviation, professional liability, and crisis management, offered through 40 Liberty International Underwriters offices worldwide. In addition, Liberty International Underwriters provides global multi-line insurance and reinsurance written on its Lloyd's Syndicate 4472 platform. Global Specialty also includes reinsurance products offered through Liberty Mutual Reinsurance.[20]

Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety[edit]
Founded in 1954, the Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety has studied the occupational safety and health of workers. Its scientific contributions include machine safeguarding guidelines, the Cornell-Liberty Survival Car, and ergonomic guidelines that have informed the basis for national and international safety standards. More recently, the Institute developed the Workplace Safety Index, which is an annual ranking of the leading causes of the most disabling occupational injuries in the United States.
The Institute's scientists conduct field and laboratory experiments to study the major causes of work-related injury and disability, publishing their results in peer-reviewed scientific literature. Institute findings are the basis for safety programs, recommendations, and software used by Liberty Mutual loss control consultants in order to help policyholders enhance worker safety. The Institute’s work is non-proprietary, and is available to the public.[21][22][23][24][25][26][27]
Controversy[edit]

In 2012 and 2013, a series of investigative articles were published in Liberty Mutual's hometown newspaper: The Boston Globe. These reports were written by Brian McGrory who later became the editor of The Boston Globe. It reported issues related to excessive compensation and questionable weekend trips using the fleet of five long-range corporate jets by its executives.[28] In the investigative reporting series, as a columnist, a number of questions related to the company were discovered; among them- (all cited):
In 2006, Liberty Mutual claims employees in the Los Angeles area desired overtime pay for work and labor accomplished related to claims work. The situation escalated, and Liberty Mutual accepted a legal question which was originally in the form of four class action lawsuits filed by its own claims representatives and employees. Some questions started in 2006 in North Carolina.[29]
Questions of this particular suit, from Liberty Mutual employees, resulted from the company's desired service to a claim, versus claim outcomes. Liberty Mutual worked on specific metrics. This case provided the company with legal precedent to claims handling and ability to process claims based on values from third party information outside of claims that repair or replace property without having to view the physical property insured. As such, Liberty Mutual closed all its locations in Los Angeles, the nation's second largest insurance market, following this action at the behest of its employees.
In late 2012, the company won an appeal granting it the ability not to pay employees for work performed on an overtime basis. Pursuit was considered an award for the insurance industry as a whole.[30] In this specific case, Liberty Mutual failed to appear. Instead, they relied on an Amicus Brief filed on behalf of the US Department of Labor.[31] The Court decided, based on the Amicus Brief, that claims personnel are exempt "Administrative Employees" and not subject to overtime pay, further supporting the mutual company's goals. In late 2012, the California Supreme Court also redacted court documents.[32]
"The benefits of political friendship" provides a newspaper published report on Liberty Mutual's political ties, including ties to Deval Patrick, the then Governor of Massachusetts. This friendship is alleged to have resulted in Liberty Mutual's receipt of tax breaks in the amount of $41M.[33]
"Perspectives Can Change at Liberty Mutual" provides a newspaper published look at Liberty Mutual's claims process; where Liberty Mutual sued its own insured for filing a claim; and forced an award against Liberty Mutual. The article also disclosed that Liberty Mutual's legal team that represented the case usually paid less than half of the judgements.[34]
"Liberty Mutual: Your premiums, his premium office" provides a newspaper published account of CEO David H Long's desire to redecorate his 1,000sq foot office at a price of $4.5M. The article also discusses the need of the insurance company to have four corporate jets.[35]
"An Untimely Award" provides a newspaper published report of corporate governance at Liberty Mutual.[36]
"View from the top at Liberty Mutual" provides a newspaper published report from Boston Globe editor, Brian McGrory who was invited to the recently renovated CEO suite at Liberty Mutual.[37]
"Lots more to Liberty Mutual pay story" provides a newspaper published report of a comparative analysis of other executives' pay in Boston.[38]
"At Liberty Mutual, Accounting To No One For Executive Privileges" provides a newspaper published report and review of itineraries of the fleet of corporate jets, and executive compensation which includes "Make believe stock options". By virtue of a Mutual-Company setup, its customers own stock in the company.[39]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Liberty Mutual was founded in 1912 as the Massachusetts Employees Insurance Association (MEIA), following passage of a Massachusetts state law requiring employers to protect their employees with workers’ compensation insurance in 1911.[11] The first branch office was opened in 1914, and later that year, the company wrote its first automobile insurance policy. The company was founded as a Massachusetts Mutual Company, where its insureds have ownership in the company. The name was changed in 1917 to the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company and, through partnerships, the company began offering full-coverage auto policies.
Structural changes[edit]
In 1964, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company began offering life insurance through its Liberty Life Assurance Branch. In 2002, the company converted into its current mutual holding company structure. The conversion was controversial, as it proposed to give policyholders an interest in the mutual insurance company, which some policyholders believed would dilute their interest in the overall company and limit their dividends.[12] A lawsuit was filed, alleging that information provided to policyholders was misleading. Liberty Mutual settled the lawsuit in December 2001, which required additional disclosure and limited certain compensation to company officers and directors.[13] Despite these concerns, the plan was approved by voting policyholders around November 2001.[14] Leveraging the greater flexibility of the mutual company structure, Liberty Mutual transformed from a single-line, highly regional insurer to one of the world's leading property and casualty insurance companies.
Growth and acquisitions[edit]
Liberty Mutual's growth has been both organic and through acquisition. Early acquisitions were small, but Liberty Mutual has made several large acquisitions over the past decade, including the high-profile acquisition of Safeco Corporation in 2008. Liberty Mutual agreed to acquire all outstanding shares of Safeco for $68.25 per share, for a total transaction price of approximately $6.2 billion. The result of this activity was an increase in revenue from $6 billion to over $30 billion in twelve years. In 1999, the company purchased Wausau Insurance Cos.[15]
Liberty Mutual created a television commercial in 2006 about people doing good things for strangers, reporting that the "overwhelming" positive response they received for the ad led to their decision to create the website The Responsibility Project.[16]
Liberty Mutual is also the sole corporate sponsor of the long-running PBS documentary series, American Experience, and has produced special commercial messages for airing during American Experience broadcasts. In 2011, as part of the company's "Real America" campaign, the company introduced two new commercials featuring Sacagawea and Paul Revere.
In 2011, the company began construction of the Liberty Mutual Tower, a 22-story skyscraper as part of its World Headquarters Expansion Project.[17] The building received its certificate of occupancy in June 2013.[18]
Organizational structure[edit]
Strategic business units[edit]
Liberty Mutual conducts all of its business through four strategic business units: US Consumer Markets, Commercial Insurance, Global Consumer Markets, and Global Specialty.[19]

US Consumer Markets[edit]
Passenger automobile, homeowners, life, annuity, and other property and casualty insurance products are available via Liberty Mutual's US Consumer Markets line. These products are branded under the Liberty Mutual Insurance and Safeco names, and are distributed via a vast network of over 2,300 sales professionals. Other distribution means are call centers, third-party producers, and the company's own website. Over 10,000 insurance agencies across the United States carry Safeco-branded products.[20]
Commercial insurance[edit]
Property and casualty, as well as group benefits commercial insurance products fall into two distinct categories: Business Insurance and National Insurance. The former caters to businesses with fewer than 1,000 employees, while the latter serves businesses in certain industries or which have greater than 1,000 employees. Group benefits products include disability insurance and group life insurance.[20]
Global Consumer Markets[edit]
Localized insurance companies sell Liberty International's products in 18 different countries and markets. International products are offered to both individual and business customers, and include property and casualty insurance, as well as health and life insurance products. The largest international product offering is passenger automobile insurance for private individuals.[20]
Global Specialty[edit]
The Global Specialty insurance line offers specialty products, such as marine, energy, aviation, professional liability, and crisis management, offered through 40 Liberty International Underwriters offices worldwide. In addition, Liberty International Underwriters provides global multi-line insurance and reinsurance written on its Lloyd's Syndicate 4472 platform. Global Specialty also includes reinsurance products offered through Liberty Mutual Reinsurance.[20]

Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety[edit]
Founded in 1954, the Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety has studied the occupational safety and health of workers. Its scientific contributions include machine safeguarding guidelines, the Cornell-Liberty Survival Car, and ergonomic guidelines that have informed the basis for national and international safety standards. More recently, the Institute developed the Workplace Safety Index, which is an annual ranking of the leading causes of the most disabling occupational injuries in the United States.
The Institute's scientists conduct field and laboratory experiments to study the major causes of work-related injury and disability, publishing their results in peer-reviewed scientific literature. Institute findings are the basis for safety programs, recommendations, and software used by Liberty Mutual loss control consultants in order to help policyholders enhance worker safety. The Institute’s work is non-proprietary, and is available to the public.[21][22][23][24][25][26][27]

In 2012 and 2013, a series of investigative articles were published in Liberty Mutual's hometown newspaper: The Boston Globe. These reports were written by Brian McGrory who later became the editor of The Boston Globe. It reported issues related to excessive compensation and questionable weekend trips using the fleet of five long-range corporate jets by its executives.[28] In the investigative reporting series, as a columnist, a number of questions related to the company were discovered; among them- (all cited):
In 2006, Liberty Mutual claims employees in the Los Angeles area desired overtime pay for work and labor accomplished related to claims work. The situation escalated, and Liberty Mutual accepted a legal question which was originally in the form of four class action lawsuits filed by its own claims representatives and employees. Some questions started in 2006 in North Carolina.[29]
Questions of this particular suit, from Liberty Mutual employees, resulted from the company's desired service to a claim, versus claim outcomes. Liberty Mutual worked on specific metrics. This case provided the company with legal precedent to claims handling and ability to process claims based on values from third party information outside of claims that repair or replace property without having to view the physical property insured. As such, Liberty Mutual closed all its locations in Los Angeles, the nation's second largest insurance market, following this action at the behest of its employees.
In late 2012, the company won an appeal granting it the ability not to pay employees for work performed on an overtime basis. Pursuit was considered an award for the insurance industry as a whole.[30] In this specific case, Liberty Mutual failed to appear. Instead, they relied on an Amicus Brief filed on behalf of the US Department of Labor.[31] The Court decided, based on the Amicus Brief, that claims personnel are exempt "Administrative Employees" and not subject to overtime pay, further supporting the mutual company's goals. In late 2012, the California Supreme Court also redacted court documents.[32]
"The benefits of political friendship" provides a newspaper published report on Liberty Mutual's political ties, including ties to Deval Patrick, the then Governor of Massachusetts. This friendship is alleged to have resulted in Liberty Mutual's receipt of tax breaks in the amount of $41M.[33]
"Perspectives Can Change at Liberty Mutual" provides a newspaper published look at Liberty Mutual's claims process; where Liberty Mutual sued its own insured for filing a claim; and forced an award against Liberty Mutual. The article also disclosed that Liberty Mutual's legal team that represented the case usually paid less than half of the judgements.[34]
"Liberty Mutual: Your premiums, his premium office" provides a newspaper published account of CEO David H Long's desire to redecorate his 1,000sq foot office at a price of $4.5M. The article also discusses the need of the insurance company to have four corporate jets.[35]
"An Untimely Award" provides a newspaper published report of corporate governance at Liberty Mutual.[36]
"View from the top at Liberty Mutual" provides a newspaper published report from Boston Globe editor, Brian McGrory who was invited to the recently renovated CEO suite at Liberty Mutual.[37]
"Lots more to Liberty Mutual pay story" provides a newspaper published report of a comparative analysis of other executives' pay in Boston.[38]
"At Liberty Mutual, Accounting To No One For Executive Privileges" provides a newspaper published report and review of itineraries of the fleet of corporate jets, and executive compensation which includes "Make believe stock options". By virtue of a Mutual-Company setup, its customers own stock in the company.[39]

Liberty Mutual Group, more commonly known by the name of its primary line of business, Liberty Mutual Insurance, is an American diversified global insurer, and the fourth-largest property and casualty insurer in the United States.[2] It ranks 76th on the Fortune 100 list of largest corporations in the United States based on 2013 revenue.[3] Based in Boston, Massachusetts, it employs over 50,000 people in more than 900 locations throughout the world. As of December 31, 2015, Liberty Mutual Insurance had $121.7 billion in consolidated assets, $102.5 billion in consolidated liabilities, and $37.6 billion in annual consolidated revenue.[1][4] The company, founded in 1912, offers a wide range of insurance products and services, including personal automobile, homeowners, workers' compensation, commercial multiple peril, commercial automobile, general liability, global specialty, group disability, fire and surety.[5][6]

Liberty Mutual Group owns, wholly or in part, local insurance companies in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, China (including Hong Kong), Colombia, Ecuador, India, Ireland, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Venezuela and Vietnam.
In the United States, Liberty Mutual remains a mutual company where policyholders holding contracts for insurance are considered shareholders in the company. However, Liberty Mutual Group's brand usually operates as a separate entity outside the United States. In other countries, subsidiaries are often created in countries where legally recognized mutual company benefits cannot be enjoyed.
The current CEO is David H. Long. He succeeded his predecessor Edmund (Ted) F. Kelly on June 29, 2011.[7][8] Ted Kelly was appointed CEO in 1998.[9] In April 2013, Ted Kelly stepped down from the board of directors, as chairman.[10]

History[edit]
Early history[edit]
Liberty Mutual was founded in 1912 as the Massachusetts Employees Insurance Association (MEIA), following passage of a Massachusetts state law requiring employers to protect their employees with workers’ compensation insurance in 1911.[11] The first branch office was opened in 1914, and later that year, the company wrote its first automobile insurance policy. The company was founded as a Massachusetts Mutual Company, where its insureds have ownership in the company. The name was changed in 1917 to the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company and, through partnerships, the company began offering full-coverage auto policies.
Structural changes[edit]
In 1964, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company began offering life insurance through its Liberty Life Assurance Branch. In 2002, the company converted into its current mutual holding company structure. The conversion was controversial, as it proposed to give policyholders an interest in the mutual insurance company, which some policyholders believed would dilute their interest in the overall company and limit their dividends.[12] A lawsuit was filed, alleging that information provided to policyholders was misleading. Liberty Mutual settled the lawsuit in December 2001, which required additional disclosure and limited certain compensation to company officers and directors.[13] Despite these concerns, the plan was approved by voting policyholders around November 2001.[14] Leveraging the greater flexibility of the mutual company structure, Liberty Mutual transformed from a single-line, highly regional insurer to one of the world's leading property and casualty insurance companies.
Growth and acquisitions[edit]
Liberty Mutual's growth has been both organic and through acquisition. Early acquisitions were small, but Liberty Mutual has made several large acquisitions over the past decade, including the high-profile acquisition of Safeco Corporation in 2008. Liberty Mutual agreed to acquire all outstanding shares of Safeco for $68.25 per share, for a total transaction price of approximately $6.2 billion. The result of this activity was an increase in revenue from $6 billion to over $30 billion in twelve years. In 1999, the company purchased Wausau Insurance Cos.[15]
Liberty Mutual created a television commercial in 2006 about people doing good things for strangers, reporting that the "overwhelming" positive response they received for the ad led to their decision to create the website The Responsibility Project.[16]
Liberty Mutual is also the sole corporate sponsor of the long-running PBS documentary series, American Experience, and has produced special commercial messages for airing during American Experience broadcasts. In 2011, as part of the company's "Real America" campaign, the company introduced two new commercials featuring Sacagawea and Paul Revere.
In 2011, the company began construction of the Liberty Mutual Tower, a 22-story skyscraper as part of its World Headquarters Expansion Project.[17] The building received its certificate of occupancy in June 2013.[18]
Organizational structure[edit]
Strategic business units[edit]
Liberty Mutual conducts all of its business through four strategic business units: US Consumer Markets, Commercial Insurance, Global Consumer Markets, and Global Specialty.[19]

US Consumer Markets[edit]
Passenger automobile, homeowners, life, annuity, and other property and casualty insurance products are available via Liberty Mutual's US Consumer Markets line. These products are branded under the Liberty Mutual Insurance and Safeco names, and are distributed via a vast network of over 2,300 sales professionals. Other distribution means are call centers, third-party producers, and the company's own website. Over 10,000 insurance agencies across the United States carry Safeco-branded products.[20]
Commercial insurance[edit]
Property and casualty, as well as group benefits commercial insurance products fall into two distinct categories: Business Insurance and National Insurance. The former caters to businesses with fewer than 1,000 employees, while the latter serves businesses in certain industries or which have greater than 1,000 employees. Group benefits products include disability insurance and group life insurance.[20]
Global Consumer Markets[edit]
Localized insurance companies sell Liberty International's products in 18 different countries and markets. International products are offered to both individual and business customers, and include property and casualty insurance, as well as health and life insurance products. The largest international product offering is passenger automobile insurance for private individuals.[20]
Global Specialty[edit]
The Global Specialty insurance line offers specialty products, such as marine, energy, aviation, professional liability, and crisis management, offered through 40 Liberty International Underwriters offices worldwide. In addition, Liberty International Underwriters provides global multi-line insurance and reinsurance written on its Lloyd's Syndicate 4472 platform. Global Specialty also includes reinsurance products offered through Liberty Mutual Reinsurance.[20]

Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety[edit]
Founded in 1954, the Liberty Mutual Research Institute for Safety has studied the occupational safety and health of workers. Its scientific contributions include machine safeguarding guidelines, the Cornell-Liberty Survival Car, and ergonomic guidelines that have informed the basis for national and international safety standards. More recently, the Institute developed the Workplace Safety Index, which is an annual ranking of the leading causes of the most disabling occupational injuries in the United States.
The Institute's scientists conduct field and laboratory experiments to study the major causes of work-related injury and disability, publishing their results in peer-reviewed scientific literature. Institute findings are the basis for safety programs, recommendations, and software used by Liberty Mutual loss control consultants in order to help policyholders enhance worker safety. The Institute’s work is non-proprietary, and is available to the public.[21][22][23][24][25][26][27]
Controversy[edit]

In 2012 and 2013, a series of investigative articles were published in Liberty Mutual's hometown newspaper: The Boston Globe. These reports were written by Brian McGrory who later became the editor of The Boston Globe. It reported issues related to excessive compensation and questionable weekend trips using the fleet of five long-range corporate jets by its executives.[28] In the investigative reporting series, as a columnist, a number of questions related to the company were discovered; among them- (all cited):
In 2006, Liberty Mutual claims employees in the Los Angeles area desired overtime pay for work and labor accomplished related to claims work. The situation escalated, and Liberty Mutual accepted a legal question which was originally in the form of four class action lawsuits filed by its own claims representatives and employees. Some questions started in 2006 in North Carolina.[29]
Questions of this particular suit, from Liberty Mutual employees, resulted from the company's desired service to a claim, versus claim outcomes. Liberty Mutual worked on specific metrics. This case provided the company with legal precedent to claims handling and ability to process claims based on values from third party information outside of claims that repair or replace property without having to view the physical property insured. As such, Liberty Mutual closed all its locations in Los Angeles, the nation's second largest insurance market, following this action at the behest of its employees.
In late 2012, the company won an appeal granting it the ability not to pay employees for work performed on an overtime basis. Pursuit was considered an award for the insurance industry as a whole.[30] In this specific case, Liberty Mutual failed to appear. Instead, they relied on an Amicus Brief filed on behalf of the US Department of Labor.[31] The Court decided, based on the Amicus Brief, that claims personnel are exempt "Administrative Employees" and not subject to overtime pay, further supporting the mutual company's goals. In late 2012, the California Supreme Court also redacted court documents.[32]
"The benefits of political friendship" provides a newspaper published report on Liberty Mutual's political ties, including ties to Deval Patrick, the then Governor of Massachusetts. This friendship is alleged to have resulted in Liberty Mutual's receipt of tax breaks in the amount of $41M.[33]
"Perspectives Can Change at Liberty Mutual" provides a newspaper published look at Liberty Mutual's claims process; where Liberty Mutual sued its own insured for filing a claim; and forced an award against Liberty Mutual. The article also disclosed that Liberty Mutual's legal team that represented the case usually paid less than half of the judgements.[34]
"Liberty Mutual: Your premiums, his premium office" provides a newspaper published account of CEO David H Long's desire to redecorate his 1,000sq foot office at a price of $4.5M. The article also discusses the need of the insurance company to have four corporate jets.[35]
"An Untimely Award" provides a newspaper published report of corporate governance at Liberty Mutual.[36]
"View from the top at Liberty Mutual" provides a newspaper published report from Boston Globe editor, Brian McGrory who was invited to the recently renovated CEO suite at Liberty Mutual.[37]
"Lots more to Liberty Mutual pay story" provides a newspaper published report of a comparative analysis of other executives' pay in Boston.[38]
"At Liberty Mutual, Accounting To No One For Executive Privileges" provides a newspaper published report and review of itineraries of the fleet of corporate jets, and executive compensation which includes "Make believe stock options". By virtue of a Mutual-Company setup, its customers own stock in the company.[39]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).

However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
