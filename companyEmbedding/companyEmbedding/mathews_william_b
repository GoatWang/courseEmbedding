California AHGP - William B. Mathews





WILLIAM B. MATHEWS





William B. Mathews, one of the extensive land owners of San Joaquin county, his realty possession aggregating twelve hundred acres, is engaged in general farming, but makes a specialty of the raising of barley and wheat.  He annually harvests fine crops and has become one of the foremost representatives of the grain-raising industry in this section of the state.



Mr. Mathews is a native of Posey county, Indiana, born on the 4th of August, 1854.  He is a son of John and Elizabeth (Hust) Mathews, the former a native of Wisconsin and the latter of Posey county.  Both the paternal and the maternal grandparents located in Posey county when it was a frontier district and were actively connected with its pioneer development and progress.  Upon the old homestead farm William B. Mathews spent the days of his boyhood and youth, attending the public schools through the winter months and assisting in the labors of the field through the summer seasons.  he gave his father the benefit of his services until he attained his majority, when, in 1875, he left home and came direct to California, settling in San Joaquin county.  Here he began farming upon rented land lying along the San Joaquin river, and when his labors had brought to him sufficient capital he began buying property, and from time to time he has added to his estate until he now has two fine ranches, comprising twelve hundred acres.  For a number of years he has engaged in raising draft horses and was likewise engaged at one time in raising mules, but now confines his attention along stock-raising lines to horses.  In his fields his principal crops are wheat and barley, and his harvests are large and the product finds a ready sale on the market.  He keeps fully abreast with the most progressive ideas of the times bearing upon agricultural and stock-raising interests, and his valuable and well equipped farms indicate that his life has been one of untiring activity, crowned with desirable and gratifying success.



In public affairs Mr. Mathews is deeply interested in a public-spirited way and endorses all measures for the general good.  He is now serving as a trustee of Reclamation district No. 17, and has also served as a trustee of the public schools of French Camp.  He votes with the Democracy, and in his religious faith is a Methodist, belonging to the church of that denomination at French Camp, of which he is now serving as a trustee.  He takes an active part in its work and is zealous in behalf of its growth and upbuilding.



In May, 1891, Mr. Mathews was united in marriage to Miss Julia Wilson, of Posey county, Indiana, a daughter of Christopher and Elizabeth Wilson, now deceased, who were residents of the Hoosier state.  Both Mr. and Mrs. Mathews are charter members and active workers in Castoria Grange No. 322, P. H.  He was its first master and his wife has served as secretary since its organization.  Through this avenue they have done much to promote the agricultural interests of San Joaquin county, and they are most worthy representatives of the intelligent, enterprising and progressive agriculturists who have done so much to reclaim and improve this county and make it one of the prosperous sections of the great state of California.  From humble surroundings Mr. Mathews has worked his way gradually upward to prosperity, and his life history exemplifies the statement that success has as its foundation earnest and honorable labor.

Mathews William B
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in California:













Does Mathews William B carry a valid contracting license?



In California, any remodeling or construction project that exceeds $500 (labor and materials), requires a contractor to have an active license with the California Contractor State License Board (CSLB).
Mathews William B currently holds license C10233 (Architect), which was Active when we last checked.











How important is contractor licensing in California?



The CSLB is one of the highest rated licensing boards in the US. Applicants are required to pass a written board exam and prove at least four years of prior, relevant work experience. In addition, the CSLB requires all license holders to maintain at least $2,500 in operating capital and provides you with a range of other consumer protections.











Your liability risk when hiring Mathews William B



Contractors in California are required to carry workers' compensation insurance if they have employees and proof of liability insurance with the cumulative limit of $1 million for licensees with five or fewer persons, and an additional 100,000 for each additional member over five, not to exceed $5 million total.











Financial recourse when hiring Mathews William B



All licensed contractors in California are required to maintain a bond, which provides you with financial recourse in case they perform defective work or violate license regulations. If you feel as though you have been taken advantage of, you should leave feedback on the contractor's BuildZoom profile and file a complaint with the CSLB.











What else should I know before hiring Mathews William B



California contractors are required to submit their fingerprints to the board, which are then checked against criminal records held by the California Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) prior to obtaining a valid contracting license.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The California State License Board recommends getting at least three written bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.â¦ read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.
