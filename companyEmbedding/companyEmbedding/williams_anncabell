Local knowledge: Process expertise: Responsiveness: Negotiation skills:  I highly recommend Ann-Cabell and her team!
I was a first time homebuyer and not having any knowledge on how the market works, I knew A LOT after my experience with Ann-Cabell. She and her team took the time to explain everything to me with a great deal of patience. 

They also explained everything  that would happen, and they would always give me plenty of time to prepare myself for the next step. I didn't know it was going to be an emotional experience but they were very reassuring and confident. They also introduced me to a financial company that made everything even smoother for me. They were essential in our day to day questions and worries. I couldn't be happier that I found them!More Less         Highly likely to recommend     12/19/2016 -  lburleson0    Written about  Ann-Cabell Baum   on 12/19/2016 Sold a Condo home in 2016 for approximately $400K in North Central, Raleigh, NC.   Local knowledge: Process expertise: Responsiveness: Negotiation skills:  Great experience with great and talented realtors.  I appreciated the staff coming above and beyond the call of duty to not only get condo ready for sale but also to get access to and to negotiate the purchase of a new residence.        Highly likely to recommend     10/28/2016 -  fph0223    Written about  Ann-Cabell Baum   on 10/28/2016 Sold a Condo home in 2016 in Central, Raleigh, NC.   Local knowledge: Process expertise: Responsiveness: Negotiation skills:  The Glenwood Agency is exceptional in so many ways others aren't.  We had a very specific agenda when we hired Glenwood Agency and Ann-Cabell and her team listened to our needs, created, communicated, and executed a plan, and exceeded our goals.  Their knowledge on and experience in the downtown  Raleigh real estate market separates themselves from the rest. Seriously, nobody can do this better than Glenwood Agency.More Less         Highly likely to recommend     03/14/2016 -  brant pruden    Written about  Ann-Cabell Baum   on 03/14/2016 Bought a Single Family home in 2016 in Five Points, Raleigh, NC.

As first timers, we felt guided and supported throughout the entire process. We felt at ease and confident that we were in the right hands.

Her knowledge, expertise, enthusiasm, and responsiveness are unparalleled! She has amassed a wonderful team of professionals who guided me through the most seamless process imaginable.
