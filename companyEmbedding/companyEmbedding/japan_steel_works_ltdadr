Japan Steel Works, Ltd. (株式会社日本製鋼所, Kabushiki Kaisha Nihon Seikōsho) is a steel manufacturer founded in Muroran, Hokkaidō, Japan in 1907.[3]

History[edit]
Japan Steel Works was set up with investment from British firms Vickers, Armstrong Whitworth and Mitsui.[3] During World War II, they manufactured what was then the world's largest gun barrel to be fitted on the battleship Yamato. 200 workers in their main plant in Muroran were killed in a 1945 attack by Allied Forces.[4]
Products[edit]
Japan Steel Works' industrial processes which are used to purify steel are held to high standards. These include the use of argon gas to eliminate impurities, and the addition of manganese, chromium and nickel to make the steel harder.[4]
Japan Steel Works' services are in great demand owing to its role as one of only five manufacturers worldwide of the largest single-piece components of pressure vessels for nuclear reactors[4][5] at the company's factory, which is located on the island of Hokkaidō. The other manufacturers as of 2010 are two companies in China, one in Russia and one in France.[6] However, Japan Steel Works is the only one that can make cores in a single piece without welds, which reduces risk from radiation leakage.[7] The company has boosted production to 6 units per year from 4 previously of the steel pressure vessel forgings, which contain the nuclear reactor core. It is scheduled to take capacity to 11 by 2013.[7] Due to the production bottleneck, utilities across the world are submitting orders years in advance of any actual need, along with deposits worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Other manufacturers are examining various options, including finding ways to make a similar item using alternate methods, or making the component themselves with welds.[4] However, welds are weak points which can result in reactor leakage.
Other items manufactured by Japan Steel Works include machines for processed plastics.[8] They also continue to make a limited number of traditional Japanese swords.[4] They are also involved in the development of the Type 10 battle tank, Type 99 155 mm self-propelled howitzer and Naval artillery.
Financial information[edit]
In fiscal year 2001, Japan Steel Works posted a net loss of ¥1.81 billion on sales of ¥119.70 billion. Their performance improved in 2002, with net profit of ¥100 million on sales of ¥129 billion; however, this was far short of their earlier estimate of ¥600 million net profit on sales of ¥134 billion.[8]
Japan Steel Works Ltd. increased net profit to ¥12.6 billion for the nine months to December 31, 2007. Revenue was up to ¥159.2 billion. Operating profit increased to ¥21.9 billion and ordinary profit rose to ¥21.2 billion. Full-year revenue forecast is unchanged at ¥ 218 billion to March 31, 2008. The company maintained a full-year net profit forecast of ¥15 billion.[9]

History[edit]
Japan Steel Works was set up with investment from British firms Vickers, Armstrong Whitworth and Mitsui.[3] During World War II, they manufactured what was then the world's largest gun barrel to be fitted on the battleship Yamato. 200 workers in their main plant in Muroran were killed in a 1945 attack by Allied Forces.[4]
Products[edit]
Japan Steel Works' industrial processes which are used to purify steel are held to high standards. These include the use of argon gas to eliminate impurities, and the addition of manganese, chromium and nickel to make the steel harder.[4]
Japan Steel Works' services are in great demand owing to its role as one of only five manufacturers worldwide of the largest single-piece components of pressure vessels for nuclear reactors[4][5] at the company's factory, which is located on the island of Hokkaidō. The other manufacturers as of 2010 are two companies in China, one in Russia and one in France.[6] However, Japan Steel Works is the only one that can make cores in a single piece without welds, which reduces risk from radiation leakage.[7] The company has boosted production to 6 units per year from 4 previously of the steel pressure vessel forgings, which contain the nuclear reactor core. It is scheduled to take capacity to 11 by 2013.[7] Due to the production bottleneck, utilities across the world are submitting orders years in advance of any actual need, along with deposits worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Other manufacturers are examining various options, including finding ways to make a similar item using alternate methods, or making the component themselves with welds.[4] However, welds are weak points which can result in reactor leakage.
Other items manufactured by Japan Steel Works include machines for processed plastics.[8] They also continue to make a limited number of traditional Japanese swords.[4] They are also involved in the development of the Type 10 battle tank, Type 99 155 mm self-propelled howitzer and Naval artillery.
Financial information[edit]
In fiscal year 2001, Japan Steel Works posted a net loss of ¥1.81 billion on sales of ¥119.70 billion. Their performance improved in 2002, with net profit of ¥100 million on sales of ¥129 billion; however, this was far short of their earlier estimate of ¥600 million net profit on sales of ¥134 billion.[8]
Japan Steel Works Ltd. increased net profit to ¥12.6 billion for the nine months to December 31, 2007. Revenue was up to ¥159.2 billion. Operating profit increased to ¥21.9 billion and ordinary profit rose to ¥21.2 billion. Full-year revenue forecast is unchanged at ¥ 218 billion to March 31, 2008. The company maintained a full-year net profit forecast of ¥15 billion.[9]

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.
