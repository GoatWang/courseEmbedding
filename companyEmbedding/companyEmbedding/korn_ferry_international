If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]
1969-1972[edit]
The firm was founded in 1969 by Lester Korn and Richard Ferry. The two first met in 1962, when they worked for Los Angeles accounting firm—Peat, Marwick, Mitchell.[6] Before leaving to form Korn Ferry, the two made partner at the firm.[6]
Initial public offering in 1972[edit]
In 1972 the firm went public with an IPO and within two years (1974) had acquired all outstanding shares to become private again.[7]
Acquisitions (1973-1991)[edit]
In the 1970s Korn Ferry expanded internationally by a combination of acquiring small to medium-sized enterprises and setting up subsidiaries of Korn Ferry International. An example being the formation of Tokyo, Japan based Korn Ferry International Japan in 1973.[8]
With the opening in 1975 of Korn Ferry International Singapore the company had 41 offices in 20 countries.[9]
Two years later in 1977 acquired the Mexico City firm Hazzard & Associados. The next year in 1978 they opened offices in Malaysia[10] and Hong Kong and acquired the UK firm John Stork. In 1979 they acquired Australian-based Guy Pease Associates.
By 1981, the company was the largest executive search firm in the world, with Lester Korn serving as Chairman and CEO.[11]
In 1987 Korn Ferry opened an office in Bangkok, Thailand with a footprint of 37 offices in fifteen countries servicing around 1,250 client corporations and organizations.[12]
In 1989, the firm's revenues exceeded $100 million equivalent to ($193 million in 2015) for the first time.[13]
Change in leadership (1991)[edit]
On May 10, 1991 Lester Korn retired as chairman with Richard Ferry then president and CEO assuming the additional role of chairman.[13]
Reflective of 1991 executive-recruiting firms' economic outlook in the face of corporate clients successfully arrangements of lower fees, added services without cost, and industry trend of search firms being used less; Richard Ferry implemented cut costs through office closing and redundancies.[14]
Under Richard Ferry, Korn Ferry in 1993 acquired and merged its European operations into Carre Orban and Partners that was branded in Europe as Korn/Ferry Carre/Orban International.
Korn Ferry opened their first office in India (1994), China (1995), Indonesia (1996), and South Korea (1998).[15]
Beginning in 1992 Korn Ferry implemented a video-conferencing system to speed up the screening of job candidates.[16]
In what was reported as increased competition in the management-consulting industry in 1995 Korn Ferry sold its organizational-consulting practice and executive-pay consulting firm.[17]
In 1999 they acquired the German firm Hofman Herbold and separately the Australian firm Amrop International for $3.8M ($5.46 million in 2015)[18] In 2000 acquiring the London based PA Consulting Group for an estimated $35M ($48.7 million in 2015). In 2000 they purchased Boston-based search firm specializing in financial services Westgate Group.[19]
In May 2000 Korn Ferry acquired Pratzer & Partners Inc. a Canada based boutique executive recruiting firms.[20]
Redundancies in the 2001 contraction[edit]
Amongst an executive-search industry contraction during 2000 Korn Ferry's 2001 redundancies were "more dramatic than those of competitors who aren't publicly traded" such as Spencer Stuart and Russell Reynolds Associates. The greater reductions were reported and attributed to having "expanded so heavily during the technology boom" coupled with Korn Ferry's new CEO Paul C. Reilly choosing to "send a message to shareholders."[21]
Acquisitions and diversification (2001-2015)[edit]
In 2001 they purchased Levy Kerson, Helstrom Turner & Associates a search firm specializing in the retail and fashion industry, and Pearson, Caldwell, and Farnworth a search firm specializing in the financial services industry. In 2005 Korn Ferry moved their regional head office to Shanghai, China[15] with a footprint of 73 offices in forty countries. In 2006 Korn Ferry acquired leadership development tools firm Lominger International of Golden Valley for $24M ($28.5 million in 2015) in a move to diversify Korn Ferry's product offerings beyond recruitment.[1]
In 2007 Gary Burnison became CEO and continued the push to expand Korn Ferry from a recruitment centric into a retention-and-development firm that saw in the previous year the acquisition as Lominger International.[1][22][23] Burnison's first such purchase was LeaderSource in 2007; the privately held 25 employee Minneapolis based executive-coaching firm founded in 1986 by Kevin Cashman with 2006 revenues of USD $3.5M ($4.16 million in 2015).[22] In 2008 Korn Ferry acquired Lore International Institute. In June 2009, Korn Ferry acquired the London-based executive search firm Whitehead Mann.[24] In 2010 it acquired Sensa Solutions. In 2013 Korn Ferry completed its acquisition of Minneapolis-based PDI Ninth House, a leading, globally-recognized provider of leadership solutions for $80M.[25] In 2015 Korn Ferry also acquired Pivot Leadership.
Acquisition of Hay Group (2015)[edit]
In September 2015, Korn Ferry acquired Hay Group, one of the most renowned HR consultancies of the globe. As part of the deal, worth a reported $452 million in cash and stock, Korn Ferry will bundle its Leadership and Talent Consulting advisory business with Hay Group, creating a 7,000 man strong human capital advisor. The move to acquire Hay Group follows its ambitious growth strategy to be the preeminent global people and organisational advisory firm.
Corporate affairs[edit]
As of 2015, Korn Ferry employed 7,000 people worldwide.[4]
Litigation[edit]
In 2005 Korn Ferry accused one of its former star recruiters, David Nosal, stealing confidential client data to establish his own competing firm.[26] In 2008 Nolan was charged under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) noting that he "acted "without authorization" in violation of the law."[27] In 2016 the US court of appeals from the ninth circuit ruled in United States v Nosal in Korn Ferry's favor that Nosal's "activity now constitutes a criminal act, under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)."[27]
Current operations[edit]

Korn Ferry Executive Search[edit]
Korn Ferry assists organizations in attracting, engaging, developing, and retaining their people. Services range from executive recruitment to leadership development programs, enterprise learning, succession planning and recruitment outsourcing. Since the firm's inception, it has conducted over 100,000 senior-level searches,[28] and placed about seventy thousand managers.[29]
In addition to its search services, Korn Ferry publishes surveys of its clients and other employers regarding trends in hiring.[30]
Korn Ferry Hay Group[edit]
The September 2015 purchase of the privately held HR "global management consultancy"[31] Hay Group for $452M expanded the scope of services for clients.[4] The acquisition and expansion redefined the firm from one focused on recruitment to a retention and development firm.[4][31] The Hay Group purchase added 3000 employees on top of Korn Ferry 4,000 resulting in 7,000 headcount.[4]
Korn Ferry Futurestep[edit]
In August 1998,[32] Korn Ferry partnered with the Wall Street Journal to start the internet venture Futurestep.com, which was utilized to help candidates at the middle management level specifically find positions to advance their career.[33][34]
Korn Ferry went public in 1998 to finance Futurestep.com and its digital jobs initiatives to "maintain its industry dominance."[7]
Describing the largest executive search firm in the world as "latecomers are as green as the next start-up" Crain's New York Business reported on Korn Ferry's move into the "ultracompetitive market" of tech recruitment in 1999 with the Korn Ferry launch of the internet venture FuturestepAT.com specifically targeting "advanced technologists," to compete against small boutiques executive search firms such as Redwood Partners and Silicon Alley Connections that have "carved out niches and built strong reputations" focused on technology hires.[32] The nature of the tech field is one "where the skills needed can change dramatically from month to month".[32] Fee structure for FuturestepAT was reported as unchanged from its parent Korn Ferry's "one-third of the first year's salary."[32]
By 2001 Futurestep had been rolled out to 22 countries with worldwide losses of $60 million since beginning in May 1998 with $23M in the nine months to Jan 31, 2001.[35]
Korn Ferry is known for its "headhunting technology".[15]
Corporate structure[edit]

Korn Ferry (NYSE:KFY)Historical Stock Chart
1 Month : From Jun 2017 to Jul 2017



      Korn Ferry (NYSE: KFY) today announced that Angel Martinez has been 
      elected to serve on the Company’s board of directors.
    

      Mr. Martinez brings to Korn Ferry extensive experience in marketing and 
      brand building and has been instrumental in the development and success 
      of many household brands throughout his career.
    

      Mr. Martinez previously served as the President and Chief Executive 
      Officer of Deckers Outdoor Corp. from 2005 until his retirement in 2016. 
      He also currently serves as Chairman of the company, a role he has held 
      since 2008. During his time at the company, he oversaw many global 
      footwear brands including Teva®, UGG® Australia, and HOKA One One®. In 
      2008, he was honored as the "Person of the Year" by Footwear News. Prior 
      to Deckers, Mr. Martinez also held executive positions at Keen, LLC, a 
      performance outdoor footwear company and Reebok International Ltd.
    

      “We are pleased to have Angel join our board of directors,” said Gary D. 
      Burnison, CEO, Korn Ferry. “Angel is a brand building visionary who has 
      made an imprint at several world-class organizations – developing and 
      marketing products enjoyed by millions of consumers across the globe. 
      His knowledge and extensive experience in extending and elevating elite 
      brands will be a great fit for Korn Ferry, as we continue to broaden the 
      scope of our offerings, change the lives of professionals and help our 
      clients drive performance through their people.”
    

      “Angel brings an entrepreneurial spirit, embrace of innovation and 
      impeccable leadership credentials to our board of directors,” said 
      George T. Shaheen, Non-Executive Chairman of Korn Ferry’s Board of 
      Directors. “He has been instrumental in driving growth and shaping the 
      brands at major consumer companies. I’m confident that Angel’s passion 
      and experience in driving transformation will be a great fit for Korn 
      Ferry.”
    

      Today, in addition to serving as Non-Executive Chairman of the Board of 
      Directors for Deckers Outdoor Corp., Mr. Martinez serves on the board of 
      Tupperware.

History[edit]
1969-1972[edit]
The firm was founded in 1969 by Lester Korn and Richard Ferry. The two first met in 1962, when they worked for Los Angeles accounting firm—Peat, Marwick, Mitchell.[6] Before leaving to form Korn Ferry, the two made partner at the firm.[6]
Initial public offering in 1972[edit]
In 1972 the firm went public with an IPO and within two years (1974) had acquired all outstanding shares to become private again.[7]
Acquisitions (1973-1991)[edit]
In the 1970s Korn Ferry expanded internationally by a combination of acquiring small to medium-sized enterprises and setting up subsidiaries of Korn Ferry International. An example being the formation of Tokyo, Japan based Korn Ferry International Japan in 1973.[8]
With the opening in 1975 of Korn Ferry International Singapore the company had 41 offices in 20 countries.[9]
Two years later in 1977 acquired the Mexico City firm Hazzard & Associados. The next year in 1978 they opened offices in Malaysia[10] and Hong Kong and acquired the UK firm John Stork. In 1979 they acquired Australian-based Guy Pease Associates.
By 1981, the company was the largest executive search firm in the world, with Lester Korn serving as Chairman and CEO.[11]
In 1987 Korn Ferry opened an office in Bangkok, Thailand with a footprint of 37 offices in fifteen countries servicing around 1,250 client corporations and organizations.[12]
In 1989, the firm's revenues exceeded $100 million equivalent to ($193 million in 2015) for the first time.[13]
Change in leadership (1991)[edit]
On May 10, 1991 Lester Korn retired as chairman with Richard Ferry then president and CEO assuming the additional role of chairman.[13]
Reflective of 1991 executive-recruiting firms' economic outlook in the face of corporate clients successfully arrangements of lower fees, added services without cost, and industry trend of search firms being used less; Richard Ferry implemented cut costs through office closing and redundancies.[14]
Under Richard Ferry, Korn Ferry in 1993 acquired and merged its European operations into Carre Orban and Partners that was branded in Europe as Korn/Ferry Carre/Orban International.
Korn Ferry opened their first office in India (1994), China (1995), Indonesia (1996), and South Korea (1998).[15]
Beginning in 1992 Korn Ferry implemented a video-conferencing system to speed up the screening of job candidates.[16]
In what was reported as increased competition in the management-consulting industry in 1995 Korn Ferry sold its organizational-consulting practice and executive-pay consulting firm.[17]
In 1999 they acquired the German firm Hofman Herbold and separately the Australian firm Amrop International for $3.8M ($5.46 million in 2015)[18] In 2000 acquiring the London based PA Consulting Group for an estimated $35M ($48.7 million in 2015). In 2000 they purchased Boston-based search firm specializing in financial services Westgate Group.[19]
In May 2000 Korn Ferry acquired Pratzer & Partners Inc. a Canada based boutique executive recruiting firms.[20]
Redundancies in the 2001 contraction[edit]
Amongst an executive-search industry contraction during 2000 Korn Ferry's 2001 redundancies were "more dramatic than those of competitors who aren't publicly traded" such as Spencer Stuart and Russell Reynolds Associates. The greater reductions were reported and attributed to having "expanded so heavily during the technology boom" coupled with Korn Ferry's new CEO Paul C. Reilly choosing to "send a message to shareholders."[21]
Acquisitions and diversification (2001-2015)[edit]
In 2001 they purchased Levy Kerson, Helstrom Turner & Associates a search firm specializing in the retail and fashion industry, and Pearson, Caldwell, and Farnworth a search firm specializing in the financial services industry. In 2005 Korn Ferry moved their regional head office to Shanghai, China[15] with a footprint of 73 offices in forty countries. In 2006 Korn Ferry acquired leadership development tools firm Lominger International of Golden Valley for $24M ($28.5 million in 2015) in a move to diversify Korn Ferry's product offerings beyond recruitment.[1]
In 2007 Gary Burnison became CEO and continued the push to expand Korn Ferry from a recruitment centric into a retention-and-development firm that saw in the previous year the acquisition as Lominger International.[1][22][23] Burnison's first such purchase was LeaderSource in 2007; the privately held 25 employee Minneapolis based executive-coaching firm founded in 1986 by Kevin Cashman with 2006 revenues of USD $3.5M ($4.16 million in 2015).[22] In 2008 Korn Ferry acquired Lore International Institute. In June 2009, Korn Ferry acquired the London-based executive search firm Whitehead Mann.[24] In 2010 it acquired Sensa Solutions. In 2013 Korn Ferry completed its acquisition of Minneapolis-based PDI Ninth House, a leading, globally-recognized provider of leadership solutions for $80M.[25] In 2015 Korn Ferry also acquired Pivot Leadership.
Acquisition of Hay Group (2015)[edit]
In September 2015, Korn Ferry acquired Hay Group, one of the most renowned HR consultancies of the globe. As part of the deal, worth a reported $452 million in cash and stock, Korn Ferry will bundle its Leadership and Talent Consulting advisory business with Hay Group, creating a 7,000 man strong human capital advisor. The move to acquire Hay Group follows its ambitious growth strategy to be the preeminent global people and organisational advisory firm.
Corporate affairs[edit]
As of 2015, Korn Ferry employed 7,000 people worldwide.[4]
Litigation[edit]
In 2005 Korn Ferry accused one of its former star recruiters, David Nosal, stealing confidential client data to establish his own competing firm.[26] In 2008 Nolan was charged under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) noting that he "acted "without authorization" in violation of the law."[27] In 2016 the US court of appeals from the ninth circuit ruled in United States v Nosal in Korn Ferry's favor that Nosal's "activity now constitutes a criminal act, under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)."[27]
Current operations[edit]

Korn Ferry Executive Search[edit]
Korn Ferry assists organizations in attracting, engaging, developing, and retaining their people. Services range from executive recruitment to leadership development programs, enterprise learning, succession planning and recruitment outsourcing. Since the firm's inception, it has conducted over 100,000 senior-level searches,[28] and placed about seventy thousand managers.[29]
In addition to its search services, Korn Ferry publishes surveys of its clients and other employers regarding trends in hiring.[30]
Korn Ferry Hay Group[edit]
The September 2015 purchase of the privately held HR "global management consultancy"[31] Hay Group for $452M expanded the scope of services for clients.[4] The acquisition and expansion redefined the firm from one focused on recruitment to a retention and development firm.[4][31] The Hay Group purchase added 3000 employees on top of Korn Ferry 4,000 resulting in 7,000 headcount.[4]
Korn Ferry Futurestep[edit]
In August 1998,[32] Korn Ferry partnered with the Wall Street Journal to start the internet venture Futurestep.com, which was utilized to help candidates at the middle management level specifically find positions to advance their career.[33][34]
Korn Ferry went public in 1998 to finance Futurestep.com and its digital jobs initiatives to "maintain its industry dominance."[7]
Describing the largest executive search firm in the world as "latecomers are as green as the next start-up" Crain's New York Business reported on Korn Ferry's move into the "ultracompetitive market" of tech recruitment in 1999 with the Korn Ferry launch of the internet venture FuturestepAT.com specifically targeting "advanced technologists," to compete against small boutiques executive search firms such as Redwood Partners and Silicon Alley Connections that have "carved out niches and built strong reputations" focused on technology hires.[32] The nature of the tech field is one "where the skills needed can change dramatically from month to month".[32] Fee structure for FuturestepAT was reported as unchanged from its parent Korn Ferry's "one-third of the first year's salary."[32]
By 2001 Futurestep had been rolled out to 22 countries with worldwide losses of $60 million since beginning in May 1998 with $23M in the nine months to Jan 31, 2001.[35]
Korn Ferry is known for its "headhunting technology".[15]
Corporate structure[edit]
In February 1999 Korn Ferry IPOed on the New York Stock Exchange.
Gary Burnison, a former partner of KPMG, serves as the current CEO.

Beginning in 1992 Korn Ferry implemented a video-conferencing system to speed up the screening of job candidates.[16]
In what was reported as increased competition in the management-consulting industry in 1995 Korn Ferry sold its organizational-consulting practice and executive-pay consulting firm.[17]
In 1999 they acquired the German firm Hofman Herbold and separately the Australian firm Amrop International for $3.8M ($5.46 million in 2015)[18] In 2000 acquiring the London based PA Consulting Group for an estimated $35M ($48.7 million in 2015). In 2000 they purchased Boston-based search firm specializing in financial services Westgate Group.[19]
In May 2000 Korn Ferry acquired Pratzer & Partners Inc. a Canada based boutique executive recruiting firms.[20]
Redundancies in the 2001 contraction[edit]
Amongst an executive-search industry contraction during 2000 Korn Ferry's 2001 redundancies were "more dramatic than those of competitors who aren't publicly traded" such as Spencer Stuart and Russell Reynolds Associates. The greater reductions were reported and attributed to having "expanded so heavily during the technology boom" coupled with Korn Ferry's new CEO Paul C. Reilly choosing to "send a message to shareholders."[21]
Acquisitions and diversification (2001-2015)[edit]
In 2001 they purchased Levy Kerson, Helstrom Turner & Associates a search firm specializing in the retail and fashion industry, and Pearson, Caldwell, and Farnworth a search firm specializing in the financial services industry. In 2005 Korn Ferry moved their regional head office to Shanghai, China[15] with a footprint of 73 offices in forty countries. In 2006 Korn Ferry acquired leadership development tools firm Lominger International of Golden Valley for $24M ($28.5 million in 2015) in a move to diversify Korn Ferry's product offerings beyond recruitment.[1]
In 2007 Gary Burnison became CEO and continued the push to expand Korn Ferry from a recruitment centric into a retention-and-development firm that saw in the previous year the acquisition as Lominger International.[1][22][23] Burnison's first such purchase was LeaderSource in 2007; the privately held 25 employee Minneapolis based executive-coaching firm founded in 1986 by Kevin Cashman with 2006 revenues of USD $3.5M ($4.16 million in 2015).[22] In 2008 Korn Ferry acquired Lore International Institute. In June 2009, Korn Ferry acquired the London-based executive search firm Whitehead Mann.[24] In 2010 it acquired Sensa Solutions. In 2013 Korn Ferry completed its acquisition of Minneapolis-based PDI Ninth House, a leading, globally-recognized provider of leadership solutions for $80M.[25] In 2015 Korn Ferry also acquired Pivot Leadership.
Acquisition of Hay Group (2015)[edit]
In September 2015, Korn Ferry acquired Hay Group, one of the most renowned HR consultancies of the globe. As part of the deal, worth a reported $452 million in cash and stock, Korn Ferry will bundle its Leadership and Talent Consulting advisory business with Hay Group, creating a 7,000 man strong human capital advisor. The move to acquire Hay Group follows its ambitious growth strategy to be the preeminent global people and organisational advisory firm.
Corporate affairs[edit]
As of 2015, Korn Ferry employed 7,000 people worldwide.[4]
Litigation[edit]
In 2005 Korn Ferry accused one of its former star recruiters, David Nosal, stealing confidential client data to establish his own competing firm.[26] In 2008 Nolan was charged under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) noting that he "acted "without authorization" in violation of the law."[27] In 2016 the US court of appeals from the ninth circuit ruled in United States v Nosal in Korn Ferry's favor that Nosal's "activity now constitutes a criminal act, under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)."[27]

Korn Ferry went public in 1998 to finance Futurestep.com and its digital jobs initiatives to "maintain its industry dominance."[7]
Describing the largest executive search firm in the world as "latecomers are as green as the next start-up" Crain's New York Business reported on Korn Ferry's move into the "ultracompetitive market" of tech recruitment in 1999 with the Korn Ferry launch of the internet venture FuturestepAT.com specifically targeting "advanced technologists," to compete against small boutiques executive search firms such as Redwood Partners and Silicon Alley Connections that have "carved out niches and built strong reputations" focused on technology hires.[32] The nature of the tech field is one "where the skills needed can change dramatically from month to month".[32] Fee structure for FuturestepAT was reported as unchanged from its parent Korn Ferry's "one-third of the first year's salary."[32]
By 2001 Futurestep had been rolled out to 22 countries with worldwide losses of $60 million since beginning in May 1998 with $23M in the nine months to Jan 31, 2001.[35]
Korn Ferry is known for its "headhunting technology".[15]

On May 10, 1991 Lester Korn retired as chairman with Richard Ferry then president and CEO assuming the additional role of chairman.[13]

History[edit]
1969-1972[edit]
The firm was founded in 1969 by Lester Korn and Richard Ferry. The two first met in 1962, when they worked for Los Angeles accounting firm—Peat, Marwick, Mitchell.[6] Before leaving to form Korn Ferry, the two made partner at the firm.[6]
Initial public offering in 1972[edit]
In 1972 the firm went public with an IPO and within two years (1974) had acquired all outstanding shares to become private again.[7]
Acquisitions (1973-1991)[edit]
In the 1970s Korn Ferry expanded internationally by a combination of acquiring small to medium-sized enterprises and setting up subsidiaries of Korn Ferry International. An example being the formation of Tokyo, Japan based Korn Ferry International Japan in 1973.[8]
With the opening in 1975 of Korn Ferry International Singapore the company had 41 offices in 20 countries.[9]
Two years later in 1977 acquired the Mexico City firm Hazzard & Associados. The next year in 1978 they opened offices in Malaysia[10] and Hong Kong and acquired the UK firm John Stork. In 1979 they acquired Australian-based Guy Pease Associates.
By 1981, the company was the largest executive search firm in the world, with Lester Korn serving as Chairman and CEO.[11]
In 1987 Korn Ferry opened an office in Bangkok, Thailand with a footprint of 37 offices in fifteen countries servicing around 1,250 client corporations and organizations.[12]
In 1989, the firm's revenues exceeded $100 million equivalent to ($193 million in 2015) for the first time.[13]
Change in leadership (1991)[edit]
On May 10, 1991 Lester Korn retired as chairman with Richard Ferry then president and CEO assuming the additional role of chairman.[13]
Reflective of 1991 executive-recruiting firms' economic outlook in the face of corporate clients successfully arrangements of lower fees, added services without cost, and industry trend of search firms being used less; Richard Ferry implemented cut costs through office closing and redundancies.[14]
Under Richard Ferry, Korn Ferry in 1993 acquired and merged its European operations into Carre Orban and Partners that was branded in Europe as Korn/Ferry Carre/Orban International.
Korn Ferry opened their first office in India (1994), China (1995), Indonesia (1996), and South Korea (1998).[15]
Beginning in 1992 Korn Ferry implemented a video-conferencing system to speed up the screening of job candidates.[16]
In what was reported as increased competition in the management-consulting industry in 1995 Korn Ferry sold its organizational-consulting practice and executive-pay consulting firm.[17]
In 1999 they acquired the German firm Hofman Herbold and separately the Australian firm Amrop International for $3.8M ($5.46 million in 2015)[18] In 2000 acquiring the London based PA Consulting Group for an estimated $35M ($48.7 million in 2015). In 2000 they purchased Boston-based search firm specializing in financial services Westgate Group.[19]
In May 2000 Korn Ferry acquired Pratzer & Partners Inc. a Canada based boutique executive recruiting firms.[20]
Redundancies in the 2001 contraction[edit]
Amongst an executive-search industry contraction during 2000 Korn Ferry's 2001 redundancies were "more dramatic than those of competitors who aren't publicly traded" such as Spencer Stuart and Russell Reynolds Associates. The greater reductions were reported and attributed to having "expanded so heavily during the technology boom" coupled with Korn Ferry's new CEO Paul C. Reilly choosing to "send a message to shareholders."[21]
Acquisitions and diversification (2001-2015)[edit]
In 2001 they purchased Levy Kerson, Helstrom Turner & Associates a search firm specializing in the retail and fashion industry, and Pearson, Caldwell, and Farnworth a search firm specializing in the financial services industry. In 2005 Korn Ferry moved their regional head office to Shanghai, China[15] with a footprint of 73 offices in forty countries. In 2006 Korn Ferry acquired leadership development tools firm Lominger International of Golden Valley for $24M ($28.5 million in 2015) in a move to diversify Korn Ferry's product offerings beyond recruitment.[1]
In 2007 Gary Burnison became CEO and continued the push to expand Korn Ferry from a recruitment centric into a retention-and-development firm that saw in the previous year the acquisition as Lominger International.[1][22][23] Burnison's first such purchase was LeaderSource in 2007; the privately held 25 employee Minneapolis based executive-coaching firm founded in 1986 by Kevin Cashman with 2006 revenues of USD $3.5M ($4.16 million in 2015).[22] In 2008 Korn Ferry acquired Lore International Institute. In June 2009, Korn Ferry acquired the London-based executive search firm Whitehead Mann.[24] In 2010 it acquired Sensa Solutions. In 2013 Korn Ferry completed its acquisition of Minneapolis-based PDI Ninth House, a leading, globally-recognized provider of leadership solutions for $80M.[25] In 2015 Korn Ferry also acquired Pivot Leadership.
Acquisition of Hay Group (2015)[edit]
In September 2015, Korn Ferry acquired Hay Group, one of the most renowned HR consultancies of the globe. As part of the deal, worth a reported $452 million in cash and stock, Korn Ferry will bundle its Leadership and Talent Consulting advisory business with Hay Group, creating a 7,000 man strong human capital advisor. The move to acquire Hay Group follows its ambitious growth strategy to be the preeminent global people and organisational advisory firm.
Corporate affairs[edit]
As of 2015, Korn Ferry employed 7,000 people worldwide.[4]
Litigation[edit]
In 2005 Korn Ferry accused one of its former star recruiters, David Nosal, stealing confidential client data to establish his own competing firm.[26] In 2008 Nolan was charged under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) noting that he "acted "without authorization" in violation of the law."[27] In 2016 the US court of appeals from the ninth circuit ruled in United States v Nosal in Korn Ferry's favor that Nosal's "activity now constitutes a criminal act, under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)."[27]
Current operations[edit]

Korn Ferry Executive Search[edit]
Korn Ferry assists organizations in attracting, engaging, developing, and retaining their people. Services range from executive recruitment to leadership development programs, enterprise learning, succession planning and recruitment outsourcing. Since the firm's inception, it has conducted over 100,000 senior-level searches,[28] and placed about seventy thousand managers.[29]
In addition to its search services, Korn Ferry publishes surveys of its clients and other employers regarding trends in hiring.[30]
Korn Ferry Hay Group[edit]
The September 2015 purchase of the privately held HR "global management consultancy"[31] Hay Group for $452M expanded the scope of services for clients.[4] The acquisition and expansion redefined the firm from one focused on recruitment to a retention and development firm.[4][31] The Hay Group purchase added 3000 employees on top of Korn Ferry 4,000 resulting in 7,000 headcount.[4]
Korn Ferry Futurestep[edit]
In August 1998,[32] Korn Ferry partnered with the Wall Street Journal to start the internet venture Futurestep.com, which was utilized to help candidates at the middle management level specifically find positions to advance their career.[33][34]
Korn Ferry went public in 1998 to finance Futurestep.com and its digital jobs initiatives to "maintain its industry dominance."[7]
Describing the largest executive search firm in the world as "latecomers are as green as the next start-up" Crain's New York Business reported on Korn Ferry's move into the "ultracompetitive market" of tech recruitment in 1999 with the Korn Ferry launch of the internet venture FuturestepAT.com specifically targeting "advanced technologists," to compete against small boutiques executive search firms such as Redwood Partners and Silicon Alley Connections that have "carved out niches and built strong reputations" focused on technology hires.[32] The nature of the tech field is one "where the skills needed can change dramatically from month to month".[32] Fee structure for FuturestepAT was reported as unchanged from its parent Korn Ferry's "one-third of the first year's salary."[32]
By 2001 Futurestep had been rolled out to 22 countries with worldwide losses of $60 million since beginning in May 1998 with $23M in the nine months to Jan 31, 2001.[35]
Korn Ferry is known for its "headhunting technology".[15]
Corporate structure[edit]
In February 1999 Korn Ferry IPOed on the New York Stock Exchange.
Gary Burnison, a former partner of KPMG, serves as the current CEO.

History[edit]
1969-1972[edit]
The firm was founded in 1969 by Lester Korn and Richard Ferry. The two first met in 1962, when they worked for Los Angeles accounting firm—Peat, Marwick, Mitchell.[6] Before leaving to form Korn Ferry, the two made partner at the firm.[6]
Initial public offering in 1972[edit]
In 1972 the firm went public with an IPO and within two years (1974) had acquired all outstanding shares to become private again.[7]
Acquisitions (1973-1991)[edit]
In the 1970s Korn Ferry expanded internationally by a combination of acquiring small to medium-sized enterprises and setting up subsidiaries of Korn Ferry International. An example being the formation of Tokyo, Japan based Korn Ferry International Japan in 1973.[8]
With the opening in 1975 of Korn Ferry International Singapore the company had 41 offices in 20 countries.[9]
Two years later in 1977 acquired the Mexico City firm Hazzard & Associados. The next year in 1978 they opened offices in Malaysia[10] and Hong Kong and acquired the UK firm John Stork. In 1979 they acquired Australian-based Guy Pease Associates.
By 1981, the company was the largest executive search firm in the world, with Lester Korn serving as Chairman and CEO.[11]
In 1987 Korn Ferry opened an office in Bangkok, Thailand with a footprint of 37 offices in fifteen countries servicing around 1,250 client corporations and organizations.[12]
In 1989, the firm's revenues exceeded $100 million equivalent to ($193 million in 2015) for the first time.[13]
Change in leadership (1991)[edit]
On May 10, 1991 Lester Korn retired as chairman with Richard Ferry then president and CEO assuming the additional role of chairman.[13]
Reflective of 1991 executive-recruiting firms' economic outlook in the face of corporate clients successfully arrangements of lower fees, added services without cost, and industry trend of search firms being used less; Richard Ferry implemented cut costs through office closing and redundancies.[14]
Under Richard Ferry, Korn Ferry in 1993 acquired and merged its European operations into Carre Orban and Partners that was branded in Europe as Korn/Ferry Carre/Orban International.
Korn Ferry opened their first office in India (1994), China (1995), Indonesia (1996), and South Korea (1998).[15]
Beginning in 1992 Korn Ferry implemented a video-conferencing system to speed up the screening of job candidates.[16]
In what was reported as increased competition in the management-consulting industry in 1995 Korn Ferry sold its organizational-consulting practice and executive-pay consulting firm.[17]
In 1999 they acquired the German firm Hofman Herbold and separately the Australian firm Amrop International for $3.8M ($5.46 million in 2015)[18] In 2000 acquiring the London based PA Consulting Group for an estimated $35M ($48.7 million in 2015). In 2000 they purchased Boston-based search firm specializing in financial services Westgate Group.[19]
In May 2000 Korn Ferry acquired Pratzer & Partners Inc. a Canada based boutique executive recruiting firms.[20]
Redundancies in the 2001 contraction[edit]
Amongst an executive-search industry contraction during 2000 Korn Ferry's 2001 redundancies were "more dramatic than those of competitors who aren't publicly traded" such as Spencer Stuart and Russell Reynolds Associates. The greater reductions were reported and attributed to having "expanded so heavily during the technology boom" coupled with Korn Ferry's new CEO Paul C. Reilly choosing to "send a message to shareholders."[21]
Acquisitions and diversification (2001-2015)[edit]
In 2001 they purchased Levy Kerson, Helstrom Turner & Associates a search firm specializing in the retail and fashion industry, and Pearson, Caldwell, and Farnworth a search firm specializing in the financial services industry. In 2005 Korn Ferry moved their regional head office to Shanghai, China[15] with a footprint of 73 offices in forty countries. In 2006 Korn Ferry acquired leadership development tools firm Lominger International of Golden Valley for $24M ($28.5 million in 2015) in a move to diversify Korn Ferry's product offerings beyond recruitment.[1]
In 2007 Gary Burnison became CEO and continued the push to expand Korn Ferry from a recruitment centric into a retention-and-development firm that saw in the previous year the acquisition as Lominger International.[1][22][23] Burnison's first such purchase was LeaderSource in 2007; the privately held 25 employee Minneapolis based executive-coaching firm founded in 1986 by Kevin Cashman with 2006 revenues of USD $3.5M ($4.16 million in 2015).[22] In 2008 Korn Ferry acquired Lore International Institute. In June 2009, Korn Ferry acquired the London-based executive search firm Whitehead Mann.[24] In 2010 it acquired Sensa Solutions. In 2013 Korn Ferry completed its acquisition of Minneapolis-based PDI Ninth House, a leading, globally-recognized provider of leadership solutions for $80M.[25] In 2015 Korn Ferry also acquired Pivot Leadership.
Acquisition of Hay Group (2015)[edit]
In September 2015, Korn Ferry acquired Hay Group, one of the most renowned HR consultancies of the globe. As part of the deal, worth a reported $452 million in cash and stock, Korn Ferry will bundle its Leadership and Talent Consulting advisory business with Hay Group, creating a 7,000 man strong human capital advisor. The move to acquire Hay Group follows its ambitious growth strategy to be the preeminent global people and organisational advisory firm.
Corporate affairs[edit]
As of 2015, Korn Ferry employed 7,000 people worldwide.[4]
Litigation[edit]
In 2005 Korn Ferry accused one of its former star recruiters, David Nosal, stealing confidential client data to establish his own competing firm.[26] In 2008 Nolan was charged under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) noting that he "acted "without authorization" in violation of the law."[27] In 2016 the US court of appeals from the ninth circuit ruled in United States v Nosal in Korn Ferry's favor that Nosal's "activity now constitutes a criminal act, under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)."[27]

Korn Ferry Executive Search[edit]
Korn Ferry assists organizations in attracting, engaging, developing, and retaining their people. Services range from executive recruitment to leadership development programs, enterprise learning, succession planning and recruitment outsourcing. Since the firm's inception, it has conducted over 100,000 senior-level searches,[28] and placed about seventy thousand managers.[29]
In addition to its search services, Korn Ferry publishes surveys of its clients and other employers regarding trends in hiring.[30]
Korn Ferry Hay Group[edit]
The September 2015 purchase of the privately held HR "global management consultancy"[31] Hay Group for $452M expanded the scope of services for clients.[4] The acquisition and expansion redefined the firm from one focused on recruitment to a retention and development firm.[4][31] The Hay Group purchase added 3000 employees on top of Korn Ferry 4,000 resulting in 7,000 headcount.[4]
Korn Ferry Futurestep[edit]
In August 1998,[32] Korn Ferry partnered with the Wall Street Journal to start the internet venture Futurestep.com, which was utilized to help candidates at the middle management level specifically find positions to advance their career.[33][34]
Korn Ferry went public in 1998 to finance Futurestep.com and its digital jobs initiatives to "maintain its industry dominance."[7]
Describing the largest executive search firm in the world as "latecomers are as green as the next start-up" Crain's New York Business reported on Korn Ferry's move into the "ultracompetitive market" of tech recruitment in 1999 with the Korn Ferry launch of the internet venture FuturestepAT.com specifically targeting "advanced technologists," to compete against small boutiques executive search firms such as Redwood Partners and Silicon Alley Connections that have "carved out niches and built strong reputations" focused on technology hires.[32] The nature of the tech field is one "where the skills needed can change dramatically from month to month".[32] Fee structure for FuturestepAT was reported as unchanged from its parent Korn Ferry's "one-third of the first year's salary."[32]
By 2001 Futurestep had been rolled out to 22 countries with worldwide losses of $60 million since beginning in May 1998 with $23M in the nine months to Jan 31, 2001.[35]
Korn Ferry is known for its "headhunting technology".[15]
Corporate structure[edit]
In February 1999 Korn Ferry IPOed on the New York Stock Exchange.
Gary Burnison, a former partner of KPMG, serves as the current CEO.

In addition to its search services, Korn Ferry publishes surveys of its clients and other employers regarding trends in hiring.[30]
Korn Ferry Hay Group[edit]
The September 2015 purchase of the privately held HR "global management consultancy"[31] Hay Group for $452M expanded the scope of services for clients.[4] The acquisition and expansion redefined the firm from one focused on recruitment to a retention and development firm.[4][31] The Hay Group purchase added 3000 employees on top of Korn Ferry 4,000 resulting in 7,000 headcount.[4]
Korn Ferry Futurestep[edit]
In August 1998,[32] Korn Ferry partnered with the Wall Street Journal to start the internet venture Futurestep.com, which was utilized to help candidates at the middle management level specifically find positions to advance their career.[33][34]
Korn Ferry went public in 1998 to finance Futurestep.com and its digital jobs initiatives to "maintain its industry dominance."[7]
Describing the largest executive search firm in the world as "latecomers are as green as the next start-up" Crain's New York Business reported on Korn Ferry's move into the "ultracompetitive market" of tech recruitment in 1999 with the Korn Ferry launch of the internet venture FuturestepAT.com specifically targeting "advanced technologists," to compete against small boutiques executive search firms such as Redwood Partners and Silicon Alley Connections that have "carved out niches and built strong reputations" focused on technology hires.[32] The nature of the tech field is one "where the skills needed can change dramatically from month to month".[32] Fee structure for FuturestepAT was reported as unchanged from its parent Korn Ferry's "one-third of the first year's salary."[32]
By 2001 Futurestep had been rolled out to 22 countries with worldwide losses of $60 million since beginning in May 1998 with $23M in the nine months to Jan 31, 2001.[35]
Korn Ferry is known for its "headhunting technology".[15]
Corporate structure[edit]
In February 1999 Korn Ferry IPOed on the New York Stock Exchange.
Gary Burnison, a former partner of KPMG, serves as the current CEO.

History[edit]
1969-1972[edit]
The firm was founded in 1969 by Lester Korn and Richard Ferry. The two first met in 1962, when they worked for Los Angeles accounting firm—Peat, Marwick, Mitchell.[6] Before leaving to form Korn Ferry, the two made partner at the firm.[6]
Initial public offering in 1972[edit]
In 1972 the firm went public with an IPO and within two years (1974) had acquired all outstanding shares to become private again.[7]
Acquisitions (1973-1991)[edit]
In the 1970s Korn Ferry expanded internationally by a combination of acquiring small to medium-sized enterprises and setting up subsidiaries of Korn Ferry International. An example being the formation of Tokyo, Japan based Korn Ferry International Japan in 1973.[8]
With the opening in 1975 of Korn Ferry International Singapore the company had 41 offices in 20 countries.[9]
Two years later in 1977 acquired the Mexico City firm Hazzard & Associados. The next year in 1978 they opened offices in Malaysia[10] and Hong Kong and acquired the UK firm John Stork. In 1979 they acquired Australian-based Guy Pease Associates.
By 1981, the company was the largest executive search firm in the world, with Lester Korn serving as Chairman and CEO.[11]
In 1987 Korn Ferry opened an office in Bangkok, Thailand with a footprint of 37 offices in fifteen countries servicing around 1,250 client corporations and organizations.[12]
In 1989, the firm's revenues exceeded $100 million equivalent to ($193 million in 2015) for the first time.[13]
Change in leadership (1991)[edit]
On May 10, 1991 Lester Korn retired as chairman with Richard Ferry then president and CEO assuming the additional role of chairman.[13]
Reflective of 1991 executive-recruiting firms' economic outlook in the face of corporate clients successfully arrangements of lower fees, added services without cost, and industry trend of search firms being used less; Richard Ferry implemented cut costs through office closing and redundancies.[14]
Under Richard Ferry, Korn Ferry in 1993 acquired and merged its European operations into Carre Orban and Partners that was branded in Europe as Korn/Ferry Carre/Orban International.
Korn Ferry opened their first office in India (1994), China (1995), Indonesia (1996), and South Korea (1998).[15]
Beginning in 1992 Korn Ferry implemented a video-conferencing system to speed up the screening of job candidates.[16]
In what was reported as increased competition in the management-consulting industry in 1995 Korn Ferry sold its organizational-consulting practice and executive-pay consulting firm.[17]
In 1999 they acquired the German firm Hofman Herbold and separately the Australian firm Amrop International for $3.8M ($5.46 million in 2015)[18] In 2000 acquiring the London based PA Consulting Group for an estimated $35M ($48.7 million in 2015). In 2000 they purchased Boston-based search firm specializing in financial services Westgate Group.[19]
In May 2000 Korn Ferry acquired Pratzer & Partners Inc. a Canada based boutique executive recruiting firms.[20]
Redundancies in the 2001 contraction[edit]
Amongst an executive-search industry contraction during 2000 Korn Ferry's 2001 redundancies were "more dramatic than those of competitors who aren't publicly traded" such as Spencer Stuart and Russell Reynolds Associates. The greater reductions were reported and attributed to having "expanded so heavily during the technology boom" coupled with Korn Ferry's new CEO Paul C. Reilly choosing to "send a message to shareholders."[21]
Acquisitions and diversification (2001-2015)[edit]
In 2001 they purchased Levy Kerson, Helstrom Turner & Associates a search firm specializing in the retail and fashion industry, and Pearson, Caldwell, and Farnworth a search firm specializing in the financial services industry. In 2005 Korn Ferry moved their regional head office to Shanghai, China[15] with a footprint of 73 offices in forty countries. In 2006 Korn Ferry acquired leadership development tools firm Lominger International of Golden Valley for $24M ($28.5 million in 2015) in a move to diversify Korn Ferry's product offerings beyond recruitment.[1]
In 2007 Gary Burnison became CEO and continued the push to expand Korn Ferry from a recruitment centric into a retention-and-development firm that saw in the previous year the acquisition as Lominger International.[1][22][23] Burnison's first such purchase was LeaderSource in 2007; the privately held 25 employee Minneapolis based executive-coaching firm founded in 1986 by Kevin Cashman with 2006 revenues of USD $3.5M ($4.16 million in 2015).[22] In 2008 Korn Ferry acquired Lore International Institute. In June 2009, Korn Ferry acquired the London-based executive search firm Whitehead Mann.[24] In 2010 it acquired Sensa Solutions. In 2013 Korn Ferry completed its acquisition of Minneapolis-based PDI Ninth House, a leading, globally-recognized provider of leadership solutions for $80M.[25] In 2015 Korn Ferry also acquired Pivot Leadership.
Acquisition of Hay Group (2015)[edit]
In September 2015, Korn Ferry acquired Hay Group, one of the most renowned HR consultancies of the globe. As part of the deal, worth a reported $452 million in cash and stock, Korn Ferry will bundle its Leadership and Talent Consulting advisory business with Hay Group, creating a 7,000 man strong human capital advisor. The move to acquire Hay Group follows its ambitious growth strategy to be the preeminent global people and organisational advisory firm.
Corporate affairs[edit]
As of 2015, Korn Ferry employed 7,000 people worldwide.[4]
Litigation[edit]
In 2005 Korn Ferry accused one of its former star recruiters, David Nosal, stealing confidential client data to establish his own competing firm.[26] In 2008 Nolan was charged under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) noting that he "acted "without authorization" in violation of the law."[27] In 2016 the US court of appeals from the ninth circuit ruled in United States v Nosal in Korn Ferry's favor that Nosal's "activity now constitutes a criminal act, under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)."[27]

Korn Ferry Hay Group[edit]
The September 2015 purchase of the privately held HR "global management consultancy"[31] Hay Group for $452M expanded the scope of services for clients.[4] The acquisition and expansion redefined the firm from one focused on recruitment to a retention and development firm.[4][31] The Hay Group purchase added 3000 employees on top of Korn Ferry 4,000 resulting in 7,000 headcount.[4]
Korn Ferry Futurestep[edit]
In August 1998,[32] Korn Ferry partnered with the Wall Street Journal to start the internet venture Futurestep.com, which was utilized to help candidates at the middle management level specifically find positions to advance their career.[33][34]
Korn Ferry went public in 1998 to finance Futurestep.com and its digital jobs initiatives to "maintain its industry dominance."[7]
Describing the largest executive search firm in the world as "latecomers are as green as the next start-up" Crain's New York Business reported on Korn Ferry's move into the "ultracompetitive market" of tech recruitment in 1999 with the Korn Ferry launch of the internet venture FuturestepAT.com specifically targeting "advanced technologists," to compete against small boutiques executive search firms such as Redwood Partners and Silicon Alley Connections that have "carved out niches and built strong reputations" focused on technology hires.[32] The nature of the tech field is one "where the skills needed can change dramatically from month to month".[32] Fee structure for FuturestepAT was reported as unchanged from its parent Korn Ferry's "one-third of the first year's salary."[32]

Korn Ferry (NYSE:KFY)Historical Stock Chart
1 Month : From Jun 2017 to Jul 2017



      Korn Ferry (NYSE: KFY) today announced that Angel Martinez has been 
      elected to serve on the Company’s board of directors.
    

      Mr. Martinez brings to Korn Ferry extensive experience in marketing and 
      brand building and has been instrumental in the development and success 
      of many household brands throughout his career.
    

      Mr. Martinez previously served as the President and Chief Executive 
      Officer of Deckers Outdoor Corp. from 2005 until his retirement in 2016. 
      He also currently serves as Chairman of the company, a role he has held 
      since 2008. During his time at the company, he oversaw many global 
      footwear brands including Teva®, UGG® Australia, and HOKA One One®. In 
      2008, he was honored as the "Person of the Year" by Footwear News. Prior 
      to Deckers, Mr. Martinez also held executive positions at Keen, LLC, a 
      performance outdoor footwear company and Reebok International Ltd.
    

      “We are pleased to have Angel join our board of directors,” said Gary D. 
      Burnison, CEO, Korn Ferry. “Angel is a brand building visionary who has 
      made an imprint at several world-class organizations – developing and 
      marketing products enjoyed by millions of consumers across the globe. 
      His knowledge and extensive experience in extending and elevating elite 
      brands will be a great fit for Korn Ferry, as we continue to broaden the 
      scope of our offerings, change the lives of professionals and help our 
      clients drive performance through their people.”
    

      “Angel brings an entrepreneurial spirit, embrace of innovation and 
      impeccable leadership credentials to our board of directors,” said 
      George T. Shaheen, Non-Executive Chairman of Korn Ferry’s Board of 
      Directors. “He has been instrumental in driving growth and shaping the 
      brands at major consumer companies. I’m confident that Angel’s passion 
      and experience in driving transformation will be a great fit for Korn 
      Ferry.”
    

      Today, in addition to serving as Non-Executive Chairman of the Board of 
      Directors for Deckers Outdoor Corp., Mr. Martinez serves on the board of 
      Tupperware.

RainKing only profiles those in Los Angeles. The company has restructured its technology staff in recent years because of the increased interaction between internal IT and product-side technology as the company becomes more online-centric.

The Vice President and Chief Technology Architect helps set strategy for the whole division. For enterprise resource planning (ERP) the company relies primarily on a host of SAP modules, including financial systems, accounting, and HRIS functions. Database Operations plays a key role within the department.

The Digital Strategy team, separate from IT, leads the company’s online and mobility efforts, which include tablet capabilities. This team also oversees some internal communications methods.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
