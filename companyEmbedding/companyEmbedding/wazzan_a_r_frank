			Dr. Wazzan has served as a director of Maxim Integrated since 1990. Dr. Wazzan is Distinguished Professor and Dean Emeritus of the School of Engineering and Applied Science, University of California, Los Angeles. Dr. Wazzan has served as consultant (classified work) to Douglas Aircraft, Hughes Electrodynamics, North American Rockwell, the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission, Westinghouse Oceanics Division, Honeywell, Electricite de France (EDF), the French Atomic Energy Commission, and the Rand Corporation. Over that period, the U.S. Department of Defense granted Dr. Wazzan secret, top secret, and critical nuclear weapon design and information clearances to work on the design of underwater weapon systems, the effect of nuclear radiation on the performance of electronic materials and communication satellites, and methods of hardening boosters and satellites to laser and microwave weapons. Dr. Wazzan is a member of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, a Guggenheim Fellow, and a Fellow of the American Nuclear Society. He is recipient of the Gold Medal Award at the First International Meeting on Nuclear Power Plants in Commercial Operations. Dr. Wazzan served as a member of the U.S. White Team (Major General John C. Toomay, Chair) to develop the U.S. space-based laser-weapons program. He was one of thirteen national delegates representing the U.S. at the First CSNI specialists meeting on the behavior of PWR fuel elements under accident conditions (sponsored by OECD, European Nuclear Energy Agency and the International Atomic Energy Agency). Dr. Wazzan served as scientific secretary at the First European Nuclear Conference in Paris, France. He was also a Founding Member of the University of California Industry-University Cooperative Research Program (UC- IUCRP).

 

In nominating Dr. Wazzan to serve on the board, the Governance Committee considered as important factors, among other items, Dr. Wazzan's relevant academic experience, including his experience as Distinguished Professor and Dean Emeritus of a major university's engineering school, his long-standing service on Maxim Integrated's board and his expertise and familiarity with executive compensation matters.

A.R. Frank Wazzan, Dean

 A.R. Frank Wazzan
Dean (1987 to present)



A. R. Frank Wazzan was named Dean of the School of Engineering
and Applied Science in 1987 after serving more than 25 years as
a faculty member.  At that time, Chancellor Charles Young
praised Wazzan as "a man with outstanding professional and
leadership credentials and a seasoned administrator, able to
lead the engineering School into an era of rising enrollments
and immense technological change."  Even in the face of budget
cuts in the 1990s, Dean Wazzan has done just that.  His role in
continually increasing the School's research funding has
propelled the School to a position of excellence: in 1995, it is
perhaps the fastest growing school of engineering in the nation
with more than $40 million in private and public grants.


As associate and assistant dean, Wazzan was instrumental in
gaining academic recognition of the School, and the national
accreditation of the School's programs.  His personal efforts in
the planning and completion of the Engineering IV building
enabled the state of the art facility to open in 1990, doubling
the School's available space.  Frank Wazzan is a triple alumnus
of the University of California, Berkeley, which between 1959
and 1963 awarded him a bachelor's degree in chemical
engineering, a master's in mechanical engineering and aeronautic
sciences, and a doctorate in engineering science.


He is internationally recognized for his research in the areas
of nuclear material, thermal hydraulics, and stability of
laminar flows.  He also was recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship
at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark for studies of
magnetic interaction in solids.  His research has had
significant impact on the design of high performance underwater
weapons systems for the U.S. Navy, and on the operation of
pressurized water nuclear reactors for commercial applications.


Dean Wazzan and his wife Jocelyne are Westwood residents and
parents of Paul and Natasha.
