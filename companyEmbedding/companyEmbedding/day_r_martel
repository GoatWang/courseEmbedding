Martel Day is the founder and principal of NLR Advisory Services. With almost 30 years of experience in the direct investment industry, Martel, through NLR Advisory Services, works with Non-Listed REIT sponsors to realize their potential for success.

While at RAIT he served in various capacities including Chief Executive Officer and Manager of Independence Realty Securities, LLC; President and Manager of Independence Realty Advisor, LLC; and Executive Vice President of Independence Realty Trust, Inc.
Prior to joining RAIT, Martel enjoyed an extensive career with the Inland Group of Companies (Inland). He joined Inland in 1984 as a Regional Representative. During his 25 years with Inland he served as Regional Vice President; Senior Vice President - National Sales and Marketing; and Executive Vice President - Director of Business Development.
