(1) Any line item amounts not expended completely shall be held in reserve as 
    general working capital and subject to reallocation to other line item 
    expenditures as required for ongoing operations.              

The minimum amount of proceeds required to have an operating business for the
next twelve (12) months is $50,000. In addition, to cover public reporting fees
such as professional fees, legal fees, accounting, auditing and filling fees we
would need to raise a minimum of $85,000.
 
If no shares are sold in this Offering, the Company will not be able to continue
its operations through the 4th quarter of 2016 unless we receive additional
funds from the current officer or obtain outside financing.
 
If we raise less than 25% of our Offering, we plan to proceed with our business
plan as stated. We will likely resort to borrowing funds from our director or
selling additional common stock. However, we cannot guarantee that Ms. Lopera
will be in a position to make any such loan to our Company. If we are unable to
raise a minimum of $85,000 from this Offering and/or obtain such minimum amount
in combination with other potential sources of equity and/or debt financing on a
timely basis, we will only be able to maintain minimal operations and will not
be able to expand our business. We do not have any arrangements to sell
additional shares at this time other than the proceeds from this offering.

In the event that we raise at least $86,750 of  Net Proceeds from the sale of
shares in this Offering (i.e., 25% of the shares being offered are sold), during
the next twelve (12) months, we will be able to have an operating business with
one (1) restaurant location and meet our minimum public company reporting
requirements. We will allocate $35,000 to cover our public reporting
requirements, including legal and accounting fees, $16,000 for the development
of our ordering website and the balance of $ 35,750 shall be allocated to
general working capital.
          
If 50% of the Offering is sold, we will use the Net Proceeds of $180,500 to
cover the current reporting fees, including legal and accounting. In addition,
we will open the 2nd restaurant location.
 
If 75% of the Offering is sold, we will use the Net Proceeds of $ 274,250 to
cover the current reporting fees such as legal and accounting. In addition the
company will open the 2nd  location  and the production kitchen and the balance
of $14,250 shall be allocated to general working capital.
 
If 100% of the Offering is sold, we will use the Net Proceeds of $368,000
towards the opening of our 2nd restaurant location with the combined production
kitchen or the “Hub & Spoke” facility where we will produce and bottle our Cold
Press juices and Smoothies for delivery to our restaurant locations and various
gyms and outlets that our within range of the facility. We will be able to open
the 3rd location which will be located in a shopping center or mall which will
be our “food court” type of restaurant location along with our online ordering
website. In addition we will have enough funds to keep current in our public
reporting obligations such as professional fees, legal fees, accounting,
auditing and filling fees.  If we raise the full amount from this Offering, we
will be able to execute the projected business model described in the offering.
 
If we require additional funding, we will seek such funds from Ms. Lopera,
and/or her friends, family, and business acquaintances in order to continue
operations. As with any form of financing, there are uncertainties concerning
the availability of such funds, and the likelihood that such funds will be
available to the Company on acceptable terms since the Company has not received
any firm commitments or indications of interest from the friends, family
members, or business acquaintances of our officer and director regarding
potential investments in the Company.


Currently throughout Latin America the fitness market is exploding and companies
that offer a healthy alternative are growing, but they have not penetrated the
market like that in the United States. The demand for a healthy, low cost, full
menu offering is extremely high and the low labor costs make this a very
attractive sector to enter into and grow very rapidly.


Company Description
We are a growing Latin American fusion restaurant concept that delivers fast
nutritious healthy food combined with Cold Press juices and Smoothies. We
entered into a 3 year lease agreement for our first location at Balboa Boutiques
in Panama City, Panama in 2014 and after 1 year of construction we


 opened for
business in July of 2015. We deliver a full service menu that is low in
carbohydrates, sodium and with all natural super food ingredients for an
affordable price tailored for the customer on the go, but looking for a
nutritious meal. Inspired by Latin nutritionist and Best Selling author of the
book “RETA TU VIDA” Jose Fernandez, the menu includes Vegan Friendly dishes,
vegetarian as well as fresh fish, chicken and steak to serve the average
customer who is looking for a healthy alternative. We source foods from local
organic growers and deliver healthy cuisine using only fresh products and
deliver a never-frozen menu. The restaurant does not come equipped with a
freezer and that fact is advertised to our customers. We offer a contemporary
and comfortable atmosphere with an open grill and salad bar so customers can
watch as the food is prepared. We opened our first location in Panama City, and
we project to have at least fifteen (15) company-owned locations open and
operating within the next three (3) years. We are targeting Panama, Colombia and
Miami Florida. The fitness market is exploding in Latin America and we will open
the first ten (10) company-owned locations in Panama and Colombia to take
advantage of areas that has less competition and lower cost to open than the
United States market, but still has a high demand for a nutritious, healthy, low
sodium and carbohydrate, super food menu delivered at an affordable price.
