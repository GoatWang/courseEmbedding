          Product introduction accelerated due to successful customer product trials with SweeGen's Bestevia™ Reb-M Sweetener

RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA, California, April 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- SweeGen Inc., a nature based sweetener company, today announced that a major global food and beverage company has started production of a new consumer product using SweeGen's Bestevia™ Reb-M sweetener. After successfully completing all product trials in March 2017, the customer decided to accelerate the introduction of Bestevia™ Reb-M sweetener into the current production runs to meet its planned product launch later this year. 








SweeGen's BESTEVIA™ Reb-M sweetener is a non-caloric and high purity stevia sweetener with a clean, sweet, sugar-like taste. Starting with the stevia leaf, a proprietary production pathway is used to produce the stevia Reb M sweetener. The global consumer demand is increasing for healthy alternatives to sugar and artificial sweeteners without sacrificing taste. SweeGen's Bestevia™ Reb-M sweetener is the obvious choice for food and beverage manufacturers, as well as consumers, to satisfy this demand.
SweeGen started commercializing its Bestevia™ Reb-M sweetener in January 2017 and has received the U.S. FDA no-objection letter as well as approval for use in Canada. Regulatory approval in nine countries is expected by the end of 2017, with the majority of the remaining global approvals expected in 2018. 
ABOUT SWEEGEN SweeGen (OTC: SWEE) is dedicated to the development, production and distribution of non-caloric, non-GMO sweeteners for the food, flavor and beverage industries. SweeGen's robust product pipeline, intellectual property portfolio, and dedicated manufacturing capacity and R&D provide the Company its foundation for innovation and delivery of high-quality sweetener products. For more information please contact info@sweegen.com and visit SweeGen's website, www.sweegen.com. Ingredion is SweeGen's exclusive distribution partner outside of China, and excluding SweeGen's House Accounts.

RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA, Calif., Feb. 21, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- SweeGen, Inc. announced today the successful commercialization of its Bestevia™ Reb-M, the company's non-caloric and high purity stevia sweetener with an unparalleled, clean, sweet taste, which is comparable to regular table sugar. Customer feedback on the product has been exceptional, which includes a major global beverage company that recently used SweeGen's Bestevia™ Reb-M in its large-scale trial for one of its bottled beverages.








SweeGen's Bestevia™ Reb-M, is the first sweetener of its type to be made commercially available via bioconversion. As the global demand for sugar continues to increase while production decreases, and companies are faced with a tax on high-sugar products, SweeGen's Bestevia™ Reb-M produced through enzymatic conversion becomes the obvious choice for food and beverage manufacturers, as well as consumers. 
The production of SweeGen's Bestevia™ Reb-M uses proprietary and patent-pending bioconversion technologies utilizing natural steviol glycosides derived from the stevia leaf to achieve a high-quality sweetener that is well suited for food and beverage applications. With expected and upcoming regulatory compliance in major markets, competitive pricing, a superior taste profile and high purity, SweeGen's Bestevia™ Reb-M is clearly set apart from the competition and establishes a new standard for the sweetener industry.
About SweeGen
SweeGen is dedicated to the development, production and distribution of non-caloric, non-GMO sweeteners for the food, flavor and beverage industries.  SweeGen's robust product pipeline, intellectual property portfolio, and dedicated manufacturing capacity and R&D provide the Company its foundation for innovation and delivery of high-quality sweetener products.

SweeGen's Bestevia™ Reb-M Sweetener Is Used In Production Of A Leading Global Food & Beverage Company's New Product









PR Newswire




Apr 25, 2017 8:00 AM EDT













 
















































  RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA, California, April 25, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- SweeGen Inc., a nature based sweetener company, today announced that a major global food and beverage company has started production of a new consumer product using SweeGen's Bestevia™ Reb-M sweetener. After successfully completing all product trials in March 2017, the customer decided to accelerate the introduction of Bestevia™ Reb-M sweetener into the current production runs to meet its planned product launch later this year.     SweeGen's BESTEVIA™ Reb-M sweetener is a non-caloric and high purity stevia sweetener with a clean, sweet, sugar-like taste. Starting with the stevia leaf, a proprietary production pathway is used to produce the stevia Reb M sweetener. The global consumer demand is increasing for healthy alternatives to sugar and artificial sweeteners without sacrificing taste. SweeGen's Bestevia™ Reb-M sweetener is the obvious choice for food and beverage manufacturers, as well as consumers, to satisfy this demand. SweeGen started commercializing its Bestevia™ Reb-M sweetener in January 2017 and has received the U.S. FDA no-objection letter as well as approval for use in Canada. Regulatory approval in nine countries is expected by the end of 2017, with the majority of the remaining global approvals expected in 2018.  ABOUT SWEEGEN SweeGen (OTC: SWEE) is dedicated to the development, production and distribution of non-caloric, non-GMO sweeteners for the food, flavor and beverage industries.

Next Generation Stevia Sweeteners
The demand for sugar continues to grow while production of sugar is declining. Artificial sweeteners continue to create controversies and concern among consumers about the direct relationship between weight gain and their use in foods and beverages. At this time there is a need for sustainable production of non-caloric sweeteners based on consumer demand for natural ingredients world-wide. Stevia sweeteners derived from stevia, high-purity Reb-A and Steviol Glycosides 95% are growing in acceptance and demand. These sweet compounds, first generation stevia sweeteners, are the most abundant in the stevia leaf and therefore can be easily produced by extraction. But the real potential lies in Natural Next Generation Sweeteners for use in food products and beverages. These high-intensity stevia sweeteners are a better choice than artificial sweeteners for safety reasons as well as sustainability.
Reb M, Reb D, and other steviol glycosides, exist only in extremely low concentration in stevia leaves. The cost of extracting these rare compounds is very high and not commercially feasible because the high price of Reb M, Reb D, produced by extraction, limits drastically the potential usage of these stevia sweeteners in food and beverage.
The answer to this problem is manufacture by bioconversion, more specifically, our unique manufacturing process; a combination of science, engineering, bioconversion and purification processes developed by our team of scientists and engineers to produce Natural Next Generation Sweeteners that meet Non-GMO regulatory compliance, as well as “naturalness” in the US and Europe and offer these ingredients at prices comparable to the price of sugar based on sweetness capacity.

Nature based proprietary process
Our process begins with the extraction of naturally occurring sweet compounds, called Steviol Glycosides, from Stevia leaves. Enzymes are used to increase the amount of the preferred, best tasting components, which are then isolated and purified. The molecules produced (Reb-M, Reb-D or any other targeted steviol glycoside) are identical to those found in nature, as confirmed using isotopic analytical methods. The result is great tasting, next generation sweeteners for use food and beverage products which delight the global consumer.

Environmentally friendly and sustainable stevia technology
We start our process with sustainably sourced stevia leaves and enzymes and, through our bioconversion technology, produce a range of stevia sweeteners with assured quality, regulatory compliance and competitive prices. Plus, we support thousands of farmers by utilizing their stevia leaves. Our goal is to combine the best of what nature offers for enhanced results – and to maintain the integrity of the original components, ensuring sustainable production and regulatory compliance.
The Advantages of Our Platform
Our expertise in manufacturing and investment in technology and science has given our team a strong advantage in the market.

Unique IP, a proprietary manufacturing process with several granted and pending patents.
Regulatory compliance
Highly efficient manufacturing process that ensures sustained availability, consistent quality and a competitive pricing.
Vertical integration, large capacity and food grade GMP facilities that ensure continuous production and quality standards.

Our Intellectual Property
Our exclusive license agreement in the sweetener space with R&D powerhouse CONAGEN (www.conagen-inc.com) allows us to always be a step ahead of the competition. Conagen is based in Boston, MA and employs some of the best scientists from MIT, Harvard and other world renowned universities. The research and development teams specialize in strain development and scale up for commercial use.

Our exclusive licensing agreement allows us to produce other steviol glycosides, that are naturally found in the stevia leaf. Each molecule offers different characteristics like taste, mouthfeel and solubility.
With many issued and pending patents, along with many trade secrets, we have formed a solid foundation for the commercial production of next generation sweeteners.
