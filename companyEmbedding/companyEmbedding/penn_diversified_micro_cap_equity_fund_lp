Diversifier II Annuity



The numbers below assume a $10,000 hypothetical investment without any optional riders or contingent deferred sales charges included for contract form DV-790. Had these been included, performance values would be lower. Performance is however net of fund expenses, product charges and the $30 annual administration charge.
The performance data quoted represents past performance and is not predictive of future results. The investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. 
These returns assume that the investment portfolios were available under the contract since their respective inception dates. The inception date represents the date on which the underlying investment option commenced investment operations.

Investors should carefully consider the objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the relevant variable annuity product and underlying investment options prior to investing.  Please read the prospectus carefully as it contains this and other pertinent information specific to the product being presented.  A prospectus may be obtained from your Penn Mutual financial professional or from the Prospectus & Statement of Additional Information page.
Penn Mutual variable products are offered through  Hornor, Townsend & Kent, Inc. (HTK), Registered Investment Advisor, Member FINRA/SIPC, 600 Dresher Road, Horsham, PA  19044, 215-957-7300. HTK is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company.
Investments in the small capitalization sector of the financial markets may be subject to increased volatility or risk due to the size, experience, and information available on any such companies. International investing involves certain risks, including political and economic uncertainties, in addition to currency price fluctuations not inherent in domestic investing. REITs involve risks such as refinancing, economic impact on industry, changes in property values, dependency on management skills, and risks similar to small company investing. Investing in higher yielding, lower-rated corporate bonds has a greater risk of price fluctuations and loss of principal and income than U.S. Government Securities. Investment in a money market is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency, and although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in these funds. Fund shares are not insured and their value and yield will vary with market conditions. The S&P 500 Index is an unmanaged index of common stock performance, considered to be representative of the stock market in general. Indexes do not have sales charges and it is not possible to invest directly in an index.

Investment Team



Penn Capital's research process involves a well defined meeting structure to develop consensus on all ideas. Each investment style is directed by a style portfolio manager who drives the decision making of their respective portfolios.
All members of the portfolio team (Portfolio Managers and Analysts) are responsible for maintenance research and idea generation within their areas of expertise. Research responsibilities are divided by Sector. Portfolio Managers' and Analysts' conduct a Complete Capital Structure Analysis® on the companies they follow, identify the best relative value within the capital structure (debt or equity), and bring their ideas to the team for consideration. The best of those ideas are reviewed by the style portfolio manager, who evaluates how to apply those that closely align with core business strategies.
