Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.

WHO ARE WE? 

    Viking acquires title to properties through tax sales.  The properties shown on this website are "matured".  That is, generally speaking, the period of time allowed for prior owners to redeem their property from the tax sale has ended.  In all cases we have made attempts to return title to the prior owner. That is our first priority, always.   
    However, for many reasons, prior owners may choose to not redeem their properties.  In that event, our company is awarded ownership (via the tax deed) to the property.  We offer these properties for sale to individuals and investors.  
    We think you will find some exceptional real estate bargains on this website.  If you don't agree, make us an offer. 
    IF YOU ARE NEW TO TAX DEED PROPERTY -  please click on "Buying Tax Deed Properties" to the left.  Then click "First Time Buyer of Tax Deed Properties?"
 
Our Mission Statement
Viking Investments serves local communities by:
Providing operating revenue to counties through the purchase of real property tax liens.
Enforcing and operating within the laws set in place to protect the greater good of the community.
Cleaning up neighborhoods by selling abandoned / blighted properties to owners who will fix, clean and occupy them.
Providing affordable opportunities for homeownership.
 
Owner/Agent Notice -  Viking Investments has an ownship interest, in whole or in partnership, in all properties shown on this website.  Viking is not a real estate broker and does not act as such.  Viking and its affiliates are offering these properties as owner and not as agent.    
 
 
We strive to keep these lists current by updating the website regularly, but properties sell and prices can change at any time.  Please feel free to give us a call or send an email regarding your interest in any property.
Properties are subject to prior sale.     
Prices are subject to change. 

  
 
 So please, have a look around, and contact us with any questions you might have about the market or our services. No question is too mundane - we want to help!

Viking Investments Group, Inc. Decides to Enter the $6.3 Billion Dollar Online Social Gaming Market in China

Oct 16, 2012, 08:45 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Viking Investments Group, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


NEW YORK and SHANGHAI, Oct. 16, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Viking Investments Group, Inc. (OTCQB: VKIN), ("VIKING" and/or the "Company") today announced that after a three months study, it has decided to enter the online social gaming market in China. 
Pursuant to Niko Partners, www.nikopartners.com, a leader in Asian Games Market Intelligence, the Chinese market revenue of browser-based games will grow 41% in 2012. The 2011 mainland Chinese online games market size, including Social Networking Services ("SNS") games, was $7.0 billion, up 46% from 2010. Excluding SNS games, online games revenue reached $6.3 billion. Niko projects fast growth in mobile games revenue in China led by the rising adoption of 3G usage, soaring sales of smartphones from a wide array of vendors, and the desire to play entertaining, inexpensive games on these smart mobile devices. Cosmas Hanson, managing partner of Niko said: "The Chinese mobile game market has no clear dominant company yet. Social casual games are popular now, while mobile hardcore games are just getting started."
Online gaming in the People's Republic of China represents one of the largest and fastest growing Internet business sectors in the country. With an estimated 513 million Internet users currently active in the PRC, the country now has the largest online user base in world, of which two-thirds engage in online game play. The average online gamer in China is relatively young (18 to 30 years old), male, and has at least completed a secondary level of education. Demographically the online gaming user base in China is very similar to base of China Internet users, most of whom live in larger cities. China is now the world's largest online gaming market, contributing one-third to the global revenue in this sector in 2009, or 56 percent of the Asia Pacific total.
Says Tom Simeo, Chairman of Viking Investments, "We believe our unique gaming approach will appeal to 513 million Chinese Internet users, and we hope to capture a fraction of this multibillion dollar market. To make an impact at an early stage, Viking Investments is partnering up with some of the best in the industry. Supported platforms for our games will be iPhone, Android, Windows and iMac. Stay tuned for additional information related to the launch of our first Chinese Internet business."

In preparing the management's discussion and analysis, the registrant presumes that you have read or have access to the discussion and analysis for the preceding fiscal year.  SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS  This document includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended or the Reform Act. All statements other than statements of historical fact are "forward-looking statements" for purposes of federal and state securities laws, including, but not limited to, any projections of earning, revenue or other financial items; any statements of the plans, strategies and objectives of management for future operations; any statements concerning proposed new services or developments; any statements regarding future economic conditions of performance; and statements of belief; and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of the Company to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Such factors include, among others, the following: the Company's ability to raise capital and the terms thereof; and other factors referenced in the Form 10-K.  The use in this Form 10-K of such words as "believes", "plans", "anticipates", "expects", "intends", and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements, but are not the exclusive means of identifying such statements. These forward-looking statements present the Company's estimates and assumptions only as of the date of this report. Except for the Company's ongoing obligation to disclose material information as required by the federal securities laws, the Company does not intend, and undertakes no obligation, to update any forward-looking statements.  Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in any of the forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed or any of the Company's forward-looking statements. The Company's future financial condition and results of operations, as well as any forward-looking statements, are subject to change and inherent risks and uncertainties.  PLAN OF OPERATIONS  Overview  The Company's business plan is to engage in the acquisition, exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas properties, both individually and through collaborative partnerships with other companies in this field of endeavor. In November of 2014, the Company entered its first contract of this kind as explained in Note 4. On March 8, 2016, the Company incorporated a wholly owned subsidiary, Viking Oil & Gas (Canada) ULC, in Alberta, Canada, to hold its Canadian oil and gas interests. On August 30, 2016, the Company organized a wholly owned subsidiary, Mid-Con Petroleum, LLC, a Kansas limited liability company, to hold its oil and gas interests in the central United States.  Viking Investments is neither an underwriter as the term is defined in Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act of 1933, nor an investment company pursuant to the Investment Company Act of 1940. Viking Investments is not an investment adviser pursuant to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Viking Investments is not registered with FINRA or SIPC.  Table of Contents  Going Concern Qualification  The Company's ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. Management has no formal plan in place to address this concern but considers that the Company will be able to obtain additional funds by equity financing and/or related party advances; however, there is no assurance of additional funding being available.  RESULTS OF CONTINUING OPERATIONS  The following discussion of the consolidated financial condition and results of operation of the Company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related Notes included elsewhere in this Report.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Working Capital: December 31, 2015 2014 Current Assets $ 184,462 $ 1,345 Current Liabilities $ 1,642,757 $ 481,902 Asset retirement obligation $ 416,246 $ - Working Capital (deficit) $ (1,458,295 ) $ (480,557 ) Cash Flows: Years Ended December 31, 2015 2014 Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Operating Activities $ (151,307 ) $ (370,800 ) Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Investing Activities $ - $ (549,811 ) Net Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities $ 180,547 $ 909,666 Increase (Decrease) in Cash during the Period $ 29,240 $ (10,894 ) Cash and Cash Equivalents, End of Period $ 30,585 $ 1345  The Company had current assets of $184,462 as of December 31, 2015, as compared to $1,345 in the comparable period in 2014. The Company had current liabilities of $1,642,757 as of December 31, 2015, as compared to $481,902 in the comparable period in 2014. The increase in current liabilities is mainly due to an increase in amounts due to directors, new convertible debt, and a corresponding derivative liability. The Company had a working capital deficit of $1,458,295 as a consequence of these increased liabilities as of December 31, 2015, compared to a working capital deficit in December 31, 2014, of $480,557.  Cash used in operating activities decreased to ($151,307) during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to ($370,800) in the comparable period in 2014. The decrease was mostly due expenses being paid directly by directors.  Cash from financing activities decreased to $180,547 during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to 909,666 in the comparable period in 2014. The decrease was mostly due to the Company not issuing units during 2015 and generating less cash through convertible debt, as well as the borrowings from directors.  Table of Contents  Cash used in investing activities decreased to zero during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to ($549,811) in the comparable period in 2014. The decrease is a result of the Company having accomplished the purchase of 1,256,593 and 2,187,500 units of Tanager Energy Inc. ("Tanager"), a Canadian mining company listed on the Canadian TSX Venture Exchange as a Tier 2 company and trading under the stock symbol "TAN," at a price of C$0.08 per unit during 2014. On November 3, 2014, the Company entered into a Purchase and Sale, Petroleum and Natural Gas Conveyance Agreement (the "Agreement"), with Tanager Energy. Pursuant to the Agreement, the Company is entitled to receive a 50% working interest in the Joffre oil and gas property located in Alberta, Canada (the "Joffre Property"). On November 4, 2014, the Company closed the transaction by paying Tanager US$302,367, with US$52,801 (C$60,000) payable as of December 31, 2014, which was paid in January of 2015.  Tanager owns the remaining 50% working interest in the Joffre Property and operates and manages the property in accordance with an operating agreement pursuant to the Canadian Association of Petroleum Landman Operating Procedure. The proceeds were to be used by Tanager to complete and place on production the first of four suspended Devonian oil wells in the Joffre D-3 B oil pool (the "Joffre Project"). In April 2015, the Company advanced to Tanager, an additional $153,877 (C$190,000) as an investment in the second well in the Joffre D-3 oil pool. On or about March 30, 2016, the working interest was registered in the name of the Company's wholly owned subsidiary, Viking Oil & Gas (Canada) ULC.  Revenue  The Company had gross revenues of $95,924 for the year ended December 31, 2015, representing its share of revenue from its 50% working interest in the Joffre Property. This revenue comes from the first two oil wells in the Joffre Project which began producing during April of 2015. The Company did not have any revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014.  Expenses  The Company's operating expenses increased by $358,344 to $924,995 for the year ended December 31, 2015, from $566,651 for the year ended December 31, 2014. This increase is mainly attributable to the Company's portion of the operational costs of processing, gathering and administering the oil wells in the Joffre Project of $49,965, an impairment loss of $210,032, accretion expense of $10,031 and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense of $34,881.  Loss from Operations  The Company incurred a loss from operations of $829,071 for the year ended December 31, 2015, as compared to a loss from operations of $566,651 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in loss from operations was mainly due to the items referred to in the analysis of expenses.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements  The Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on its financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity or capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to an investor in the Company's securities.  Seasonality  The Company' operating results are not affected by seasonality.  Inflation  The Company's business and operating results are not affected in any material way by inflation.  Table of Contents  Subsequent Events  On January 12, 2016, the Company issued 300,926 common shares upon the conversion of convertible debt in the amount of $10,111.  On February 23, 2016, the Company closed on the acquisition of working interests (Net Revenue Interests from 80 to 87%) in four leases with access to the mineral rights (oil and gas) concerning approximately 281 acres of property in Miami and Franklin Counties in eastern Kansas. This project produces oil from the Cherokee formation at a depth of approximately 600 feet. These leases offer the potential for several future drilling locations. The purchase includes an undivided interest in all oil and gas wells, equipment, fixtures and other personal property located upon the leased properties and used in connection with oil and gas operations upon the leases attributable to the working interests purchased by the Company. The effective date of the acquisitions is February 1, 2016, so the Company was entitled to net revenues from its share of production as of such date.  As consideration for this transaction, the Company made a cash payment of $1,305,000 at closing to the vendors and a cash payment in March of 2016 in the amount of $45,000. The Company also agreed to issue the vendors 4,500,000 shares of common stock.  Immediately prior to the above-noted acquisition, the Company also purchased a 100% working interest (Net Revenue Interest of 83%) in: (i) three leases with access to the mineral rights (oil and gas) concerning approximately 270 acres of property in Miami and Franklin Counties in eastern Kansas; and (ii) 31 leases with access to the mineral rights (oil and gas) concerning approximately 5,500 acres of property in Cass and Bates Counties in Missouri. The purchase includes an undivided interest in all oil and gas wells, equipment, fixtures and other personal property located upon the leased properties and used in connection with oil and gas operations upon the leases attributable to the working interests purchased by Viking. As consideration for this transaction, Viking agreed to issue the vendors 5,150,000 shares of common stock of Viking.  To facilitate these acquisitions, the Company borrowed $1,450,000 from private lenders pursuant to a 15% Senior Secured Convertible Promissory Note (the "Note"), arranged through a licensed broker/dealer, with the primary terms of the loan being as follows: (i) Term - 6 months; (ii) Rate - 15% per annum; (iii) Security - 1st ranking charge against company assets pursuant to a Security and Pledge Agreement (the "Security Agreement"); (iv) Conversion - the lenders have a right to convert all or part of the note into common stock of Viking at a price of $0.15 per share, subject to certain ownership restrictions; and (v) Warrants - the lenders were given an option to purchase, within the next 5 years, 3,750,000 shares of common stock of Viking at an exercise price of $0.20 per share pursuant to a Common Stock Purchase Warrant. Viking's CEO and director, James Doris, also personally guaranteed repayment of the loan and granted the lenders a security interest in his assets.  The foregoing descriptions of the terms of the Note, Security Agreement and Warrant are qualified in their entirety by the full text of such agreements, the form of which Note, Security Agreement and Warrant are incorporated by reference in and to Exhibits 99.3, 99.4, and 99.5 hereto.  As of February 1, 2016, the Company issued 9,650,000 common shares as part of the consideration for the acquisition of the oil and gas investment made at that time.  On March 16, 2016, the Company issued 1,000,000 common shares for services, valued at $102,500.  On March 21, 2016, the Company executed two one-year consulting agreements requiring the issuance of 2,000,000 common shares for each contract. Both of these contracts were terminated, the shares were returned to the Company, and were cancelled in August 2016.  On March 21, 2016, the Company executed a one-year advisory services agreement requiring the issuance of 1,000,000 common shares for the contract. The shares are to be issued as 375,002 upon execution of the contract, with 56,818 shares being issued at the beginning of each month for the remaining eleven months.  As of April 29, 2016, the Company issued a total of $375,000 of 10% Secured Subordinated promissory notes with a term expiring January 12, 2017 (the "Maturity Date"), and an original issue discount of fifty percent (50%). Interest is payable on the outstanding principal of these notes at 10% per annum on the Maturity Date.  As of April 29, 2016, the Company, pursuant to a securities purchase agreement, sold 1,250,000 shares of its common stock at $0.15 per share.  Table of Contents  On September 28, 2016, the Company issued 2,400,000 common shares, at the current market value of $288,000 as a portion of the purchase price of additional oil and gas properties acquired on October 4, 2016.  During September 2016, the Company negotiated the payment of certain convertible notes, and committed to the issuance of 375,000 common shares at the current market value of $52,500 as additional interest.  As of September 30, 2016, the Company, pursuant to a securities purchase agreement, sold $1,337,500 shares of its common stock at $0.15 per share.  As of October 2016, the Company issued a total of $610,000 of 10% Secured promissory notes with a term expiring April 3, 2017 (the "Maturity Date"), and an original issue discount of thirty seven and one half percent (37.5%). Interest is payable on the outstanding principal of these notes at 10% per annum on the Maturity Date.  On October 4, 2016, the Company closed on the purchase of working interests in various oil and gas leases in Eastern Kansas. Simultaneously, to facilitate the purchase, the Company closed on its initial funding from Crossfirst Bank under the September 30, 2016 Revolver Agreement in the amount of $1,800,000. Additionally, on October 4, 2016, the Company committed to the issuance of 2,752,021 common shares as a part of the consideration for the acquisition of this oil and gas investment. The shares were issued in December 2016.  During November 2016, the Company issued 1,400,000 common shares as part of a negotiated settlement on convertible notes.  During November, 2016, the Company issued 187,500 common shares pursuant to a securities purchase agreement.  Critical Accounting Policies  We prepare our financial statements in conformity with GAAP, which requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions and apply judgments. We base our estimates and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the financial statements are prepared and actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material. Due to the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain, materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. On a regular basis, we review our critical accounting policies and how they are applied in the preparation of our financial statements, as well as the sufficiency of the disclosures pertaining to our accounting policies in the footnotes accompanying our financial statements. Described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements, some of which are subject to alternative treatments under GAAP. We also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies. See "Note 3 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies" to our consolidated financial statements.  Oil and Gas Property Accounting  The Company uses the full cost method of accounting for its investment in oil and natural gas properties. Under this method of accounting, all costs of acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties (including such costs as leasehold acquisition costs, geological expenditures, dry hole costs, tangible and intangible development costs and direct internal costs) are capitalized as the cost of oil and natural gas properties when incurred.  The full cost method requires the Company to calculate quarterly, by cost center, a "ceiling," or limitation on the amount of properties that can be capitalized on the balance sheet. To the extent capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties, less accumulated depletion and related deferred taxes exceed the sum of the discounted future net revenues of proved oil and natural gas reserves, the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties subject to amortization, the cost of properties not being amortized, and the related tax amounts, such excess capitalized costs are charged to expense.  Proved Reserves  Estimates of our proved reserves included in this report are prepared in accordance with U.S. SEC guidelines for reporting corporate reserves and future net revenue. The accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of:  i. the quality and quantity of available data;  ii. the interpretation of that data;  iii. the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions; and  iv. the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate.  Table of Contents  Our proved reserve information included in this report was predominately based on estimates. Because these estimates depend on many assumptions, all of which may substantially differ from future actual results, reserve estimates will be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered. In addition, results of drilling, testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate.  In accordance with SEC requirements, we based the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on the unweighted arithmetic average of the prior 12-month commodity prices as of the first day of each of the months constituting the period and costs on the date of the estimate.  The estimates of proved reserves materially impact depreciation, depletion, amortization and accretion ("DD&A") expense. If the estimates of proved reserves decline, the rate at which we record DD&A expense will increase, reducing future net income. Such a decline may result from lower market prices, which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce from higher-cost fields.  Asset Retirement Obligation  Asset retirement obligations ("ARO") primarily represent the estimated present value of the amount we will incur to plug, abandon and remediate our producing properties at the projected end of their productive lives, in accordance with applicable federal, state and local laws. We determined our ARO by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to the obligation. The retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value as of the obligation's inception, with an offsetting increase to proved properties. Periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded as accretion expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income.  ARO liability is determined using significant assumptions, including current estimates of plugging and abandonment costs, annual inflation of these costs, the productive lives of wells and a risk-adjusted interest rate. Changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated ARO.  Revenues from oil and gas properties are recognized under the entitlements method of accounting, whereby revenue is recognized on the amount the Company is entitled to, based on its interest in the property after all costs associated with exploration, gathering, marketing and sales relative to the volumes of product sold.  The Company has updated its accounting for net operating losses to reflect accumulated deficits.  Dec 14, 2016  (c) 1995-2016 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

Wealth Structuring
Preservation and Transfer
Your wealth plan is designed to provide you and your family with thoughtful and innovative solutions customized to the financial and personal complexities of your life.  We bring you knowledge, experience and expertise across the broad range of wealth structuring disciplines.






Wealth Planning
Integrating your personal and financial affairs
By thinking holistically about all aspects of your wealth, we develop customized strategies to help pursue your unique goals. Wealth structuring can help you address issues including:

The cash flow required to help meet your lifestyle
The investments needed to help meet long-range objectives 
The most effective way to pursue estate planning goals 
The tax implications of the many aspects of managing and transferring your wealth

Trusts and Estates
Shaping your legacy and transferring your wealth
For more than two centuries, U.S. Trust has been helping many of America's wealthiest families build estate plans and implement wealth transfer strategies. Your team can work with you to build a sound estate plan that may help you:

Control the transfer of wealth to those you care about
Fulfill important philanthropic commitments
Reduce estate taxes
Maintain your privacy
Protect assets from creditors and other third parties

We can help you and your attorney establish trusts to provide financial security for your spouse or partner, pass assets to future generations and charities and reduce estate taxes, as well as provide for financial and investment management during your lifetime. We bring our extensive knowledge and experience to bear in helping clients manage their trusts whether we are serving as agent for trustee or corporate trustee.
Philanthropy
Making your charitable giving more fulfilling and effective
We offer you personal support and an array of tools to help you and your family assess your charitable goals, values and interests. Your philanthropic specialist can then help you understand a range of important considerations, including how to:

Implement your plan
Identify the best-qualified grant recipients
Monitor the impact of your efforts

We can help you design and implement a philanthropic strategy that helps you fulfill your values-based commitments in a way that is consistent with your lifestyle.
Learn more about Philanthropy at U.S. Trust
Custody Services
Benefiting from the experience of dedicated custody specialists
U.S. Trust is the custodian of choice for many sophisticated investors with extensive and complex holdings. Whether you manage your own portfolio or work with multiple brokers and investment managers, we can structure a personalized custody program that simplifies portfolio and trade monitoring and helps meet your specific safekeeping, service and information needs.

Always consult with your independent attorney, tax advisor, investment manager and insurance agent for final recommendations and before changing or implementing any financial, tax or estate planning strategy.
