1934 Allan Wolsey Cardinall
newly appointed Commissioner of the Cayman Islands, founded the Cayman Islands Yacht and Sailing Club
1935 January Regatta, the first Cayman Islands Regatta. It was held in late January, between the shark-fishing and turtling seasons when most of the island’s working vessels were back in their home port for refitting. There may have been as many as 20 schooners and 100 catboats.

1964 Easter Regatta
The Origins of the Grand Cayman Easter Regatta
The present-day Easter Regatta started in 1964 with the encouragement of various hotels, who saw it as an obvious attraction to visitors as well as residents.  However, the idea seems to have originated back in 1934 when the newly appointed Commissioner, Mr. (later Sir) Allan Wolsey Cardinall founded the Cayman Islands Yacht and Sailing Club.
