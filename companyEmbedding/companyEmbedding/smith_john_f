Current Topic

     07/17 - Industrial Tax Matters

               What has been the impact of the changes made to the tax exemption plan?
               
               Until recently, large industrial businesses that relocate or expand in Louisiana were eligible for a five-year waiver of their local property taxes with a nearly automatic five-year renewal. Proponents of the Industrial Tax Exemption Program (ITEP) say it stimulates investment in the state and creates jobs. Critics of the program say that the tax exemption reduces resources for local taxing entities and services.

While the ITEP was championed by former Gov. Bobby Jindal, Gov. John Bel Edwards announced modifications to the program in 2016. What has been the impact of the changes made to the tax exemption plan? How effective is the ITEP in growing jobs? What has the program’s cost been to local communities? Louisiana Public Square explores these questions and more on “Industrial Tax Matters.“

Our panelists are:
-	Wendy Aguillard, Calcasieu Parish Tax Assessor  
-	Broderick Bagert, Together Baton Rouge 
-	Greg Bowser, La. Chemical Association  
-	Sec. Don Pierson, Louisiana Economic Development  

Barry Erwin, President of Council for a Better Louisiana (CABL) and member of the Task Force on Structural Changes in Budget & Tax Policy, will moderate the discussion. 


This program is funded in part by Chasing the Dream: Poverty and Opportunity in America, WNET’s multi-platform public media Initiative that aims to provide a deeper understanding of the impact of poverty on American society. Major funding for this initiative is provided by The JPB Foundation. Additional funding is provided by Ford Foundation and the Annie E. Casey Foundation.

Tell us your story >


John F. “Jack” Smith, Jr. led the General Motors Corporation into the 21st Century first as its president and chief executive officer (beginning in 1992) and then as chairman of the board from January 1, 1996 until May 1, 2003 when he was succeeded in that position by Rick Wagoner.
Smith was born April 6, 1938, in Worcester, Mass. He received his bachelor of business administration degree from the University of Massachusetts in 1960, and a master of business administration degree from Boston University in 1965.
Smith joined General Motors in 1961 at the Fisher Body facility in Framingham, Massachusetts. He transferred to the Financial Staff in the New York office in 1966, and was named an assistant treasurer in September 1974. In February 1976, he was named an assistant comptroller on the Financial Staff in Detroit.
On August 1, 1980, he was named comptroller of General Motors Corporation. He became director of worldwide product planning in Detroit on February 1, 1982.
He was appointed president and general manager of General Motors of Canada Limited on January 9, 1984. At this time, he was elected a vice president of General Motors.
On February 1, 1986, Smith was named executive vice president of General Motors Europe-Passenger Cars, in charge of operations and engineering, and was appointed president of General Motors Europe on April 1, 1987.
From August 1, 1990 to April 6, 1992, Smith served as vice chairman of GM with responsibility for international operations. Prior to that, he had been executive vice president in charge of GM's international operations since June 1988.
Smith was elected to replace Lloyd Reuss as president and chief operating officer of GM on April 6, 1992 during a period of financial crisis for the corporation.  On November 2 of that same year, he was elected chief executive officer and president of General Motors. He continued to serve in a dual capacity as president for nearly two years after being elected chairman of the board in 1996.
