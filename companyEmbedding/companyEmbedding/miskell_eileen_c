Eileen C. Miskell



  
 
 





Eileen C. Miskell, Chairman and President of the Cape Cod Foundation Board. Since joining the Foundation board in August 2008 she has been the Treasurer and is currently also the Chair of The Falmouth Fund of the Cape Cod Foundation advisory committee. Eileen and her husband, Dana Miskell, own Wood Lumber Company in Falmouth.
Eileen is a member of the board of directors of Independent Bancorp in Rockland.
She has been a volunteer for the Falmouth Public Schools and the Falmouth Service Center. She has been on the board of the Falmouth Public Library Foundation and Falmouth Academy. Eileen holds a BS degree from Boston College and an MBA from Boston University. She and her husband Dana reside in Falmouth. They have two adult children.
~ What has inspired you to serve as a member of the Cape Cod Foundation Board of Directors? 


“I was asked to join the Cape Cod Foundation board when the foundation was meeting with community activists in Falmouth to start the first geographic field of interest fund. A geographic field of interest fund allows residents of a community to pool their financial resources to make grants, help organizations with board development, stimulate growth in philanthropic capital and act as a catalyst for positive change in a community. Falmouth residents with years of experience in community and philanthropic work thought by creating this fund, we could provide funds for 501©3 organizations working to strengthen the community. We have made grants in the areas of health and human services, youth and education, senior living, recreation, arts and culture, and the environment. The Falmouth Fund of the Cape Cod Foundation has leveraged the organizational capacity of the Cape Cod Foundation by receiving back office support (including accounting, gift acknowledgement letters and record-keeping), grantmaking expertise (with online capabilities), professional investment management and governance support.
We are on our way to building a substantial permanent endowment to continue grant making in Falmouth long after the founders of The Falmouth Fund are gone.”
