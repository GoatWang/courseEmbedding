FMC Corporation is an American chemical manufacturing company headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The company was founded by chemist John Bean in 1883 as the Bean Spray Pump Company in Los Gatos, California, producing piston pumps for insecticides. In 1928, Bean Spray Pump purchased two companies: the Anderson-Barngrover Co. and Sprague-Sells Co. At this time the company changed its name to Food Machinery Corporation, and began using the initials FMC. In 1941 the company FMC received a contract to design and build amphibious tracked landing vehicles for the United States Department of War,[4] and afterwards the company continued to diversify its products. FMC employed 5,500 people worldwide, and had gross revenues of US$3.4 billion in 2011.[5]

History[edit]

The Bean Spray Pump Company[edit]
Founded in 1883 as the Bean Spray Pump Company in Los Gatos, California[6] by chemist John Bean. The company's first product was a piston pump. Bean invented the pump to spray insecticide on the many fruit orchards in the area. A Bean sprayer was on display at the Forbes Mill museum in Los Gatos until its closure in 2014.[7][8] Bean Avenue in downtown Los Gatos is named after John Bean.
FMC[edit]
In 1928, Bean Spray Pump purchased two companies: the Anderson-Barngrover Co. and Sprague-Sells Co. The Anderson-Barngrover Co. manufactured a sealed can rotary pressure sterilizer[9] and the Sprague-Sells Co. manufactured canning machinery. At this time the company changed its name to Food Machinery Corporation, and began using the initials FMC.

FMC received a contract to design and build amphibious tracked landing vehicles for the United States War Department in 1941. FMC ranked 64th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.[4]
In 1961, the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Ships issued bids for a high performance amphibious ship-to-shore cargo carrier capable of moving over water at 35 knots (approx. 40 mph) and over ground at the same speed. It had to carry five tons of cargo across water, through the surf, across the beach, and inland. The vehicle also had to be quickly loaded and unloaded under combat conditions. FMC's Ordnance Division in San José, California built and tested two prototypes named "LVHX2 Landing Vehicle, Hydrofoil" for the U.S. Marine Corps. These were the first amphibious landing vehicles to make use of hydrofoils for high speed ship-to-shore operation. Although the LVHX2 never went into production, the Marine Corps used the prototypes in their continuous research and development program to develop better equipment for amphibious assault operations.
FMC later built the M113 Armored Personnel Carrier (APC), the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, and the XR311 at its former facility in Santa Clara, California. It also purchased the rights to manufacture some foreign military hardware, including the Brazilian EE-9 Cascavel, under license.[10] Bean also manufactured fire fighting equipment in the 1960s through the 1980s under the FMC and the Bean names.
In 1972, personnel were transferred from ordnance to designing and building RVs (motorcoaches). The oil crisis and high prices led production to end after five years.[11]
FMC also producedfire truck fire pumps and pumper bodies. It had an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) arrangement with Ladder Towers Inc. (LTI) to market aerial ladders. In the early 1980s the fire apparatus division of FMC tried to expand its role in aerial ladders on fire trucks, leveraging the Link-Belt crane division. FMC's expansion into production of aerial ladders failed: the FMC Fire Apparatus division was shut down in 1990.[12]
FMC sells chemical products used by beef and poultry processors to reduce pathogens, such a E. coli and salmonella, on uncooked beef and poultry.[13] FMC obtained a patent on a method for sanitizing fowl that have been killed, plucked and eviscerated by contacting the fowl with an aqueous acid solution and maintaining that contact for a time sufficient to sanitize the fowl.[13]
Spinoffs[edit]

In 1946, FMC bought Bolens Lawn and Garden Equipment. FMC changed its name again in 1948, becoming Food Machinery and Chemical Corporation. In 1961 the name was changed to FMC Corporation.
In 1967, the FMC Corporation merged with the Link-Belt Company. The company produced FMC Link-Belt branded cranes and excavators. In 1986, the Link-Belt Construction Equipment Company was formed as a joint venture between FMC Corporation and Sumitomo Heavy Industries.
Between 1965 and 1985 FMC was the owner of the Gunderson metal works in Springfield, Oregon USA, during that period it was known as the 'Marine and Rail Equipment Division of FMC' (MRED), it was sold in 1985 to The Greenbrier Companies.[14]
In the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, FMC Corporation began spinning several of its divisions into separate companies, including United Defense and FMC Technologies, and selling its divisions, including its automotive division to Snap-on Equipment, a division of Snap-on, in 1996. Snap-on renamed the division the "John Bean Company".[15] Bolens was sold to Troy-Built in 1988.
21st century[edit]

In 2001, FMC spun off its energy, airport, and food equipment businesses into a separate company named FMC Technologies.
In 2006 FMC Corporation celebrated 75 years being listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
Pierre Brondeau was named President and Chief Executive Officer succeeding William G. Walter, effective January 1, 2010. Brondeau had been with Dow Chemical and prior to that Rohm & Haas.[16]
A former FMC site in San Jose, California is the location for Avaya Stadium, a new soccer stadium for the San Jose Earthquakes.
In 2015, FMC completed the sale of its Alkali Chemicals business and acquisition of Cheminova, a multinational crop protection company, which aligns with the company’s corporate strategy to focus its portfolio on agriculture, health and nutrition end markets, and lithium technologies.[17][18]

Issues[edit]
Superfund site[edit]
FMC Corporation operated a phosphate mine and plant in Idaho on the Fort Hall Reservation of the federally recognized Shoshone-Bannock Tribes. Between 1949 and 2001, it produced an estimated 250 million pounds of elemental phosphorus annually. In 1989, as part of what is termed the Eastern Michaud Flats Contamination, its 1500-acre plant site was designated by EPA under CERCLA as a Superfund site because of extensive water and land pollution caused by these operations. After working to improve operations and air quality, the company abandoned the plant and related mine about 2001 because of much higher electricity costs and the challenge of cheaper phosphate coming from China. Seventeen mines in the area have been designated as Superfund sites because of selenium poisoning.[19]
African lion program[edit]
In 2009, CBS 60 Minutes ran an exposé on the use by farmers in Kenya of an FMC–produced pesticide, Furadan, as a poison to kill African lions. The piece suggested that Furadan was a serious threat to the future of the lion population in Africa.[20] FMC has commented extensively on this issue through the media and their websites, including furadanfacts.com.[21] They engaged with government officials, NGOs, and others to try and resolve the illegal use of pesticides to kill wildlife. The company took action to stop the sale of this product and instituted a buy-back program in East Africa when it determined that the illegal and intentional misuse of chemicals against wildlife could not be controlled by education or stewardship programs alone.[22][23]
In popular culture[edit]

The troubled development of the Bradley vehicle was satirized in the 1998 HBO movie The Pentagon Wars. In the movie FMC was fictionalized as A.O.C. corporation.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.

FMC Corporation is an American chemical manufacturing company headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The company was founded by chemist John Bean in 1883 as the Bean Spray Pump Company in Los Gatos, California, producing piston pumps for insecticides. In 1928, Bean Spray Pump purchased two companies: the Anderson-Barngrover Co. and Sprague-Sells Co. At this time the company changed its name to Food Machinery Corporation, and began using the initials FMC. In 1941 the company FMC received a contract to design and build amphibious tracked landing vehicles for the United States Department of War,[4] and afterwards the company continued to diversify its products. FMC employed 5,500 people worldwide, and had gross revenues of US$3.4 billion in 2011.[5]

History[edit]




FMC Towers headquarters in Philadelphia


The Bean Spray Pump Company[edit]
Founded in 1883 as the Bean Spray Pump Company in Los Gatos, California[6] by chemist John Bean. The company's first product was a piston pump. Bean invented the pump to spray insecticide on the many fruit orchards in the area. A Bean sprayer was on display at the Forbes Mill museum in Los Gatos until its closure in 2014.[7][8] Bean Avenue in downtown Los Gatos is named after John Bean.
FMC[edit]
In 1928, Bean Spray Pump purchased two companies: the Anderson-Barngrover Co. and Sprague-Sells Co. The Anderson-Barngrover Co. manufactured a sealed can rotary pressure sterilizer[9] and the Sprague-Sells Co. manufactured canning machinery. At this time the company changed its name to Food Machinery Corporation, and began using the initials FMC.

FMC received a contract to design and build amphibious tracked landing vehicles for the United States War Department in 1941. FMC ranked 64th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.[4]
In 1961, the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Ships issued bids for a high performance amphibious ship-to-shore cargo carrier capable of moving over water at 35 knots (approx. 40 mph) and over ground at the same speed. It had to carry five tons of cargo across water, through the surf, across the beach, and inland. The vehicle also had to be quickly loaded and unloaded under combat conditions. FMC's Ordnance Division in San José, California built and tested two prototypes named "LVHX2 Landing Vehicle, Hydrofoil" for the U.S. Marine Corps. These were the first amphibious landing vehicles to make use of hydrofoils for high speed ship-to-shore operation. Although the LVHX2 never went into production, the Marine Corps used the prototypes in their continuous research and development program to develop better equipment for amphibious assault operations.
FMC later built the M113 Armored Personnel Carrier (APC), the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, and the XR311 at its former facility in Santa Clara, California. It also purchased the rights to manufacture some foreign military hardware, including the Brazilian EE-9 Cascavel, under license.[10] Bean also manufactured fire fighting equipment in the 1960s through the 1980s under the FMC and the Bean names.
In 1972, personnel were transferred from ordnance to designing and building RVs (motorcoaches). The oil crisis and high prices led production to end after five years.[11]
FMC also producedfire truck fire pumps and pumper bodies. It had an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) arrangement with Ladder Towers Inc. (LTI) to market aerial ladders. In the early 1980s the fire apparatus division of FMC tried to expand its role in aerial ladders on fire trucks, leveraging the Link-Belt crane division. FMC's expansion into production of aerial ladders failed: the FMC Fire Apparatus division was shut down in 1990.[12]
FMC sells chemical products used by beef and poultry processors to reduce pathogens, such a E. coli and salmonella, on uncooked beef and poultry.[13] FMC obtained a patent on a method for sanitizing fowl that have been killed, plucked and eviscerated by contacting the fowl with an aqueous acid solution and maintaining that contact for a time sufficient to sanitize the fowl.[13]
Spinoffs[edit]

In 1946, FMC bought Bolens Lawn and Garden Equipment. FMC changed its name again in 1948, becoming Food Machinery and Chemical Corporation. In 1961 the name was changed to FMC Corporation.
In 1967, the FMC Corporation merged with the Link-Belt Company. The company produced FMC Link-Belt branded cranes and excavators. In 1986, the Link-Belt Construction Equipment Company was formed as a joint venture between FMC Corporation and Sumitomo Heavy Industries.
Between 1965 and 1985 FMC was the owner of the Gunderson metal works in Springfield, Oregon USA, during that period it was known as the 'Marine and Rail Equipment Division of FMC' (MRED), it was sold in 1985 to The Greenbrier Companies.[14]
In the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, FMC Corporation began spinning several of its divisions into separate companies, including United Defense and FMC Technologies, and selling its divisions, including its automotive division to Snap-on Equipment, a division of Snap-on, in 1996. Snap-on renamed the division the "John Bean Company".[15] Bolens was sold to Troy-Built in 1988.
21st century[edit]

In 2001, FMC spun off its energy, airport, and food equipment businesses into a separate company named FMC Technologies.
In 2006 FMC Corporation celebrated 75 years being listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
Pierre Brondeau was named President and Chief Executive Officer succeeding William G. Walter, effective January 1, 2010. Brondeau had been with Dow Chemical and prior to that Rohm & Haas.[16]
A former FMC site in San Jose, California is the location for Avaya Stadium, a new soccer stadium for the San Jose Earthquakes.
In 2015, FMC completed the sale of its Alkali Chemicals business and acquisition of Cheminova, a multinational crop protection company, which aligns with the company’s corporate strategy to focus its portfolio on agriculture, health and nutrition end markets, and lithium technologies.[17][18]

Issues[edit]
Superfund site[edit]
FMC Corporation operated a phosphate mine and plant in Idaho on the Fort Hall Reservation of the federally recognized Shoshone-Bannock Tribes. Between 1949 and 2001, it produced an estimated 250 million pounds of elemental phosphorus annually. In 1989, as part of what is termed the Eastern Michaud Flats Contamination, its 1500-acre plant site was designated by EPA under CERCLA as a Superfund site because of extensive water and land pollution caused by these operations. After working to improve operations and air quality, the company abandoned the plant and related mine about 2001 because of much higher electricity costs and the challenge of cheaper phosphate coming from China. Seventeen mines in the area have been designated as Superfund sites because of selenium poisoning.[19]
African lion program[edit]
In 2009, CBS 60 Minutes ran an exposé on the use by farmers in Kenya of an FMC–produced pesticide, Furadan, as a poison to kill African lions. The piece suggested that Furadan was a serious threat to the future of the lion population in Africa.[20] FMC has commented extensively on this issue through the media and their websites, including furadanfacts.com.[21] They engaged with government officials, NGOs, and others to try and resolve the illegal use of pesticides to kill wildlife. The company took action to stop the sale of this product and instituted a buy-back program in East Africa when it determined that the illegal and intentional misuse of chemicals against wildlife could not be controlled by education or stewardship programs alone.[22][23]
In popular culture[edit]

The troubled development of the Bradley vehicle was satirized in the 1998 HBO movie The Pentagon Wars. In the movie FMC was fictionalized as A.O.C. corporation.

History[edit]

The Bean Spray Pump Company[edit]
Founded in 1883 as the Bean Spray Pump Company in Los Gatos, California[6] by chemist John Bean. The company's first product was a piston pump. Bean invented the pump to spray insecticide on the many fruit orchards in the area. A Bean sprayer was on display at the Forbes Mill museum in Los Gatos until its closure in 2014.[7][8] Bean Avenue in downtown Los Gatos is named after John Bean.
FMC[edit]
In 1928, Bean Spray Pump purchased two companies: the Anderson-Barngrover Co. and Sprague-Sells Co. The Anderson-Barngrover Co. manufactured a sealed can rotary pressure sterilizer[9] and the Sprague-Sells Co. manufactured canning machinery. At this time the company changed its name to Food Machinery Corporation, and began using the initials FMC.

FMC received a contract to design and build amphibious tracked landing vehicles for the United States War Department in 1941. FMC ranked 64th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.[4]
In 1961, the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Ships issued bids for a high performance amphibious ship-to-shore cargo carrier capable of moving over water at 35 knots (approx. 40 mph) and over ground at the same speed. It had to carry five tons of cargo across water, through the surf, across the beach, and inland. The vehicle also had to be quickly loaded and unloaded under combat conditions. FMC's Ordnance Division in San José, California built and tested two prototypes named "LVHX2 Landing Vehicle, Hydrofoil" for the U.S. Marine Corps. These were the first amphibious landing vehicles to make use of hydrofoils for high speed ship-to-shore operation. Although the LVHX2 never went into production, the Marine Corps used the prototypes in their continuous research and development program to develop better equipment for amphibious assault operations.
FMC later built the M113 Armored Personnel Carrier (APC), the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, and the XR311 at its former facility in Santa Clara, California. It also purchased the rights to manufacture some foreign military hardware, including the Brazilian EE-9 Cascavel, under license.[10] Bean also manufactured fire fighting equipment in the 1960s through the 1980s under the FMC and the Bean names.
In 1972, personnel were transferred from ordnance to designing and building RVs (motorcoaches). The oil crisis and high prices led production to end after five years.[11]
FMC also producedfire truck fire pumps and pumper bodies. It had an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) arrangement with Ladder Towers Inc. (LTI) to market aerial ladders. In the early 1980s the fire apparatus division of FMC tried to expand its role in aerial ladders on fire trucks, leveraging the Link-Belt crane division. FMC's expansion into production of aerial ladders failed: the FMC Fire Apparatus division was shut down in 1990.[12]
FMC sells chemical products used by beef and poultry processors to reduce pathogens, such a E. coli and salmonella, on uncooked beef and poultry.[13] FMC obtained a patent on a method for sanitizing fowl that have been killed, plucked and eviscerated by contacting the fowl with an aqueous acid solution and maintaining that contact for a time sufficient to sanitize the fowl.[13]
Spinoffs[edit]

In 1946, FMC bought Bolens Lawn and Garden Equipment. FMC changed its name again in 1948, becoming Food Machinery and Chemical Corporation. In 1961 the name was changed to FMC Corporation.
In 1967, the FMC Corporation merged with the Link-Belt Company. The company produced FMC Link-Belt branded cranes and excavators. In 1986, the Link-Belt Construction Equipment Company was formed as a joint venture between FMC Corporation and Sumitomo Heavy Industries.
Between 1965 and 1985 FMC was the owner of the Gunderson metal works in Springfield, Oregon USA, during that period it was known as the 'Marine and Rail Equipment Division of FMC' (MRED), it was sold in 1985 to The Greenbrier Companies.[14]
In the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, FMC Corporation began spinning several of its divisions into separate companies, including United Defense and FMC Technologies, and selling its divisions, including its automotive division to Snap-on Equipment, a division of Snap-on, in 1996. Snap-on renamed the division the "John Bean Company".[15] Bolens was sold to Troy-Built in 1988.
21st century[edit]

In 2001, FMC spun off its energy, airport, and food equipment businesses into a separate company named FMC Technologies.
In 2006 FMC Corporation celebrated 75 years being listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
Pierre Brondeau was named President and Chief Executive Officer succeeding William G. Walter, effective January 1, 2010. Brondeau had been with Dow Chemical and prior to that Rohm & Haas.[16]
A former FMC site in San Jose, California is the location for Avaya Stadium, a new soccer stadium for the San Jose Earthquakes.
In 2015, FMC completed the sale of its Alkali Chemicals business and acquisition of Cheminova, a multinational crop protection company, which aligns with the company’s corporate strategy to focus its portfolio on agriculture, health and nutrition end markets, and lithium technologies.[17][18]

Issues[edit]
Superfund site[edit]
FMC Corporation operated a phosphate mine and plant in Idaho on the Fort Hall Reservation of the federally recognized Shoshone-Bannock Tribes. Between 1949 and 2001, it produced an estimated 250 million pounds of elemental phosphorus annually. In 1989, as part of what is termed the Eastern Michaud Flats Contamination, its 1500-acre plant site was designated by EPA under CERCLA as a Superfund site because of extensive water and land pollution caused by these operations. After working to improve operations and air quality, the company abandoned the plant and related mine about 2001 because of much higher electricity costs and the challenge of cheaper phosphate coming from China. Seventeen mines in the area have been designated as Superfund sites because of selenium poisoning.[19]
African lion program[edit]
In 2009, CBS 60 Minutes ran an exposé on the use by farmers in Kenya of an FMC–produced pesticide, Furadan, as a poison to kill African lions. The piece suggested that Furadan was a serious threat to the future of the lion population in Africa.[20] FMC has commented extensively on this issue through the media and their websites, including furadanfacts.com.[21] They engaged with government officials, NGOs, and others to try and resolve the illegal use of pesticides to kill wildlife. The company took action to stop the sale of this product and instituted a buy-back program in East Africa when it determined that the illegal and intentional misuse of chemicals against wildlife could not be controlled by education or stewardship programs alone.[22][23]
In popular culture[edit]

The troubled development of the Bradley vehicle was satirized in the 1998 HBO movie The Pentagon Wars. In the movie FMC was fictionalized as A.O.C. corporation.

FMC received a contract to design and build amphibious tracked landing vehicles for the United States War Department in 1941. FMC ranked 64th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.[4]
In 1961, the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Ships issued bids for a high performance amphibious ship-to-shore cargo carrier capable of moving over water at 35 knots (approx. 40 mph) and over ground at the same speed. It had to carry five tons of cargo across water, through the surf, across the beach, and inland. The vehicle also had to be quickly loaded and unloaded under combat conditions. FMC's Ordnance Division in San José, California built and tested two prototypes named "LVHX2 Landing Vehicle, Hydrofoil" for the U.S. Marine Corps. These were the first amphibious landing vehicles to make use of hydrofoils for high speed ship-to-shore operation. Although the LVHX2 never went into production, the Marine Corps used the prototypes in their continuous research and development program to develop better equipment for amphibious assault operations.
FMC later built the M113 Armored Personnel Carrier (APC), the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, and the XR311 at its former facility in Santa Clara, California. It also purchased the rights to manufacture some foreign military hardware, including the Brazilian EE-9 Cascavel, under license.[10] Bean also manufactured fire fighting equipment in the 1960s through the 1980s under the FMC and the Bean names.
In 1972, personnel were transferred from ordnance to designing and building RVs (motorcoaches). The oil crisis and high prices led production to end after five years.[11]
FMC also producedfire truck fire pumps and pumper bodies. It had an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) arrangement with Ladder Towers Inc. (LTI) to market aerial ladders. In the early 1980s the fire apparatus division of FMC tried to expand its role in aerial ladders on fire trucks, leveraging the Link-Belt crane division. FMC's expansion into production of aerial ladders failed: the FMC Fire Apparatus division was shut down in 1990.[12]
FMC sells chemical products used by beef and poultry processors to reduce pathogens, such a E. coli and salmonella, on uncooked beef and poultry.[13] FMC obtained a patent on a method for sanitizing fowl that have been killed, plucked and eviscerated by contacting the fowl with an aqueous acid solution and maintaining that contact for a time sufficient to sanitize the fowl.[13]
Spinoffs[edit]

In 1946, FMC bought Bolens Lawn and Garden Equipment. FMC changed its name again in 1948, becoming Food Machinery and Chemical Corporation. In 1961 the name was changed to FMC Corporation.
In 1967, the FMC Corporation merged with the Link-Belt Company. The company produced FMC Link-Belt branded cranes and excavators. In 1986, the Link-Belt Construction Equipment Company was formed as a joint venture between FMC Corporation and Sumitomo Heavy Industries.
Between 1965 and 1985 FMC was the owner of the Gunderson metal works in Springfield, Oregon USA, during that period it was known as the 'Marine and Rail Equipment Division of FMC' (MRED), it was sold in 1985 to The Greenbrier Companies.[14]
In the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, FMC Corporation began spinning several of its divisions into separate companies, including United Defense and FMC Technologies, and selling its divisions, including its automotive division to Snap-on Equipment, a division of Snap-on, in 1996. Snap-on renamed the division the "John Bean Company".[15] Bolens was sold to Troy-Built in 1988.
21st century[edit]

In 2001, FMC spun off its energy, airport, and food equipment businesses into a separate company named FMC Technologies.
In 2006 FMC Corporation celebrated 75 years being listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
Pierre Brondeau was named President and Chief Executive Officer succeeding William G. Walter, effective January 1, 2010. Brondeau had been with Dow Chemical and prior to that Rohm & Haas.[16]
A former FMC site in San Jose, California is the location for Avaya Stadium, a new soccer stadium for the San Jose Earthquakes.
In 2015, FMC completed the sale of its Alkali Chemicals business and acquisition of Cheminova, a multinational crop protection company, which aligns with the company’s corporate strategy to focus its portfolio on agriculture, health and nutrition end markets, and lithium technologies.[17][18]

Issues[edit]
Superfund site[edit]
FMC Corporation operated a phosphate mine and plant in Idaho on the Fort Hall Reservation of the federally recognized Shoshone-Bannock Tribes. Between 1949 and 2001, it produced an estimated 250 million pounds of elemental phosphorus annually. In 1989, as part of what is termed the Eastern Michaud Flats Contamination, its 1500-acre plant site was designated by EPA under CERCLA as a Superfund site because of extensive water and land pollution caused by these operations. After working to improve operations and air quality, the company abandoned the plant and related mine about 2001 because of much higher electricity costs and the challenge of cheaper phosphate coming from China. Seventeen mines in the area have been designated as Superfund sites because of selenium poisoning.[19]
African lion program[edit]
In 2009, CBS 60 Minutes ran an exposé on the use by farmers in Kenya of an FMC–produced pesticide, Furadan, as a poison to kill African lions. The piece suggested that Furadan was a serious threat to the future of the lion population in Africa.[20] FMC has commented extensively on this issue through the media and their websites, including furadanfacts.com.[21] They engaged with government officials, NGOs, and others to try and resolve the illegal use of pesticides to kill wildlife. The company took action to stop the sale of this product and instituted a buy-back program in East Africa when it determined that the illegal and intentional misuse of chemicals against wildlife could not be controlled by education or stewardship programs alone.[22][23]
In popular culture[edit]

The troubled development of the Bradley vehicle was satirized in the 1998 HBO movie The Pentagon Wars. In the movie FMC was fictionalized as A.O.C. corporation.

FMC Corporation is an American chemical manufacturing company headquartered in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The company was founded by chemist John Bean in 1883 as the Bean Spray Pump Company in Los Gatos, California, producing piston pumps for insecticides. In 1928, Bean Spray Pump purchased two companies: the Anderson-Barngrover Co. and Sprague-Sells Co. At this time the company changed its name to Food Machinery Corporation, and began using the initials FMC. In 1941 the company FMC received a contract to design and build amphibious tracked landing vehicles for the United States Department of War,[4] and afterwards the company continued to diversify its products. FMC employed 5,500 people worldwide, and had gross revenues of US$3.4 billion in 2011.[5]

History[edit]




FMC Towers headquarters in Philadelphia


The Bean Spray Pump Company[edit]
Founded in 1883 as the Bean Spray Pump Company in Los Gatos, California[6] by chemist John Bean. The company's first product was a piston pump. Bean invented the pump to spray insecticide on the many fruit orchards in the area. A Bean sprayer was on display at the Forbes Mill museum in Los Gatos until its closure in 2014.[7][8] Bean Avenue in downtown Los Gatos is named after John Bean.
FMC[edit]
In 1928, Bean Spray Pump purchased two companies: the Anderson-Barngrover Co. and Sprague-Sells Co. The Anderson-Barngrover Co. manufactured a sealed can rotary pressure sterilizer[9] and the Sprague-Sells Co. manufactured canning machinery. At this time the company changed its name to Food Machinery Corporation, and began using the initials FMC.

FMC received a contract to design and build amphibious tracked landing vehicles for the United States War Department in 1941. FMC ranked 64th among United States corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.[4]
In 1961, the U.S. Navy's Bureau of Ships issued bids for a high performance amphibious ship-to-shore cargo carrier capable of moving over water at 35 knots (approx. 40 mph) and over ground at the same speed. It had to carry five tons of cargo across water, through the surf, across the beach, and inland. The vehicle also had to be quickly loaded and unloaded under combat conditions. FMC's Ordnance Division in San José, California built and tested two prototypes named "LVHX2 Landing Vehicle, Hydrofoil" for the U.S. Marine Corps. These were the first amphibious landing vehicles to make use of hydrofoils for high speed ship-to-shore operation. Although the LVHX2 never went into production, the Marine Corps used the prototypes in their continuous research and development program to develop better equipment for amphibious assault operations.
FMC later built the M113 Armored Personnel Carrier (APC), the Bradley Fighting Vehicle, and the XR311 at its former facility in Santa Clara, California. It also purchased the rights to manufacture some foreign military hardware, including the Brazilian EE-9 Cascavel, under license.[10] Bean also manufactured fire fighting equipment in the 1960s through the 1980s under the FMC and the Bean names.
In 1972, personnel were transferred from ordnance to designing and building RVs (motorcoaches). The oil crisis and high prices led production to end after five years.[11]
FMC also producedfire truck fire pumps and pumper bodies. It had an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) arrangement with Ladder Towers Inc. (LTI) to market aerial ladders. In the early 1980s the fire apparatus division of FMC tried to expand its role in aerial ladders on fire trucks, leveraging the Link-Belt crane division. FMC's expansion into production of aerial ladders failed: the FMC Fire Apparatus division was shut down in 1990.[12]
FMC sells chemical products used by beef and poultry processors to reduce pathogens, such a E. coli and salmonella, on uncooked beef and poultry.[13] FMC obtained a patent on a method for sanitizing fowl that have been killed, plucked and eviscerated by contacting the fowl with an aqueous acid solution and maintaining that contact for a time sufficient to sanitize the fowl.[13]
Spinoffs[edit]

In 1946, FMC bought Bolens Lawn and Garden Equipment. FMC changed its name again in 1948, becoming Food Machinery and Chemical Corporation. In 1961 the name was changed to FMC Corporation.
In 1967, the FMC Corporation merged with the Link-Belt Company. The company produced FMC Link-Belt branded cranes and excavators. In 1986, the Link-Belt Construction Equipment Company was formed as a joint venture between FMC Corporation and Sumitomo Heavy Industries.
Between 1965 and 1985 FMC was the owner of the Gunderson metal works in Springfield, Oregon USA, during that period it was known as the 'Marine and Rail Equipment Division of FMC' (MRED), it was sold in 1985 to The Greenbrier Companies.[14]
In the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s, FMC Corporation began spinning several of its divisions into separate companies, including United Defense and FMC Technologies, and selling its divisions, including its automotive division to Snap-on Equipment, a division of Snap-on, in 1996. Snap-on renamed the division the "John Bean Company".[15] Bolens was sold to Troy-Built in 1988.
21st century[edit]

In 2001, FMC spun off its energy, airport, and food equipment businesses into a separate company named FMC Technologies.
In 2006 FMC Corporation celebrated 75 years being listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
Pierre Brondeau was named President and Chief Executive Officer succeeding William G. Walter, effective January 1, 2010. Brondeau had been with Dow Chemical and prior to that Rohm & Haas.[16]
A former FMC site in San Jose, California is the location for Avaya Stadium, a new soccer stadium for the San Jose Earthquakes.
In 2015, FMC completed the sale of its Alkali Chemicals business and acquisition of Cheminova, a multinational crop protection company, which aligns with the company’s corporate strategy to focus its portfolio on agriculture, health and nutrition end markets, and lithium technologies.[17][18]

Issues[edit]
Superfund site[edit]
FMC Corporation operated a phosphate mine and plant in Idaho on the Fort Hall Reservation of the federally recognized Shoshone-Bannock Tribes. Between 1949 and 2001, it produced an estimated 250 million pounds of elemental phosphorus annually. In 1989, as part of what is termed the Eastern Michaud Flats Contamination, its 1500-acre plant site was designated by EPA under CERCLA as a Superfund site because of extensive water and land pollution caused by these operations. After working to improve operations and air quality, the company abandoned the plant and related mine about 2001 because of much higher electricity costs and the challenge of cheaper phosphate coming from China. Seventeen mines in the area have been designated as Superfund sites because of selenium poisoning.[19]
African lion program[edit]
In 2009, CBS 60 Minutes ran an exposé on the use by farmers in Kenya of an FMC–produced pesticide, Furadan, as a poison to kill African lions. The piece suggested that Furadan was a serious threat to the future of the lion population in Africa.[20] FMC has commented extensively on this issue through the media and their websites, including furadanfacts.com.[21] They engaged with government officials, NGOs, and others to try and resolve the illegal use of pesticides to kill wildlife. The company took action to stop the sale of this product and instituted a buy-back program in East Africa when it determined that the illegal and intentional misuse of chemicals against wildlife could not be controlled by education or stewardship programs alone.[22][23]
In popular culture[edit]

The troubled development of the Bradley vehicle was satirized in the 1998 HBO movie The Pentagon Wars. In the movie FMC was fictionalized as A.O.C. corporation.

FMC Corporation
Privacy Statement—Human Resources Data


Translated copy

FMC Corporation (“FMC”) complies with the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss
Safe Harbor Framework set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and
retention of personal information from European Union (“EU”) member countries and Switzerland. This
Privacy Statement applies solely to human resources Personal Data maintained, processed, or controlled by
FMC regarding individuals in the context of their engagement with FMC as employees or contractors.
Specifically, this Privacy Statement applies to the collection and use of Personal Data obtained from FMC
and FMC affiliate and subsidiary employees or contractors located in the European Union or Switzerland that
may be transferred to the United States. 

For the purposes of this Privacy Statement, “Personal Data” is information: 
about a specific employee or contractor of FMC Corporation or employee or contractor of an
    FMC affiliate or subsidiary company with regard to his or her engagement with FMC who is
    employed in the EU or Switzerland,
    
that identifies that employee or contractor, and
    
is transferred from the EU or Switzerland to the United States.
    

For example, Personal Data may include, but is not limited to, date of hire, date of birth, start/end
date, compensation and benefits information, and information collected through company-issued technology
accounts. 
Notice of Collection and Use of Personal Data
FMC creates and receives Personal Data in connection with the management and administration of
pre-employment, employment, and post-employment matters. FMC will use such information for business
operations, employee development, and administrative purposes, or when required in the course of judicial or
administrative proceedings or otherwise by applicable law to protect the interests of FMC and third parties.
From time to time, FMC may provide information about employees or contractors to third parties for
purposes related to employment or the administration of FMC’s compensation, benefits, and human
resources programs. For example, FMC may disclose Personal Data to compensation and benefits
consultants, internal and external auditors, and legal or tax professionals retained by the company. 
FMC will only share Personal Data in connection with an individual’s status as a current or former
employee or contractor. Personal Data will not be rented, sold, or leased to any third party for any purposes
unrelated to that individual’s status as a current or former employee or contractor. 
This Privacy Statement does not apply to aggregate information collected or developed by FMC
concerning employees or contractors. Aggregate information may include statistics, such as the number of
people employed in a certain country, demographic information or any other information which does not
identify a specific individual. 
Choice 
Where required by law, FMC will offer employees and contractors the opportunity to opt out of
having their Personal Data collected, used, and disclosed. 
Any withdrawal of consent to the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Data, where allowed by
law, may affect certain aspects of the employment relationship or result in the employee or contractor being
no longer eligible for certain benefits and services provided by FMC, to the extent the Personal Data affected
by the withdrawal of consent was necessary to process such benefits. 
FMC does not intend to use or share any “sensitive” information (for example, personal information
specifying medical or health conditions, racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, and religious or
philosophical beliefs) about employees or contractors with third parties. Employees or contractors may,
however, opt-in prior to any potential uses of sensitive information, as required by applicable law, if the
information is to be disclosed to a third party that is not an affiliate or agent of FMC or used for a purpose
other than the original purpose at the time of collection, or any purpose authorized subsequently by the
employee or contractor.

Data Security 
FMC takes reasonable measures to protect Personal Data from loss, misuse, and unauthorized access,
disclosure, alteration, or destruction. These measures include, but are not limited to: training and
communication of appropriate policies and practices; restricted access and monitoring of buildings, systems,
and files; appropriate technical measures including firewalls, etc.; personal password and authentication
protection; and authorization requirements to access Personal Data on a “need to know” basis either for job
requirements or specific business purposes. FMC will store Personal Data for as long as it is deemed
reasonably necessary. This may extend beyond the term of an individual’s employment or engagement. 
Onward Transfer
Prior to the disclosure of Personal Data to any third party, FMC will confirm that the third party
subscribes to the Safe Harbor Principles or, alternatively, that the third party agrees to provide at least the
same level of privacy protection required by the Safe Harbor principles. 
Many of the servers that store Personal Data are maintained in the United States of America.
Therefore, your Personal Data may be exported to, and stored and processed in, the United States. By
becoming an employee or contractor, you freely and specifically give FMC your consent to export and store
your Personal Data in the United States. You understand that Personal Data stored in the United States may
be subject to lawful requests by the courts or law enforcement authorities in the United States. 
Data Integrity 
FMC processes Personal Data only in ways compatible with the purposes for which it was collected
or subsequently authorized by the employee or contractor. To the extent necessary for such purposes, FMC
takes reasonable steps to make sure Personal Data is accurate, complete current, and otherwise reliable with
regard to its intended use. 
Access
FMC provides individuals with reasonable access to the Personal Data they provided to FMC. FMC
also provides the ability to review and correct Personal Data, as applicable, by contacting the Human
Resources Service Center. 
Enforcement
If a complaint regarding FMC’s use of Personal Data is raised by an EU or Swiss employee or
contractor, FMC will investigate and try to resolve any dispute. Any questions or concerns regarding this
Privacy Statement or the handling of employee or contractor Personal Data should be directed to the
Manager of the Human Resources Service Center by using the information below: 
FMC Human Resources Service Center
801 Princeton South Corporate Center
Ewing, NJ 08628
HRSC@FMC.com
1 (888) 362 – 4448
If the dispute cannot be resolved, the employee or contractor may have certain rights under the local laws of
the country in which he or she is located. FMC will participate in the dispute resolution procedures of
European data protection authorities. 
Amendment 
This Privacy Statement may be amended from time to time in a manner consistent with the
requirements of the Safe Harbor Principles. Appropriate notice will be given concerning any amendments.
