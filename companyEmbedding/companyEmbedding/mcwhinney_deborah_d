As the chief operating officer of Citi Enterprise Payments, McWhinney is responsible for developing and implementing new mobile and online services around the globe for some of the world’s biggest corporations and governments.
She is also the global product manager of Consumer Integrated Payments at Citi, a business line that enables large merchants to collect money from consumers worldwide by combining classic merchant acquiring and local clearing capabilities.
Looking ahead five years McWhinney says an important change in how the payments business is conducted will be driven by the digitization of payment flows.
“While corporate payments have long been digitized, the emergence of mobile technology will create consumer digital flows, and with that, the gradual transition from physical cash towards digital money,” she says. “Commerce will become more convenient, consumers will be more informed, and corporations will connect directly to consumers globally. New business models, participants and ecosystems will emerge as part of this transition.”
McWhinney joined Citigroup in 2009 as head of the Citi Personal Wealth Management organization. She was previously president of Schwab Institutional, a division of Charles Schwab & Co. that works with independent investment advisers.
