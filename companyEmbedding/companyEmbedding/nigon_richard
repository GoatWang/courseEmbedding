Robins Kaplan Miller & Ciresi, LLPOrganization Type: Law FirmPosition/Title: Chief Financial OfficerFunctional Area: FinanceYear of Induction: 2012

CITATION UPON INDUCTION INTO THE COLLEGE
For 20 years, Richard Nigon has been a “poster child” for what it means to be dedicated to your profession and to improving and enhancing the quality of law practice management. He has been a catalyst for positive approaches to financial leadership and reasonableness in changing economic times. Dick’s contributions to improving the administration of justice and for being an “unsung hero” in law firm management have been honored by county and state bar associations in Minnesota. The place he holds in the esteem and hearts of his professional colleagues is reflected in being one of only nine individuals in ALA’s 40-year history to receive its “Spirit of ALA Award” for commitment, dedication and service to the profession, and – perhaps, most telling – that his home chapter in Minnesota established its scholarship program in his name to honor and recognize his consistent professional involvement, innovation and character. I am pleased to welcome Richard Nigon as a Fellow of the College of Law Practice Management.
—Nominated by John Michalik and Judy Anderson, October 2012

CITATION UPON INDUCTION INTO THE COLLEGE
For 20 years, Richard Nigon has been a “poster child” for what it means to be dedicated to your profession and to improving and enhancing the quality of law practice management. He has been a catalyst for positive approaches to financial leadership and reasonableness in changing economic times. Dick’s contributions to improving the administration of justice and for being an “unsung hero” in law firm management have been honored by county and state bar associations in Minnesota. The place he holds in the esteem and hearts of his professional colleagues is reflected in being one of only nine individuals in ALA’s 40-year history to receive its “Spirit of ALA Award” for commitment, dedication and service to the profession, and – perhaps, most telling – that his home chapter in Minnesota established its scholarship program in his name to honor and recognize his consistent professional involvement, innovation and character. I am pleased to welcome Richard Nigon as a Fellow of the College of Law Practice Management.
—Nominated by John Michalik and Judy Anderson, October 2012
