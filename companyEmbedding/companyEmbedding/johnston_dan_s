VT801
Heavy duty cleaning power house
Robust ConstructionMounted to the sub frame, the hydraulically operated sweeping system is designed to prolong brush life and reduce the cost of ownership. Both channel and wide-sweep brush installations feature quick-change mechanisms which reduce downtime between changeovers. All twin-engine VT Range sweepers are powered by a dedicated high performance auxiliary engine. With a heavy-duty, corrosion-resistant stainless steel body, the Johnston VT801 is robust and built for unrivalled durability.In-Cab ControlsAll sweeping operations are controlled from the master module inside the cab, while all critical systems controls - including the master circuit breaker plus the valves and auxiliary equipment for the pneumatic, hydraulic and water systems - are housed in an easily accessible purpose-built, dust and weatherproof locker. The VT801, in common with all V Range products, comes with waterproof IP67 automotive electrical connectors to enhance reliability.Advanced Air Filter DesignThrough years of experience in sweeper design, Johnston have developed a unique system which creates a cyclone effect within the hopper for efficient filtering of debris and dust particles prior to discharge to atmosphere through mesh filter screens. This unique design is a now a standard feature of all Johnston V Range sweepers. The rear discharge chute directs loads away from the rear of the vehicle, minimising the risk of damage to lamps and other components. The standard load de-watering system allows draining of water from the waste volume.EmissionsThe Johnston VT801 in common with all the V Range is also the first European-manufactured machine to achieve full PM10 test compliance in stringent air quality tests on whole vehicle emissions.

These shoes are very comfortable. I wore them for the first time to an event that was over 6 hours long, standing for much of it, and I had no problems. Another reviewer commented that they were narrow, but I don't feel that way. I have wide feet and they were fine for me. The only thing I'm not too crazy about is the toe box. It is square, not round and you can't tell that from the picture.
