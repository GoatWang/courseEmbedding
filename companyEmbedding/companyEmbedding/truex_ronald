To the Truex Family, 
Sorry for your loss. The Truex "name" was mentioned alot in our house when I was growing up. ....you see my father, was Mr. Ron Dotson, track coach, at Lima Central High and then Lima Senior High.  My father always talked and sang praises for the Truexes.  
My sympathies to the you all.  
Your truly,

Family, friends and past coworkers of Mr. Truex,
I grew up knowing Mr. Truex through the fire department family. My father, Captain Robert D. Huber, worked with Mr. Truex on the fire department where I met him in my youth. He was a man of many talents. Please accept my condolences on his passing. This world will be a lot less colorful without Mr. Truex in it.
Respectfully,
