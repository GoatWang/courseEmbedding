Michael McDermott





Lowe’s Companies, Inc. has announced that Michael P. McDermott has been promoted to chief merchandising officer, replacing Michael A. Jones, who will assume the role of chief customer officer, effective April 30. In addition, the retailer has named Joseph M. (Mike) Mabry as the company’s new strategy and experience design executive, replacing Robert J. Gfeller who left the company last month to pursue a career supporting the prevention and treatment of children’s traumatic injuries. Both Mabry and McDermott will report to Jones. 
“Lowe’s is fortunate to have a strong bench of leaders in Mike McDermott and Mike Mabry to help move our company forward in delivering omni-channel customer experiences,” Jones said.
McDermott will be responsible for the merchandising offering for Lowe’s U.S. business, pricing and promotion, and all global sourcing activities.  He joined Lowe’s in 2013 as svp/general merchandising manager, building and maintenance. McDermott  has more than 20 years of experience in product leadership, merchandising, marketing and commercial sales, having served previously with General Electric, where he was sales leader/appliances and a member of the company’s corporate commercial council.  His prior experience in leading global product management teams, merchandising teams, and driving innovation will be key assets to drive growth for Lowe’s, the company said. 
“Mike McDermott is an accomplished business leader and, during his time at Lowe’s, has helped develop the 2014 merchandising plan as well as processes to improve the building and maintenance brand portfolio to make it more relevant to both Pro and DIY customers,” said Jones.
Mabry will focus on developing U.S. strategy, aligning experience design and building a capabilities roadmap that delivers compelling, differentiating, omni-channel customer experiences across the company’s U.S. business.  He will retain responsibility for digital interfaces, including Lowes.com and ATGstores.com. Mabry joined Lowe’s in 2003 and led the company’s supply chain organization until 2012 when he was named digital interfaces executive.
“Mike Mabry has demonstrated leadership across functions and an outstanding ability to develop a comprehensive roadmap that’s aligned with our strategy,” Jones explained. “His leadership experiences will serve the company well as Mike takes on this important role of developing the U.S. strategy, aligning experience design and building a capabilities roadmap to deliver omni-channel customer experiences that differentiate Lowe’s.
