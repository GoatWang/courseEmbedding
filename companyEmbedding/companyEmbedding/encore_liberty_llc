Liberty Home Products

We are the Valley’s leading awning and shade specialist. We’ve been manufacturing and installing patio shades and retractable awnings for more than 30 years.
Family owned and operated, Richard Mahon, the founder of Liberty Home Products, began his working career in the U.S. Air Force training in aircraft instrument repair. He was honorably discharged from the Air Force in 1966. He later became a machinist, turned engineer, turned business owner. In 1979, Richard started his own company — Liberty Home Products, Inc. in Denver, Colorado. Richard was able to formulate unique designs utilizing strong, reliable, American-made materials so each accessory or piece of equipment we offer is heavy-duty and resilient. All of our products are engineered and designed by Richard.

In 2001, Richard, his son Steven, his daughter Amy and her husband Frank began an addition to the business in Phoenix, Arizona, under the same name – Liberty Home Products, LLC. The Phoenix location concentrated on providing home products specific to shade.
Today, we carry on the tradition of high-quality, American-made products, engineered for comfort and peace of mind.
