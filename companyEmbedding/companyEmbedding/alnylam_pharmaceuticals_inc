About
Alnylam




A World of Discovery at Alnylam
Alnylam is leading the translation of RNA interference (RNAi) into a whole new class of innovative medicines with the potential to transform the lives of patients who have limited or inadequate treatment options. Based on Nobel Prize-winning science, RNAi therapeutics represent a powerful, clinically validated approach for the treatment of a wide range of debilitating diseases with high unmet medical need. Alnylam was founded in 2002 on a bold vision to turn scientific possibility into reality, which is now marked by its robust discovery platform and deep pipeline of investigational medicines, including 3 programs in late-stage clinical development.




What’s in a Name?
Our name may not be the easiest to pronounce, but once you learn it, you’ll never forget it. Alnylam is derived from “Alnilam,” the center star in Orion’s belt, which shines the brightest of them all. It is also the Arabic word for “string of pearls.”

 







From Possibility to Patients: What’s in a Name

 


Mission, Vision, and Values
Alnylam was founded on a revolutionary vision and bold mission, which remain firmly in place today. We are a growing biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics based on RNAi.

From Possibility to Patients: The Scientific Odyssey – The RNAi Boom

 



RNAi BOOM
There was a time when interest in RNAi boomed. Everyone wanted a piece of it. Excitement for this promising new approach for treating disease drew in multiple pharmaceutical players, millions of dollars, and ambition to be the first to unlock the power of this new discovery.


 







From Possibility to Patients: The Scientific Odyssey – The Dark Ages

 



The Dark Ages
Alnylam faced many challenges in its early history. The dissolution of major partnerships led to turmoil and a loss of faith in the technology outside the walls of Alnylam. Within the company, there remained unwavering belief, continued focus, enthusiasm and drive to make RNAi therapeutics a reality.


 







From Possibility to Patients: The Scientific Odyssey – The Slope of Enlightenment

 



The Slope of Enlightenment
After overcoming seemingly insurmountable challenges, Alnylam has built a robust Research & Development engine and a deep pipeline of investigational RNAi therapeutics with the potential to address a broad spectrum of diseases. Today, Alnylam is dedicated to proving that innovative science, perseverance, and passion can come together to improve the lives of patients.

Alnylam Presents New Data on Fitusiran at EAHAD

02.02.2017


- New Phase 1 Results Demonstrate Effective Bleed Management with

      Replacement Factor and Bypassing Agents During Fitusiran Administration -


- Stability Study Results Support a Greater than Two Year Product

      Shelf-Life at Room Temperature Storage Conditions -



 CAMBRIDGE, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Alnylam

      Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ALNY), the leading RNAi therapeutics

      company today announced new results

      from an exploratory analysis of its Phase 1 study with fitusiran, an

      investigational RNAi therapeutic, in patients with hemophilia A or B

      with or without inhibitors. This analysis of bleed management during

      fitusiran administration showed that breakthrough bleeds were

      effectively managed with replacement factors or bypassing agents, with

      no thromboembolic events. Additionally, results presented from stability

      studies of fitusiran support a greater than two-year shelf life at room

      temperature storage conditions and demonstrated resistance to thermal

      stress, favoring real world handling of the final drug product. These

      data were presented at the 10th Annual Congress of the

      European Association of Haemophilia and Allied Disorders (EAHAD) held

      February 1 - 3, 2017 in Paris, France.

    


      New analyses examined 21 total bleed events in 41 patients treated with

      fitusiran, after achieving greater than 75 percent antithrombin

      lowering. This analysis found that dosing of agents was generally within

      the normal dose range for replacement Factor VIII and Factor IX as well

      as for the bypassing agent rFVIIa, while at the lower end of the range

      for the bypassing agent aPCC. Treatment of all breakthrough bleed events

      resulted in successful hemostasis without any thromboembolic events.

    


      "We are encouraged by this new analysis which provides evidence that

      breakthrough bleeds occurring in patients treated with fitusiran can be

      effectively managed with both replacement factor and bypassing agents,

      with no thromboembolic events. These data, combined with positive recent

      clinical results, continue to support the potential of fitusiran as a

      once-monthly subcutaneous investigational medicine for the management of

      hemophilia," said Akin Akinc, Ph.D., Vice President and General Manager,

      Fitusiran. "Furthermore, data continue to support the robust stability

      profile of fitusiran, potentially facilitating treatment in regions

      where cold chain storage requirements represent a challenge to patients'

      access to effective therapies. We continue to advance toward the start

      of our ATLAS Phase 3 clinical program in early 2017."

    


      An evaluation of fitusiran at refrigerated (i.e., 5ºC), customary room

      temperature (i.e., 25ºC/60 percent relative humidity) and at accelerated

      aging conditions (i.e., 40ºC) demonstrated a robust stability profile,

      with all key quality attributes predicted to be retained at both

      refrigerated and room temperature conditions for at least 24 months.

      Further, fitusiran has shown resistance to thermal stress and cyclic

      temperature fluctuations that may occur during real world storage and

      handling of the drug product. Consequently, the stability profile of

      fitusiran could enable convenient transportation and storage, including

      in parts of the world where cold chain delivery is a challenge.

About Fitusiran



      Fitusiran is a subcutaneously administered, investigational RNAi

      therapeutic targeting antithrombin (AT) for the treatment of hemophilia

      A and B and rare bleeding disorders (RBD) currently in early stage

      clinical development. Fitusiran is designed to lower levels of AT with

      the goal of promoting sufficient thrombin generation to restore

      hemostasis and prevent bleeding in patients with hemophilia and RBD. AT,

      also known as "antithrombin III" and "SERPINC1" is a liver-expressed

      plasma protein and member of the "serpin" family of proteins that acts

      by inactivating thrombin and other coagulation factors. AT plays a key

      role in normal hemostasis by helping to limit the process of fibrin clot

      formation. However, in hemophilia, insufficient thrombin generation

      results in impaired fibrin clot formation. Lowering AT in the hemophilia

      setting may promote the generation of sufficient levels of thrombin

      needed to form an effective fibrin clot and prevent bleeding. This

      rationale is supported by human genetic data suggesting that

      co-inheritance of thrombophilic mutations, including AT deficiency, may

      ameliorate bleeding in hemophilia. Lowering of AT is a unique and

      innovative strategy for restoring hemostasis in people with hemophilia.

      Fitusiran utilizes Alnylam's ESC-GalNAc conjugate technology, which

      enables subcutaneous dosing with increased potency and durability and a

      wide therapeutic index.

    

About Fitusiran Phase 1 Study



      The ongoing Phase 1 trial of fitusiran is being conducted in the United

      States, Bulgaria, Russia, Switzerland, and the U.K. as a single- and

      multi-dose, dose-escalation study comprised of four parts. Part A -

      which is complete - was a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled,

      single-dose, dose-escalation study (N=4 per cohort; 3:1 randomization of

      fitusiran:placebo) in healthy volunteers. This part of the study was

      completed after the first dose cohort received a single subcutaneous

      dose of fitusiran at 30 mcg/kg. Part B of the study - which is also

      complete - was an open-label, multi-dose, dose-escalation study that

      enrolled 12 patients with severe hemophilia A or B. Patients in Part B

      received three weekly subcutaneous injections of fitusiran at doses of

      15, 45, or 75 mcg/kg. Part C of the study - which has completed dosing -

      is an open-label, multi-dose, dose escalation study that enrolled 18

      patients with moderate or severe hemophilia A or B without inhibitors.

      Twelve patients in Part C received three monthly subcutaneous doses of

      fitusiran at doses of 225, 450, 900, or 1800 mcg/kg. In addition, six

      patients in Part C received three fixed monthly subcutaneous doses of

      fitusiran at 80 mg. Part D was designed to enroll up to 18 patients with

      inhibitors. Patients in Part D received 3 fixed monthly subcutaneous

      doses of fitusiran at 50 mg or 80 mg. The primary objective of Parts B,

      C, and D of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of

      multiple doses of subcutaneously administered fitusiran in patients with

      hemophilia, with and without inhibitors. Secondary objectives include

      assessment of clinical activity as determined by lowering of circulating

      AT levels and increase in thrombin generation at pharmacologic doses of

      fitusiran. In addition, exploratory analyses of bleeding are being

      performed. In the U.K., enrollment has been aided by the Southern

      Academic Coagulation Consortium (SACC).

    

Sanofi Genzyme Alliance



      In January 2014, Alnylam and Sanofi Genzyme, the specialty care global

      business unit of Sanofi, formed an alliance to accelerate and expand the

      development and commercialization of RNAi therapeutics across the world.

      The alliance is structured as a multi-product geographic alliance in the

      field of rare diseases. Alnylam retains product rights in the United

      States, Canada and Western Europe, while Sanofi Genzyme obtained the

      right to access certain programs in Alnylam's current and future Genetic

      Medicines pipeline in the rest of the world through the end of 2019,

      together with certain broader co-development/co-commercialization rights

      and global rights for certain products. Sanofi Genzyme has elected to

      opt in to co-develop (through Sanofi R&D) and co-commercialize fitusiran

      in the United States, Canada and Western Europe, in addition to

      developing and commercializing fitusiran in its rest of world

      territories.

    

About RNAi



      RNAi (RNA interference) is a revolution in biology, representing a

      breakthrough in understanding how genes are turned on and off in cells,

      and a completely new approach to drug discovery and development. Its

      discovery has been heralded as "a major scientific breakthrough that

      happens once every decade or so," and represents one of the most

      promising and rapidly advancing frontiers in biology and drug discovery

      today which was awarded the 2006 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine.

      RNAi is a natural process of gene silencing that occurs in organisms

      ranging from plants to mammals. By harnessing the natural biological

      process of RNAi occurring in our cells, the creation of a major new

      class of medicines, known as RNAi therapeutics, is on the horizon. Small

      interfering RNA (siRNA), the molecules that mediate RNAi and comprise

      Alnylam's RNAi therapeutic platform, target the cause of diseases by

      potently silencing specific mRNAs, thereby preventing disease-causing

      proteins from being made. RNAi therapeutics have the potential to treat

      disease and help patients in a fundamentally new way.

History[edit]
In 2002, Alnylam was founded by scientists Phillip Sharp, Paul Schimmel, David Bartel, Thomas Tuschl, and Phillip Zamore, and by investors Christoph Westphal and John Kennedy Clarke; John Maraganore was the founding CEO.[1][2][3][4] The company was named after Alnilam, a star in Orion’s belt. The spelling was modified to make it unique.[5] In 2003, Alnylam merged with the German pharmaceutical company, Ribopharma AG. The newly formed company also received $24.6 million in funding from private-equity firms.[6][7] On February 27, 2004, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals filed for an IPO.[3][8] The company raised $26 million and began trading as ALNY on the Nasdaq stock exchange.[9]
In 2005, the company partnered with Medtronic to develop drug-device combinations to treat neurodegenerative disorders.[10] Alnylam partnered with Biogen Idec to discover and develop potential treatments of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy in 2006.[11] In July 2007, Alnylam entered into a nonexclusive alliance with the Swiss drug company, Hoffmann-La Roche, in which Alnylam received $331 million upfront in exchange for access to its technology platform.[12] In September 2007, Alnylam partnered with Isis Pharmaceuticals to found the company Regulus Therapeutics, a company focused on discovery, development, and commercialization of microRNA therapeutics.[13]
In 2009, Alnylam formed alliances with Cubist Pharmaceuticals and Kyowa Hakko Kirin to market a drug developed to treat the respiratory syncytial virus.[14] Alnylam expanded its previous collaboration with Medtronic to include the CHDI Foundation in its Huntington's Disease focused research in 2010.[15] In 2011, Alnylam and GlaxoSmithKline partnered together to develop RNAi technology enhancing vaccine production.[16][17] Alnylam entered into a 10-year alliance with Monsanto in 2012, in order to develop biotech solutions for the farming industry by using natural molecules and developing them for use in crop protection.[18][19][20] In October 2012, the company formed a partnership with Sanofi Genzyme to develop and commercialize a treatment for transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis, a hereditary disease in Asia.[21] In February 2013, Alnylam formed a partnership with The Medicines Company to develop and commercialize a drug to treat a genetic form of high cholesterol.[22]
In July 2013, during a Phase I trial Alnylam demonstrated statistically significant reduction of a protein called transthyretin, or TTR and demonstrated human efficacy with intravenous and subcutaneous modes of administration.[23] In 2014, Sanofi Genzyme acquired a 12 percent stake in Alnylam and increased its rights to several of the company's drugs for $700 million. In a separate transaction Alnylam announced that it had purchased Merck & Co.'s Sirna Therapeutics, for $25 million cash and $150 million in stock.[24][25] In 2015, the company had $41 million in revenue and a market cap of $5.2 billion.[26]
In 2016, the company purchased land in Norton, Massachusetts to build a manufacturing facility.[27][28]
In October 2016 the Phase III clinical trial of the company's lead product, revusiran, was halted due to increased deaths in the drug arm of the trial, and the company said it was terminating development of the compound.[29][30]
Therapeutic concept[edit]
Main article: RNA interference
Most drug discovery seeks molecules which associate with a "target" associated with a disease and interfere with its function, thus remediating the disease at a molecular level. Examples include small molecule HIV protease inhibitors, which are taken orally, and via the bloodstream, make their way to cells infected with the HIV virus, and block a key enzyme, virally encoded enzyme, HIV protease, by occupying its active site, thereby refusing access of a key viral component, and preventing a key step in the HIV virus life cycle (scission of the HIV polyprotein).
A different approach targets the production of a protein required for the development of the disease. RNAi was discovered to be a natural mechanism for silencing genes through cleavage and degradation of mRNA, first discovered in C. elegans in 1998 by Andrew Fire and Craig Mello.[31] Genes encode the information necessary for cells to synthesize proteins, and proteins made abnormally cause many human diseases. When a mutant gene is silenced, the cell stops making the abnormal protein specified by that gene, potentially improving the course of the disease. In 2001, Alnylam founders began using small interfering RNAs, known as siRNAs, to silence genes by targeting mRNA in mammalian cells.[32]
Products[edit]
In 2016, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals had 18 potential treatments[33] in various development stages across three Strategic Therapeutic Areas (STArs), Genetic Medicine, Cardio-Metabolic Disease and Hepatic Infectious Disease. In late 2016, the company's lead candidate in phase III studies was patisiran, a treatment targeting transthyretin (TTR) for the treatment of TTR-mediated amyloidosis (ATTR), in patients with familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP).[29]

A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER 

















A NEW WAY TO FIGHT CANCER

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

















We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

FlashRatings - All research for my stocks!

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
