With nearly 25 years of service with Bridgestone Americas, Inc., Christine Karbowiak is an Executive Vice President and serves as the company’s Chief Administrative Officer (CAO) and Chief Risk Officer (CRO). In addition, she is a Vice President and Senior Officer of Bridgestone Corporation (BSJ), and also is a member of the boards of Bridgestone Americas, Inc., Bridgestone China Asia Pacific and Bridgestone Brands, LLC.
 
In her roles, Karbowiak oversees all of Bridgestone Americas’ risk and reputation management departments, including communications, environmental, corporate security, safety, industrial hygiene, and internal audit, as well as government relations.

In 2010, she was named Chief Administrative Officer & Executive Vice President, Bridgestone Americas and was elected Vice President and Officer of Bridgestone Corporation a year later.
