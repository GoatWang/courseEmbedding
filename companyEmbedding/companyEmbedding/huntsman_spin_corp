Huntsman Retains Textile Effects Business; Names Spin ‘Venator Materials Corporation’; Amends Form 10


FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASEJanuary 17, 2017The Woodlands, TexasNYSE: HUN
THE WOODLANDS, Texas - Huntsman Corporation (NYSE: HUN) today announced that it has decided to retain the Textile Effects business and exclude it from its planned Pigments and Additives spin-off. Strong pricing recovery for titanium dioxide and the identification of business improvement opportunities representing more than $75 million in annual EBITDA are expected to significantly enhance the financial strength of Venator's business. The $75 million in business improvements are incremental to current earnings and are expected to be completed by the end of 2018.
Huntsman also announced that the name of its planned spin-off will be Venator Materials Corporation. Venator is the Latin word for hunter and is intended, in part, to acknowledge the Huntsman legacy. Venator shares are expected to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker VNTR after the distribution to Huntsman's shareholders, which remains targeted for the second quarter of 2017. 
Peter R. Huntsman, Huntsman Corporation President and CEO, commented:
"We are making significant progress toward the spin-off and are pleased with the Pigments and Additives business recovery. We expect Venator will be a premier pigments company unencumbered by excessive debt or other unrelated liabilities. Improved titanium dioxide pricing combined with the identification of business improvement opportunities that are incremental to current earnings are expected to more than offset the free cash flow that Venator would have received from the Textile Effects business."
"In addition to the progress we are making on the spin of our Pigments and Additives business, we continue to improve our free cash flow generation and grow our downstream differentiated businesses. During 2016, we also repaid approximately $550 million of debt and significantly strengthened our balance sheet."
Form 10
Venator Materials Corporation's Registration Statement on Form 10 is available on Venator's website at www.venatorcorp.com and the SEC's website at www.sec.gov. The completion of the spin-off is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions, including the Registration Statement on Form 10 for Venator Materials Corporation's common stock being declared effective by the SEC and certain other conditions described in the information statement included in the Form 10.
To request a copy of the Venator logo, email karen_fenwick@huntsman.com.

Huntsman plans to spin off its pigments business

By Jordan Blum


July 27, 2016
Updated: July 27, 2016 11:04pm

 


















































































































 

The chief executive of Huntsman Corp. said Wednesday that The Woodlands company plans to spin off its specialty chemical business - rather than sell it - and create a new publicly traded company by early next year.
After debating for many months which route to take, CEO Peter Huntsman said now that the struggling pigments and additives business is becoming profitable again - "back in the black" - his company can gain more value by spinning off the unit and selling shares than by selling it outright. The new company would focus specifically on titanium dioxide chemical, called TiO2, which is used as a pigment for everything from food coloring and paints to coatings and sunscreen.





"A spin allows us to have a process that we can control," Huntsman said, noting that shareholders should benefit. "This is something that has greater certainty behind it."
Huntsman has sought to unload, or at least distance itself, from the titanium dioxide business because its poor performance has weighed on Huntsman's stock price.

Hassan Ahmed,  a chemical industry analyst of New York-based Alembic Global Advisors, said spinning off the unit could prove wise because the titanium dioxide business is cyclical and makes investors wary of Huntsman. In addition, the new company might be attractive to investors now because the pigments industry is out of the cyclical trough, he said.
"Giving a timeline - rather than some pie-in-the-sky thing - is better than expected," Ahmed said of the spinoff.
Last year was termed a transition year for Huntsman after the 2014 purchase of $1 billion in plants and other assets from Rockwood Holdings, a chemical company owned by Albemarle Corp. of Charlotte, N.C. Huntsman's biggest financial drag has been its titanium dioxide plants, some of which were purchased from Rockwood. Huntsman is in the process of closing its smallest titanium dioxide plant, which is in South Africa.
The company began eliminating at least 900 jobs last year, most of them at three titanium dioxide manufacturing plants in Germany and Finland.
Huntsman, which employs more than 1,000 people in the Houston area, has dual headquarters in Texas and Utah, which is the seat of the Huntsman family dynasty in Utah. Peter Huntsman's brother, Jon, is a former Utah governor and GOP presidential candidate.
Huntsman Corp. reported that its profit for the second quarter tripled from the same period a year earlier, due in part to cost cutting. Profit rose to $87 million from $29 million in 2015, even though the specialty chemical company's revenue fell to $2.5 billion from $2.7 billion last year.
Despite the profit, Huntsman's net earnings are below its historic norms. Huntsman's stock fell Wednesday to $15.61 per share, down 50 cents.

Huntsman names spinoff Venator Materials Corp.

Posted by         Jordan Blum

Date: January 17, 2017






The Woodlands-based Huntsman Corp. chemicals giant will name its pigments business after the latin word for hunter — a play off of the family name — as it spins off into its own company this spring.
The new Venator Materials Corp. will start trading by the end of June as its own company under the stock ticker “VNTR,” Huntsman announced Tuesday.
Huntsman President and Chief Executive Peter Huntsman said the legacy company though will retain the textile effects business, which originally was to be included in the spinoff. The business makes dyes and chemicals that offer qualities such as sun protection, built-in freshness and imaging effects for textiles and other products.
Huntsman said last year it planned to spin off its pigments business in 2017. The new Venator would focus largely on the titanium dioxide chemical, called TiO2, which is used as a pigment for everything from food coloring and paints to coatings and sunscreen. The business is more cyclical than Huntsman’s other divisions and prone to more financial peaks and valleys. Huntsman values the business at more than $2 billion.
“We expect Venator will be a premier pigments company unencumbered by excessive debt or other unrelated liabilities,” Peter Huntsman said in Tuesday’s announcement.
Huntsman Corp. became the world’s second-largest pigments producer two years ago after buying more than $1 billion in plants from New York-based Rockwood Holdings.
But the timing was bad, Huntsman admitted. The pigments business is cyclical, dominated by four or five large paint companies whose buying decisions drive the cycle up or down.
Huntsman said he bought the Rockwood assets at a good price during a cyclical low, but that trough lasted two years longer than expected and dragged down the value of Huntsman Corp.
He said the company is already eyeing potential mergers or acquisitions that could be made with proceeds from the spinoff and wouldn’t rule out making deals before the new company goes public next year.
After the company went public in 2005, Huntsman moved the family business from Utah, where it was founded, to The Woodlands, where it would be closer to its plants, customers, and supplies of natural gas that provide the feedstock for petrochemicals. Huntsman today employs about 15,000 people in 30 countries, including more than 1,300 in the Houston area.

The Woodlands-based Huntsman Corp. (NYSE: HUN) has released more information about the long-planned spinoff of its pigments and additives business.
On Jan. 17, Huntsman announced the new company would be named Venator Materials Corp. Venator is the Latin word for “hunter,” a nod to the spinoff’s “Huntsman” roots.

Venator is expected to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “VNTR” after the distribution to Huntsman shareholders. The spinoff is expected to occur in the second quarter.




Also on Jan. 17, Huntsman said it decided to retain its textile effects business rather than spin it off as part of Venator.
“We are making significant progress toward the spinoff and are pleased with the pigments and additives business recovery,” Huntsman Corp. President and CEO Peter Huntsman said in a press release. “We expect Venator will be a premier pigments company unencumbered by excessive debt or other unrelated liabilities. Improved titanium dioxide pricing combined with the identification of business improvement opportunities that are incremental to current earnings are expected to more than offset the free cash flow that Venator would have received from the textile effects business.”
Huntsman has been planning to separate its pigments and additives division through either a spinoff to shareholders or other strategic transaction for some time now. The company restructured the division — including announcing 900 job cuts in December 2014 and closing its titanium dioxide manufacturing facility in South Africa last year— in preparation for the split.




 


An initial public offering was planned for the division shortly after Huntsman announced it would pay $1.1 billion in cash to acquire the pigment business of Princeton, New York-based Rockwood Holdings Inc. (NYSE: ROC) in September 2013.

Huntsman to Spin Off Pigments Business

							Wednesday, November 9, 2016 More items for 
		
		Coatings Technology




       | More

























	Huntsman Corporation, an American-based global chemical manufacturer with more than $10 billion in revenue last year, is looking to move ahead with a plan to spin off its Pigments & Additives business into its own company, with a focus on titanium dioxide.

	The Woodlands, TX-based manufacturer, which produces products including polyurethanes and epoxies, filed an initial Form 10 registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Oct. 28, it said when announcing its third quarter financial results.

	Form 10, also known as the General Form for Registration of Securities, is used to register securities for trading on U.S. exchanges and is used by analysts and private investors when making investment decisions.








Huntsman




Huntsman Corporation has announced it has filed the necessary paperwork to continue with plans to spin off its Pigments & Additives division a new publicly traded company.





	“This filing represents an important step in the progression towards a separation,” President and CEO Peter R. Huntsman said in a statement. “Subject to market conditions we plan to separate in the first half of 2017.”

	The subsidiary, temporarily named Huntsman Spin Corporation, also includes its Textile Effects business.

Profitable Segment

	The plan to spin off rather than sell the business was announced in July, after the pigments and additives business became profitable again, following a period of poor performance.

	When business was down, Huntsman attempted to distance itself from the titanium dioxide (TiO2) business, according to the Houston Chronicle, and even began eliminate about 900 jobs in 2015, primarily at most of them at three TiO2 manufacturing plants in Germany and Finland.

	However, once business improved, the company determined it would be better served to spin off the unit and sell shares instead of selling it outright.

	Huntsman’s Form 10 included a business overview, market information, company strengths and strategy, certain named executive management and historical carve-out financial statements.

	Based on the filing, the pigments spinoff company will be based in Stockton-On-Tees, U.K., chemical industry information provider ICIS reported.

	The new entity will reportedly operate 47 facilities, with 7,500 employees catering to approximately 10,000 customers in more than 100 countries.

Focus on TiO2 

	The spinoff business will focus primarily on TiO2 production, with an anticipated production capacity of 782,000 tonnes a year, it said.

The spinoff business will focus primarily on TiO2 production, with a production capacity expected to place it as one of three largest titanium dioxide producers in the world.





	According to ICIS, this will position the spinoff as one of three largest producers in the world, contributing 11 percent of global capacity.

	Although the company said it saw seasonally lower volumes for additives products in the third quarter, it reported an increase in end use demand for its titanium dioxide products. 

	“TiO2 prices are improving and with additional increases expected in the future, the timing of our spin-off should be well positioned,” Huntsman said.

	In addition to TiO2, the spinoff is also slated to produce color pigments, functional additives, timber-treatment products and water-treatment chemicals.

	The spinoff's pigments and additives segment will reportedly operate 28 plants in 10 countries with a total capacity of 1.3 million tonnes per year. This includes plans for 13 color-pigment manufacturing and processing plants, which will make iron-oxide and other pigments.

	Additionally, it will have a functional additives facility in Europe. This area includes barium- and zinc-based inorganic chemicals used to make colors brighter, coatings shine and protect against fading, ICIS explained.

Executive Structure

	According to the filing, Simon Turner, who is now division president of Huntsman's pigment business, will take on the role of CEO.

	Kurt Ogden, vice president of investor relations, will become chief financial officer.

	The chief operating officer will be Rohit Aggarwal. He is currently the division president of Huntsman's textile-effects business.

	Additional information regarding capitalization, additional pro forma information and other matters will be provided in subsequent amendments to the Form 10, the company said.

	A final company name is expected to be announced in the first quarter of 2017.
