Michael's Products - Pharmacy Grade Natural Therapies


Feel fresh, renewed and enriched with Michael’s.
In 1998 two Western Australian Pharmacists had a vision: to create pharmacist formulated, quality therapeutic skin care products using local and natural ingredients.


Since then, the father and son team at Michael’s Products have developed a comprehensive brand of affordable, quality skin and healthcare products.
