Global leadership in hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) biology. Dedicated to advancing care for serious disease.



ELEVATION 5,300 ft

About



Global leadership in hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) biology. Dedicated to advancing care for serious disease.
Pursuing advances across multiple disease states.
We were founded in 2007 to discover and develop novel therapeutic solutions leveraging hypoxia inducible factor—or HIF—biology, a primary regulator involved in multiple major biological pathways.

Our strategy is to develop novel therapeutics for patients based on the biology of HIF and to commercialize products for patients with kidney disease, beginning with vadadustat (also known as AKB-6548) for patients with anemia secondary to chronic kidney disease (CKD). We intend to:


Complete the development of vadadustat for anemia secondary to CKD.

We announced positive top-line results from our Phase 2 studies in patients with anemia secondary to dialysis-dependent CKD (DD-CKD) and non–dialysis-dependent CKD (NDD-CKD). Following the successful End-of-Phase 2 discussions with US and European regulatory agencies, we launched our Phase 3 program known as PRO2TECT in the NDD-CKD population in December 2015. We recently announced that Akebia has reached alignment with both the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency regarding key elements in the Phase 3 INNO2VATE DD-CKD program and we launched the program in August 2016.



Obtain regulatory approval of vadadustat for anemia secondary to CKD in the United States, Europe, and other markets.

We launched a Phase 3 program known as PRO2TECT in the non–dialysis-dependent CKD (NDD-CKD) population in December 2015, and we initiated a parallel Phase 3 program known as INNO2VATE in the dialysis-dependent CKD (DD-CKD) population in August 2016. The Phase 3 programs are designed to support regulatory approvals in major markets worldwide and to collect data required to establish a new standard of care of the treatment of anemia.



Commercialize vadadustat in the United States and seek partnerships in other territories.

We will establish a specialty sales and marketing organization to commercialize vadadustat in the United States.



Continue to develop vadadustat for further indications.

We have completed Phase 2 clinical development for the treatment of patients with anemia secondary to dialysis-dependent CKD (DD-CKD) and non–dialysis-dependent CKD (NDD-CKD), the two indications we are currently pursuing.



Advance pipeline assets.

We plan to advance AKB-6899, a second HIF prolyl hydroxylase (HIF-PH) inhibitor product candidate, which we believe, based on preclinical testing, has the ability to increase erythropoietin (EPO) levels while reducing vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, levels. We intend to file an Investigational New Drug, or IND, application in 2015.



Acquire or in-license additional nephrology products.

If we are able to successfully launch vadadustat, we will look to leverage our commercial infrastructure with additional products that would be prescribed by nephrologists.



We own worldwide rights to our HIF-based product candidates, including vadadustat, and may enter into strategic collaborations to fully realize all of the elements of our strategy.

HIF regulation harnesses the body’s natural strategy for adapting to low oxygen levels

HIF technology



Exploring the promise of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) technology
HIF: A primary regulator involved in multiple major biological pathways

HIF is the primary regulator of the production of red blood cells (RBCs) in the body and a potentially novel mechanism of treating anemia. This novel mechanism of action is referred to as hypoxia inducible factor-prolyl hydroxylase (HIF-PH) inhibitors. HIF-PH inhibitors act by simulating the body’s natural response to anemia. This allows a controlled, adaptive stimulation of the erythropoietic system in the body. This activation of the whole system results in both increased red blood cell (RBC) production and improved stabilization of the bone marrow’s iron supply, which ensures the proper incorporation of iron into hemoglobin necessary for such RBC production. This adaptive simulation is very similar to the natural response that is induced when a person ascends in altitude. At higher altitudes, low levels of oxygen circulating in the bloodstream lead to reduced HIF-PH activity in relevant cells in the kidney and liver. The reduced HIF-PH activity stabilizes and increases intracellular levels of proteins HIF1α and HIF2α (referred to as HIFα collectively). For most cells the stabilization of HIF2α is greater than that of HIF1α, which ultimately leads to an increase in erythropoietin (EPO) secretion and a subsequent increase in RBC production.
HIF-PH inhibitors work by blocking the effect of the prolyl hydroxylase enzymes, which promote the breakdown of HIFα proteins. As the breakdown is inhibited, the level of these HIFα proteins increases in cells. These HIFs are the primary protein mediators that enable the body and all of its individual cells to adapt to changes in levels of oxygen. Both HIFα proteins are consistently produced and their levels in cells are adjusted by the activity of the HIF-PH enzymes, which target the HIFα proteins for degradation. HIF1α helps cells survive under very low oxygen conditions, whereas HIF2α helps cells and the body to adapt to modest changes in oxygen, such that would occur with a change in altitude from sea level to up to 7500 feet.
When HIFα is stabilized, it travels to the nucleus of the cell, where it binds to the protein HIFß. When bound together, they induce the genetic signal for the production of EPO and several other proteins. The HIF-PH inhibitors increase HIFα levels much in the same way that a reduction in oxygen increases HIFα levels by inhibiting the HIF-PH enzymes in the body. With continued stabilization of HIFα (either by staying at higher altitude or by daily dosing of the HIF-PH inhibitor), the level of hemoglobin and RBCs will rise in order to increase the amount of oxygen circulating in the blood. In this way, once-daily dosing of vadadustat (also known as AKB-6548) may have the potential to restore the normal level of EPO for a patient with anemia.
Vadadustat, our lead compound in development, works by inhibiting HIF-PH, leading to stabilization and increased levels of HIFα, and improved production of hemoglobin and RBCs, while maintaining normal levels of EPO in patients. In addition, we believe that vadadustat’s mechanism of action provides for the ability to induce a more prominent HIF2α response (as naturally occurs with a moderate increase in altitude), and an enhancement in the normal diurnal variation of EPO, which is the normal rise and fall of EPO during each day.

Global leadership in hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) biology. Dedicated to advancing care for serious disease.
Pursuing advances across multiple disease states.
We were founded in 2007 to discover and develop novel therapeutic solutions leveraging hypoxia inducible factor—or HIF—biology, a primary regulator involved in multiple major biological pathways.

Our strategy is to develop novel therapeutics for patients based on the biology of HIF and to commercialize products for patients with kidney disease, beginning with vadadustat (also known as AKB-6548) for patients with anemia secondary to chronic kidney disease (CKD). We intend to:


Complete the development of vadadustat for anemia secondary to CKD.

We announced positive top-line results from our Phase 2 studies in patients with anemia secondary to dialysis-dependent CKD (DD-CKD) and non–dialysis-dependent CKD (NDD-CKD). Following the successful End-of-Phase 2 discussions with US and European regulatory agencies, we launched our Phase 3 program known as PRO2TECT in the NDD-CKD population in December 2015. We recently announced that Akebia has reached alignment with both the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency regarding key elements in the Phase 3 INNO2VATE DD-CKD program and we launched the program in August 2016.



Obtain regulatory approval of vadadustat for anemia secondary to CKD in the United States, Europe, and other markets.

We launched a Phase 3 program known as PRO2TECT in the non–dialysis-dependent CKD (NDD-CKD) population in December 2015, and we initiated a parallel Phase 3 program known as INNO2VATE in the dialysis-dependent CKD (DD-CKD) population in August 2016. The Phase 3 programs are designed to support regulatory approvals in major markets worldwide and to collect data required to establish a new standard of care of the treatment of anemia.



Commercialize vadadustat in the United States and seek partnerships in other territories.

We will establish a specialty sales and marketing organization to commercialize vadadustat in the United States.



Continue to develop vadadustat for further indications.

We have completed Phase 2 clinical development for the treatment of patients with anemia secondary to dialysis-dependent CKD (DD-CKD) and non–dialysis-dependent CKD (NDD-CKD), the two indications we are currently pursuing.



Advance pipeline assets.

We plan to advance AKB-6899, a second HIF prolyl hydroxylase (HIF-PH) inhibitor product candidate, which we believe, based on preclinical testing, has the ability to increase erythropoietin (EPO) levels while reducing vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, levels.

We own worldwide rights to our HIF-based product candidates, including vadadustat, and may enter into strategic collaborations to fully realize all of the elements of our strategy.

Better Buy: Organovo Holdings, Inc. vs. Akebia Therapeutics, Inc.
Which stock wins in a head-to-head match-up between Organovo and Akebia Therapeutics?











                Keith Speights
            

                (TMFFishBiz)



            
            Jan 5, 2017 at 10:40AM
            
            





At first glance, Organovo Holdings (NASDAQ:ONVO) versus Akebia Therapeutics (NASDAQ:AKBA) might seem like an apples-and-oranges comparison. Organovo develops 3D bioprinted human tissues, while Akebia has a promising anemia drug in its pipeline.
There are similarities, though. The two companies' market caps are nearly exactly the same -- around $400 million. Wall Street analysts expect both stocks to perform well in 2017. Which stock is the better buy right now? Let's see how Organovo and Akebia stack up against each other.

Image source: Getty Images.
The case for Organovo
The argument for why investors should consider buying Organovo's stock is one word: growth. Shares of the 3D bioprinting leader have soared more than 50% over the last 12 months. Organovo's revenue more than quadrupled in its most recent reported quarter compared to the prior year period. CEO Keith Murphy predicts triple-digit percentage growth for the next several years. Organovo is racking up this kind of growth in a couple of ways.
First, the company is driving increased adoption of its 3D human tissues through a concerted effort to educate prospective customers about the benefits of its products. Organovo has enlisted the help of several large customers to highlight the capabilities of 3D tissues to detect toxicity levels very early in the development process through conference presentations and scientific publications.
Second, Organovo is rolling out new products and services. The company launched its second product, 3D human kidney tissue, in September, following success for its 3D liver tissue. Organovo plans to offer metabolism studies to customers in the near future, a move that could double its annual revenue potential. In October, the company also announced plans to develop bioprinted human liver tissue for direct transplantation to patients.   
Although Organovo's revenue is growing rapidly, it's still really low. In its last quarter, the company reported revenue of less than $1.4 million. Over one-fourth of that revenue came from collaborations and grants rather than sales of its products and services. However, Organovo's management team believes the company could ultimately generate annual revenue of more than $200 million.
The case for Akebia Therapeutics
Akebia, on the other hand, hasn't experienced real growth. Its stock dropped 17% in 2016. The biotech hasn't generated any product revenue yet. So what's the investment case for Akebia? Potential.
The company currently has two late-stage clinical studies in progress evaluating experimental drug vadadustat in treating anemia related to chronic kidney disease (CKD). Around 30 million Americans suffer from CKD, with approximately 1.8 million of them experiencing anemia related to the disease. Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) are currently used to treat this anemia, but they can cause hemoglobin levels to increase too much.
Vadadustat holds the potential to treat anemia related to CKD and keep hemoglobin levels within a desired range. Even better, the drug should be able to be used in treating both dialysis and non-dialysis patients. Japanese drugmaker Otsuka Pharmaceutical liked vadadustat's prospects enough to shell out $125 million up front for marketing rights and commit to potential milestone payments of up to $765 million.
Analysts project that Akebia's share price will increase by more than 50% over the next 12 months in anticipation of late-stage study results for vadadustat. The first study (for non-dialysis CKD) should wrap up in late 2018 with the second study concluding in the third quarter of 2019.





Better buy
Which of these stocks is the better pick for investors? It's a question of risk versus reward.
Organovo probably has less risk. The company already has two products on the market and doesn't face any large competitors with 3D tissue offerings. However, Organovo's revenue ceiling is lower than Akebia's, so the potential rewards are also less.
Akebia faces three primary risks. One is that vadadustat fails to win regulatory approval. Another risk is that Akebia's drug gets beaten by a rival product. Fibrogen (NASDAQ:FGEN) is developing its own drug, roxadustat, to treat anemia in CKD patients using a similar approach as Akebia. The biotech has several late-stage clinical studies in progress for roxadustat that are scheduled to complete later this year. Akebia also has a risk that it will lose in patent litigation against Fibrogen.
Despite these risks, I think Akebia has a good shot at success over the long run -- with a significantly higher peak revenue potential than Organovo. I like Organovo, but the better buy in this case appears to be Akebia.
