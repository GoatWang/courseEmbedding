Why Energy Infrastructure MLPs?
Thematically, MLPs represent an investment in the build-out of US energy infrastructure
                        over the next few decades. MLPs own, operate, and build energy infrastructure assets
                        such as pipelines, storage facilities, and processing plants.

Investment Objectives
The Fund seeks investment results that replicate as closely as possible, before fees and expenses, the performance of the S-Network Sector Dividend Dogs Index (the "Underlying Index").
Strategy
This Strategy provides the following potential benefits:
Starting Universe:

The S&P 500 Index
High Conviction Tilt Towards Income:
Screening is isolated at the sector level, providing high dividend exposure by selecting the five highest yielding securities in each of the 10 GICS sectors.
Sector and Stock Diversification:
Equally weighting at the stock and sector level provides diversification while avoiding sector biases.

$10,000 Hypothetical Investment

ALPS Sector Dividend Dogs ETF (NAV)
S-Network Sector Dividend Dogs Total Return Index



The chart above represents the total return historical performance of a hypothetical investment of $10,000 in the Fund over the life of the Fund. Performance calculations are as of the end of each month. Past performance does not guarantee future results. This chart does not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on Fund distributions or the redemption of Fund shares.

Market Price is based on the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4 p.m. ET and does not represent the returns an investor would receive if shares were traded at other times.
Performance data quoted represent past performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future results so that shares, when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost. The investment return and principal value will fluctuate. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance quoted.

Diversification does not eliminate the risk of experiencing investment losses. IDOG and EDOG are subject to foreign investing risks including currency fluctuations and political uncertainty. Investments in Emerging Markets accentuate these risks.
The ALPS Sector Dividend Dogs Series are subject to the additional risks associated with concentrating its investments in companies in the market sector.
Dogs of the Dow Theory: an investment strategy which proposes that an investor annually select for investment the ten Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks whose dividend is the highest fraction of their price.

Objective
The Fund seeks investment results that correspond (before fees and expenses) generally to the price and yield performance of its underlying index, the Alerian MLP Infrastructure Index (the "Index"). 
Description
The Alerian MLP ETF (NYSE Arca: AMLP) delivers exposure to the Alerian MLP Infrastructure Index (NYSE: AMZI), a capped, float-adjusted, capitalization-weighted composite of energy infrastructure Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) that earn the majority of their cash flow from the transportation, storage, and processing of energy commodities. 
Why Energy Infrastructure MLPs?

Thematically, MLPs represent an investment in the build-out of US energy infrastructure over the next few decades. MLPs own, operate, and build energy infrastructure assets such as pipelines, storage facilities, and processing plants.
Energy renaissance drives growth. Billions of investment dollars are required for infrastructure to keep pace with the boom in domestic production of natural gas and oil. 
Toll-road business models MLPs possess regional monopoly footprints and benefit from inflation-hedged contracts and inelastic energy demand.
Income potential MLPs pay out the majority of their operating cash flow as quarterly dividends.

Market Price is based on the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4 p.m. ET and does not represent the returns an investor would receive if shares were traded at other times.

The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. The ETF accrues deferred income taxes for future tax liabilities associated with the portion of Master Limited Partnership (MLP) distributions considered to be a tax-deferred return of capital and for any net operating gains as well as capital appreciation of its investment. This deferred tax liability is reflected in the daily NAV and as a result the MLP fund's after-tax performance could differ significantly from the underlying assets even if the pre-tax performance is closely tracked.
The Fund is classified for federal income tax purposes as a taxable regular corporation or so-called Subchapter "C" corporation. As a "C" corporation, the Fund accrues deferred tax liability for its future tax liability associated with the capital appreciation of its investments and the distributions received by the Fund on equity securities of master limited partnerships considered to be a return of capital and for any net operating gains. The Fund's accrued deferred tax liability, if any, is reflected each day in the Fund's net asset value per share. The deferred income tax expense/(benefit) represents an estimate of the Fund's potential tax expense/(benefit) if it were to recognize the unrealized gains/(losses) in the portfolio. An estimate of deferred income tax expense/(benefit) is dependent upon the Fund's net investment income/(loss) and realized and unrealized gains/(losses) on investments and such expenses may vary greatly from year to year and from day to day depending on the nature of the Fund's investments, the performance of those investments and general market conditions. Therefore, any estimate of deferred income tax expense/(benefit) cannot be reliably predicted from year to year.
Under current law, the Fund is not eligible to elect treatment as a regulated investment company due to its investments primarily in MLPs. The Fund must be taxed as a regular corporation for federal income purposes. Whereas the NAV of Fund Shares is reduced by the accrual of any deferred tax liabilities, the Alerian MLP Infrastructure Index is calculated without any tax deductions.
Investments in securities of MLPs involve risks that differ from an investment in common stock. MLPs are controlled by their general partners, which 
generally have conflicts of interest and limited fiduciary duties to the MLP, 
which may permit the general partner to favor its own interests over the MLPs.
The benefit you are expected to derive from the Fund's investment in MLPs depends largely on the MLPs being treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, an MLP has no federal income tax liability at the entity level. Therefore, treatment of one or more MLPs as a corporation for federal income tax purposes could affect the Fund's ability to meet its investment objective and would reduce the amount of cash available to pay or distribute to you. Legislative, judicial, or administrative changes and differing interpretations, possibly on a retroactive basis, could negatively impact the value of an investment in MLPs and therefore the value of your investment in the Fund.
The Fund invests primarily in energy infrastructure companies which may be 
adversely affected by changes in worldwide energy prices, exploration, production spending, government regulation, changes in exchange rates, depletion of natural resources and risks that arise from extreme weather conditions.
All K-1s are received and processed by the Alerian MLP ETF. The Alerian MLP ETF distributes a single Form 1099 to its shareholders. This notice is provided to you for informational purposes only, and should not be considered tax advice. Please consult your tax advisor for further assistance. 
There are risks involved with investing in ETFs including the loss of money. An investment in the Fund is subject to investment risk including the possible loss of the entire principal amount that you invest.
If, due to tax law changes, an MLP in the portfolio is deemed a corporation rather than a partnership for federal income purposes, then income would be subject to federal taxation at the MLP level. This would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to the fund which could result in a reduction of the fund's value. The Fund is taxed as a regular corporation for federal income purposes, which reduces the Net Asset Value of fund shares by the accrual of any deferred tax liabilities. Depending on the taxes paid by the fund as a result of income and/or gains from investments and/or the sale of MLP interests, the return on an investment in the Fund will be reduced. This differs from most investment companies, which elect to be treated as "regulated investment companies" to avoid paying entity level income taxes. The ETF is taxed as a regular corporation and is subject to U.S. federal income tax on taxable income at the corporate tax rate (currently as high as 35%) as well as state and local taxes.

About ALPS







Our History
Our Approach
Management






Our History

ALPS is a comprehensive financial services company offering a variety of services to the investment management industry. With over 25 years of experience, we have developed a strong track record of innovation in the asset management, asset servicing and asset gathering business. ALPS entered the ETF market as one of the first service providers in 1995 and has since grown to become the 4th largest distributor of ETFs in the US. In 2007, we expanded our capabilities as an asset manager, specializing in satellite and alternative investment strategies that are designed to help advisors and Institutional Investors build better portfolios.
Our approach involves asset class and manager evaluation, seeking to partner with best-in-class index providers and sub-advisors to deliver portfolio solutions that help improve diversification and provide exposure to attractive investment themes. By utilizing Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and Open-End Mutual Funds, we are able to provide asset class exposure that is registered, liquid and transparent.





Our Approach

ALPS offers innovative investment solutions that help advisors and investors build better portfolios. Through both our alternative investment products and access to specialty asset managers we strive to deliver portfolio solutions that allow investors to diversify their core holdings and obtain exposure to attractive investment themes. Our exposure to alternatives and specialty managers is achieved primarily through exchange-traded funds, exchange-traded products, closed-end funds and open-end funds so that we can provide access that is registered, liquid and fully transparent.

The fund may allocate to various fixed income asset classes, such as high yield, mortgage backed securities and corporate debt, without constraint but is limited to no more than 50% allocation to securities denominated in foreign currencies and no more than 50% allocation in emerging market debt. The average duration of the fund is expected to be between two and ten years, under normal conditions.

The credit ratings typically range from AAA (highest) to D (lowest). The rating is not a recommendation to buy or sell a particular bond.

RiverFront Dynamic Unconstrained Income ETF
P.O. Box 44386
Denver, CO 80203








Market Price is based on the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4 p.m. ET and does not represent the returns an investor would receive if shares were traded at other times.

Performance data quoted represent past performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future results so that shares, when redeemed may be worth more or less than their original cost. The investment return and principal value will fluctuate. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance quoted.
The performance of the Fund relative to its benchmark will depend largely on the decisions of the RiverFront Investment Group, LLC (the "Sub-Adviser" or 
"RiverFront") as to strategic asset allocation and tactical adjustments made to the asset allocation. At times, RiverFront's judgments as to the asset classes in which the Fund should invest may prove to be wrong, as some asset classes may perform worse than others or the equity markets generally from time to time or for extended periods of time. The performance of the Fund is related to the economic sectors that RiverFront may choose to emphasize or deemphasize from time to time, as well as to the individual securities selected by RiverFront within those sectors. The investment returns for particular economic sectors will fluctuate and may be lower than other sectors. In addition, the individual securities chosen for investment within a particular sector may underperform other securities within that same sector. Certain stocks selected for the Fund's portfolio may decline in value more than the overall stock markets. 
The value of the Fund's investments in fixed-income securities will generally decrease when interest rates rise, which means the Fund's NAV will likewise 
decrease.
The RiverFront Dynamic Unconstrained Income ETF is not suitable for all investors. Subject to investment risks, including possible loss of the principal amount invested.
RiverFront's Price Matters® discipline compares inflation-adjusted current prices relative to their long-term trend to help identify extremes in valuation.
ALPS Advisors, Inc. is the investment adviser to the Fund and RiverFront Investment Group, LLC is the investment sub-adviser. ALPS is not affiliated with RiverFront Investment Group, LLC.

Our History

ALPS is a comprehensive financial services company offering a variety of services to the investment management industry. With over 25 years of experience, we have developed a strong track record of innovation in the asset management, asset servicing and asset gathering business. ALPS entered the ETF market as one of the first service providers in 1995 and has since grown to become the 4th largest distributor of ETFs in the US. In 2007, we expanded our capabilities as an asset manager, specializing in satellite and alternative investment strategies that are designed to help advisors and Institutional Investors build better portfolios.
Our approach involves asset class and manager evaluation, seeking to partner with best-in-class index providers and sub-advisors to deliver portfolio solutions that help improve diversification and provide exposure to attractive investment themes. By utilizing Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and Open-End Mutual Funds, we are able to provide asset class exposure that is registered, liquid and transparent.





Our Approach

ALPS offers innovative investment solutions that help advisors and investors build better portfolios. Through both our alternative investment products and access to specialty asset managers we strive to deliver portfolio solutions that allow investors to diversify their core holdings and obtain exposure to attractive investment themes. Our exposure to alternatives and specialty managers is achieved primarily through exchange-traded funds, exchange-traded products, closed-end funds and open-end funds so that we can provide access that is registered, liquid and fully transparent.

About ALPS






 "Do Things Right" that is our commitment to you 









Our History
ALPS Today
Our Philosophy
Our Focus
Guiding Principles







Our History

ALPS, celebrating over 30 years of customized and innovative service to the mutual fund industry, traces its roots to changes in the Glass-Steagall banking laws back in the early 1980's. Indeed, with the financial institutions deregulation act, a wide range of securities, insurance and other financial products suddenly became available to banks and thrift institutions, and banks across the country were getting into the mutual fund business.
It was inside that emerging market that company founders Bob Alexander and Art Lucey, both executives with the First National Bank of Denver, saw opportunity. Specifically, they saw a chance to create a company that provided certain specialized services that banks could not themselves offer. And so it was that in June of 1985, ALPS came to be.

  




ALPS Today

In almost three decades, ALPS has evolved from its modest beginnings of servicing a single bank mutual fund client into a full-service provider to the investment management industry. Now with more than 660 employees, over 400 clients, and an executive team that's been in place for over 20 years, ALPS continues to actively promote all of its various business segments, from asset servicing through ALPS Fund Services, Inc. to asset gathering through ALPS Distributors, Inc. and ALPS Advisors, Inc.


With a combination of expertise in a broad range of products and a culture built around the founders' encouragement to "Do Things Right," ALPS is uniquely positioned in the industry to help its clients' structure, service and distribution of all product types.







Our Philosophy


We consider ourselves to be a partner to our clients, not a vendor, by providing service beyond what is required in our contracts. As highlighted in our Guiding Principles, ALPS was founded on the premise to always "Do Things Right" and this motto still flourishes within our company today.



Management at ALPS has made a conscious decision to control growth so that we never have to compromise our service levels or our reputation in the industry for delivering tailored, high-touch services to our clients. By following this philosophy, ALPS has demonstrated a consistent ability over the years to grow revenues while maintaining high levels of service and excellence.



Truly customized service requires care and forethought. To ensure we can always fulfill that commitment, we aim to partner with like-minded clients who share our values. Your success is our success; therefore, we maintain a deep commitment to providing a range of high-quality services critical to the growth of your funds. 







Our Focus
ALPS is focused on providing a suite of asset servicing and asset management solutions to the investment management industry. Clients successfully leverage both aspects of ALPS, to combine a top-rated fund servicing model with the expertise needed to develop new products.

ALPS Tops List of Fastest Growing Fund Managers




Denver Firm Leads The Pack In Passive Mutual Fund Asset Growth






February 28, 2013 02:56 PM Eastern Standard Time



DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)--ALPS Advisors, Inc. (ALPS), a leading provider of investment advisory 
      services to the financial services industry, today announced the firm 
      was named one of 2012’s fastest-growing mutual fund managers by Strategic 
      Insight.
    


      The recognition marks the Denver-based firm’s third consecutive year 
      ranked in the top 10 fastest growers. In 2012, ALPS – which more than 
      doubled its assets under management – ranked first in the 
      Passively-Managed Stock and Bond Funds and ETF category and second 
      overall.
    

Strategic Insight, a well-known provider of unbiased mutual fund 
      industry research and business intelligence reports ALPS grew its 
      passive mutual fund assets from $2.7 billion to $5.8 billion across the 
      year.
    

      “That we actually accelerated our rate of growth across such a difficult 
      year tells me our lineup is appealing to the broad investment 
      community,” says Corey Dillon, Senior Vice President and Director of 
      Advisory Services for ALPS Advisors, Inc. “It also tells me our team is 
      doing a terrific job connecting with advisors and investors.”
    

      ALPS partners with best-in-class index providers and sub-advisors to 
      deliver portfolio solutions that help improve diversification and 
      provide exposure to attractive investment themes. Most recently, the 
      firm launched four new exchange-traded funds (ETFs) designed to track a 
      Goldman Sachs proprietary index.
    

      According to Mr. Dillon, his firm’s primary strategy has been to fill 
      niche investment segments with distinctive and well managed solutions.
    

      “I have to think today’s financial advisors and their clients are 
      increasingly more focused on specialized funds and alternative 
      products,” says Mr. Dillon. “We are too, and that reality is allowing us 
      to put together an altogether compelling product offering.”
    

      For the full Strategic Insight report on 2012’s fastest growing 
      managers, visit http://www.sionline.com.
