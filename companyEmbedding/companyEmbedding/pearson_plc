	Innovation


Innovating education through partnerships


We recognise that the only way to keep pace with all the exciting opportunities in education is to challenge the traditional model of developing new ideas.  


In fact, at its core, it’s common sense. It’s about finding smart people - partners and customers inside and outside the company who can positively impact our business and learning outcomes.


Often that's about working with technology partners who can help us put education in the hands of more people around the world, in more inspiring ways. And it's about working with local experts, who know better than anyone what's needed to solve the challenges where they are.
Here are some examples of how we are doing that.


















Affordable learning

Low-cost private schools are an effective way to help drive up the quality of education for all students. 
Affordable learning










Parent Toolkit

We've contributed to a new toolkit to help parents understand their child’s journey from pre-kindergarten through high school.
Parent Toolkit










Build with Pearson

Pearson Developer gives developers access to our content and APIs so they can find innovative new ways to help people learn.

History[edit]
Construction business: 1844 to the 1920s[edit]
The company was founded by Samuel Pearson in 1844 as a building and engineering concern operating in Yorkshire under the name S. Pearson & Son.[4] In 1880, control passed to his grandson Weetman Dickinson Pearson, an engineer, who in 1890 moved the business to London and turned it into one of the world's largest construction companies.[4] Another of its prominent engineers was Ernest William Moir who, after working for Pearson on tunnels in New York City, became the contractor's agent on construction of the Blackwall Tunnel under the River Thames in London between 1892 and 1897.[5][6][7] The company also built the Admiralty Harbour at Dover, the Halifax Dry Dock in Canada, the East River Railway Tunnels in New York City, the Mexican Grand Canal that drained Mexico City, the Tehuantepec Railway in Mexico, and railways and harbours around the world.[8][9] In November 1915, the firm began construction of HM Factory, Gretna, the largest cordite factory in the UK during World War I.[10]
The construction business was shut down in the 1920s.[11] Among its final projects was completion of the Sennar Dam, in Sudan, in 1925.[12]
Publishing business: 1920s to 1990[edit]
In 1919, the firm acquired a 45% stake in the London branch of merchant bankers Lazard Brothers, an interest which was increased to 80% in 1932 during the depression years. Pearson continued to hold a 50% stake until 1999.[13] In 1921, Pearson purchased a number of local daily and weekly newspapers in the United Kingdom, which it combined to form the Westminster Press group.[4]
In 1957, it bought the Financial Times[4] and acquired a 50% stake in The Economist. It purchased the publisher Longman in 1968.[4]
The company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1969.[4] It went on to buy paperback publisher Penguin in 1970,[4] and in 1972, children's imprint Ladybird Books. In 1986, Pearson invested in the British Satellite Broadcasting consortium, which, a few years later merged with Sky TV to form a new company, British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB).[14]
1990 to 2000[edit]
During the 1990s, Pearson acquired a number of TV production and broadcasting assets (including former ITV franchisee Thames Television) and sold most of its non-media assets, under the leadership of future U.S. Congressman Bob Turner. Westminster Press was sold to Newsquest in 1996.[15] Pearson acquired the education division of HarperCollins in 1996 from News Corporation [16] and acquired book publishers Scott Foresman & Co. in 1996.[17] In 1998 Pearson acquired Prentice Hall Textbooks/Simon & Schuster Trade Books from Viacom and merged it with its own education unit, Addison-Wesley Longman to form Pearson Education.[18]
2000 to 2010[edit]
Pearson acquired Dorling Kindersley, the illustrated reference publisher and integrated it within Penguin, in March 2000[19] and then bought acquired National Computer Systems (NCS) in September 2000 so entering the educational assessment and school management systems market in the United States.[20]
In 2002, Pearson sold its 22% stake in RTL Group[21] for 1.5 billion Euros, and then purchased Rough Guides, the travel publisher, and brought it under Penguin. Pearson acquired Edexcel,[22] a provider of qualifications in the UK, in 2003 and acquired about 80% stake in Meximerica Media Inc for $16.5 million for the swelling U.S. Hispanic market in 2004.[23]
Pearson purchased a series of other testing and assessment businesses, including Knowledge Technologies in 2004,[24] AGS in 2005,[25] and National Evaluation Systems[26] and Promissor in 2006.[27] Pearson acquired National Evaluation Systems, a provider of customised state assessments for teacher certification in the US, in April 2006[28] and announced that it had agreed to acquire Harcourt Assessment and Harcourt Education International from Reed Elsevier for $950m in cash in May 2007.[29] Pearson then completed the acquisition of Harcourt Assessment, merging the acquired businesses into Pearson Assessment & Information.[30] Pearson also acquired eCollege, a digital learning technology group for $477m in May 2007.[31]
In February 2008, Pearson announced the sale of its Pearson Data Management Division (formerly the scanner manufacturing and servicing division of NCS Inc.) to Scantron Corporation (part of M&F Worldwide) which had been its main competitor.[32]
Pearson acquired Wall Street English for $145m in 2009[33] and bought the school learning systems division of Sistema Educacional Brasileiro (SEB) for $497m in 2010.[34] Also in 2010, Pearson sold its 61% stake in Interactive Data to investment funds managed by Silver Lake Partners and Warburg Pincus for $2 billion.[35]
2010 to 2020[edit]
In July 2011, Pearson announced the creation of Pearson College, a British degree provider based in London.[36][37] Also in 2011, Pearson acquired Connections Education and agreed to sell its 50% stake in FTSE International Limited to the London Stock Exchange for £450 million.[38] In 2011, Pearson also increased its stake in TutorVista, such that it had a 76% stake, for $127 million.[39]
Pearson entered into talks with rival conglomerate Bertelsmann, over the possibility of combining their respective publishing companies, Penguin Group and Random House in October 2012. The houses are considered two of the "Big Six" publishing companies.[40] On 29 October 2012, Pearson said it would merge Penguin Books with Bertelsmann's Random House to create the world's biggest consumer book publisher.[41] Then in May 2012 Pearson announced its acquisition of GlobalEnglish Corporation, an American Business English software and solutions company, in an all-cash transaction.[42]
In May 2013, Pearson announced a new restructuring plan to invest in digital learning and emerging markets, after predicting weaker earnings.[43]
The change supports the decoupling of the Penguin consumer publishing business into a separate entity with Random House (forming Penguin Random House). The new structure combines the separate education companies, Pearson International and Pearson North America under one Pearson company. Pearson will organize around three global lines of business – School, Higher Education and Professional. The Financial Times Group and Pearson English will form part of Pearson Professional.[44]
In July 2014, Pearson announced it had cut 4,000 jobs, representing 10% of the company's workforce.[45]
Pearson announced on 23 July 2015 that it had agreed to sell the FT Group, which includes business daily Financial Times, to Japanese media group Nikkei for £844 million, or $1.32 billion. The sale does not include FT Group's London property at One Southwark Bridge.[46] In August 2015, Pearson's sold its 50% stake in The Economist to the Agnelli family for £469 million[47] who previously held 4.7% of the group.[48] The remaining 50% of The Economist Group is owned by the Schroders, Cadburys and the Rothschilds.[48]
On 5 November 2015, Pearson announced it was rebranding, including creating a new logo, with a "100% focus" on education.[49][50]
On 3 July 2017, India-based education technology company, Byju's, acquired Tutor Vista and Edurite from Pearson.[51]
On 11 July 2017, Pearson agreed to reduce its holding in Penguin Random House to 25%, by selling a a 22% stake in the business to Bertelsmann.[52]
Operations[edit]
Pearson has two main streams of business:[53]

Global lines of business: focuses on the School, Higher Education and Professional areas (includes textbooks and digital technologies for teachers and students). Pearson's school brands include BTEC, Bug Club, Edexcel, Fronter, GradPoint, Schoolnet, and SuccessNet. Pearson's higher education brands include eCollege, Mastering/MyLabs, Revel, online tutoring (Smarthinking), and Financial Times Publishing.
Geographic streams: focuses on North American market, Growth markets and Core markets

Criticism[edit]
Concerns exist around the amount of influence Pearson, a commercial company, has on public education.[54] Other concerns are around tax avoidance, the high value contracts, and in one instance, laying off teachers to offset the high costs of testing.[55] In 2017, more than six out of ten Pearson's shareholders voted against the chief executive's pay package of £1.5m after the company made a record loss.[56]
United Kingdom[edit]
Pearson owns Edexcel, an education and examination board.[57] Edexcel has produced qualifications which link to Pearson texts, although Edexcel also continues to endorse textbooks published by other companies.[22]
Libyan Investment Authority[edit]
In June 2010, Pearson Plc received notification that the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) founded by Muammar Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a sovereign fund, had acquired 24,431,000 shares within the company via Euroclear. On further investigation, Pearson said the LIA may have acquired an additional 2,141,179 shares, resulting in a total interest of 26,572,179 shares. At the time, this represented a major holding of 3.27% within the company and the investment was worth around £280 million.[58]
Tax Avoidance[edit]
Pearson has been criticised for using offshore tax avoidance schemes involving a host of companies at a service address in Luxembourg.[59]

History[edit]
Construction business: 1844 to the 1920s[edit]
The company was founded by Samuel Pearson in 1844 as a building and engineering concern operating in Yorkshire under the name S. Pearson & Son.[4] In 1880, control passed to his grandson Weetman Dickinson Pearson, an engineer, who in 1890 moved the business to London and turned it into one of the world's largest construction companies.[4] Another of its prominent engineers was Ernest William Moir who, after working for Pearson on tunnels in New York City, became the contractor's agent on construction of the Blackwall Tunnel under the River Thames in London between 1892 and 1897.[5][6][7] The company also built the Admiralty Harbour at Dover, the Halifax Dry Dock in Canada, the East River Railway Tunnels in New York City, the Mexican Grand Canal that drained Mexico City, the Tehuantepec Railway in Mexico, and railways and harbours around the world.[8][9] In November 1915, the firm began construction of HM Factory, Gretna, the largest cordite factory in the UK during World War I.[10]
The construction business was shut down in the 1920s.[11] Among its final projects was completion of the Sennar Dam, in Sudan, in 1925.[12]
Publishing business: 1920s to 1990[edit]
In 1919, the firm acquired a 45% stake in the London branch of merchant bankers Lazard Brothers, an interest which was increased to 80% in 1932 during the depression years. Pearson continued to hold a 50% stake until 1999.[13] In 1921, Pearson purchased a number of local daily and weekly newspapers in the United Kingdom, which it combined to form the Westminster Press group.[4]
In 1957, it bought the Financial Times[4] and acquired a 50% stake in The Economist. It purchased the publisher Longman in 1968.[4]
The company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1969.[4] It went on to buy paperback publisher Penguin in 1970,[4] and in 1972, children's imprint Ladybird Books. In 1986, Pearson invested in the British Satellite Broadcasting consortium, which, a few years later merged with Sky TV to form a new company, British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB).[14]
1990 to 2000[edit]
During the 1990s, Pearson acquired a number of TV production and broadcasting assets (including former ITV franchisee Thames Television) and sold most of its non-media assets, under the leadership of future U.S. Congressman Bob Turner. Westminster Press was sold to Newsquest in 1996.[15] Pearson acquired the education division of HarperCollins in 1996 from News Corporation [16] and acquired book publishers Scott Foresman & Co. in 1996.[17] In 1998 Pearson acquired Prentice Hall Textbooks/Simon & Schuster Trade Books from Viacom and merged it with its own education unit, Addison-Wesley Longman to form Pearson Education.[18]
2000 to 2010[edit]
Pearson acquired Dorling Kindersley, the illustrated reference publisher and integrated it within Penguin, in March 2000[19] and then bought acquired National Computer Systems (NCS) in September 2000 so entering the educational assessment and school management systems market in the United States.[20]
In 2002, Pearson sold its 22% stake in RTL Group[21] for 1.5 billion Euros, and then purchased Rough Guides, the travel publisher, and brought it under Penguin. Pearson acquired Edexcel,[22] a provider of qualifications in the UK, in 2003 and acquired about 80% stake in Meximerica Media Inc for $16.5 million for the swelling U.S. Hispanic market in 2004.[23]
Pearson purchased a series of other testing and assessment businesses, including Knowledge Technologies in 2004,[24] AGS in 2005,[25] and National Evaluation Systems[26] and Promissor in 2006.[27] Pearson acquired National Evaluation Systems, a provider of customised state assessments for teacher certification in the US, in April 2006[28] and announced that it had agreed to acquire Harcourt Assessment and Harcourt Education International from Reed Elsevier for $950m in cash in May 2007.[29] Pearson then completed the acquisition of Harcourt Assessment, merging the acquired businesses into Pearson Assessment & Information.[30] Pearson also acquired eCollege, a digital learning technology group for $477m in May 2007.[31]
In February 2008, Pearson announced the sale of its Pearson Data Management Division (formerly the scanner manufacturing and servicing division of NCS Inc.) to Scantron Corporation (part of M&F Worldwide) which had been its main competitor.[32]
Pearson acquired Wall Street English for $145m in 2009[33] and bought the school learning systems division of Sistema Educacional Brasileiro (SEB) for $497m in 2010.[34] Also in 2010, Pearson sold its 61% stake in Interactive Data to investment funds managed by Silver Lake Partners and Warburg Pincus for $2 billion.[35]
2010 to 2020[edit]
In July 2011, Pearson announced the creation of Pearson College, a British degree provider based in London.[36][37] Also in 2011, Pearson acquired Connections Education and agreed to sell its 50% stake in FTSE International Limited to the London Stock Exchange for £450 million.[38] In 2011, Pearson also increased its stake in TutorVista, such that it had a 76% stake, for $127 million.[39]
Pearson entered into talks with rival conglomerate Bertelsmann, over the possibility of combining their respective publishing companies, Penguin Group and Random House in October 2012. The houses are considered two of the "Big Six" publishing companies.[40] On 29 October 2012, Pearson said it would merge Penguin Books with Bertelsmann's Random House to create the world's biggest consumer book publisher.[41] Then in May 2012 Pearson announced its acquisition of GlobalEnglish Corporation, an American Business English software and solutions company, in an all-cash transaction.[42]
In May 2013, Pearson announced a new restructuring plan to invest in digital learning and emerging markets, after predicting weaker earnings.[43]
The change supports the decoupling of the Penguin consumer publishing business into a separate entity with Random House (forming Penguin Random House). The new structure combines the separate education companies, Pearson International and Pearson North America under one Pearson company. Pearson will organize around three global lines of business – School, Higher Education and Professional. The Financial Times Group and Pearson English will form part of Pearson Professional.[44]
In July 2014, Pearson announced it had cut 4,000 jobs, representing 10% of the company's workforce.[45]
Pearson announced on 23 July 2015 that it had agreed to sell the FT Group, which includes business daily Financial Times, to Japanese media group Nikkei for £844 million, or $1.32 billion. The sale does not include FT Group's London property at One Southwark Bridge.[46] In August 2015, Pearson's sold its 50% stake in The Economist to the Agnelli family for £469 million[47] who previously held 4.7% of the group.[48] The remaining 50% of The Economist Group is owned by the Schroders, Cadburys and the Rothschilds.[48]
On 5 November 2015, Pearson announced it was rebranding, including creating a new logo, with a "100% focus" on education.[49][50]
On 3 July 2017, India-based education technology company, Byju's, acquired Tutor Vista and Edurite from Pearson.[51]
On 11 July 2017, Pearson agreed to reduce its holding in Penguin Random House to 25%, by selling a a 22% stake in the business to Bertelsmann.[52]
Operations[edit]
Pearson has two main streams of business:[53]

Global lines of business: focuses on the School, Higher Education and Professional areas (includes textbooks and digital technologies for teachers and students). Pearson's school brands include BTEC, Bug Club, Edexcel, Fronter, GradPoint, Schoolnet, and SuccessNet. Pearson's higher education brands include eCollege, Mastering/MyLabs, Revel, online tutoring (Smarthinking), and Financial Times Publishing.
Geographic streams: focuses on North American market, Growth markets and Core markets

Criticism[edit]
Concerns exist around the amount of influence Pearson, a commercial company, has on public education.[54] Other concerns are around tax avoidance, the high value contracts, and in one instance, laying off teachers to offset the high costs of testing.[55] In 2017, more than six out of ten Pearson's shareholders voted against the chief executive's pay package of £1.5m after the company made a record loss.[56]
United Kingdom[edit]
Pearson owns Edexcel, an education and examination board.[57] Edexcel has produced qualifications which link to Pearson texts, although Edexcel also continues to endorse textbooks published by other companies.[22]
Libyan Investment Authority[edit]
In June 2010, Pearson Plc received notification that the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) founded by Muammar Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a sovereign fund, had acquired 24,431,000 shares within the company via Euroclear. On further investigation, Pearson said the LIA may have acquired an additional 2,141,179 shares, resulting in a total interest of 26,572,179 shares. At the time, this represented a major holding of 3.27% within the company and the investment was worth around £280 million.[58]
Tax Avoidance[edit]
Pearson has been criticised for using offshore tax avoidance schemes involving a host of companies at a service address in Luxembourg.[59]

History[edit]
Construction business: 1844 to the 1920s[edit]
The company was founded by Samuel Pearson in 1844 as a building and engineering concern operating in Yorkshire under the name S. Pearson & Son.[4] In 1880, control passed to his grandson Weetman Dickinson Pearson, an engineer, who in 1890 moved the business to London and turned it into one of the world's largest construction companies.[4] Another of its prominent engineers was Ernest William Moir who, after working for Pearson on tunnels in New York City, became the contractor's agent on construction of the Blackwall Tunnel under the River Thames in London between 1892 and 1897.[5][6][7] The company also built the Admiralty Harbour at Dover, the Halifax Dry Dock in Canada, the East River Railway Tunnels in New York City, the Mexican Grand Canal that drained Mexico City, the Tehuantepec Railway in Mexico, and railways and harbours around the world.[8][9] In November 1915, the firm began construction of HM Factory, Gretna, the largest cordite factory in the UK during World War I.[10]
The construction business was shut down in the 1920s.[11] Among its final projects was completion of the Sennar Dam, in Sudan, in 1925.[12]
Publishing business: 1920s to 1990[edit]
In 1919, the firm acquired a 45% stake in the London branch of merchant bankers Lazard Brothers, an interest which was increased to 80% in 1932 during the depression years. Pearson continued to hold a 50% stake until 1999.[13] In 1921, Pearson purchased a number of local daily and weekly newspapers in the United Kingdom, which it combined to form the Westminster Press group.[4]
In 1957, it bought the Financial Times[4] and acquired a 50% stake in The Economist. It purchased the publisher Longman in 1968.[4]
The company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1969.[4] It went on to buy paperback publisher Penguin in 1970,[4] and in 1972, children's imprint Ladybird Books. In 1986, Pearson invested in the British Satellite Broadcasting consortium, which, a few years later merged with Sky TV to form a new company, British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB).[14]
1990 to 2000[edit]
During the 1990s, Pearson acquired a number of TV production and broadcasting assets (including former ITV franchisee Thames Television) and sold most of its non-media assets, under the leadership of future U.S. Congressman Bob Turner. Westminster Press was sold to Newsquest in 1996.[15] Pearson acquired the education division of HarperCollins in 1996 from News Corporation [16] and acquired book publishers Scott Foresman & Co. in 1996.[17] In 1998 Pearson acquired Prentice Hall Textbooks/Simon & Schuster Trade Books from Viacom and merged it with its own education unit, Addison-Wesley Longman to form Pearson Education.[18]
2000 to 2010[edit]
Pearson acquired Dorling Kindersley, the illustrated reference publisher and integrated it within Penguin, in March 2000[19] and then bought acquired National Computer Systems (NCS) in September 2000 so entering the educational assessment and school management systems market in the United States.[20]
In 2002, Pearson sold its 22% stake in RTL Group[21] for 1.5 billion Euros, and then purchased Rough Guides, the travel publisher, and brought it under Penguin. Pearson acquired Edexcel,[22] a provider of qualifications in the UK, in 2003 and acquired about 80% stake in Meximerica Media Inc for $16.5 million for the swelling U.S. Hispanic market in 2004.[23]
Pearson purchased a series of other testing and assessment businesses, including Knowledge Technologies in 2004,[24] AGS in 2005,[25] and National Evaluation Systems[26] and Promissor in 2006.[27] Pearson acquired National Evaluation Systems, a provider of customised state assessments for teacher certification in the US, in April 2006[28] and announced that it had agreed to acquire Harcourt Assessment and Harcourt Education International from Reed Elsevier for $950m in cash in May 2007.[29] Pearson then completed the acquisition of Harcourt Assessment, merging the acquired businesses into Pearson Assessment & Information.[30] Pearson also acquired eCollege, a digital learning technology group for $477m in May 2007.[31]
In February 2008, Pearson announced the sale of its Pearson Data Management Division (formerly the scanner manufacturing and servicing division of NCS Inc.) to Scantron Corporation (part of M&F Worldwide) which had been its main competitor.[32]
Pearson acquired Wall Street English for $145m in 2009[33] and bought the school learning systems division of Sistema Educacional Brasileiro (SEB) for $497m in 2010.[34] Also in 2010, Pearson sold its 61% stake in Interactive Data to investment funds managed by Silver Lake Partners and Warburg Pincus for $2 billion.[35]
2010 to 2020[edit]
In July 2011, Pearson announced the creation of Pearson College, a British degree provider based in London.[36][37] Also in 2011, Pearson acquired Connections Education and agreed to sell its 50% stake in FTSE International Limited to the London Stock Exchange for £450 million.[38] In 2011, Pearson also increased its stake in TutorVista, such that it had a 76% stake, for $127 million.[39]
Pearson entered into talks with rival conglomerate Bertelsmann, over the possibility of combining their respective publishing companies, Penguin Group and Random House in October 2012. The houses are considered two of the "Big Six" publishing companies.[40] On 29 October 2012, Pearson said it would merge Penguin Books with Bertelsmann's Random House to create the world's biggest consumer book publisher.[41] Then in May 2012 Pearson announced its acquisition of GlobalEnglish Corporation, an American Business English software and solutions company, in an all-cash transaction.[42]
In May 2013, Pearson announced a new restructuring plan to invest in digital learning and emerging markets, after predicting weaker earnings.[43]
The change supports the decoupling of the Penguin consumer publishing business into a separate entity with Random House (forming Penguin Random House). The new structure combines the separate education companies, Pearson International and Pearson North America under one Pearson company. Pearson will organize around three global lines of business – School, Higher Education and Professional. The Financial Times Group and Pearson English will form part of Pearson Professional.[44]
In July 2014, Pearson announced it had cut 4,000 jobs, representing 10% of the company's workforce.[45]
Pearson announced on 23 July 2015 that it had agreed to sell the FT Group, which includes business daily Financial Times, to Japanese media group Nikkei for £844 million, or $1.32 billion. The sale does not include FT Group's London property at One Southwark Bridge.[46] In August 2015, Pearson's sold its 50% stake in The Economist to the Agnelli family for £469 million[47] who previously held 4.7% of the group.[48] The remaining 50% of The Economist Group is owned by the Schroders, Cadburys and the Rothschilds.[48]
On 5 November 2015, Pearson announced it was rebranding, including creating a new logo, with a "100% focus" on education.[49][50]
On 3 July 2017, India-based education technology company, Byju's, acquired Tutor Vista and Edurite from Pearson.[51]
On 11 July 2017, Pearson agreed to reduce its holding in Penguin Random House to 25%, by selling a a 22% stake in the business to Bertelsmann.[52]
Operations[edit]
Pearson has two main streams of business:[53]

Global lines of business: focuses on the School, Higher Education and Professional areas (includes textbooks and digital technologies for teachers and students). Pearson's school brands include BTEC, Bug Club, Edexcel, Fronter, GradPoint, Schoolnet, and SuccessNet. Pearson's higher education brands include eCollege, Mastering/MyLabs, Revel, online tutoring (Smarthinking), and Financial Times Publishing.
Geographic streams: focuses on North American market, Growth markets and Core markets

Criticism[edit]
Concerns exist around the amount of influence Pearson, a commercial company, has on public education.[54] Other concerns are around tax avoidance, the high value contracts, and in one instance, laying off teachers to offset the high costs of testing.[55] In 2017, more than six out of ten Pearson's shareholders voted against the chief executive's pay package of £1.5m after the company made a record loss.[56]
United Kingdom[edit]
Pearson owns Edexcel, an education and examination board.[57] Edexcel has produced qualifications which link to Pearson texts, although Edexcel also continues to endorse textbooks published by other companies.[22]
Libyan Investment Authority[edit]
In June 2010, Pearson Plc received notification that the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) founded by Muammar Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a sovereign fund, had acquired 24,431,000 shares within the company via Euroclear. On further investigation, Pearson said the LIA may have acquired an additional 2,141,179 shares, resulting in a total interest of 26,572,179 shares. At the time, this represented a major holding of 3.27% within the company and the investment was worth around £280 million.[58]
Tax Avoidance[edit]
Pearson has been criticised for using offshore tax avoidance schemes involving a host of companies at a service address in Luxembourg.[59]

History[edit]
Construction business: 1844 to the 1920s[edit]
The company was founded by Samuel Pearson in 1844 as a building and engineering concern operating in Yorkshire under the name S. Pearson & Son.[4] In 1880, control passed to his grandson Weetman Dickinson Pearson, an engineer, who in 1890 moved the business to London and turned it into one of the world's largest construction companies.[4] Another of its prominent engineers was Ernest William Moir who, after working for Pearson on tunnels in New York City, became the contractor's agent on construction of the Blackwall Tunnel under the River Thames in London between 1892 and 1897.[5][6][7] The company also built the Admiralty Harbour at Dover, the Halifax Dry Dock in Canada, the East River Railway Tunnels in New York City, the Mexican Grand Canal that drained Mexico City, the Tehuantepec Railway in Mexico, and railways and harbours around the world.[8][9] In November 1915, the firm began construction of HM Factory, Gretna, the largest cordite factory in the UK during World War I.[10]
The construction business was shut down in the 1920s.[11] Among its final projects was completion of the Sennar Dam, in Sudan, in 1925.[12]
Publishing business: 1920s to 1990[edit]
In 1919, the firm acquired a 45% stake in the London branch of merchant bankers Lazard Brothers, an interest which was increased to 80% in 1932 during the depression years. Pearson continued to hold a 50% stake until 1999.[13] In 1921, Pearson purchased a number of local daily and weekly newspapers in the United Kingdom, which it combined to form the Westminster Press group.[4]
In 1957, it bought the Financial Times[4] and acquired a 50% stake in The Economist. It purchased the publisher Longman in 1968.[4]
The company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1969.[4] It went on to buy paperback publisher Penguin in 1970,[4] and in 1972, children's imprint Ladybird Books. In 1986, Pearson invested in the British Satellite Broadcasting consortium, which, a few years later merged with Sky TV to form a new company, British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB).[14]
1990 to 2000[edit]
During the 1990s, Pearson acquired a number of TV production and broadcasting assets (including former ITV franchisee Thames Television) and sold most of its non-media assets, under the leadership of future U.S. Congressman Bob Turner. Westminster Press was sold to Newsquest in 1996.[15] Pearson acquired the education division of HarperCollins in 1996 from News Corporation [16] and acquired book publishers Scott Foresman & Co. in 1996.[17] In 1998 Pearson acquired Prentice Hall Textbooks/Simon & Schuster Trade Books from Viacom and merged it with its own education unit, Addison-Wesley Longman to form Pearson Education.[18]
2000 to 2010[edit]
Pearson acquired Dorling Kindersley, the illustrated reference publisher and integrated it within Penguin, in March 2000[19] and then bought acquired National Computer Systems (NCS) in September 2000 so entering the educational assessment and school management systems market in the United States.[20]
In 2002, Pearson sold its 22% stake in RTL Group[21] for 1.5 billion Euros, and then purchased Rough Guides, the travel publisher, and brought it under Penguin. Pearson acquired Edexcel,[22] a provider of qualifications in the UK, in 2003 and acquired about 80% stake in Meximerica Media Inc for $16.5 million for the swelling U.S. Hispanic market in 2004.[23]
Pearson purchased a series of other testing and assessment businesses, including Knowledge Technologies in 2004,[24] AGS in 2005,[25] and National Evaluation Systems[26] and Promissor in 2006.[27] Pearson acquired National Evaluation Systems, a provider of customised state assessments for teacher certification in the US, in April 2006[28] and announced that it had agreed to acquire Harcourt Assessment and Harcourt Education International from Reed Elsevier for $950m in cash in May 2007.[29] Pearson then completed the acquisition of Harcourt Assessment, merging the acquired businesses into Pearson Assessment & Information.[30] Pearson also acquired eCollege, a digital learning technology group for $477m in May 2007.[31]
In February 2008, Pearson announced the sale of its Pearson Data Management Division (formerly the scanner manufacturing and servicing division of NCS Inc.) to Scantron Corporation (part of M&F Worldwide) which had been its main competitor.[32]
Pearson acquired Wall Street English for $145m in 2009[33] and bought the school learning systems division of Sistema Educacional Brasileiro (SEB) for $497m in 2010.[34] Also in 2010, Pearson sold its 61% stake in Interactive Data to investment funds managed by Silver Lake Partners and Warburg Pincus for $2 billion.[35]
2010 to 2020[edit]
In July 2011, Pearson announced the creation of Pearson College, a British degree provider based in London.[36][37] Also in 2011, Pearson acquired Connections Education and agreed to sell its 50% stake in FTSE International Limited to the London Stock Exchange for £450 million.[38] In 2011, Pearson also increased its stake in TutorVista, such that it had a 76% stake, for $127 million.[39]
Pearson entered into talks with rival conglomerate Bertelsmann, over the possibility of combining their respective publishing companies, Penguin Group and Random House in October 2012. The houses are considered two of the "Big Six" publishing companies.[40] On 29 October 2012, Pearson said it would merge Penguin Books with Bertelsmann's Random House to create the world's biggest consumer book publisher.[41] Then in May 2012 Pearson announced its acquisition of GlobalEnglish Corporation, an American Business English software and solutions company, in an all-cash transaction.[42]
In May 2013, Pearson announced a new restructuring plan to invest in digital learning and emerging markets, after predicting weaker earnings.[43]
The change supports the decoupling of the Penguin consumer publishing business into a separate entity with Random House (forming Penguin Random House). The new structure combines the separate education companies, Pearson International and Pearson North America under one Pearson company. Pearson will organize around three global lines of business – School, Higher Education and Professional. The Financial Times Group and Pearson English will form part of Pearson Professional.[44]
In July 2014, Pearson announced it had cut 4,000 jobs, representing 10% of the company's workforce.[45]
Pearson announced on 23 July 2015 that it had agreed to sell the FT Group, which includes business daily Financial Times, to Japanese media group Nikkei for £844 million, or $1.32 billion. The sale does not include FT Group's London property at One Southwark Bridge.[46] In August 2015, Pearson's sold its 50% stake in The Economist to the Agnelli family for £469 million[47] who previously held 4.7% of the group.[48] The remaining 50% of The Economist Group is owned by the Schroders, Cadburys and the Rothschilds.[48]
On 5 November 2015, Pearson announced it was rebranding, including creating a new logo, with a "100% focus" on education.[49][50]
On 3 July 2017, India-based education technology company, Byju's, acquired Tutor Vista and Edurite from Pearson.[51]
On 11 July 2017, Pearson agreed to reduce its holding in Penguin Random House to 25%, by selling a a 22% stake in the business to Bertelsmann.[52]
Operations[edit]
Pearson has two main streams of business:[53]

Global lines of business: focuses on the School, Higher Education and Professional areas (includes textbooks and digital technologies for teachers and students). Pearson's school brands include BTEC, Bug Club, Edexcel, Fronter, GradPoint, Schoolnet, and SuccessNet. Pearson's higher education brands include eCollege, Mastering/MyLabs, Revel, online tutoring (Smarthinking), and Financial Times Publishing.
Geographic streams: focuses on North American market, Growth markets and Core markets

Criticism[edit]
Concerns exist around the amount of influence Pearson, a commercial company, has on public education.[54] Other concerns are around tax avoidance, the high value contracts, and in one instance, laying off teachers to offset the high costs of testing.[55] In 2017, more than six out of ten Pearson's shareholders voted against the chief executive's pay package of £1.5m after the company made a record loss.[56]
United Kingdom[edit]
Pearson owns Edexcel, an education and examination board.[57] Edexcel has produced qualifications which link to Pearson texts, although Edexcel also continues to endorse textbooks published by other companies.[22]
Libyan Investment Authority[edit]
In June 2010, Pearson Plc received notification that the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) founded by Muammar Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a sovereign fund, had acquired 24,431,000 shares within the company via Euroclear. On further investigation, Pearson said the LIA may have acquired an additional 2,141,179 shares, resulting in a total interest of 26,572,179 shares. At the time, this represented a major holding of 3.27% within the company and the investment was worth around £280 million.[58]
Tax Avoidance[edit]
Pearson has been criticised for using offshore tax avoidance schemes involving a host of companies at a service address in Luxembourg.[59]

History[edit]
Construction business: 1844 to the 1920s[edit]
The company was founded by Samuel Pearson in 1844 as a building and engineering concern operating in Yorkshire under the name S. Pearson & Son.[4] In 1880, control passed to his grandson Weetman Dickinson Pearson, an engineer, who in 1890 moved the business to London and turned it into one of the world's largest construction companies.[4] Another of its prominent engineers was Ernest William Moir who, after working for Pearson on tunnels in New York City, became the contractor's agent on construction of the Blackwall Tunnel under the River Thames in London between 1892 and 1897.[5][6][7] The company also built the Admiralty Harbour at Dover, the Halifax Dry Dock in Canada, the East River Railway Tunnels in New York City, the Mexican Grand Canal that drained Mexico City, the Tehuantepec Railway in Mexico, and railways and harbours around the world.[8][9] In November 1915, the firm began construction of HM Factory, Gretna, the largest cordite factory in the UK during World War I.[10]
The construction business was shut down in the 1920s.[11] Among its final projects was completion of the Sennar Dam, in Sudan, in 1925.[12]
Publishing business: 1920s to 1990[edit]
In 1919, the firm acquired a 45% stake in the London branch of merchant bankers Lazard Brothers, an interest which was increased to 80% in 1932 during the depression years. Pearson continued to hold a 50% stake until 1999.[13] In 1921, Pearson purchased a number of local daily and weekly newspapers in the United Kingdom, which it combined to form the Westminster Press group.[4]
In 1957, it bought the Financial Times[4] and acquired a 50% stake in The Economist. It purchased the publisher Longman in 1968.[4]
The company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1969.[4] It went on to buy paperback publisher Penguin in 1970,[4] and in 1972, children's imprint Ladybird Books. In 1986, Pearson invested in the British Satellite Broadcasting consortium, which, a few years later merged with Sky TV to form a new company, British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB).[14]
1990 to 2000[edit]
During the 1990s, Pearson acquired a number of TV production and broadcasting assets (including former ITV franchisee Thames Television) and sold most of its non-media assets, under the leadership of future U.S. Congressman Bob Turner. Westminster Press was sold to Newsquest in 1996.[15] Pearson acquired the education division of HarperCollins in 1996 from News Corporation [16] and acquired book publishers Scott Foresman & Co. in 1996.[17] In 1998 Pearson acquired Prentice Hall Textbooks/Simon & Schuster Trade Books from Viacom and merged it with its own education unit, Addison-Wesley Longman to form Pearson Education.[18]
2000 to 2010[edit]
Pearson acquired Dorling Kindersley, the illustrated reference publisher and integrated it within Penguin, in March 2000[19] and then bought acquired National Computer Systems (NCS) in September 2000 so entering the educational assessment and school management systems market in the United States.[20]
In 2002, Pearson sold its 22% stake in RTL Group[21] for 1.5 billion Euros, and then purchased Rough Guides, the travel publisher, and brought it under Penguin. Pearson acquired Edexcel,[22] a provider of qualifications in the UK, in 2003 and acquired about 80% stake in Meximerica Media Inc for $16.5 million for the swelling U.S. Hispanic market in 2004.[23]
Pearson purchased a series of other testing and assessment businesses, including Knowledge Technologies in 2004,[24] AGS in 2005,[25] and National Evaluation Systems[26] and Promissor in 2006.[27] Pearson acquired National Evaluation Systems, a provider of customised state assessments for teacher certification in the US, in April 2006[28] and announced that it had agreed to acquire Harcourt Assessment and Harcourt Education International from Reed Elsevier for $950m in cash in May 2007.[29] Pearson then completed the acquisition of Harcourt Assessment, merging the acquired businesses into Pearson Assessment & Information.[30] Pearson also acquired eCollege, a digital learning technology group for $477m in May 2007.[31]
In February 2008, Pearson announced the sale of its Pearson Data Management Division (formerly the scanner manufacturing and servicing division of NCS Inc.) to Scantron Corporation (part of M&F Worldwide) which had been its main competitor.[32]
Pearson acquired Wall Street English for $145m in 2009[33] and bought the school learning systems division of Sistema Educacional Brasileiro (SEB) for $497m in 2010.[34] Also in 2010, Pearson sold its 61% stake in Interactive Data to investment funds managed by Silver Lake Partners and Warburg Pincus for $2 billion.[35]
2010 to 2020[edit]
In July 2011, Pearson announced the creation of Pearson College, a British degree provider based in London.[36][37] Also in 2011, Pearson acquired Connections Education and agreed to sell its 50% stake in FTSE International Limited to the London Stock Exchange for £450 million.[38] In 2011, Pearson also increased its stake in TutorVista, such that it had a 76% stake, for $127 million.[39]
Pearson entered into talks with rival conglomerate Bertelsmann, over the possibility of combining their respective publishing companies, Penguin Group and Random House in October 2012. The houses are considered two of the "Big Six" publishing companies.[40] On 29 October 2012, Pearson said it would merge Penguin Books with Bertelsmann's Random House to create the world's biggest consumer book publisher.[41] Then in May 2012 Pearson announced its acquisition of GlobalEnglish Corporation, an American Business English software and solutions company, in an all-cash transaction.[42]
In May 2013, Pearson announced a new restructuring plan to invest in digital learning and emerging markets, after predicting weaker earnings.[43]
The change supports the decoupling of the Penguin consumer publishing business into a separate entity with Random House (forming Penguin Random House). The new structure combines the separate education companies, Pearson International and Pearson North America under one Pearson company. Pearson will organize around three global lines of business – School, Higher Education and Professional. The Financial Times Group and Pearson English will form part of Pearson Professional.[44]
In July 2014, Pearson announced it had cut 4,000 jobs, representing 10% of the company's workforce.[45]
Pearson announced on 23 July 2015 that it had agreed to sell the FT Group, which includes business daily Financial Times, to Japanese media group Nikkei for £844 million, or $1.32 billion. The sale does not include FT Group's London property at One Southwark Bridge.[46] In August 2015, Pearson's sold its 50% stake in The Economist to the Agnelli family for £469 million[47] who previously held 4.7% of the group.[48] The remaining 50% of The Economist Group is owned by the Schroders, Cadburys and the Rothschilds.[48]
On 5 November 2015, Pearson announced it was rebranding, including creating a new logo, with a "100% focus" on education.[49][50]
On 3 July 2017, India-based education technology company, Byju's, acquired Tutor Vista and Edurite from Pearson.[51]
On 11 July 2017, Pearson agreed to reduce its holding in Penguin Random House to 25%, by selling a a 22% stake in the business to Bertelsmann.[52]
Operations[edit]
Pearson has two main streams of business:[53]

Global lines of business: focuses on the School, Higher Education and Professional areas (includes textbooks and digital technologies for teachers and students). Pearson's school brands include BTEC, Bug Club, Edexcel, Fronter, GradPoint, Schoolnet, and SuccessNet. Pearson's higher education brands include eCollege, Mastering/MyLabs, Revel, online tutoring (Smarthinking), and Financial Times Publishing.
Geographic streams: focuses on North American market, Growth markets and Core markets

Criticism[edit]
Concerns exist around the amount of influence Pearson, a commercial company, has on public education.[54] Other concerns are around tax avoidance, the high value contracts, and in one instance, laying off teachers to offset the high costs of testing.[55] In 2017, more than six out of ten Pearson's shareholders voted against the chief executive's pay package of £1.5m after the company made a record loss.[56]
United Kingdom[edit]
Pearson owns Edexcel, an education and examination board.[57] Edexcel has produced qualifications which link to Pearson texts, although Edexcel also continues to endorse textbooks published by other companies.[22]
Libyan Investment Authority[edit]
In June 2010, Pearson Plc received notification that the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) founded by Muammar Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a sovereign fund, had acquired 24,431,000 shares within the company via Euroclear. On further investigation, Pearson said the LIA may have acquired an additional 2,141,179 shares, resulting in a total interest of 26,572,179 shares. At the time, this represented a major holding of 3.27% within the company and the investment was worth around £280 million.[58]
Tax Avoidance[edit]
Pearson has been criticised for using offshore tax avoidance schemes involving a host of companies at a service address in Luxembourg.[59]

History[edit]
Construction business: 1844 to the 1920s[edit]
The company was founded by Samuel Pearson in 1844 as a building and engineering concern operating in Yorkshire under the name S. Pearson & Son.[4] In 1880, control passed to his grandson Weetman Dickinson Pearson, an engineer, who in 1890 moved the business to London and turned it into one of the world's largest construction companies.[4] Another of its prominent engineers was Ernest William Moir who, after working for Pearson on tunnels in New York City, became the contractor's agent on construction of the Blackwall Tunnel under the River Thames in London between 1892 and 1897.[5][6][7] The company also built the Admiralty Harbour at Dover, the Halifax Dry Dock in Canada, the East River Railway Tunnels in New York City, the Mexican Grand Canal that drained Mexico City, the Tehuantepec Railway in Mexico, and railways and harbours around the world.[8][9] In November 1915, the firm began construction of HM Factory, Gretna, the largest cordite factory in the UK during World War I.[10]
The construction business was shut down in the 1920s.[11] Among its final projects was completion of the Sennar Dam, in Sudan, in 1925.[12]
Publishing business: 1920s to 1990[edit]
In 1919, the firm acquired a 45% stake in the London branch of merchant bankers Lazard Brothers, an interest which was increased to 80% in 1932 during the depression years. Pearson continued to hold a 50% stake until 1999.[13] In 1921, Pearson purchased a number of local daily and weekly newspapers in the United Kingdom, which it combined to form the Westminster Press group.[4]
In 1957, it bought the Financial Times[4] and acquired a 50% stake in The Economist. It purchased the publisher Longman in 1968.[4]
The company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1969.[4] It went on to buy paperback publisher Penguin in 1970,[4] and in 1972, children's imprint Ladybird Books. In 1986, Pearson invested in the British Satellite Broadcasting consortium, which, a few years later merged with Sky TV to form a new company, British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB).[14]
1990 to 2000[edit]
During the 1990s, Pearson acquired a number of TV production and broadcasting assets (including former ITV franchisee Thames Television) and sold most of its non-media assets, under the leadership of future U.S. Congressman Bob Turner. Westminster Press was sold to Newsquest in 1996.[15] Pearson acquired the education division of HarperCollins in 1996 from News Corporation [16] and acquired book publishers Scott Foresman & Co. in 1996.[17] In 1998 Pearson acquired Prentice Hall Textbooks/Simon & Schuster Trade Books from Viacom and merged it with its own education unit, Addison-Wesley Longman to form Pearson Education.[18]
2000 to 2010[edit]
Pearson acquired Dorling Kindersley, the illustrated reference publisher and integrated it within Penguin, in March 2000[19] and then bought acquired National Computer Systems (NCS) in September 2000 so entering the educational assessment and school management systems market in the United States.[20]
In 2002, Pearson sold its 22% stake in RTL Group[21] for 1.5 billion Euros, and then purchased Rough Guides, the travel publisher, and brought it under Penguin. Pearson acquired Edexcel,[22] a provider of qualifications in the UK, in 2003 and acquired about 80% stake in Meximerica Media Inc for $16.5 million for the swelling U.S. Hispanic market in 2004.[23]
Pearson purchased a series of other testing and assessment businesses, including Knowledge Technologies in 2004,[24] AGS in 2005,[25] and National Evaluation Systems[26] and Promissor in 2006.[27] Pearson acquired National Evaluation Systems, a provider of customised state assessments for teacher certification in the US, in April 2006[28] and announced that it had agreed to acquire Harcourt Assessment and Harcourt Education International from Reed Elsevier for $950m in cash in May 2007.[29] Pearson then completed the acquisition of Harcourt Assessment, merging the acquired businesses into Pearson Assessment & Information.[30] Pearson also acquired eCollege, a digital learning technology group for $477m in May 2007.[31]
In February 2008, Pearson announced the sale of its Pearson Data Management Division (formerly the scanner manufacturing and servicing division of NCS Inc.) to Scantron Corporation (part of M&F Worldwide) which had been its main competitor.[32]
Pearson acquired Wall Street English for $145m in 2009[33] and bought the school learning systems division of Sistema Educacional Brasileiro (SEB) for $497m in 2010.[34] Also in 2010, Pearson sold its 61% stake in Interactive Data to investment funds managed by Silver Lake Partners and Warburg Pincus for $2 billion.[35]
2010 to 2020[edit]
In July 2011, Pearson announced the creation of Pearson College, a British degree provider based in London.[36][37] Also in 2011, Pearson acquired Connections Education and agreed to sell its 50% stake in FTSE International Limited to the London Stock Exchange for £450 million.[38] In 2011, Pearson also increased its stake in TutorVista, such that it had a 76% stake, for $127 million.[39]
Pearson entered into talks with rival conglomerate Bertelsmann, over the possibility of combining their respective publishing companies, Penguin Group and Random House in October 2012. The houses are considered two of the "Big Six" publishing companies.[40] On 29 October 2012, Pearson said it would merge Penguin Books with Bertelsmann's Random House to create the world's biggest consumer book publisher.[41] Then in May 2012 Pearson announced its acquisition of GlobalEnglish Corporation, an American Business English software and solutions company, in an all-cash transaction.[42]
In May 2013, Pearson announced a new restructuring plan to invest in digital learning and emerging markets, after predicting weaker earnings.[43]
The change supports the decoupling of the Penguin consumer publishing business into a separate entity with Random House (forming Penguin Random House). The new structure combines the separate education companies, Pearson International and Pearson North America under one Pearson company. Pearson will organize around three global lines of business – School, Higher Education and Professional. The Financial Times Group and Pearson English will form part of Pearson Professional.[44]
In July 2014, Pearson announced it had cut 4,000 jobs, representing 10% of the company's workforce.[45]
Pearson announced on 23 July 2015 that it had agreed to sell the FT Group, which includes business daily Financial Times, to Japanese media group Nikkei for £844 million, or $1.32 billion. The sale does not include FT Group's London property at One Southwark Bridge.[46] In August 2015, Pearson's sold its 50% stake in The Economist to the Agnelli family for £469 million[47] who previously held 4.7% of the group.[48] The remaining 50% of The Economist Group is owned by the Schroders, Cadburys and the Rothschilds.[48]
On 5 November 2015, Pearson announced it was rebranding, including creating a new logo, with a "100% focus" on education.[49][50]
On 3 July 2017, India-based education technology company, Byju's, acquired Tutor Vista and Edurite from Pearson.[51]
On 11 July 2017, Pearson agreed to reduce its holding in Penguin Random House to 25%, by selling a a 22% stake in the business to Bertelsmann.[52]
Operations[edit]
Pearson has two main streams of business:[53]

Global lines of business: focuses on the School, Higher Education and Professional areas (includes textbooks and digital technologies for teachers and students). Pearson's school brands include BTEC, Bug Club, Edexcel, Fronter, GradPoint, Schoolnet, and SuccessNet. Pearson's higher education brands include eCollege, Mastering/MyLabs, Revel, online tutoring (Smarthinking), and Financial Times Publishing.
Geographic streams: focuses on North American market, Growth markets and Core markets

Criticism[edit]
Concerns exist around the amount of influence Pearson, a commercial company, has on public education.[54] Other concerns are around tax avoidance, the high value contracts, and in one instance, laying off teachers to offset the high costs of testing.[55] In 2017, more than six out of ten Pearson's shareholders voted against the chief executive's pay package of £1.5m after the company made a record loss.[56]
United Kingdom[edit]
Pearson owns Edexcel, an education and examination board.[57] Edexcel has produced qualifications which link to Pearson texts, although Edexcel also continues to endorse textbooks published by other companies.[22]
Libyan Investment Authority[edit]
In June 2010, Pearson Plc received notification that the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) founded by Muammar Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a sovereign fund, had acquired 24,431,000 shares within the company via Euroclear. On further investigation, Pearson said the LIA may have acquired an additional 2,141,179 shares, resulting in a total interest of 26,572,179 shares. At the time, this represented a major holding of 3.27% within the company and the investment was worth around £280 million.[58]
Tax Avoidance[edit]
Pearson has been criticised for using offshore tax avoidance schemes involving a host of companies at a service address in Luxembourg.[59]

History[edit]
Construction business: 1844 to the 1920s[edit]
The company was founded by Samuel Pearson in 1844 as a building and engineering concern operating in Yorkshire under the name S. Pearson & Son.[4] In 1880, control passed to his grandson Weetman Dickinson Pearson, an engineer, who in 1890 moved the business to London and turned it into one of the world's largest construction companies.[4] Another of its prominent engineers was Ernest William Moir who, after working for Pearson on tunnels in New York City, became the contractor's agent on construction of the Blackwall Tunnel under the River Thames in London between 1892 and 1897.[5][6][7] The company also built the Admiralty Harbour at Dover, the Halifax Dry Dock in Canada, the East River Railway Tunnels in New York City, the Mexican Grand Canal that drained Mexico City, the Tehuantepec Railway in Mexico, and railways and harbours around the world.[8][9] In November 1915, the firm began construction of HM Factory, Gretna, the largest cordite factory in the UK during World War I.[10]
The construction business was shut down in the 1920s.[11] Among its final projects was completion of the Sennar Dam, in Sudan, in 1925.[12]
Publishing business: 1920s to 1990[edit]
In 1919, the firm acquired a 45% stake in the London branch of merchant bankers Lazard Brothers, an interest which was increased to 80% in 1932 during the depression years. Pearson continued to hold a 50% stake until 1999.[13] In 1921, Pearson purchased a number of local daily and weekly newspapers in the United Kingdom, which it combined to form the Westminster Press group.[4]
In 1957, it bought the Financial Times[4] and acquired a 50% stake in The Economist. It purchased the publisher Longman in 1968.[4]
The company was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1969.[4] It went on to buy paperback publisher Penguin in 1970,[4] and in 1972, children's imprint Ladybird Books. In 1986, Pearson invested in the British Satellite Broadcasting consortium, which, a few years later merged with Sky TV to form a new company, British Sky Broadcasting (BSkyB).[14]
1990 to 2000[edit]
During the 1990s, Pearson acquired a number of TV production and broadcasting assets (including former ITV franchisee Thames Television) and sold most of its non-media assets, under the leadership of future U.S. Congressman Bob Turner. Westminster Press was sold to Newsquest in 1996.[15] Pearson acquired the education division of HarperCollins in 1996 from News Corporation [16] and acquired book publishers Scott Foresman & Co. in 1996.[17] In 1998 Pearson acquired Prentice Hall Textbooks/Simon & Schuster Trade Books from Viacom and merged it with its own education unit, Addison-Wesley Longman to form Pearson Education.[18]
2000 to 2010[edit]
Pearson acquired Dorling Kindersley, the illustrated reference publisher and integrated it within Penguin, in March 2000[19] and then bought acquired National Computer Systems (NCS) in September 2000 so entering the educational assessment and school management systems market in the United States.[20]
In 2002, Pearson sold its 22% stake in RTL Group[21] for 1.5 billion Euros, and then purchased Rough Guides, the travel publisher, and brought it under Penguin. Pearson acquired Edexcel,[22] a provider of qualifications in the UK, in 2003 and acquired about 80% stake in Meximerica Media Inc for $16.5 million for the swelling U.S. Hispanic market in 2004.[23]
Pearson purchased a series of other testing and assessment businesses, including Knowledge Technologies in 2004,[24] AGS in 2005,[25] and National Evaluation Systems[26] and Promissor in 2006.[27] Pearson acquired National Evaluation Systems, a provider of customised state assessments for teacher certification in the US, in April 2006[28] and announced that it had agreed to acquire Harcourt Assessment and Harcourt Education International from Reed Elsevier for $950m in cash in May 2007.[29] Pearson then completed the acquisition of Harcourt Assessment, merging the acquired businesses into Pearson Assessment & Information.[30] Pearson also acquired eCollege, a digital learning technology group for $477m in May 2007.[31]
In February 2008, Pearson announced the sale of its Pearson Data Management Division (formerly the scanner manufacturing and servicing division of NCS Inc.) to Scantron Corporation (part of M&F Worldwide) which had been its main competitor.[32]
Pearson acquired Wall Street English for $145m in 2009[33] and bought the school learning systems division of Sistema Educacional Brasileiro (SEB) for $497m in 2010.[34] Also in 2010, Pearson sold its 61% stake in Interactive Data to investment funds managed by Silver Lake Partners and Warburg Pincus for $2 billion.[35]
2010 to 2020[edit]
In July 2011, Pearson announced the creation of Pearson College, a British degree provider based in London.[36][37] Also in 2011, Pearson acquired Connections Education and agreed to sell its 50% stake in FTSE International Limited to the London Stock Exchange for £450 million.[38] In 2011, Pearson also increased its stake in TutorVista, such that it had a 76% stake, for $127 million.[39]
Pearson entered into talks with rival conglomerate Bertelsmann, over the possibility of combining their respective publishing companies, Penguin Group and Random House in October 2012. The houses are considered two of the "Big Six" publishing companies.[40] On 29 October 2012, Pearson said it would merge Penguin Books with Bertelsmann's Random House to create the world's biggest consumer book publisher.[41] Then in May 2012 Pearson announced its acquisition of GlobalEnglish Corporation, an American Business English software and solutions company, in an all-cash transaction.[42]
In May 2013, Pearson announced a new restructuring plan to invest in digital learning and emerging markets, after predicting weaker earnings.[43]
The change supports the decoupling of the Penguin consumer publishing business into a separate entity with Random House (forming Penguin Random House). The new structure combines the separate education companies, Pearson International and Pearson North America under one Pearson company. Pearson will organize around three global lines of business – School, Higher Education and Professional. The Financial Times Group and Pearson English will form part of Pearson Professional.[44]
In July 2014, Pearson announced it had cut 4,000 jobs, representing 10% of the company's workforce.[45]
Pearson announced on 23 July 2015 that it had agreed to sell the FT Group, which includes business daily Financial Times, to Japanese media group Nikkei for £844 million, or $1.32 billion. The sale does not include FT Group's London property at One Southwark Bridge.[46] In August 2015, Pearson's sold its 50% stake in The Economist to the Agnelli family for £469 million[47] who previously held 4.7% of the group.[48] The remaining 50% of The Economist Group is owned by the Schroders, Cadburys and the Rothschilds.[48]
On 5 November 2015, Pearson announced it was rebranding, including creating a new logo, with a "100% focus" on education.[49][50]
On 3 July 2017, India-based education technology company, Byju's, acquired Tutor Vista and Edurite from Pearson.[51]
On 11 July 2017, Pearson agreed to reduce its holding in Penguin Random House to 25%, by selling a a 22% stake in the business to Bertelsmann.[52]
Operations[edit]
Pearson has two main streams of business:[53]

Global lines of business: focuses on the School, Higher Education and Professional areas (includes textbooks and digital technologies for teachers and students). Pearson's school brands include BTEC, Bug Club, Edexcel, Fronter, GradPoint, Schoolnet, and SuccessNet. Pearson's higher education brands include eCollege, Mastering/MyLabs, Revel, online tutoring (Smarthinking), and Financial Times Publishing.
Geographic streams: focuses on North American market, Growth markets and Core markets

Criticism[edit]
Concerns exist around the amount of influence Pearson, a commercial company, has on public education.[54] Other concerns are around tax avoidance, the high value contracts, and in one instance, laying off teachers to offset the high costs of testing.[55] In 2017, more than six out of ten Pearson's shareholders voted against the chief executive's pay package of £1.5m after the company made a record loss.[56]
United Kingdom[edit]
Pearson owns Edexcel, an education and examination board.[57] Edexcel has produced qualifications which link to Pearson texts, although Edexcel also continues to endorse textbooks published by other companies.[22]
Libyan Investment Authority[edit]
In June 2010, Pearson Plc received notification that the Libyan Investment Authority (LIA) founded by Muammar Gaddafi's son Saif al-Islam Gaddafi as a sovereign fund, had acquired 24,431,000 shares within the company via Euroclear. On further investigation, Pearson said the LIA may have acquired an additional 2,141,179 shares, resulting in a total interest of 26,572,179 shares. At the time, this represented a major holding of 3.27% within the company and the investment was worth around £280 million.[58]
Tax Avoidance[edit]
Pearson has been criticised for using offshore tax avoidance schemes involving a host of companies at a service address in Luxembourg.[59]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
