Strategy


Privet Fund Management LLC manages investment partnerships focused on making event-driven, value-oriented investments in small capitalization companies across all levels of the capital structure. Privetâs goal is to produce high long term absolute returns with low correlation to the broader markets.
Privet utilizes a research intensive approach, delving deep into business and situational fundamentals to identify low valuation investments tied to specific catalysts. Because of the exceptional knowledge threshold necessary to initiate investments, the Fund is run in a concentrated manner to ensure only the highest conviction positions influence 
	performance.
We believe that the "institutionalization" of the hedge fund industry has forced the vast majority of asset managers to myopically focus on liquidity and volatility management at the expense of returns. This dynamic has dramatically increased the number of companies for which informational asymmetry can be unearthed. In seeking to exploit this market inefficiency, the Fund targets small cap companies that have public market valuations significantly below our estimate of the private market value of the enterprises. Specific catalysts are identified or, if necessary, created that will drive convergence of public valuation and intrinsic value.

Norsat Announces Receipt Of Updated, Unsolicited Proposal From  Privet Fund Management LLC
Vancouver, British Columbia – May 15, 2017 – Norsat International Inc. (“Norsat” or the “Company”) (TSX: NII and NYSE MKT: NSAT), a provider of unique and customized communication solutions for remote and challenging applications, today announced that further to its news releases of September 19, 2016, March 17, 2017, March 27, 2017 and April 17, 2017, it has received an updated unsolicited, proposal from Privet Fund Management LLC (“Privet”) to acquire the Company for cash consideration of US$11.00 per share (the “Privet Proposal”).  The Privet Proposal is not subject to any due diligence or financing conditions.  Privet has indicated that it is prepared to sign a definitive agreement on non-financial terms and conditions substantially identical to the existing arrangement agreement with Hytera (the “Arrangement Agreement”).
The Special Committee comprising all of the Independent Directors of the Board of Directors, in consultation with the Company’s legal and financial advisors, will review and consider if the Privet Proposal is a “Superior Proposal” as defined in the Arrangement Agreement.  If, after completing the review, the Independent Directors determine that the offer by Privet is a Superior Proposal, they will notify Hytera of that determination.  Hytera will then have a period of five business days to offer to amend the terms of the Arrangement Agreement.  Hytera is under no obligation to make such an offer, but if they offer to amend the Arrangement Agreement and the Independent Directors determine that the proposal of Privet ceases to be a Superior Proposal, Norsat will enter into an amendment of the Arrangement Agreement and implement the amended offer.  If, after the Independent Directors determine the Privet offer is a Superior Proposal, Hytera does not offer to amend the Arrangement Agreement, or offers to amend but the Privet Proposal remains a Superior Proposal, Norsat intends to accept the Privet Proposal, terminate the Arrangement Agreement and pay Hytera the termination fee of US$2.0 million, all in accordance with the terms of the Arrangement Agreement.  However, a definitive agreement with Privet can only be executed by Norsat after approval from the Industrial Technologies Office representing the Strategic Aerospace and Defence Initiative program. Further, any transaction with Privet would be subject to approvals from and including but not limited to shareholders of Norsat, under the Investment Canada Act and Controlled Goods Directorate.
At this time, there can be no assurance that the Privet Proposal will lead to the termination of the Arrangement Agreement and the execution of a definitive agreement with Privet, or that the transaction contemplated by the Privet Proposal will obtain all necessary approvals or be consummated.
About Norsat International Inc.
Founded in 1977, Norsat International Inc. is a provider of unique and customized communication solutions for remote and challenging applications. Norsat’s products and services include leading-edge product design and development, production, distribution and infield support and service of fly-away satellite terminals, microwave components, antennas, Radio Frequency (RF) conditioning products, maritime based satellite terminals and remote network connectivity solutions.

Forward Looking Statements
The discussion and analysis of this news release contains forward-looking statements concerning anticipated developments in Norsat’s operations in future periods, the adequacy of its financial resources and other events or conditions that may occur in the future. Forward-looking statements are frequently, but not always, identified by words such as “expects,” “anticipates,” “believes,” “intends,” “estimates”, “predicts,” “potential,” “targeted,” “plans,” “possible” and similar expressions, or statements that events, conditions or results “will,” “may”, “could” or “should” occur or be achieved. These forward-looking statements include, without limitation, statements about the proposal made by Privet, the proposed acquisition by Hytera, the adequacy of available cash resources and other statements about future events or results. Forward-looking statements are statements about the future and are inherently uncertain, and actual achievements of the Company or other future events or conditions may differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking statements due to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors, such as business and economic risks and uncertainties. The forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs, expectations and opinions of management on the date the statements are made. Consequently, all forward-looking statements made in this news release are qualified by this cautionary statement and there can be no assurance that actual results or anticipated developments will be realized. For the reasons set forth above, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are made as of the date of this news release and Norsat assumes no obligation to update or revise them to reflect new events or circumstances, other than as required by law.

Privet Fund Management LLC Sends Revised Proposal to Acquire Norsat International Inc. for US$11.50 Per Share









PR Newswire




Jun 12, 2017 7:36 AM EDT













 


















































       ATLANTA, GA ,  June 12, 2017  /CNW/ - Privet Fund Management LLC ("Privet") announced today that Privet sent a letter to the board of directors of Norsat International Inc. ("Norsat") (TSX:NII , NYSE MKT:NSAT) containing a revised proposal to acquire 100% of the common shares of Norsat not already owned by Privet and its affiliates at a price of US$11.50 per share in cash pursuant to a plan of arrangement. This consideration is greater than the US$11.25 per share in consideration offered by Hytera Communications Co., Ltd. ("Hytera") in Hytera's arrangement agreement (as amended, the "Hytera Agreement") with Norsat.  Privet is confident that this revised proposal constitutes a "Superior Proposal" as defined in the Hytera Agreement. Privet will provide all of the equity capital necessary for the proposal and has received  amending letters to the debt commitment letters previously provided to finance a portion of the consideration . Privet anticipates that the required regulatory approvals would not materially impact the timing or certainty of the transaction. Furthermore, given Privet's substantial existing ownership, Privet is highly confident that shareholder approval of the proposal will be readily obtained.  The proposal is non-binding and is subject to the negotiation and execution of a mutually acceptable definitive acquisition agreement between Privet and Norsat. Privet is prepared to execute a definitive arrangement agreement, which includes terms and conditions substantially similar to those in the Hytera Agreement, should the board of directors of Norsat determine that Privet's proposal constitutes a "Superior Proposal" as defined in the Hytera Agreement.

Privet Fund Management LLC Announces Intention To Vote Against Arrangement Resolution Between Norsat International And Hytera Communications Co.









PR Newswire

   Believes Norsat Board Failed to Secure Additional Value for Shareholders    Considers Current Offer from Hytera Against the Best Interests of All Stakeholders    Privet Fund's Current Offer to Acquire Norsat at US$11.50 per Share Remains Open    ATLANTA ,  June 19, 2017  /PRNewswire/ - Privet Fund Management LLC ("Privet" or "we"), the largest shareholder of Norsat International Inc. ("Norsat") (TSX:NII, NYSE MKT:NSAT), announced today that Privet will be voting its approximate 17.6% common share ownership AGAINST the proposed arrangement resolution with Hytera Communications Co., Ltd. ("Hytera").  Privet believes the Norsat Board of Directors squandered a significant opportunity to extract additional value for all shareholders by failing to deliver a topping offer from Hytera while Privet's bona fide, fully financed offer of US$11.50 was on the table.  "We find it incredible that the Norsat Board believes an identical offer from Hytera represents the best interests of all stakeholders in light of the mounting political scrutiny and regulatory uncertainty surrounding a transaction with Hytera, 1  " said Ryan Levenson, managing member of Privet. "Even more egregious, in exchange for merely matching Privet's offer, the Norsat Board gifted an additional US$500,000 to Hytera in the form of an increased termination fee, making it even more expensive for a third party to deliver a topping bid. The increased fee brings the total amount of incremental termination fees Norsat has bestowed upon Hytera for just keeping up with Privet to US$1 Million - or US$0.17 per share.  That is money that could have gone directly to shareholders, rather than used to ensure that Hytera remains in an advantageous negotiating position," added Mr. Levenson.
