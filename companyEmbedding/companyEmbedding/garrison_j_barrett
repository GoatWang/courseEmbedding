The Garrison Barrett Group Inc. grew out of the 1991 merger of The Garrison Group and Barrett/Hearn/Kunz. Aubrey Garrison's partner, Oren Smith, died in the July 1991 crash of a L'Express commuter plane, and Lauren Barrett lost one of his partners to cancer the same week. The two met to discuss the challenges of replacing their lost colleagues and decided to merge their companies the following November.
Garrison Barrett's architectural and design work is about 40 percent churches, 30 percent retail and 25 percent universities and institutional.




 


The firm designed some of Birmingham's most popular churches: The Church at Brook Hills, Metropolitan Church of God and Mountain Top Community Church.





The firm's client list incliudes Publix, Bruno's Supermarkets Inc., Coca-Cola Bottling Co. United Inc. and the Sirote & Permutt PC law firm.
Barrett's son, Brian, is a principal in the firm along with his father, Garrison and Jeff Quinn. Garrison's daughter Meg Krawczyk, is an interior designer, and his son-in-law, Craig Krawczyk, is a project architect.
