DNB Financial Corporation Reports Second Quarter 2017 Results






GlobeNewswire



Jul 24, 2017 9:00 AM EDT













 




























































 DOWNINGTOWN, Pa., July 24, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- DNB Financial Corporation (Nasdaq:DNBF), today reported net income in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") of $2.3 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, for the quarter ending June 30, 2017, compared with $1.1 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, for the same quarter, last year.  For the six months ending June 30, 2017, the Company reported net income of $4.7 million, or $1.10 per diluted share, compared with $2.7 million, or $0.93 per diluted share, for the same period, last year. DNB Financial Corporation (the "Company" or "DNB") is the parent of DNB First, National Association, one of the first nationally-chartered community banks to serve the greater Philadelphia region.  On October 1, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of Philadelphia-based East River Bank ("East River") and its results of operations are included in the consolidated results for the periods ended December 31, 2016, March 31, 2017, and June 30, 2017, but are not included in the results of operations for any other periods.  On a core basis, the Company reported net income of $1.8 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, for the quarter ending June 30, 2017, compared with $1.2 million, or $0.41 per diluted share, for the corresponding prior year quarter.  Core earnings, which is a non-GAAP measure of net income, excludes purchase accounting adjustments (accretion) of $468,000, merger-related expenses of $26,000, amortization of intangible assets of $23,000, gains from the sale of investment securities of $25,000, tax benefit of $153,000 for stock option exercises, and an income tax adjustment of $126,000 for the three months ending June 30, 2017.  DNB adopted the new accounting guidance for equity-based transactions requiring that all excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies associated with equity-based compensation be recognized as an income tax benefit or expense in the income statement. Previously, tax effects resulting from changes in the Company's share price subsequent to the grant date were recorded through stockholders' equity at the time of vesting or exercise.   The adoption of the accounting guidance resulted in a $153,000 income tax benefit in the second quarter of 2017. Please see the Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 6 of the release.  Non-GAAP financial measures include references to the terms "core" or "operating."
