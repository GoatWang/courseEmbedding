Disclosure

Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. The FundX Upgrader Funds (“Funds) are considered “funds of funds” and an investor will indirectly bear the principal risks and its share of the fees and expenses of the underlying funds. Shareholders will pay higher expenses than they would if they invested directly in the underlying funds. The Funds employ an “Upgrading” strategy whereby investment decisions are based on near-term performance, however, the Funds may be exposed to the risk of buying underlying funds immediately following a sudden, brief surge in performance that may be followed by a subsequent drop in market value. The Sustainable Impact Fund’s sustainable impact investment policy, which incorporates an analysis of environmental, social and corporate governance factors, may result in the Fund foregoing opportunities to buy certain Underlying Funds when it might otherwise be advantageous to do so, or selling its holdings in certain Underlying Funds for sustainable impact investment reasons when it might be otherwise disadvantageous for it to do so. The Funds invest in underlying funds and these underlying funds may invest in securities of small companies, which involve greater volatility than investing in larger, more established companies, or they may invest in foreign securities, which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods; these risks are greater for investments in emerging markets. The underlying funds may invest in debt securities, which typically decrease in value when interest rates rise; this risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Lower-rated and non-rated securities present a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher rated securities. While the Upgrader Funds are diversified, the underlying funds may invest in a limited number of issuers and therefore may be considered nondiversified. The underlying funds may engage in short sales; an underlying fund’s investment performance may suffer if it is required to close out a short position earlier than intended. Some underlying funds may borrow money for leveraging and will incur interest expense. Some underlying funds may use derivatives, which involve risks different from, and in certain cases, greater than the risks presented by more traditional investments. ETFs are subject to additional risks that do not apply to conventional mutual funds, including the risks that the market price of an ETF’s shares may trade at a discount to its net asset value, an active secondary trading market may not develop or be maintained, or trading may be halted by the exchange in which they trade, which may impact a Fund’s ability to sell its shares. The underlying funds may invest in asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, which involve additional risks such as credit risk, prepayment risk, possible illiquidity and default, and increased susceptibility to adverse economic developments.
Past performance does not guarantee future results. While the Funds are no-load, management fees and other expenses will apply. The Fund is offered only to United States residents, and information on this site is intended only for such persons. Nothing on this web site should be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell shares of the Fund in any jurisdiction where the offer or solicitation would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Before you invest in the FundX Funds, please refer to the prospectus for important information about the investment company, including investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. You may also obtain a prospectus by calling 866-455-3863. The prospectus should be read carefully before you invest or send money.
The FundX Upgrader Funds are distributed by Quasar Distributors, LLC.

The Challenge of Global Investing
Submitted by FundX Investment Group on June 21st, 2016

A decade ago, foreign markets, particularly emerging markets like Brazil and Mexico, were clearly the place to be. But markets changed, and in recent years, U.S. markets have strongly outperformed most foreign markets. This can make it difficult for investors to decide when to invest in foreign funds.







How to Take Advantage of ‘Persistence of Performance’ in Mutual Funds
Submitted by FundX Investment Group on June 21st, 2016


Morningstar’s January 2016 study, Performance Persistence Among U.S. Mutual Funds, found evidence of what academics call “persistence of performance”: funds that have done well recently tend to continue to do well in the coming months and even years.







How Much Can You Withdraw From Your Retirement Account?
Submitted by FundX Investment Group on June 21st, 2016

Company Description


FundX Investment Group uses an 'Upgrading' approach to overcome market challenges and to identify investment opportunities with the flexibility to exploit the next trend. Upgrading involves measuring the near-term performance of mutual funds (twelve months and less) and comparing them to returns of funds with similar risk. The firm ranks hundreds of funds in this manner each month. They invest in funds with the best recent returns and monitor their performance. When a fund drops in rank, they 'upgrade.' FundX moves incrementally to the top-ranked funds by progressively selling the lower ranked funds and reinvesting in the new market leaders. Funds with the highest returns to rise to the top of the firm's rankings regardless of their investment approach. The firm groups equity funds into four risk classes, with bond funds grouped into a fifth class. They don't isolate international funds from domestic or growth funds from value funds. Instead, the firm segregates funds based on portfolio diversification and downside risk.

          FundX Investment Group        









	New Name.  Same Process, People & Products.

	DAL Investment Company, the advisor to the FundX Upgrader Funds, now has a new name: FundX Investment Group.  FundX better reflects our relationship to the FundX Upgrader Funds, our NoLoad FundX newsletter and our private client accounts.  All three services provide access to the very same FundX Upgrading strategy and the same, long-tenured group of portfolio managers.   

	Although the name is new, the same Upgrading process is used to manage every FundX portfolio, the same investment team actively manages the FundX portfolios and the same three FundX products – clients accounts, a do-it-yourself newsletter and our family of mutual funds – help investors achieve their investment goals.


Publication Date: Upgrader Quarterly: Winter 2012 




 
 




Disclosure

Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. The FundX Upgrader Funds (“Funds) are considered “funds of funds” and an investor will indirectly bear the principal risks and its share of the fees and expenses of the underlying funds. Shareholders will pay higher expenses than they would if they invested directly in the underlying funds. The Funds employ an “Upgrading” strategy whereby investment decisions are based on near-term performance, however, the Funds may be exposed to the risk of buying underlying funds immediately following a sudden, brief surge in performance that may be followed by a subsequent drop in market value. The Sustainable Impact Fund’s sustainable impact investment policy, which incorporates an analysis of environmental, social and corporate governance factors, may result in the Fund foregoing opportunities to buy certain Underlying Funds when it might otherwise be advantageous to do so, or selling its holdings in certain Underlying Funds for sustainable impact investment reasons when it might be otherwise disadvantageous for it to do so. The Funds invest in underlying funds and these underlying funds may invest in securities of small companies, which involve greater volatility than investing in larger, more established companies, or they may invest in foreign securities, which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods; these risks are greater for investments in emerging markets. The underlying funds may invest in debt securities, which typically decrease in value when interest rates rise; this risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Lower-rated and non-rated securities present a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher rated securities. While the Upgrader Funds are diversified, the underlying funds may invest in a limited number of issuers and therefore may be considered nondiversified. The underlying funds may engage in short sales; an underlying fund’s investment performance may suffer if it is required to close out a short position earlier than intended. Some underlying funds may borrow money for leveraging and will incur interest expense. Some underlying funds may use derivatives, which involve risks different from, and in certain cases, greater than the risks presented by more traditional investments. ETFs are subject to additional risks that do not apply to conventional mutual funds, including the risks that the market price of an ETF’s shares may trade at a discount to its net asset value, an active secondary trading market may not develop or be maintained, or trading may be halted by the exchange in which they trade, which may impact a Fund’s ability to sell its shares. The underlying funds may invest in asset-backed and mortgage-backed securities, which involve additional risks such as credit risk, prepayment risk, possible illiquidity and default, and increased susceptibility to adverse economic developments.
Past performance does not guarantee future results. While the Funds are no-load, management fees and other expenses will apply. The Fund is offered only to United States residents, and information on this site is intended only for such persons. Nothing on this web site should be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell shares of the Fund in any jurisdiction where the offer or solicitation would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction. Before you invest in the FundX Funds, please refer to the prospectus for important information about the investment company, including investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. You may also obtain a prospectus by calling 866-455-3863. The prospectus should be read carefully before you invest or send money.
The FundX Upgrader Funds are distributed by Quasar Distributors, LLC.

Retirement Investing 

Most fund investors – 92% according to the Investment Company Institute – invest for retirement. But many people are putting money aside for retirement without any idea about how much they’ll actually need to retire comfortably.
Planning for retirement is tough because there are so many unknowns. What will the market do? How should I invest and how long will my portfolio last? How much can I safely take out of my account so I don’t run out of money?
One thing we’ve learned in nearly 50 years of managing retirement accounts for high-net-worth clients and corporate retirement plans is that avoiding these questions isn’t going to help you get the life you deserve in retirement.
If you want to have a comfortable and secure retirement, you need to address these uncertainties and come up with a plan that gets you on track and keeps you there.
Our Retirement Guide gives you a proven framework to think through the important decisions you’ll need to make in retirement, based on historical data, academic research, and our own experience managing more than $800 million.
The next step is to talk with an advisor who can help you figure out a plan.
We can help you move forward with your retirement planning.

The Challenge of Global Investing
Submitted by FundX Investment Group on June 21st, 2016


A decade ago, foreign markets, particularly emerging markets like Brazil and Mexico, were clearly the place to be. But markets changed, and in recent years, U.S. markets have strongly outperformed most foreign markets. This can make it difficult for investors to decide when to invest in foreign funds. 

 


How to Take Advantage of ‘Persistence of Performance’ in Mutual Funds
Submitted by FundX Investment Group on June 21st, 2016



Morningstar’s January 2016 study, Performance Persistence Among U.S. Mutual Funds, found evidence of what academics call “persistence of performance”: funds that have done well recently tend to continue to do well in the coming months and even years. 

 


How Much Can You Withdraw From Your Retirement Account?
Submitted by FundX Investment Group on June 21st, 2016



Most retirees will fund a portion of their lives by making withdrawals from their retirement accounts. The common rule of thumb is that retirees can withdraw 4% from their accounts each year, adjusted for inflation, with a high probability that their assets will last a lifetime. 

 


Sustainable Responsible Investing Has Come a Long Way (video)
Submitted by FundX Investment Group on June 21st, 2016


“Many of the investors I talk to these days aren’t only focused on gains,” FundX President Janet Brown explains in her latest video. “They also want to invest in a way that has a positive impact on the world.” And sustainable responsible investing, or SRI, helps them do just that. 

 


In Uncertain Markets, Focus on What You Know
Submitted by FundX Investment Group on June 20th, 2016


In volatile markets, we tend to focus on what we don’t know: will the sell-off get worse or have we reached a bottom? Is this a routine correction or the start of a bear market? So it helps to remind ourselves what we do know.
Here are four certainties to keep in mind in uncertain times:
1. Stocks have been the best way to make money over time 

 


Secrets of a Long-Term Investing Strategy
Submitted by FundX Investment Group on June 20th, 2016

Is Volatility Normal? (video)

Taking Charge of Your Financial Future
Submitted by FundX Investment Group on June 20th, 2016



Most people invest in order to reach long-term goals, like retirement. But what’s the best way to invest? Should you manage your own portfolio of funds, or have it managed for you? 

 


Are You Focused on the Worst Possible Scenario or the Most Likely Outcome?
Submitted by FundX Investment Group on June 20th, 2016

Sustainable Investing 

Today, many investors want to invest in a way that has a positive impact on the world, and sustainable responsible investing (SRI) can help you do just that.
We have managed sustainable responsible portfolios for more than a decade. Sustainable investing rewards responsible corporate behavior, and it allows investors to align their values with their money without sacrificing potential performance.
What began as socially responsible (or socially conscious) investing in the 1980s has evolved into a wide and growing range of investment products and asset classes. While there is no single approach to sustainable and responsible investing, most approaches consider environmental, social and corporate governance criteria (ESG) to generate long-term competitive financial returns and make a positive societal impact.
We use our time-tested Upgrading investment approach to invest in SRI funds with strong recent returns. Funds give us access to the talents of leading managers and research teams around the world. They have the time and expertise to truly evaluate a company’s record on environmental, social and or corporate governance (ESG) issues.

Who We Are 

With FundX Investment Group, you have an experienced team of fund experts who are dedicated to helping you build wealth, reach your goals, and stay on track in an ever-changing world. 
Experienced, professional investment guidance
Our firm was one of the first to use funds to professionally manage private client accounts in 1969. Today, we use funds and ETFs to manage more than $800 million for high-net-worth clients, foundations and mutual funds.
We developed the Upgrading strategy, a logical, evidence-based global approach to investing that’s been confirmed by decades of academic and industry research, and we share this time-tested approach with enterprising investors through NoLoad FundX, the only fund newsletter to beat the market since 1980, according to the Wall Street Journal (June 2014).
A fiduciary who acts in your best interests
As a registered investment adviser, or RIA, we are fiduciaries, meaning that we act in your best interest. We are not compensated by any of the underlying funds we invest in; as a fee-only advisor, we avoid that conflict of interest. We are compensated only through asset management fees from you - our clients and shareholders - that’s who we’re working for. 
Woman-owned and -led firm
Janet Brown is president of the firm and has been with the company for nearly 40 years.  She and the firm’s team of long-tenured portfolio managers serve as the investment committee and work closely with clients to provide personal and individualized services. All of our key people have a stake in the firm’s long-running success.

History  

In 1969, native San Franciscan, Stanford University graduate, and World War II pilot Burt Berry took the bold step of using noload mutual funds instead of individual stocks and bonds to professionally manage assets for clients.
The concept was virtually unheard of at the time: the mutual fund industry was young, and most funds carried 8.5% loads or sales charges that rewarded a broker just for selling a fund to an investor. But loads ate into investors’ returns and they discouraged investors from selling their funds, even when their funds weren’t performing well. The brokers didn’t mind this arrangement, but Burt thought investors were getting a raw deal.
Burt focused on noload funds. He didn’t need a broker to buy these funds, and if these funds didn’t do well, he could sell them and move on to something else. There were only a few dozen noload funds available at that time, and it was almost impossible to obtain useful performance data on them, so Burt began calculating the performance of noload funds using a spreadsheet and an adding machine. He invested in the funds that had strong recent returns; it seemed logical to him that the funds that were doing well now were doing something right. When a fund began to lag its peers, he redeemed the shares and directed the proceeds to a better performing alternative. He called this process “Upgrading.”

Years later, academic research would find that mutual funds that have outperformed in recent months tend to continue to outperform in ensuing months, a phenomenon academics called “persistence of performance”. Burt’s Upgrading process took advantage of this phenomenon.
