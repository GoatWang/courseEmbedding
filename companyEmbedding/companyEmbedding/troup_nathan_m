This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 
Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.
What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.
The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

NATHAN COURTNEY TROUP 
Nathan Troup, 32, of Lee's Summit, died on September 8, 2013. Memorial services will be held on Thursday, September 12th at 7:00 pm at Covenant Reformed Church, 9511 Lane Ave, K.C. MO. He was born Jan 15, 1981. He was able to love people that our society fears, despises and pities, people that no one else could or would even bother with, but that are children of God, nonetheless. Nathan is survived by David Lee Troup (Dad), Patricia Ann "Pat" Troup (Mom), Allison Marie Troup Schiltz (older sister), and Cara Louise Troup Burton (younger sister). Per his wishes, he will share the grave of his eldest sister, Lisa Pauline Troup, in Walsh Cemetery in Walsh, Colorado. Fond memories and condolences for the family may be left at www.floralhillsfuneralhome.com. (Arrangements by D.W. Newcomer's Sons Floral Hills Funeral Home, 816-353-1218)

Chris and I are so sorry about Nathan.  I was very happy that I got to meet him at the support group once.  We talked about his acquaintance with Chris from the peer-to-peer group.  Chris said that he liked to visit with Nathan, that "we had a lot in common."  Praying for you all.  Jo
