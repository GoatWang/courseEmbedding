Profile

Representative Cases







Joel Smith is a nationally recognized first-chair trial lawyer with more than 30 years of experience dedicated to defending high exposure product liability and mass tort litigation. As lead trial counsel, he has tried to verdict almost 20 high-exposure product liability trials across the country. In recent years, he has been a central figure in two of the biggest product liability crises to hit the automotive industry, including Toyota's unintended acceleration litigation and Honda's handling of the massive recall over faulty Takata air bags.
In defending his clients, Joel begins with a robust commitment to understanding a company's product–how the product works, or how it doesn't, then drills down to the scientific truth, becoming so well-versed in the most minute of facts and science to fully enable him to teach it to judges, juries, government officials, the media and others.


Named a Product Liability MVP in 2015 by Law360, Joel defends clients in product liability and mass tort litigation, focusing on automotive and pharmaceutical cases. He has represented manufacturers of automobiles, tires, forklifts and other equipment, as well as consumer products. Joel's experience defending automotive manufacturers in catastrophic injury and wrongful death claims nationwide, includes roof crush, air bags, restraints, rollover, crashworthiness, unintended acceleration, and tire defects, among others.


In pharmaceutical litigation, his experience includes the defense of PPA litigation, where Joel was given a first-chair role. He also played a leading role in two MDL Daubert hearings. He was the principal examiner for all defendants in several preservation depositions of MDL experts. In addition, Joel was selected as trial counsel in hormone therapy cases and cases involving infant cough/cold products.


Joel has taught trial advocacy at the University of South Carolina, and has lectured nationally on automotive, pharmaceutical and trial advocacy issues.

During his seven year tenure, the Moore School reached record levels in international rankings, enrollment and academic achievements. He retired in 2008 and was named Dean Emeritus.
Mr. Smith has also been a visionary leader in the not-for-profit sector and a champion for vital issues such as economic development, education and the arts across South Carolina. He has served on the boards of numerous organizations and educational institutions, including Spoleto Festival USA, The University of the South, The Palmetto Institute, SC Educational TV Endowment, SC Education Accountability Oversight Committee, Still Hopes Episcopal Retirement Community and the Columbia Museum of Art.
Among the many honors he has received for his professional achievements and civic leadership, Mr. Smith was awarded the Order of the Palmetto, South Carolina’s highest civilian award, in 2003, was inducted into the South Carolina Business Hall of Fame in 2001 and was named Humanitarian of the Year by the United Way of the Midlands in 2000.
Mr. Smith holds a political science degree from the University of the South and graduated from the National Commercial Lending School at the University of Oklahoma and the School of Banking of the South at Louisiana State University. He served as member of the United States Navy and Naval Reserves, retiring in 1987 with the rank of Commander.
Prior to joining the Institute’s Board, Mr. Smith served as chair of the Long-Term Care Taskforce, which was convened by the Institute during 2014-2015 and released 30 recommendations to improve the long-term care system and prepare it for the rapid growth in the aging population.
