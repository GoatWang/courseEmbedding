RIGHTSIDE GROUP, LTD. SHAREHOLDER ALERT: Former SEC Attorney Willie Briscoe Investigates Sale To Donuts Inc.






Business Wire




Jun 14, 2017 1:02 PM EDT













 
















































  Former United States Securities and Exchange Commission attorney Willie Briscoe is investigating potential claims against the Board of Directors of Rightside Group, Ltd. ("Rightside") (NASDAQ: NAME) concerning the sale to Donuts Inc. Under the terms of the all-cash tender offer, Rightside shareholders will only receive $10.60 for each share owned, which is virtually no premium over the 52-week high and lower than at least one analyst's estimated value of $11.50 per share.  If you are an affected investor, and you want to learn more about the investigation or if you have information that you believe would be helpful to our investigation of the fairness of the proposed transaction, contact Willie Briscoe at The Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC via email at shareholders@thebriscoelawfirm.com or by calling (888) 809-2750. There is no cost or fee to you.  The investigation centers on whether Rightside's Board of Directors is acting in the shareholders' best interests, whether the board considered alternatives to the acquisition, and whether the board has employed an adequate process to review and act on the proposed transaction. Notably, at least one analyst with Yahoo! Finance believes the true inherent value of the stock could be as high as $11.50.  The Briscoe Law Firm, PLLC is a full service business litigation and shareholder rights advocacy firm with more than 20 years of experience in complex litigation and transactional matters.

Rightside® Opens .GAMES Domain for Gamers and Developers to Create Awesome URLs
Short, unique, and branded .GAMES domains quickly help website owners identify themselves as passionate fans, brands, and enthusiasts of the gaming industry

KIRKLAND, Wash., Sept.  21, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Domain name registry Rightside Group LTD (NASDAQ:NAME) launched the .GAMES domain extension today for a rapidly growing base of gamers and developers that want to use their domain as a meaningful, marketable way to connect with their audiences. Following the Sunrise Phase where trademark holders can preregister names, .GAMES became Rightside's number-one performing new top level-domain (TLD), seeing applications from virtually every major studio, including Activision Publishing, Blizzard Entertainment, Electronic Arts, Nintendo, and Ubisoft Entertainment.












.GAMES domain names









"Whether used as a primary website address or a redirect back to a mothership brand, the shift toward new TLDs is becoming more mainstream in markets where the domain is an integral part of a website owner's identity, branding strategy, or plans to extend marketing reach," said Rightside CEO Taryn Naidu. "As Internet culture continues to shift toward social media, live streaming, a rapidly breaking news cycle, and gaming, our TLDs like .SOCIAL, .LIVE, .NEWS, and now .GAMES open countless opportunities to create unique IDs." Intersection of Passion and Business The introduction of .GAMES domains coincides with a gaming industry spike which is expected to reach nearly $100 billion in revenue in 2016 among 
video games alone, in addition to tabletop games, casino gaming, and sporting events. A 2015 survey by the International Game Developers Association indicated that 42 percent of respondents felt that finding better discovery mechanisms for their games was "very important" to the growth of the gaming industry. From a domain perspective, there are more than 400,000 unique websites with "games" in their domain's URL, promising a large addressable market for the .GAMES TLD. Steve Jackson Games, a publisher of books, games, and magazines for game fans, sees .GAMES as an opportunity to share its passion for gaming and to creatively engage with and grow its online audience. The company redirects an exact-match domain, SteveJackson.Games, to their homepage and uses a branded link shortener, SJ.Games for social media links and print ads. "The SJ.Games URL provides us with a useful alternative in the comic book and magazine ads we place. Every little centimeter on an ad matters so saving room is essential," said Rhea Friesen, Marketing Director at Steve Jackson Games and tabletop game enthusiast. "As an added bonus, shorter URLs are more convenient for customers interested in our games." Exciting new use 
cases include: Halo.Games and Xbox.Games - Microsoft redirects to Bing search results for the Halo and Xbox seriesF1.Games and GrandPrix.Games - Formula 1 RacingTelltale.Games - Developer known for episodic adventure games with licenses to produce games for The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, Minecraft, and Batman888poker.Games - Second-largest online poker brandSila.Games - 
Digital game download storeMonteCarlo.Games - Casino and gaming operator Societe des Bains de MerCoolMath.Games - Online game aggregator page, loosely themed around math education Availability and PricingThe new .GAMES domains are immediately available on a first come-first served basis via Rightside's registrar partners at www.registrars.rocks. Starting at a suggested retail price of $15.00, .GAMES domains are a terrific value for fans and businesses. About Rightside Rightside® inspires and delivers new possibilities for consumers and businesses to define and present themselves online. The company, with its affiliates, is a leading provider of domain name services, offering one of the industry's most comprehensive platforms for the discovery, registration, usage, and monetization 
of domain names. In addition to being a new gTLD registry operator, Rightside is home to some of the most admired brands in the industry, including Enom and Name.com. Headquartered in Kirkland, WA, Rightside has offices in North America and Europe. For more information please visit www.rightside.co.

							About Rightside
						
				
Rightside is all about helping you tell your story, your way.
As we grow beyond the dot coms and dot nets, Rightside’s new personalized domain names and services can tell your story in a way that’s as unique as you are. And with our solutions platform, it’s easy for resellers, registries, registrars, and domain investors to build and grow their businesses.

That's the Rightside story. What's yours?





Our Values
 

Do rightWe are respectful, transparent, and straightforward with our customers, partners and coworkers. By striving to always do the right thing, and delivering what we promise, we raise the bar and challenge our industry peers to do the same.  


 

Keep growingOurs is an industry in constant transformation. To some, that may be intimidating. To us, it’s motivating. We are driven by the challenge of the unknown and uncharted, ready to roll up our sleeves and find a way. The payoff is always worth the effort, and we celebrate each other and our successes. 


 

Band togetherWe may have different roles and different customers, but we share a common goal. When we stick together, we have success. When we keep talking - sharing knowledge, information and ideas - we guide each other and the industry forward. We’re one team and one organization united for a common cause.  


 

Defy limitsWe are .NINJA. Grounded by our experience and expertise in domain names, we are not afraid to think creatively, try something new, take a chance. We take time to question and experiment, always seeking to learn from our mistakes as much as our successes. We lead the industry forward by delivering on our vision.  


 

Be thereWe want to help our customers reach their goals - getting online and telling their story, their way. There is no such thing as half-measures when it comes to service - going above and beyond is simply how we do it. As partners to our customers, we will always give the highest levels of help, knowledge and guidance.

Donuts Seeks To Acquire Entirety Of Rightside Group, Ltd.'s gTLD Registry

BELLEVUE, Wash., June 24, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Donuts Inc., the world's largest operator of new domain name extensions, today publicly announced its interest in acquiring Rightside Group, Ltd.'s entire registry of generic top-level domains (gTLDs, also known as domain extensions) and related assets for $70 million in an all-cash deal. Donuts believes that this potential transaction presents a strong strategic opportunity to bolster Donuts' industry-leading gTLD portfolio and is compelling for Rightside and its investors. Donuts previously expressed its interest to Rightside relating to a potential acquisition for these assets but Rightside has repeatedly disregarded the offer. 


This move is in keeping with Donuts' stated strategy of expanding its selection of not-com domain extensions, such as .movie, .LTD, .agency, .email, .school, .group, and many more, each providing a more descriptive and creative means for big brands, entrepreneurs, and dreamers alike to brand their businesses, products and services. Donuts already leads the industry, having secured 196 domain extensions, and is best positioned to market these assets by driving industry consolidation. 
Donuts' Acquisition of Rightside's Registry Business – A Win for All Parties

Separating Rightside's registry and registrar businesses is the best approach to unlocking value in both businesses, providing Rightside with substantial capital for investor liquidity and the optionality to invest in and grow its core registrar businesses. 
The proposed acquisition complements Donuts' current portfolio and expands the range of domains and related services that Donuts can offer, further enhancing what is already the greatest portfolio of domain extensions. 
Donuts is the optimal acquirer for Rightside's registry business given Donuts' leadership in the marketplace, the parties' long-standing business relationship, our shared technology platform, and regulatory considerations, all of which ensure the highest certainty of deal closure.
About Donuts
Donuts securely operates the largest number of the Internet's top-level domain names and provides varied and relevant online identities, in multiple languages and character sets, to businesses, individuals, and organizations worldwide. Donuts is headquartered in Bellevue, Washington, with offices in Los Angeles, Chicago, Washington, D.C. and London. For more information, please visit www.donuts.domains.
Forward Looking Statement
Certain statements in this press release are "forward-looking statements." Words indicating future events, performance, results and actions, such as "will" and "believe," and variations of such words, and similar expressions identify forward-looking statements, but their absence does not mean that a statement is not forward-looking. The forward-looking statements in this press release include, among others, statements regarding interactions with and actions relating to investors and execution of business strategies.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future actions, events or performance, which may vary materially from those expressed or implied in such statements.  
Letter to Rightside regarding Registry Transaction
The text of a letter sent to the Chief Executive Officer of Rightside on June 24, 2016:
Rightside Group, Ltd.Board of Directorsc/o Taryn Naidu 5808 Lake Washington Blvd. NE, Suite 300Kirkland, WA 98033
Dear Taryn:
Following due consideration, we have concluded that it is in the best interest of both Donuts Inc. ("Donuts") and the investors of Rightside Group, Ltd. ("Rightside") that Donuts should publicly present our interest in acquiring Rightside's entire generic top-level domain ("gTLD") portfolio and related assets (the "Transaction"). To date, we have expressed our interest in the Transaction in a May 26, 2016 letter to Rightside's Board of Directors and have spoken to you and another member of Rightside's Board of Directors directly, but have been repeatedly denied a broader conversation with your Board.
Our proposal represents an undeniably compelling case for all parties involved. For Donuts, Rightside's collection of gTLDs complements Donuts' current business and expands the range of domains and related services we can offer, bolstering what is already the greatest range of "not-com" options and economies of scale in the registry market today. For Rightside and its investors, separating Rightside's registry and registrar businesses would unlock substantial value for both businesses by, among other things, allowing each to focus on their strengths and avoiding channel conflict. We firmly believe that Donuts offers Rightside a differentiated ability to consummate the Transaction in an efficient manner and with an exceptionally high level of certainty.
We note that our all-cash offer of $70 million represents approximately 40% of Rightside's current market capitalization to acquire assets that contribute approximately 5% of its revenue. We believe strongly in the value of those assets, which we trust will appreciate substantially in Donuts' consolidated portfolio and business model. But we have an equal amount of conviction that Rightside's registry portfolio's full value will go unrealized as long as it remains conjoined to your registrar businesses. Correspondingly, we believe the valuation of Rightside's registrar businesses are also constrained under your current operating model. A separation of the registry and registrar assets will unlock stockholder value and allow you to focus on your core business, which is generating approximately $200 million in annual sales.
We believe Rightside would do best for its stockholders to acknowledge that our case is sound and work with us to enter into the Transaction. The overwhelming evidence validates the Transaction's merits; enterprises of your size operating both registry and registrar businesses under "vertically integrated" models have poor track records of performance due to, among other things, inherent and inimical channel and supplier conflicts. For example, Rightside earns approximately 20% of its registry's revenue from just one of its registrar's competitors, GoDaddy Inc., and pays approximately 43% of your registrar's revenue to just one of your registry's competitors, VeriSign, Inc. Rightside's recent performance, and the similar struggles Minds + Machines Group Limited encountered while employing the same basic model, underscore the problems with vertical integration in this space. Rightside and its investors should note the improved financial performance that Minds + Machines has enjoyed following abandonment of that model in favor of operating as a pure-play business.
We remain convinced that this is a deal that represents the best possible outcome for all involved. Unfortunately, the merits of our proposal have not, to date, been appropriately discussed or considered. Donuts is the leader in the new gTLD industry, we fully understand the business we seek to acquire, and we believe we can offer unrivaled certainty and efficiency to consummate the proposed transaction due to, among other things, our geographic proximity and the shared DNA between our two companies. We trust that you will give this proposal the full consideration it deserves and seek the counsel of your investors in doing so. Time remains of the essence. While this $70 million proposal is non-binding, Donuts has the cash to consummate the Transaction but is considering other strategic objectives in parallel. Therefore, we look forward to discussing this opportunity for mutual benefit with you and your Board within two weeks.
Very truly yours,
Paul Stahura

Overview















	Rightside is a recognized leader in Internet domain name services. With a mission to advance the way businesses and consumers define and present themselves online, the company is the industry’s only end-to-end vertically integrated provider operating at scale and able to service all aspects of a domain name. Rightside is also a chief participant in an historic expansion of the Internet name space - broadening domain name extensions from just 22 legacy options like .com and .net to potentially more than 1,300 including ~700 generic Top Level Domains (gTLDs) and 600 branded Top Level Domains (like .Loreal or .Google).

	Rightside recently launched a new registry platform that offers one of the largest portfolios of domain name extensions on the market – including highly desirable gTLDs such as .REVIEWS, .SOCIAL and .ATTORNEY. The company currently has 16 million domain names under management, more than 20,000 distribution partners, an award-winning retail registrar and the leading domain name auction service through its NameJet joint venture. The vertical integration between its registry and registrar businesses uniquely positions Rightside to service every stage of the domain name lifecycle – from discovery and registration to development and monetization of domain names – while also supporting broad market adoption and usage.

	Pervasive megatrends are driving substantial growth potential in the Internet’s multi-billion dollar domain name industry, and prominent players like Rightside are well-positioned to benefit from increased momentum in the new gTLD expansion program. The company’s business model and attractive domain name unit economics dramatically improve Rightside’s revenue, margin and free cash flow opportunity. These key drivers coupled with leadership by an experienced management team, experienced in the Internet and domain name services industry, put Rightside in a solid position for compelling growth and value creation.

Earnings Quiet Period
	Rightside does not conduct any investor calls or meetings during the Company’s quiet period which starts 14 days prior to the closing of the financial period to be reported.

Overview















	Rightside is a recognized leader in Internet domain name services. With a mission to advance the way businesses and consumers define and present themselves online, the company is the industry’s only end-to-end vertically integrated provider operating at scale and able to service all aspects of a domain name. Rightside is also a chief participant in an historic expansion of the Internet name space - broadening domain name extensions from just 22 legacy options like .com and .net to potentially more than 1,300 including ~700 generic Top Level Domains (gTLDs) and 600 branded Top Level Domains (like .Loreal or .Google).

	Rightside recently launched a new registry platform that offers one of the largest portfolios of domain name extensions on the market – including highly desirable gTLDs such as .REVIEWS, .SOCIAL and .ATTORNEY. The company currently has 16 million domain names under management, more than 20,000 distribution partners, an award-winning retail registrar and the leading domain name auction service through its NameJet joint venture. The vertical integration between its registry and registrar businesses uniquely positions Rightside to service every stage of the domain name lifecycle – from discovery and registration to development and monetization of domain names – while also supporting broad market adoption and usage.

	Pervasive megatrends are driving substantial growth potential in the Internet’s multi-billion dollar domain name industry, and prominent players like Rightside are well-positioned to benefit from increased momentum in the new gTLD expansion program. The company’s business model and attractive domain name unit economics dramatically improve Rightside’s revenue, margin and free cash flow opportunity. These key drivers coupled with leadership by an experienced management team, experienced in the Internet and domain name services industry, put Rightside in a solid position for compelling growth and value creation.

Earnings Quiet Period
	Rightside does not conduct any investor calls or meetings during the Company’s quiet period which starts 14 days prior to the closing of the financial period to be reported.
