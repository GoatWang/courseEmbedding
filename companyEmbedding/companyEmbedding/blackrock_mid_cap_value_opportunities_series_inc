Portfolio Characteristics 

 
Portfolio Characteristics 



P/B Ratio
The price to book (P/B) value ratio is a fundamental measure used to determine if an investment is valued appropriately. The book value of a company is a measure of how much a company&#39;s assets are worth assuming the company&#39;s debts are paid off. Negative book values are excluded from this calculation and holding price to book ratios over 25 are set to 25.

as of 30-Jun-2017



1.69




P/E Ratio - Forward
The forward price-to-earnings ratio is used to assess a company’s valuation. To compute this ratio, the latest closing price is divided by the company’s consensus mean EPS estimate for the next unreported fiscal year. The ratio represents a weighted harmonic mean of the forward price-to-earnings ratios of its holdings with negative values being excluded from the calculation.

Stock and bond values fluctuate in price so the value of your investment can go down depending on market conditions.

International investing involves special risks including, but not limited to currency fluctuations, illiquidity and volatility. These risks may be heightened for investments in emerging markets.

The fund may use derivatives to hedge its investments or to seek to enhance returns. Derivatives entail risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and increase volatility.

Short-selling entails special risks. If the fund makes short sales in securities that increase in value, the fund will lose value. Any loss on short positions may or may not be offset by investing short-sale proceeds in other investments.

Investing in small- and mid-cap companies may entail greater risk than large-cap companies, due to shorter operating histories, less seasoned management or lower trading volumes.


Performance results reflect past performance and are no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of shares will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. All returns assume reinvestment of all dividends. Performance information shown without sales charge would have been lower if the applicable sales charge had been included. Performance during periods of exceptional market conditions should not be expected to be repeated in a normal market environment. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal.Fund details, holdings and characteristics are as of the date noted and subject to change. Yields are based on income earned for the period cited and on the Fund's NAV at the end of the period. Some BlackRock funds make distributions of ordinary income and capital gains at calendar year end. Those distributions temporarily cause extraordinarily high yields. There is no assurance that a fund will repeat that yield in the future. Subsequent monthly distributions that do not include ordinary income or capital gains in the form of dividends will likely be lower.


The Funds are distributed by BlackRock Investments, LLC (together with its affiliates, “BlackRock”).

Summary Prospectus

Investment Objective

The investment objective of the BlackRock Mid Cap Value
Opportunities Fund (the “Fund”) is to seek capital appreciation and, secondarily, income, by investing in securities, primarily equity securities that Fund management believes are undervalued and therefore represent an investment
value. Fees and Expenses of the Fund

This table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if
you buy and hold shares of the Fund. You may qualify for sales charge discounts if you and your family invest, or agree to invest in the future, at least $25,000 in the fund complex advised by BlackRock Advisors, LLC (“BlackRock”) or its
affiliates. More information about these and other discounts is available from your financial professional or your selected securities dealer, broker, investment adviser, service provider or industry professional (including BlackRock, The PNC
Financial Services Group, Inc. (“PNC”) and their respective affiliates) (each a “Financial Intermediary”) and in the “Details About the Share Classes” section on page 20 of the Fund’s prospectus and in the
“Purchase of Shares” section on page II-61 of Part II of the Fund’s Statement of Additional Information.

A contingent deferred sales
charge (“CDSC”) of 1.00% is assessed on certain redemptions of Investor A Shares made within 18 months after purchase where no initial sales charge was paid at time of purchase as part of an investment of $1,000,000 or more. 

2 
The CDSC is 4.50% if shares
are redeemed in less than one year. The CDSC for Investor B Shares decreases for redemptions made in subsequent years. After six years there is no CDSC on Investor B Shares. (See the section “Details About the Share Classes — Investor B
Shares” in the Fund’s prospectus for the complete schedule of CDSCs.)

There is no CDSC on Investor
C Shares after one year.

The Total
Annual Fund Operating Expenses do not correlate to the ratio of expenses to average net assets given in the Fund’s most recent annual report which does not include the Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses.

Example:
This Example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the
Fund with the cost of investing in other mutual funds. The Example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Fund for the time periods indicated and then redeem all of your shares at the end of those periods. The Example also assumes that your
investment has a 5% return each year and that the Fund’s operating expenses remain the same. Although your actual costs may be higher or lower, based on these assumptions your costs would be:

Portfolio Turnover:
The Fund pays transaction costs, such as commissions, when it buys and sells
securities (or “turns over” its portfolio). A higher portfolio turnover rate may indicate higher transaction costs and may result in higher taxes when shares are held in a taxable account. These costs, which are not reflected in annual
fund operating expenses or in the example, affect the Fund’s performance. During the most recent fiscal year, the Fund’s portfolio turnover rate was 65% of the average value of its portfolio.
Principal Investment Strategies of the Fund

The Fund tries to achieve its investment objective by
investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of equity securities. Under normal circumstances, the Fund invests at least 80% of its assets in equity securities of mid cap companies. Equity securities include common stock, preferred stock,
securities convertible into common stock, or securities or other instruments whose price is linked to the value of common stock. Mid cap companies are companies that at the time of purchase have market capitalizations in the range of companies
included in the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) MidCap 400 Value Index (generally between $0.7 billion and $10.2 billion as of March 31, 2015). This definition of mid-capitalization companies may be changed in response to changes in the
market. The Fund purchases securities that Fund management believes have long term potential to grow in size or become more profitable or that the stock market may value more highly in the future. Fund management places particular emphasis on stocks
trading at the low end of one or more valuation measures, such as price/book value, or price/sales, price/earnings or price/cash flow ratios. Such companies also may have particular qualities that affect the outlook for such companies, including an
attractive market niche. The Fund purchases primarily common stock of U.S. companies in trying to meet its investment objective. The Fund may also invest up to 30% of its total assets in the securities of foreign companies. The Fund may invest in
securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar.
Principal Risks of Investing in the Fund

Risk is inherent in all investing. The value of your
investment in the Fund, as well as the amount of return you receive on your investment, may fluctuate significantly from day to day and over time. You may lose part or all of your investment in the Fund or your investment may not perform as well as
other similar investments. The following is a summary description of principal risks of investing in the Fund. 


■

Equity Securities Risk — Stock markets are volatile. The price of equity securities fluctuates based on changes in a company’s financial condition and overall market and economic conditions. 

■
 
Foreign
Securities Risk — Foreign investments often involve special risks not present in U.S. investments that can increase the chances that the Fund will lose money. These risks include:
   
3  
 


 


■

The Fund generally holds its
foreign securities and cash in foreign banks and securities depositories, which may be recently organized or new to the foreign custody business and may be subject to only limited or no regulatory oversight. 

■

Changes in foreign currency
exchange rates can affect the value of the Fund’s portfolio. 

■

The economies of certain
foreign markets may not compare favorably with the economy of the United States with respect to such issues as growth of gross national product, reinvestment of capital, resources and balance of payments position. 

■

The governments of certain
countries may prohibit or impose substantial restrictions on foreign investments in their capital markets or in certain industries. 

■

Many foreign governments do
not supervise and regulate stock exchanges, brokers and the sale of securities to the same extent as does the United States and may not have laws to protect investors that are comparable to U.S. securities laws. 

■
 
Settlement and
 clearance procedures in certain foreign markets may result in delays in payment for or delivery of securities not typically associated with settlement and clearance of U.S. investments.   


■

Investment Style Risk — Under certain market conditions, value investments have performed better during periods of economic recovery. Therefore, this investment style may over
time go in and out of favor. At times when the investment style used by the Fund is out of favor, the Fund may underperform other equity funds that use different investment styles. 

■

Market Risk and Selection Risk
— Market risk is the risk that one or more markets in which the Fund invests will go down in value, including the possibility that the markets will go down sharply and unpredictably.
Selection risk is the risk that the securities selected by Fund management will underperform the markets, the relevant indices or the securities selected by other funds with similar investment objectives and investment strategies. This means you may
lose money. 

■
 
Mid Cap
Securities Risk — The securities of mid cap companies generally trade in lower volumes and are generally subject to greater and less predictable price changes than the securities of larger
capitalization companies.

Performance Information

The information shows you how the Fund’s performance has
varied year by year and provides some indication of the risks of investing in the Fund. The table compares the Fund’s performance to that of the S&P MidCap 400 Value Index, a broad measure of market performance. To the extent that
dividends and distributions have been paid by the Fund, the performance information for the Fund in the chart and table assumes reinvestment of the dividends and distributions. As with all such investments, past performance (before and after taxes)
is not an indication of future results. Sales charges are not reflected in the bar chart. If they were, returns would be less than those shown. However, the table includes all applicable fees and sales charges. If the Fund’s investment manager
and its affiliates had not waived or reimbursed certain Fund expenses during these periods, the Fund’s returns would have been lower. Updated information on the Fund’s performance, including its current net asset value, can be obtained
by visiting http://www.blackrock.com/funds or can be obtained by phone at (800) 882-0052.

relevant to investors who hold their shares through tax-deferred arrangements, such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. After-tax returns are shown for Investor A Shares only, and the after-tax returns for Investor B, Investor C,

Tax Information

The Fund’s dividends and distributions may be subject to
Federal income taxes and may be taxed as ordinary income or capital gains, unless you are a tax-exempt investor or are investing through a retirement plan, in which case you may be subject to Federal income tax upon withdrawal from such tax-deferred
arrangements. Payments to Broker/Dealers and Other
Financial Intermediaries 
If you purchase shares of the Fund through a Financial
Intermediary, the Fund and BlackRock Investments, LLC, the Fund’s distributor, or its affiliates may pay the Financial Intermediary for the sale of Fund shares and related services. These payments may create a conflict of interest by
influencing the Financial Intermediary and your individual financial professional to recommend the Fund over another investment. Ask your individual financial professional or visit your Financial Intermediary’s website for more
information.   6

We are pleased to provide you with this semi-annual report for                  
Merrill Lynch Asset Builder Program, Inc. The Program consists of               
five separate diversified portfolios, each with its own investment              
objectives.                                                                     

Complete performance information, including average annual total                
returns, for all five portfolios can be found on pages 7--11 of this            
report to shareholders.                                                         

Fundamental Value Portfolio                                                     
The quarter ended July 31, 1997 proved to be an exceptional one for             
the US equity market, with share prices rebounding sharply from the             
April downdraft. Driving the market higher were continued favorable             
economic and corporate dynamics as well as strong mutual fund cash              
inflows. The unmanaged Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P 500) Index                    
registered a +19.58% total return during the three months ended July
31, 1997, exceeding Fundamental Value Portfolio's total returns of              
+17.59%, +17.26%, +17.26% and +17.49% for Class A, Class B, Class C             
and Class D Shares, respectively. (Results shown do not reflect                 
sales charges and would be lower if sales charges were included.)               

The underperformance of the Portfolio reflects, in part, the                    
generally lagging returns of low price/earnings issues. The relative            
performance of these equities has been hindered by the indexing                 
phenomenon, which tends to favor large-capitalization growth                    
companies. We believe that the valuation disparities arising from               
this trend created opportunities in many "basic value" issues. Some             
of these opportunities have just begun to be realized as the                    
market's leadership has shown signs of broadening.                              

Examining the Portfolio's results for the period ended July 31,
1997, reveals the favorable influence of holdings in the technology             
and basic industry sectors, and the adverse impact of positions in              
the telecommunications, auto and media areas. Technology issues                 
benefited from solid earnings gains, and basic industry equities                
were boosted by improved fundamentals. Telecommunications companies             
continue to be plagued by ramifications of the Telecommunications               
Act of 1996, auto issues were hindered by cyclical concerns, and                
media companies were hampered by lackluster results. Leading                    
individual gainers for the Portfolio in the July period included                
Tandem Computers, Inc., the subject of a takeover; WHX Corp., which             
rebounded on news of a strike settlement; and Scitex Corp. Ltd.,                
whose fundamentals began to show marked improvement.                            

Reflecting the heightened market volatility, Portfolio activity was             
particularly heavy in the period ended July 31, 1997. We initiated              
five positions, eliminated 13, incremented 50% of current holdings              
and reduced 20%. Cash and cash equivalents increased to 15.8% of                
net assets at July 31, 1997, from 14.0% at April 30, 1997.                      

During the July period, we invested in out-of-favor issues in the               
insurance, multi-industry, refining and marketing, and technology               
sectors. TIG Holdings, Inc., a property and casualty insurer, was               
purchased on weakness related to disappointing earnings results and             
a feared reserve deficiency. We judged that the adversities were                
adequately reflected in the share's valuation, with TIG trading at a            
very reasonable 1.3 times book value per share and at 10 times 1998             
estimated earnings per share. TIG's near-term premium growth is                 
expected to be modest as the company transitions its business to                
specialty lines. Longer term, we believe the company is favorably               
positioned for generating attractive returns. Bolstering our                    
confidence in the shares is the heavy management ownership as well              
as the continued sizable share buybacks.                                        

Tenneco, Inc. underwent significant restructuring over the last                 
several years and is now favorably positioned in two product areas--            
auto parts and specialty packaging. We believe the shares offer                 
attractive appreciation potential driven by solid market positions,             
turnaround potential in the packaging business, an Economic Value               
Added-driven (EVA) management team and continued share buybacks.                
Tenneco was reasonably valued at 13.5 times 1998 estimated earnings             
per share and provided a dividend yield of 2.7%.                                

Sun Company, Inc., one of the largest independent refining and                  
marketing companies in the United States, was a lackluster performer            
for many years. We judged the company's fortunes were about to                  
change under the direction of a new president, the first corporate              
outsider chosen for this position in Sun's 113-year history. The new            
leader has announced restructuring initiatives, including refinery              
reconfigurations and cost reduction programs, that have already                 
yielded tangible operating results. The shares were available at a              
modest 10.5 times 1998 estimated earnings per share and provided an             
above-average dividend yield of 3.2%.                                           

Novell, Inc., a provider of network operating systems and services,             
was a stock market laggard for several years. The company's shares              
peaked in 1993 at $35.25 and declined to a low near $6.00 in June               
1997, reflecting the severe competitive pressures inflicted by                  
Microsoft Corp. as well as several very untimely acquisitions made              
by former management. We believe Novell offers an attractive                    
turnaround potential driven by new leadership, a refocused strategy,            
and exciting new products. The new chief executive officer is                   
transitioning the company from being a network operating system                 
vendor, where competition is intense, to being a diversified                    
provider of network services where there is no clear leader.                    
Novell's balance sheet is solid with cash and short-term investments            
of $3 per share and no long-term debt.                                          

Digital Equipment Corp. represents an attractive turnaround                     
candidate, in our view. The shares have dramatically underperformed             
the market for some time, languishing 56% below their early 1996                
high of $76.50 per share. The underperformance reflects lackluster              
operating results resulting from a weak personal computer business,             
losses in semiconductors, and a misaligned sales structure. These               
problems have been largely rectified, and we believe the company is             
poised for improved operating results. Indeed, management has laid              
out an intermediate-term net margin goal of 7%, implying an earnings            
potential of $6.00 per share in several years, a marked improvement             
from the depressed $0.68 per share reported in the fiscal year ended            
June 30, 1997. The shares were purchased at a modest 39% of sales               
per share and at a reasonable 13 times 1998 estimated earnings per              
share.                                                                          

Completed sales in the July period included three issues that were              
the subjects of takeovers/mergers: Total Petroleum Ltd.,                        
Transitional Hospitals Corp., and Greater New York Savings Bank. A              
partial sale, Tandem Computers, Inc., was also the subject of a                 
takeover. Other positions eliminated included two technology                    
holdings that had reached our price targets, National Semiconductor             
Corp. and 3Com Corp. Issues whose turnaround potentials had                     
diminished, and thus were eliminated, included Computervision Corp.,            
Evans Withycombe Residential, Inc. and National Auto Credit, Inc.               

Though the overall US stock market is trading at record valuation               
levels, we continue to find attractive candidates for inclusion in              
the Fundamental Value Portfolio. Our strict valuation discipline                
results in the Portfolio having a reasonable valuation. The average             
price/earnings ratio of the Portfolio's equity investments is two-              
thirds of the S&P 500's multiple, and the price/book ratio is less              
than one-half that of the market benchmark.                                     

Global Opportunity Portfolio                                                    
As of July 31, 1997, the asset allocation for Global Opportunity                
Portfolio was: foreign stocks, 51% of net assets; US stocks, 26%;               
foreign bonds, 10%; US bonds, 10%; and cash reserves of 3%.                     

During the three months ended July 31, 1997, the total returns of               
Global Opportunity Portfolio's Class A, Class B, Class C and Class D            
Shares were +15.04%, +14.68%, +14.69% and +14.98%, respectively.                
(Results shown do not reflect sales charges and would be lower if               
sales charges were included.)                                                   

During the period ended July 31, 1997, we became more positive                  
toward US bonds, and increased the weighting from 3% of net assets              
as of April 30, 1997 to 10% as of July 31, 1997. The duration of the            
US fixed-income sector was also increased from 5 years to 6 years.              
Our more optimistic stance toward US bonds reflected evidence of a              
slowdown in the US economy's growth rate and indications that                   
inflationary pressures were exceptionally subdued. At the same time,            
the rapid shrinkage of the Federal budget deficit reduced the supply            
of newly issued US Government securities relative to the demand.                
Overall, we expected a decline in intermediate- and long-term                   
interest rates to continue, resulting in a favorable reward/risk                
relationship for US bonds going forward.                                        

To expand the US bond commitment, we primarily used proceeds from               
sales of foreign bonds. We reduced foreign bond holdings from 15% to            
10% of net assets during the July period by eliminating positions in            
Australian, French and Finnish bonds and reducing the commitment to             
German obligations. At the same time, our belief that the total                 
return potential of UK obligations was attractive led us to                     
establish a position in sterling-denominated bonds. As a result,                
European bonds continue to account for the major portion of assets              
in the foreign bond sector. We maintained a position in Canada as a             
means of obtaining indirect exposure to US interest rates. Our                  
expectation of further US dollar strength resulted in our hedging               
the European bonds and stock positions (except for UK holdings), the            
Japanese equity holdings, and the position in Australian common                 
stock back to the US dollar.                                                    

Foreign equity allocation did not materially change during the July             
period. Japan remained the largest single commitment, although the              
weighting remains below the benchmark Morgan Stanley Europe                     
Australia Far East Index. While we sold the position in Eisai Co.,              
Ltd. in Japan, we established commitments in Matsushita Electric                
Works, Ltd. and Amway Japan, Ltd. We continue to maintain a                     
meaningful position in Canada and Latin America, with a new position            
established in Uniao de Bancos Brasileiros S.A. (Unibanco). In                  
Europe, changes included the sale of British Steel PLC and the                  
establishment of commitments in Gucci Group N.V., Orion-yhtyma OY,              
and Perstorp AB. We also reduced our already limited representation             
in Asia by accepting profits in Hong Kong Telecommunications Ltd.               

In the US equity sector, the largest concentration of assets                    
remained in the financial services category, which is a beneficiary             
of declining US interest rates. We also maintained meaningful                   
positions in healthcare, technology and energy. These areas of                  
emphasis are unchanged over the past three months, and reflect our              
expectation that earnings of selected companies in these sectors                
should continue to exceed consensus expectations despite a slower               
rate of US economic growth.                                                     

Growth Opportunity Portfolio                                                    
During the quarter ended July 31, 1997, the total returns of Growth             
Opportunity Portfolio's Class A, Class B, Class C and Class D Shares            
were +22.03%, +21.72%, +21.63% and +21.98%, respectively. The                   
Portfolio outperformed the Lipper Growth Funds Average total returns            
of +20.98%, and the +19.58% return of the unmanaged S&P 500.                    
(Results shown do not reflect sales charges and would be lower if               
sales charges were included.)                                                   

The most important contributors to the Portfolio's positive absolute            
and relative returns were the significant weightings in the                     
communications equipment industry (14.4% of July quarter-end net                
assets), computer software (8.7%), oil services (6.7%) and the                  
computer industry (5.9%). Individual companies contributing                     
significantly to the positive returns were Cisco Systems, Inc.,                 
Lucent Technologies, Inc., Schlumberger, Ltd., and COMPAQ Computers             
Corp., all of which were among the top ten equity holdings.                     

Investment activities during the July period focused on increasing              
the equity weightings in the communications equipment, computer                 
software and oil service industries. We reduced the pharmaceutical              
industry weighting because of our concerns about a near-term decline            
in valuation ratios as the rate of earnings growth moderates.                   

Corporate reports of capital spending intentions during the period              
ended July 31, 1997 reflected the possibility of a continued                    
increase in the rate of investment spending on network computer                 
systems, advanced digital wired and wireless communication                      
infrastructure and energy exploration activities. Although the                  
overall rate of growth in corporate earnings reported for the July              
period was at a slower pace than the year-to-year gains in the first            
quarter of 1997, the rate of growth appears sufficient to sustain               
the capital spending pace in the communications equipment,                      
computers, computer software and oil services industries.                       

The ten largest industry sectors in the Portfolio at July 31, 1997              
were communications equipment, computer software, pharmaceuticals,              
oil services, banking and financial, computers, financial services,             
electrical equipment, medical technology and cosmetics. These                   
industries represented 65.5% of net assets on July 31, 1997. The top            
ten equity holdings were equal to 37% of net assets.                            

We added four companies to the Portfolio during the period ended                
July 31, 1997. They included Citicorp, BankAmerica Corp., CVS                   
Corporation and American Express Company. Citicorp, the world's                 
leading multinational financial services and banking organization,              
was added because of the attractive valuation relative to                       
expectations of above-average growth in earnings and rates of return            
with relative consistency. Citicorp has a broad base of business in             
the emerging markets of Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe as               
well as the developed world. We added BankAmerica Corp. because of              
the attractive valuation relative to expectations of above-average              
growth rates in earnings from internal restructuring of operations.             
CVS Corporation, one of the major pharmaceutical retailers, was                 
added to the Portfolio because of the attractive valuation relative             
to the expectations of above-average rates of growth in earnings.               
American Express Company was added because of the attractive                    
valuation relative to expectations of above-average rates of growth             
in earnings from asset management as well as travel-related business            
services.                                                                       

We eliminated Wells Fargo & Co. from the Portfolio because we viewed            
the stock as overvalued relative to our perspective on the                      
fundamentals of the organization.                                               

We continued to be relatively fully invested during the July period,            
with cash and cash equivalents at July 31, 1997 equal to 6.1% of net            
assets. We continued to have a positive outlook for investment in               
the US equity markets.                                                          

Quality Bond Portfolio                                                          
At the beginning of the year, Federal Reserve Board (FRB) Chairman              
Alan Greenspan cautioned investors about a possible preemptive                  
strike against inflation. While there were few signs of accelerating            
inflation in the then-current data, he warned that monetary policy              
acts with a lag and that it would be easier to tighten policy at                
that time, as a precaution, rather than tighten later and more                  
sharply once inflation was evident. The FRB followed through with               
Chairman Greenspan's warning and tightened policy on March 25, 1997.            
Since the March tightening, economic data have been more benign,                
including bullish inflation reports from the employment cost index              
and producer price index. The yield on the long-term Treasury bond              
peaked at 7.17% in mid-April, then began to drop. This rally was                
fueled by a significant change in investor expectations regarding               
the economy and the outlook for interest rates.                                 

In early May there was widespread agreement that the FRB was ready              
for another tightening of monetary policy, and it was generally                 
assumed that a further tightening would be needed by July. However,             
the Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose only 1.4% for the first five                
months of 1997, compared with a 3.8% increase over the same period              
in 1996. At the same time, retail sales figures continued to                    
decline. As a result, the May increase in interest rates did not                
occur and the bond market continued to gain momentum. Increasing                
evidence of noninflationary economic growth boosted investor                    
confidence, which was confirmed further at the beginning of July                
when, as widely expected, the FRB chose to leave monetary policy                
unchanged. This confluence of positive indicators helped produce a              
significant rally in the US securities market.                                  

We participated in the bond rally by extending the average maturity             
of the Quality Bond Portfolio to 8.8 years. Investments favored the             
financial services sector which stands to benefit from the low                  
inflation environment. The average credit quality of the Portfolio's            
holdings is AA, as measured by Standard & Poor's Corp. ratings. Cash            
was invested in short-term instruments to take advantage of the                 
favorable spread.                                                               

US Government Securities                                                        
Portfolio                                                                       
On July 23, 1997, FRB Chairman Alan Greenspan delivered his Humphrey-           
Hawkins testimony which was the most positive assessment of the US              
economy he has ever delivered. The speech appears to have erased the            
prospect of any near-term rise in interest rates, and FRB policy                
will likely remain on hold for the foreseeable future. The                      
fundamentals and technicals continue to impress investors, pushing              
both the bond and equity markets to new heights. The Dow Jones                  
Industrial Average soared past 8000 this past quarter and the long-             
term US Treasury bond yield broke 6.5%.                                         

Since the last FRB interest rate increase in March, the economy,                
though still growing, has slowed, and inflation has been tame. In               
fact, the Producer Price Index (PPI), CPI, and the Employment Cost              
Index (ECI) have been subdued for so long, it appears that investors            
are no longer fearful of increases as they were in the past. Many               
economists theorized a "new reality" economic environment, one in               
which economic growth can be achieved without increased inflation.              
The FRB was tolerant of sustained economic growth because it was                
accompanied by low inflation. The PPI released in July marked its               
sixth consecutive monthly decline and the CPI released in July rose             
a modest 0.1%, keeping inflation at a 31-year low. This put the                 
inflation rate for the first six months of 1997 at the lowest level             
in 11 years. The ECI is something that the FRB watches closely, and             
it continues to run at under 3%. In order for the FRB to warrant a              
tightening of monetary policy, we believe they will need to see some            
mixture of above-potential economic growth and evidence of                      
inflation.                                                                      

As of July 31, 1997, the 10-year Treasury note yield, a benchmark               
for mortgage-backed securities (MBS), stood at 6.01%. This yield is             
49 basis points lower for the one-month period, 71 basis points                 
lower for the three-month period and 48 basis points lower for the              
six-month period. As typically happens in months where interest                 
rates drop dramatically in a very short period of time, MBS yields              
spreads widened versus their Treasury counterparts in July. When                
interest rates decrease, refinancing opportunities increase and MBS             
prices tend to compress as prepayment fears get priced into their               
yields.                                                                         

The US Government Securities Portfolio was somewhat immune to the               
widening spreads as we avoided those MBS which are the most                     
susceptible to prepaying and suffered the most widening. Of the                 
Portfolio's 73% MBS allocation, 61% is invested in low coupon MBS               
whose homeowners have no incentive to refinance. The remaining 12%              
of MBS is invested in super-premium MBS whose homeowners have                   
already gone through several refinancing opportunities. The                     
Portfolio also has 24% of net assets invested in US Treasury notes              
and STRIPS and a 10.6% cash position.                                           

During the July period, we extended the duration of the US Treasury             
notes allocation in the Portfolio. This benefited performance as                
long-term Treasury securities had the strongest performance as                  
yields came down and the US Treasury curve flattened. We also                   
lowered the average coupon of the MBS allocation in the Portfolio,              
and kept duration neutral in this sector with the purchase of 7-year            
balloon MBS and additional 15-year MBS. Although MBS underperformed             
their Treasury counterparts in July, they still offer a very                    
attractive yield advantage. This factor, coupled with low long-term             
implied volatility, should keep MBS a very attractive fixed-income              
investment.                                                                     

In Conclusion

None of the past results shown should be considered a representation            
of future performance. Figures shown in the "Average Annual Total
Return" tables assume reinvestment of all dividends and capital                 
gains distributions at net asset value on the ex-dividend or payable            
date. Investment return and principal value of shares will fluctuate            
so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their             
original cost. Dividends paid to each class of shares will vary                 
because of the different levels of account maintenance, distribution            
and transfer agency fees applicable to each class, which are                    
deducted from the income available to be paid to shareholders.

1. Significant Accounting Policies:                                             
Merrill Lynch Asset Builder Program, Inc. (the "Program") is                    
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 as a                        
diversified, open-end management investment company consisting of               
five separate portfolios: Fundamental Value Portfolio, Global                   
Opportunity Portfolio, Growth Opportunity Portfolio, Quality Bond               
Portfolio and US Government Securities Portfolio (the "Portfolios"),            
except for Growth Opportunity Portfolio which is classified as a non-           
diversified portfolio. These unaudited financial statements reflect             
all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary              
to a fair statement of results for the interim period presented. All            
such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. The Program's                
Portfolios offer four classes of shares under the Merrill Lynch                 
Select Pricing SM System. Shares of Class A and Class D are sold                
with a front-end sales charge. Shares of Class B and Class C may be             
subject to a contingent deferred sales charge. All classes of shares            
have identical voting, dividend, liquidation and other rights and               
the same terms and conditions, except that Class B, Class C and                 
Class D Shares bear certain expenses related to the account                     
maintenance of such shares, and Class B and Class C Shares also bear            
certain expenses related to the distribution of such shares. Each               
class has exclusive voting rights with respect to matters relating              
to its account maintenance and distribution expenditures. The                   
following is a summary of significant accounting policies followed              
by the Program.                                                                 

(a) Valuation of investments--Portfolio securities which are traded             
on stock exchanges are valued at the last sale price on the exchange            
on which such securities are traded, as of the close of business on             
the day the securities are being valued or, lacking any sales, at               
the last available bid price. Securities traded in the over-the-                
counter market are valued at the last available bid price in the                
over-the-counter market prior to the time of valuation. In cases                
where securities are traded on more than one exchange, the                      
securities are valued on the exchange designated by or under the                
authority of the Board of Directors as the primary market.                      
Securities which are traded both in the over-the-counter market and             
on a stock exchange are valued according to the broadest and most               
representative market. Options written are valued at the last sale              
price in the case of exchange-traded options or, in the case of                 
options traded in the over-the-counter market, the last asked price.            
Options purchased are valued at their last sale price in the case of            
exchange-traded options or, in the case of options traded in the                
over-the-counter market, the last bid price. Short-term securities              
are valued at amortized cost, which approximates market value. Other            
investments, including futures contracts and related options, are               
stated at market value. Securities and assets for which market                  
quotations are not readily available are valued at fair market value            
as determined in good faith by or under the direction of the Board              
of Directors of the Program.                                                    

(b) Derivative financial instruments--Each Portfolio may engage in              
various portfolio strategies to seek to increase its return by                  
hedging its portfolio against adverse movements in the equity, debt             
or currency markets. Losses may arise due to changes in the value of            
the contract or if the counterparty does not perform under the                  
contract.                                                                       

* Financial futures contracts--The Portfolios may purchase or sell              
futures contracts and options on such futures contracts for the                 
purpose of hedging the market risk on existing securities or the                
intended purchase of securities. Futures contracts are contracts for            
delayed delivery of securities at a specific future date and at a               
specific price or yield. Upon entering into a contract, the                     
Portfolios deposit and maintain as collateral such initial margin as            
required by the exchange on which the transaction is effected.                  
Pursuant to the contract, the Portfolios agree to receive from or               
pay to the broker an amount of cash equal to the daily fluctuation              
in value of the contract. Such receipts or payments are known as                
variation margin and are recorded by the Portfolios as unrealized               
gains or losses. When the contract is closed, the Portfolios record             
a realized gain or loss equal to the difference between the value of            
the contract at the time it was opened and the value at the time it             
was closed.                                                                     

* Options--The Portfolios are authorized to purchase and write call             
and put options. When the Portfolios write an option, an amount                 
equal to the premium received by the Portfolios is reflected as an              
asset and an equivalent liability. The amount of the liability is               
subsequently marked to market to reflect the current market value of            
the option written. When a security is purchased or sold through an             
exercise of an option, the related premium paid (or received) is                
added to (or deducted from) the basis of the security acquired or               
deducted from (or added to) the proceeds of the security sold. When             
an option expires (or the Portfolios enter into a closing                       
transaction), the Portfolios realize a gain or loss on the option to            
the extent of the premiums received or paid (or gain or loss to the             
extent the cost of the closing transaction exceeds the premium paid             
or received).                                                                   

Written and purchased options are non-income producing investments.             

* Forward foreign exchange contracts--Fundamental Value, Global                 
Opportunity and Growth Opportunity Portfolios are authorized to                 
enter into forward foreign exchange contracts as a hedge against                
either specific transactions or portfolio positions. Such contracts             
are not entered on the Portfolios' records. However, the effect on              
operations is recorded from the date the Portfolios enter into such             
contracts. Premium or discount is amortized over the life of the                
contracts.                                                                      

* Foreign currency options and futures--Fundamental Value, Global               
Opportunity and Growth Opportunity Portfolios may also purchase or              
sell listed or over-the-counter foreign currency options, foreign               
currency futures and related options on foreign currency futures as             
a short or long hedge against possible variations in foreign                    
exchange rates. Such transactions may be effected with respect to               
hedges on non-US dollar denominated securities owned by the                     
Portfolios, sold by the Portfolios but not yet delivered, or                    
committed or anticipated to be purchased by the Portfolios.                     

(c) Foreign currency transactions--Transactions denominated in                  
foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing when            
recognized. Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies            
are valued at the exchange rate at the end of the period. Foreign               
currency transactions are the result of settling (realized) or                  
valuing (unrealized) assets or liabilities expressed in foreign                 
currencies into US dollars. Realized and unrealized gains or losses             
from investments include the effects of foreign exchange rates on               
investments.                                                                    

(d) Income taxes--It is each Portfolio's policy to comply with the              
requirements of the Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated               
investment companies and to distribute substantially all of its                 
taxable income to its shareholders. Therefore, no Federal income tax            
provision is required. Under the applicable foreign tax law, a                  
withholding tax may be imposed on interest, dividends and capital               
gains at various rates.                                                         

(e) Security transactions and investment income--Security                       
transactions are recorded on the dates the transactions are entered             
into (the trade dates). Dividend income is recorded on the ex-                  
dividend dates. Dividends from foreign securities where the ex-                 
dividend date may have passed are subsequently recorded when the                
Portfolios have determined the ex-dividend date. Interest income (in-           
cluding amortization of discount) is recognized on the accrual                  
basis. Realized gains and losses on security transactions are                   
determined on the identified cost basis.                                        

(f) Deferred organization expenses and prepaid registration fees--              
Deferred organization expenses are charged to expense on a straight-            
line basis over a five-year period. Prepaid registration fees are               
charged to expense as the related shares are issued.                            

(g) Dividends and distributions--Dividends from net investment                  
income of Quality Bond and US Government Securities Portfolios are              
declared daily and paid monthly. Dividends from net investment                  
income of Fundamental Value, Global Opportunity and Growth                      
Opportunity Portfolios are recorded on the ex-dividend dates.                   
Distributions of capital gains for all Portfolios are recorded on               
the ex-dividend dates. Distributions in excess of investment income             
and realized gains are due primarily to differing tax treatments for            
futures transactions and post-October losses.                                   

2. Investment Advisory Agreement and Transactions                               
with Affiliates:                                                                
The Program has entered into an Investment Advisory Agreement with              
Merrill Lynch Asset Management, L.P. ("MLAM"). The general partner              
of MLAM is Princeton Services, Inc. ("PSI"), an indirect wholly-
