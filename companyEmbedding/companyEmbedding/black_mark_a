Black Mark was founded in 1991 by Börje Forsberg, a well known producer of different styles of music with over thirty years in the business. Early on, the ambition was to gather good quality metal of all sorts and in the process, Black Mark became the very label for young Scandinavian and European metal bands. Originally based in European metropolis Berlin, later on with offices in Stockholm, Toronto and New York etc.
Black Mark today, is a world wide operating business, placed in Villa Hammerheart, Bruzaholm, Sweden.
Swiftly expanding beyond Scandinavia and Europe, on to the U.S. and Canadian territories, and the rest of the world, Black Mark became synonymous with fresh, talented and innovative young metal bands. Some of these young acts were so critically acclaimed, they began to head a field of their own.
Today, bands like Edge of Sanity, Cemetary Lake of Tears, Morgana Lefay, Necrophobic, Nightigale, Bathory, Oz, Memento Mori and Fleshcrawl are regarded as leading acts.
Veterans of Black Metal and founders of Death Metal, legendary act Bathory, was tied to Black Mark right from the start. All previous Bathory albums being released for the very first time in the CD format by Black Mark. Since the start, all releases from this legendary act has been a Black Mark release, including their three 10th and 15th anniversary Jubileum volumes.
Throughout the years, Black Mark has always been able to deliver exciting new metal of all sorts, making damn sure not to lock onto one single sound or style, Black Mark has always been able to reach metal fans of all brands and all over the world. May it be in Europe, in the  U.S.A., Canada or in the far Eastern territories like Japan and South  Korea. Either on tour or during the many successful Black Mark-festivals all over Europe, visited by MTV on all occasions, the bands on the  Black Mark label has been able to take their music beyond their wildest dreams.
Several leading figures in the many Black Mark bands, has been given free hands to develop their own personal style and to explore their artistic domains in the form of solo albums. Both highly acclaimed Dan Swanö, of Edge of Sanity fame, and Quorthon, the mastermind of Bathory, have produced their own innovative solo albums. Only further proof of Black Mark’s intention and ambition to keep metal fresh and interesting.
But the stream of fresh and young blood doesn’t end there. The start of the much appreciated Out Of The Box – series, a number of compilation albums, insofar three having seen the light of day, each allowing 12 debuting bands a shot at the market, guarantees the continent flow of innovative new metal of all sounds and styles. Many of the debuting  bands such as Apostasy, Lothlorien,  and Southfork have released full length CD’s of their own on the Black Mark label.
Bathory released 2001 the long awaited new studio album “Destroyer Of Worlds”, same year once again Lake Of Tears kicked the world with the new album “THE NEONAI”, the great session Nordland I and Nordland II was beside the digipack formated CD even released on Vinyl 2003 and 2004, before the first complete Bathory vinyl issue ever came to release.
An overwhelming success which lead to many vinyl re-issues in the years 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006 and still 2007 Black Mark does feel through the Bathory fans it wasn´t vinyl enough when now releasing the Bathory discography as picture discs.
More stations: -The release of the BOX ”IN MEMORY OF QUORTHON” to mind the passing of the mastermind Quorthon in June 2004.
In 2011 the BOX ”IN MEMORY OF QUORTHON” will be relased as a Vinyl Box and Edge Of Sanity’s albums as colored Vinyl.
– Black Mark was going for downloads in 2008.

What is the 'Black Market'
Economic activity that takes place outside government-sanctioned channels. Black market transactions usually occur “under the table” to let participants avoid government price controls or taxes. The black market is also the venue where highly controlled substances or products such as drugs and firearms are illegally traded. Black markets can take a toll on an economy, since they are shadow markets where economic activity is not recorded and taxes are not paid. In the financial context, the biggest black market exists for currencies in nations with strict currency controls. While most consumers may shun the black market because they consider it sleazy, there may be rare occasions when they have no choice but to turn to this necessary evil.

BREAKING DOWN 'Black Market'
The black market's many drawbacks include the risk of fraud, the possibility of violence, being saddled with counterfeit goods or adulterated products (which is especially dangerous in the case of medications), and the fact that the buyer has no recourse.
As for currency black markets, they exist primarily in nations that – apart from currency controls – have weak economic fundamentals (such as a high inflation rate and low currency reserves) and a fixed exchange rate where the domestic currency is pegged at an unrealistically high level to the US dollar or other currency. As a result, the currency black market is flourishing in nations like Argentina, Iran, and Venezuela.
Participating in the black market is not always a black and white matter. Suppose you are on vacation with your family in an exotic location and run out of formula for your baby? If there is nothing available in local stores and the only way to acquire baby formula is through a black market transaction, few people would hesitate to make the purchase.
What about paying three times the face value of a ticket to a scalper to see your favorite band or football team? This is also a black market transaction that most people may find justifiable. Further, in a number of developing nations, life-saving medicines are in short supply and often, the only alternative is to procure them through the black market. While critics may carp that this only serves to perpetuate the illegal and unethical practice of profiteering from someone else’s misfortune, participating in the black market is a relatively easy decision to make when someone’s life is at stake.

Description


Additional information





Description
The Edit1 is 100% American and the only true descendant of the original Black Market Mob. Designed and handbuilt in Orange County, Ca. with our Black Lite heat treated chromoly tubeset featuring True Temper tubing, laser cut signature Edit”1″ bridges and drop-outs, laser cut tube HT & DT gussets and integrated seat collar. All built around Black Market’s proven geometry.
After 2 years of producing the Edit1 and actually talking to every future Edit1 owner, we’ve taking it further. Instead of taking frame sizes and design elements away from you, we’re offering you more!  We’re adding more sizes to the Edit1 frame line with the choice of HT (Headtube) & BB styles so you can choose the Size, Form and Function of your Edit1. Your Edit1 will be built with the proper tubing for your size and weight and powder coated in the color you choose.
At just over 5lbs. it’s the baddest and lightest BlkMrkt to date. Ride one and you’ll know why Black Market’s signature design, style and geometry are always imitated but the Ride is never duplicated.
Edit1 of your own today…

What Happens When a Product Is Made Illegal?




When a product is made illegal by the government, often times a black market will emerge for said product. But how does supply and demand change when goods shift from a legal to a black market?
A simple supply and demand graph can prove helpful in visualizing this scenario. Let's see how the black market affects a typical supply and demand graph, and what that means for consumers.

Typical Supply and Demand Graph
















        	Black Market Supply and Demand Illustration - 1.
        
    

To understand what changes happen when a good is made illegal, it is important to first illustrate what the supply and demand for the good looked like in the pre-black market days.
To do so, arbitrarily draw a downward sloping demand curve (shown in blue) and an upward sloping supply curve (shown in red), as illustrated in this graph. Note that price is on the X-axis and quantity is on the Y-axis.
The point of intersection between the 2 curves is the natural market price when a good is legal.

The Effects of a Black Market




When the government makes the product illegal, a black market is subsequently created. When a government makes a product illegal, such as marijuana, 2 things tend to happen.
First, there is a sharp drop in supply as the penalties for selling the good cause people to shift into other industries.
Second, a drop in demand is observed as a prohibition of possessing the good deters some consumers from wanting to buy it.

Black Market Supply and Demand Graph
















        	Black Market Supply and Demand Illustration - 2.
        
    

A drop in supply means the upward sloping supply curve will shift to the left. Similarly, a drop in demand means the downward sloping demand curve will shift to the left.
Typically the supply side effects dominate the demand side ones when the government creates a black market. Meaning, the shift in the supply curve is larger than the shift in the demand curve. This is shown with the new dark blue demand curve and the new dark red supply curve in this graph.
Now look at the new point at which the new supply and demand curves intersect. The shift in supply and demand causes the quantity consumed of the black market good to decrease, while the price rises. If the demand side effects dominate, there will be a drop in quantity consumed, but there will also see a corresponding drop in price. However, this does not typically happen in a black market. Instead, there is normally a rise in price.
The amount of the price change and the change in quantity consumed will depend on the magnitude of the shifts of the curve, as well as the price elasticity of demand and the price elasticity of supply.
