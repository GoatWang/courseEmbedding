About Us and our Retirement Plan Consultants | ForUsAll



































ABOUT US AND OUR RETIREMENT PLAN CONSULTANTS
Our team of experienced retirement plan consultants and technologists are making retirement saving safer and easier.


          We have a very simple goal here at ForUsAll – to fix retirement in America, so that everyone has a fair shot at a brighter financial future. Our consultants, investment advisor representatives, operations team, and technologists can advise you on how to offer a next-gen 401(k) that has built-in administrative and investment fiduciary protection, that works with your existing HR software, and tracks employee eligibility. ForUsAll’s smart plan design, employee onboarding, and communication strategies improve employee engagement and promote your employees’ financial wellness. Because our consultants leverage technology and low-cost funds, all this is usually possible for less than what you are currently paying.
        



Meet the retirement plan consultants, investment advisor representatives, software engineers, and 401(k) operations professionals who are leading the effort:













Shin Inoue
Founder, CEO



Shin believes that every American deserves a fair shot at retirement success, and as a founder and CEO of ForUsAll is committed to delivering on that promise by modernizing and simplifying the way people plan for retirement. Prior to ForUsAll, Shin was Director of New Business at Financial Engines, a pioneer in democratizing access to high quality, personalized investment advice that today manages more than $100 billion. He led the design & development of Financial Engines’s two flagship products, which helped people effectively plan for and strategically spend in retirement.  Shin holds an M.A. in Operations Research and a B.S. in Mathematical and Computational Science, both from Stanford University. In his free time Shin enjoys watching the West Wing and Friday Night Lights reruns with his wife Gaby. Shin plans to drive an awesome food truck around the country when he retires.

David Ramirez
Founder, Investment Management



David is on a mission to help every small business owner offer a 401(k) that rivals the largest Fortune 500 retirement plans. To say David is frugal is, well, an understatement. So as a founder and Chief Investment Officer, David spends his time doggedly using the combined purchasing power of our clients to get ever better services at ever lower costs. And David has a pretty good idea of how awesome and inexpensive 401(k)’s can be. Prior to founding ForUsAll, David helped manage over $55 billion in assets for employees at large Fortune 100 companies. David holds a CFA charter and a B.S. in Political Economics of Industrial Societies from the University of California, Berkeley. When not working, David swims, writes bad haiku and moonlights as a ceramicist. David has no plans on retiring - but will likely make a career shift later in life to dedicate himself fully to creating the perfect teapot.

Dave Boudreau
Founder, Customer Experience



Dave co-founded ForUsAll to remove the barriers that stand between everyday Americans and their pursuit of retirement success. He leads customer experience, content strategy and creation, and is the principal architect behind ForUsAll’s virtual advisor, DAVE (uhm… no relation). Before all this, Dave was Customer Experience Principal at Financial Engines, where he co-founded and led the end-to-end experience design for the ground-breaking retirement income solution, Income+. Dave holds a B.S. in Communication Design from Fitchburg State University. In his spare time, he reads, writes, consumes streaming content like a crazy man, and is an experimental pastry chef specializing in “things you only want to eat once” (his words). He and his wife, Hanka, plan to retire to twin art studios somewhere in the Trinity Alps of Northern California.

Cindy Bloch
Founder, Client Services



Cindy is a strong believer in evening-out the playing field by giving small companies 401(k)s  that rival those available to Fortune 500 companies. As a founder and client service lead for ForUsAll, Cindy is dedicated to providing great customer service to our clients. Prior to ForUsAll, Cindy was CFO at David W. Tice & Associates, an advisory firm that enabled small investors to utilize market hedging techniques generally only available to wealthy investors. Cindy holds an A.B. in Economics from Dartmouth College. In her spare time, Cindy enjoys cooking for her friends and family.  When she retires, Cindy hopes to have some grandchildren to spoil.

Jeff Schulte
Product and Client Services



Jeff believes that well-designed services can help investors make better decisions and as head of Product Management and Client Services, he’s focused on creating the best customer experience possible for employers and employees. Prior to joining ForUsAll, Jeff was the Vice President of Product Management at Financial Engines, where he helped grow the 401(k) managed account business from $4B in AUM to $100B. Jeff has his Bachelor’s from Brown University and has an MBA from Columbia business school. When Jeff is not working, he enjoys hiking in the Oakland hills with his family. When Jeff retires, he plans to go back to school to study physics, psychology and history - just a few of the things he failed to learn the first time around.

Melissa Wang
Operations



Melissa is passionate about helping others and strongly believes in the notion of “paying it forward” to your future self. She thrives at ForUsAll, where she makes 401(k) setup and maintenance easier for small business employers while helping their employees look forward to retirement through a simpler participation process. Prior to joining ForUsAll, Melissa spent most of her career focused on marketing, communications, and event planning. Having started out in the solar energy industry, she is still actively involved with Bay Area non-profit Everybody Solar. Melissa holds a B.A. in Psychology from the University of Michigan, where she was also a first violinist in the Campus Symphony Orchestra. When she’s not working, Melissa dedicates her time to perfecting recipes and pastry techniques, exploring the Bay Area, and supporting her cat Kiara’s rising Instagram fame. She plans to enjoy her retirement by traveling and eating her way around the world.

Holly Brotherton
Operations



Holly is a big promoter of ForUsAll's mission of providing the traditionally underserved with the best possible chance at saving for retirement. She grew up in London and lived in Sydney for several years before making the move to the States. Holly studied Pharmacology and Molecular Genetics at King's College London before making the not-so-obvious leap into finance, and has spent her last few years prior to ForUsAll developing analytical tools and processes to estimate financial risk in the reinsurance industry. Holly is a keen triathlete and can be found swimming, running and cycling when not working. Holly would like to retire next to a beach, passing the time training for Ironman triathlon races.

Hazel envisions a world where all clients receive the best experience imaginable, and that’s her mission as a Financial Advisor at ForUsAll. Before tackling client advisory at ForUsAll, she worked on improving customer experience at AT&T. Hazel has her B.A. in economics from Cornell University. In her spare time, Hazel hangs out with her dog and best friend, Bruno, and travels. She has gone scuba diving in the Great Barrier Reef, hang gliding in Rio de Janeiro, and dune bashing in Dubai. When she retires, Hazel plans on becoming a travel writer, talk show host, or podcaster.

Brian Mahendra Lane
Retirement Plan Associate



Brian has worked exclusively in startups, (usually without retirement plans) and has observed members of his generation stacking their income in checking accounts without any thoughts of the future. So, Brian’s mission is to reach out to the countless companies barred from offering a retirement plan due to company size, cost, or complexity of entry. He firmly believes that everyone deserves a transparent, affordable solution for saving for their future. Brian’s first love is architecture, but that did not stop him from earning his B.S. in Environmental Economics and Policy at the University of California, Berkeley. In his spare time, Brian is an aspiring triathlete with a preference for swimming, camping, and star wars. When Brian retires, he plans to move to Norway, live in a snowy cabin, and design modern homes.

Amir Ouki
Retirement Plan Consultant



Amir made the move from the East Coast to the West Coast to join ForUsAll in its mission of giving the everyday working American a fair shot at retirement. Amir is from London and has lived in New York and Buenos Aires, before moving to the Golden State. Prior to ForUsAll, Amir led business development and growth strategy at one of New York's fastest growing financial services startups (as ranked by Inc.500!). Amir studied Economics at University College London and is fluent in French. In his spare time, he enjoys talking to his long-suffering friends about his dog, and backpacking or scuba-diving in as many foreign countries as he can. When Amir retires, he would like to own his own gastro-pub in North London.

Healy Jones
Marketing



Healy joined ForUsAll because he believes that all Americans deserve a fulfilling retirement. As the head of marketing, he’s focused on spreading the word that small businesses can offer their employees a great 401k plan. Prior to ForUsAll, he ran the acquisition marketing team at Sunrun, the nation’s largest dedicated residential solar provider, where he lead the direct to consumer team to hundreds of percent year over year growth. He began his career in financial services, working for JP Morgan, Summit Partners, and Atlas Venture. Healy has an A.B. from Dartmouth College and an M.B.A. from Wharton. When he’s not working, Healy and his wife enjoy taking their daughter rock climbing and filling their wine fridge. When he finally retires, he hopes to start emptying the wine fridge.
