Ophthotech is developing novel therapeutics to treat diseases of the eye, with a particular focus on diseases of the back of the eye. 



Fovista® Anti-PDGF Therapy
Fovista® is designed to target platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) in combination with anti-VEGF drugs to disrupt the formation of abnormal new blood vessels in wet AMD. In clinical trials, the combination of Fovista® 1.5mg and an anti-VEGF therapy demonstrated statistically significant superiority compared to anti-VEGF monotherapy in terms of improvements in visual acuity, providing a 62% comparative benefit from baseline.
Fovista® binds to and inhibits PDGF expression, causing the loss or stripping of pericytes, leaving the endothelial cells unprotected and highly vulnerable to the effects of anti-VEGF therapy. Clinical data have shown that administration of Fovista® 1.5mg in combination with anti-VEGF drugs is likely to inhibit new blood vessel growth in patients with wet AMD more effectively than anti-VEGF monotherapy and may also enhance neovascular regression.
Fovista® Clinical Development   Fovista® fact sheet
Zimura® – Anti-Complement
Zimura® targets complement factor C5, a central component of the complement cascade that is believed to be involved in the development of AMD. In a Phase 2a clinical trial of Zimura®, wet AMD patients who had not previously been treated with anti-VEGF therapy and who received six injections of Zimura® in combination with anti-VEGF treatment showed improvements in vision of a magnitude warranting further evaluation in subsequent studies.
Based on results of this trial, data from a third-party clinical trial and multiple published studies suggesting that the complement pathway plays a significant role in dry AMD, we plan to initiate a Phase 2/3 clinical trial investigating Zimura® for treatment of geographic atrophy, a severe form of dry AMD affecting approximately 8 million patients worldwide.
Zimura® Clinical Development
Aptamer Technology
Both Fovista® and Zimura® are aptamers, single strands of nucleic acid that bind with high specificity and affinity to targets such as PDGF, similar to a monoclonal antibody. Aptamers are synthetically derived, making their production predictable and reproducible. They are also chemically stable and do not generate an immune response that could limit efficacy.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Unfortunately, increasingly busy lifestyles make this a bit difficult at times, so it s important to create a nutritional safety net for yourself by consuming diet and nutritional supplements that can boost your health. The wide variety of diet and nutritional supplements can make it difficult to know what s right for you, so learning the basics of choosing nutritional supplements is the first step to getting the best supplements for your needs   along with talking to your doctor about what you might need to take. With the wide selection of diet and nutritional supplements available at Every Day Low Prices at Walmart, you can easily find all the vitamins and minerals that make it easier to lead a healthy lifestyle. Why should you use supplements? Nothing can replace a diet rich in minerals and vitamins, but when life gets busy and your stress levels rise, you may struggle to find the time to source and prepare nutritious dishes every day. By choosing nutrition supplements, you and your entire family can get the nutrition you need every day, no matter what life throws at you. Alternatively, if you're overweight and would like to lose weight, you may find it helpful to use dieting supplements such as appetite suppressants or fat inhibitors that can control your appetite and help you deal with the constant feeling of hunger. Vitamins and minerals Besides supporting general health, vitamins and mineral supplements may help head off chronic conditions, so it's important to make sure that your risk of dietary deficiencies is low by taking supplements. Before making your choice, ensure that you know what to look for in a multivitamin supplement.  Start by reading the label to identify the nutrients included as well as the amounts per serving.  If you're looking for a daily supplement that's suitable for most individuals, get a combination of basic vitamins and minerals. Some of the essential ingredients in such supplements include vitamins C, B1, B2, B3, B6, A, folic acid, Vitamin E, iodine, zinc, magnesium, calcium and iron. Multiple types of multivitamins are targeted at helping individuals with specific conditions or nutritional needs. Women, for example, could take a supplement with folic acid when they're pregnant to help avoid some congenital disabilities. Middle-aged women can take calcium and vitamin D supplements to lower the risk of osteoporosis. Check the percentages to determine whether a certain supplement offers you 100 percent of the Daily Value (DV) for the vitamins and minerals included. You shouldn t take multivitamins that exceed the 100 percent recommended dose. Proteins and meal replacements Protein powders, protein bars and meal replacement supplements are a popular choice for those who engage in sports regularly. The human body needs large amounts of protein as part of a balanced diet, but just like in the case of vitamins and minerals, it may be difficult to get all the amount you need from food. protein shakes are available in multiple types, with the most common of them being protein concentrate, isolate and hydrolysate. Meal replacement shakes are often made with skim milk, and they're high in protein and fiber while being low in fat. They offer a high-energy meal, but they only have around 200 to 300 calories per serving. Protein bars are ideal for those moments you want a nutritious snack on the go. Diet supplements If losing weight is your goal, diet supplements can help you by curbing cravings and suppressing your appetite. Remember that these supplements aren't magic pills for losing weight and that they work well in combination with a nutritious, low-calorie diet and regular exercise. Chromium diet supplements are available in tablet form and they do a good job at reducing excess body fat while helping your body maintain normal sugar levels. Control your diet with an everyday weight loss kit that come complete with everything you need to embrace healthy eating, offering you a variety of breakfast options and snacks. Slimming powders combine appetite suppressants with protein and other nutrients to boost your metabolism. Diet-specific supplements are available at Walmart, so you can find options that are tailored to the specific phases of various diets.Show moreElectrode, Comp-166904561, DC-prod-dal1, ENV-prod-a, PROF-PROD, VER-1.16.0, SHA-a61be39c429b9ad89de35da485c799e426355f1c, CID-
