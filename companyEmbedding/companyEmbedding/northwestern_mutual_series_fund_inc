NORTHWESTERN MUTUAL SERIES FUND INC - DEF 14A - 20070104 - PROPOSAL_4







	PROPOSAL 4:




	     


	APPROVAL OF AN AMENDMENT TO A

	COMPONENT OF THE INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE OF





	THE BALANCED PORTFOLIO

	(Balanced Portfolio)







	Which Portfolios Shareholders will vote on this proposal?






	Proposal 4 applies to Shareholders of the Balanced Portfolio as of the Record Date.






	What are Shareholders being asked to approve?






	Shareholders of the Balanced Portfolio are being asked to approve a change to a component of the Portfolios fundamental investment objective. The Balanced Portfolios current investment objective has two components: primary and supplemental. The primary component is to realize as high a level of total return as is consistent with prudent investment risk (the Primary Objective). The Primary Objective remains unchanged. The second component supplements the Primary Objective by utilizing the investment objectives and policies for the Index 500 Portfolio, Select Bond Portfolio and Money Market Portfolio (the Supplemental Objective). Shareholders are being asked to approve the removal of the Supplemental Objective as an investment objective of the Balanced Portfolio.






	What are the reasons for the proposed change?






	The Balanced Portfolio invests in the stock, bond and money market sectors in the manner as described for the Index 500 Portfolio, the Select Bond Portfolio and the Money Market Portfolio, respectively. The Index 500 Portfolios investment objective is to seek investment results that approximate the performance of the Standard & Poors 500® Composite Stock Price Index (the S&P 500® Index). The S&P 500® Index is an unmanaged index of 500 selected common stocks, and is comprised primarily of large capitalization companies that represent a broad spectrum of the U.S. economy and a substantial part of the U.S. stock markets total capitalization. Using a computer program, the Index 500 Portfolio (and therefore the equity portion of the Balanced Portfolio) invests in stocks included in the S&P 500® Index in proportion to their weighting in the S&P 500® Index in order to track the performance of the S&P 500® Index. The
	Supplemental Objective, therefore, limits diversification of the equity component of the Balanced Portfolio to investments in those large capitalization companies that comprise the S&P 500® Index.




	MSA believes, and the Board of Directors concurs, that in order to provide MSA with more flexibility to achieve the Balanced Portfolios Primary Objective, the Portfolio should have the ability to further diversify its holdings by investing in companies with small and mid-sized market capitalizations and foreign companies,




	26






	in addition to large capitalization companies such as those that comprise the S&P 500® Index, when and to the extent MSA, as investment advisor for the Portfolio, deems appropriate. MSA believes that by broadening the investment mandate among a greater number of asset classes, MSA can reduce the Portfolios volatility and overall risk and potentially improve returns. If the Proposal is approved, therefore, the Balanced Portfolio would no longer be required to invest the equity component of its assets only in securities of large capitalization companies that comprise the S&P 500® Index, and would have the flexibility to invest in securities of small, mid and/or large capitalization companies and foreign companies. The investment strategy of the Balanced Fund would also be modified to reflect this increased flexibility.




	With respect to the components of the Supplemental Objective that reference the objective of the Select Bond Portfolio and Money Market Portfolio, MSA has recommended, and the Board of Directors has concurred, that these references are not necessary and their removal would avoid confusion as to the objective of the Balanced Portfolio.




	The Primary Objective of the Balanced Portfolio and the primary investment objective of the Select Bond Portfolio are identical (i.e., to realize as high a level of total return as is consistent with prudent investment risk). MSA, as investment advisor to the Balanced Portfolio, in seeking to achieve the Balanced Portfolios Primary Objective, would continue to invest its fixed income component subject to the same investment policies currently applicable to the Select Bond and Money Market Portfolios. The Select Bond Portfolio normally invests at least 80% of its net assets in a diversified portfolio of investment grade debt securities, and may invest up to 20% of net assets in non-investment grade, high yield/high risk bonds (also known as junk bonds). It may also invest up to 30% of its net assets in foreign bonds. These investment policies will continue to apply for the fixed income component of the Balanced Portfolio. While historically the Balanced Portfolio has not purchased assets
	in the high yield/high risk bonds (even though it had the authority to do so), MSA anticipates that it will begin to purchase high yield/high risk bonds for the Balanced Portfolio as is consistent with the Balanced Portfolios Primary Objective, and being subject to the existing limit on investments in these types of Securities. MSA believes that by diversifying the Balanced Portfolio among investment grade and non-investment grade bonds, along with investing in multiple equity classes, it may better achieve its Primary Objective by potentially (i) reducing the Portfolios volatility and (ii) improving returns.




	The investment objective of the Money Market Portfolio is to realize maximum current income to the extent consistent with liquidity and stability of capital. It invests only in high-quality, short term money market instruments that present minimal credit risks, as determined by MSA. MSA intends to continue to manage the money market component of the Balanced Portfolio with this same goal and subject to similar investment policies.




	27










	The chart below provides the changes that would be made to the Balanced Portfolios investment objective and investment policies if this Proposal is approved by Shareholders. If the Proposal is not approved, the Supplemental Objective of the Balanced Portfolio will remain the same, and the Board of Directors may consider other courses of action.

	To realize as high a level of total return as is consistent with prudent investment risk. The Balanced Portfolios investment objective is supplemented by investment objectives and policies for the stock, bond and money market sectors. These are presently substantially identical to those which have been established for the Index 500 Stock, Select Bond and Money Market Portfolios.

	Investment

	Strategy






	Investing in the stock, bond and money market sectors as described for the Index 500 Stock, Select Bond and Money Market Portfolios, management attempts to capitalize on the variation in return potential produced by the interaction of changing financial markets and economic conditions while maintaining a balance over time between investment opportunities and their associated potential risks by following a flexible policy of allocating assets across the three market sectors. Management may adjust the percentage of assets in each market sector in response to changing market and economic conditions.



	The Portfolio normally has some portion of its assets in all three asset categories. However, up to 100% may be invested in money market instruments, and not more than 75% may be invested in either the stock or bond sector.





	Investing in the stock, bond and money market sectors, management attempts to capitalize on the variation in return potential produced by the interaction of changing financial markets and economic conditions while maintaining a balance over time between investment opportunities and their associated potential risks by following a flexible policy of allocating assets across the three market sectors.



	The Portfolio is actively managed to attempt to capitalize on changing financial markets and economic conditions following a flexible policy for allocating assets according to a benchmark of 35-55% equities; 40-60% debt and 0-20% in money market instruments. However, these benchmarks are not minimum and maximum limits and MSA may invest a greater or lesser percentage in any component.








	 





	 




	 





	 


	 


	 






	 



	The equity component is invested in a manner designed to track the performance of the S&P 500® Index, which is comprised primarily of large capitalization companies.




	Equity investments will

	 be actively managed and may consist of small, mid and large capitalization companies and foreign stocks based on MSAs economic and market outlook, and its perceived opportunities in each class. Up to 25% of net assets may be invested in foreign stocks.







	29










	 








	Debt securities will generally consist primarily of investment grade debt securities with maturities exceeding one year, though the Portfolio may invest up to 20% of the Portfolios total net assets in non-investment grade high yield/high risk bonds.



	Money market instruments will consist of high-quality, short term money market instruments that present minimal credit risks, as determined by MSA.



	 


	Up to 30% of the Portfolios net assets may be invested in foreign bonds.






	Debt securities will generally consist of investment grade debt securities with maturities exceeding one year, though the Portfolio may invest up to 20% of the Portfolios total net assets in non-investment grade high yield/high risk bonds.


	Money market instruments will consist of high-quality, short term money market instruments that present minimal credit risks, as determined by MSA.


	 


	Up to 30% of the Portfolios net assets may be invested in foreign bonds.








	What are the risks to the Balanced Portfolio of investing in securities of small and mid-sized companies, foreign companies and high yield/high risk bonds?






	Small and mid-sized companies may involve greater risk of loss and price fluctuation. The trading markets for securities of small and mid-sized companies may be less liquid and more volatile than securities of larger companies. This means that the Portfolio could have greater difficulty buying or selling a security of a small or mid-sized company at an acceptable price, especially in periods of market volatility. In addition, small and mid-sized companies can have more limited product lines, markets, and financial resources than larger, more well-established companies.




	Foreign securities can involve additional risks relating to political, economic, or regulatory conditions in foreign countries. These risks include fluctuations in foreign currencies; withholding or other taxes; and trading, settlement, custodial, and other operational risks. Foreign securities may also be subject to the less stringent investor protection and disclosure standards of some foreign markets. All of these factors can make foreign investments more volatile and potentially less liquid than U.S. investments. In addition, foreign markets can perform differently from the U.S. market.

	Non-investment grade high yield/high risk bonds (sometimes referred to as junk bonds) tend to offer higher yields than higher-rated securities of comparable maturities. However, they usually present greater risk of loss of income and principal. They are directly affected by the market perception of the creditworthiness of the securities issuers and are more likely to react to developments affecting market and credit risk than higher rated securities. The yield and price, therefore, may experience greater volatility than is the case with higher rated securities. In addition, the secondary market for these securities, which is concentrated in relatively few market makers, may not be as liquid and, under adverse market conditions, the secondary market could contract further. Judgment plays a more significant role in valuing these securities than those securities for which more objective market data are available.






	Will there be any change in the Balanced Portfolios management fee or other operating expenses?






	If the Proposal is approved by Shareholders, the management fee paid to MSA by the Balanced Portfolio will remain the same. MSA does not expect any change to the Balanced Portfolios other operating expenses as a result of the change except that, with more asset classes available, the ability to invest in foreign stocks, and the intention to invest more in high yield/high risk securities, portfolio turnover may be greater. Larger portfolio turnover rates result in more transaction costs which are paid out of the assets of the Balanced Portfolio and, like other Portfolio expenses, can reduce returns. In addition, upon the implementation of the changes, if approved by shareholders, there will be an initial increase in these transaction costs as some assets are moved from large capitalization companies to smaller companies and foreign securities.






	When will the proposed change become effective?






	If approved by shareholders at the Special Meeting, the proposed amendment to the Balanced Portfolios fundamental investment objective will become effective on April 30, 2007.






	What vote is required to approve the Proposal?






	Only shareholders of the Balanced Portfolio will vote on this Proposal. Approval of the Proposal requires the affirmative vote of the holders of a "majority of the outstanding voting securities" of the Balanced Portfolio, as defined in the 1940 Act. That means, the affirmative vote of the lesser of (1) 67% or more of the Balanced Portfolios shares present at the Special Meeting if more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Balanced Portfolio are present or represented, or (2) more than 50% of the outstanding shares of the Balanced Portfolio. Balanced Portfolio shares as to which no timely instructions are received will be voted by Northwestern Mutual in proportion to the instructions received for those contract and policy owners and payees who furnish timely instructions for the Balanced Portfolio.

	Who are NMSFs independent auditors?






	NMSFs principal accountant is PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (the Accountant). The Accountant has been appointed by NMSFs Audit Committee, which is comprised solely of independent directors. As such, pursuant to Rule 32a-4 under the 1940 Act, the Portfolios shareholders are not being asked at this time to ratify the selection of the Accountant. Representatives of the Accountant will not be present at the Special Meeting.




	The Accountant billed NMSF aggregate fees for services rendered to NMSF for the last two fiscal years as follows:

	Audit Related Fees relate to assurance and related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit or review of NMSFs financial statements that are traditionally performed by the independent auditor. Tax services include such things as tax return preparation or review, tax compliance, tax planning and tax advice.




	During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2004 and 2005, the aggregate non-audit fees (exclusive of the tax fees included in the table above) billed by the Accountant for other professional services rendered to NMSF, MSA and entities controlling, controlled by or under common control with MSA that provided ongoing services to NMSF, were $71,500 and $160,856, respectively.




	NMSF has adopted a policy governing the pre-approval of certain audit and non-audit related services to be provided by the Accountant. The policy provides for the pre-approval of audit, audit related and tax services for NMSF, as well as certain non-audit services provided to affiliates of NMSF that provide ongoing services to NMSF. All of the services listed above during fiscal 2004 and 2005 received the pre-approval of the Audit Committee or its designated representative. When considering the approval of audit-related and non-audit services, the Audit Committee considers whether the services to be provided by the Accountant are compatible with maintaining the Accountants independence.




	33








	Who will pay for the Special Meeting and related costs?






	NMSF will not pay the expenses in connection with the Notice and this Statement or the Special Meeting of Shareholders. MSA and/or an affiliate will pay the expenses, including the printing, mailing, solicitation and vote tabulation expenses, legal fees, and out-of-pocket expenses.






	Other information regarding the Special Meeting and the solicitation of votes.






	Proxies and voting instructions will be solicited by NMSF primarily by mail. The solicitation may also include telephone, facsimile, internet or oral communication by certain officers or employees of NMSF, MSA and Northwestern Mutual, none of whom will be paid for these services. Although it is not currently contemplated, NMSF or MSA may retain an outside proxy solicitation service to assist in soliciting voting instructions by telephone. The costs of any such outside proxy solicitation service will be borne by MSA and/or Northwestern Mutual, and not by NMSF. Any recordholder of shares giving voting instructions may revoke it before it is exercised at the Special Meeting by properly submitting a written notice of revocation or a subsequently signed proxy card.

	2.






	The Committee shall evaluate each candidates qualifications for Board membership, and, with respect to prospective nominees for Independent Director, their independence from the Funds investment advisers and other principal service providers.

	4.



	     



	While the Committee is solely responsible for the selection and nomination of potential candidates to serve on the Board, the Committee may consider and evaluate nominations properly submitted by shareholders of the Fund.











	 






	5.




	The Committee shall periodically evaluate the composition of the Board to determine whether it may be appropriate to add individuals with different backgrounds or skills from those already on the Board.






	D.








	Other Powers and Responsibilities





	The Committee shall meet as necessary in connection with any vacancy on or addition to the Board, and otherwise from time to time as appropriate to carry out the Committees responsibilities.




	The Committee shall have the resources and authority appropriate to discharge its responsibilities, including the ability to engage and compensate from the Funds assets, third party consultants to assist with identification and evaluation of potential Independent Directors.




	The Committee shall periodically assess this Charter and recommend to the Board any revisions or modifications that the Committee deems necessary or appropriate to the effective discharge of its responsibilities.

	APPENDIX C






	SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF NMSF DIRECTORS, DIRECTOR NOMINEES

	AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS





	All of the outstanding shares of each Portfolio of NMSF are owned by Northwestern Mutual. Northwestern Mutual holds these shares for its General Account and for its separate investment accounts used for variable annuity contracts and variable life policies. Information about Northwestern Mutuals ownership of each Portfolio is set forth above. Information about ownership interests of Directors, nominees and executive officers of NMSF, as of October 31, 2006, is set forth in the table below.

No information is given for a Portfolio if a nominee or Executive Officer had no interest in any shares of that Portfolio as of October 31, 2006. The Independent Directors would no longer be considered independent within the meaning of Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act if
	they were to invest in variable annuity contracts and variable life policies issued by Northwestern Mutual (which is the only way they could invest in the Portfolios.)

	APPENDIX D





	PROPOSED 

	AMENDED

	 




	INVESTMENT ADVISORY AGREEMENT




	     

	THIS



	AMENDED



	AGREEMENT, entered into this __ day of __, 2007 between Northwestern Mutual Series Fund, Inc., a Maryland corporation ("NMSF"), and Mason Street Advisors, LLC., a Wisconsin limited liability company ("MSA") (MSA being hereinafter referred to as the "Manager").



	     

	WHEREAS, NMSF is a series company as contemplated by the Investment Company Act of 1940 and currently has eighteen series, each of which is represented by a separate class of capital stock, and all of which are subject to this agreement: T. Rowe Price Small Cap Value Portfolio, International Growth Portfolio, Capital Guardian Domestic Equity Portfolio, Asset Allocation Portfolio, Small Cap Growth Stock Portfolio, Aggressive Growth Stock Portfolio, Franklin Templeton International Equity Portfolio, AllianceBernstein Mid Cap Value Portfolio, Index 400 Stock Portfolio, Janus Capital Appreciation Portfolio, Growth Stock Portfolio, Large Cap Core Stock Portfolio, T. Rowe Price Equity Income Portfolio, Index 500 Stock Portfolio, Balanced Portfolio, High Yield Bond Portfolio, Select Bond Portfolio and Money Market Portfolio (the "Portfolios"); and



	     

	WHEREAS, NMSF and Manager wish to enter into an agreement amending, restating and superseding the existing investment advisory agreements for fifteen of the Portfolios and setting forth the terms on which the Manager will perform certain services for NMSF and all of the Portfolios.




	     NOW, THEREFORE, it is mutually agreed as follows:



	     

	1. NMSF hereby employs the Manager to manage the investment and reinvestment of the assets of each Portfolio, to determine the composition of the assets of each Portfolio, including the purchase, retention or sale of the securities and cash contained in the Portfolio, subject to the supervision of the Board of Directors of NMSF, for the period and on the terms in this Agreement set forth. The Manager will perform its duties in accordance with the investment objectives and policies of each Portfolio as stated in NMSF's Articles of Incorporation, By-laws and Registration Statement and amendments thereto filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in resolutions adopted by NMSF's Board of Directors. The Manager hereby accepts such employment and agrees during such period, at its own expense, to render the services and to assume the obligations herein set forth, for the compensation herein provided. The Manager shall for all
	purposes herein be deemed to be an independent contractor and shall, unless otherwise expressly provided or authorized, have no authority to act for or represent NMSF in any way or otherwise be deemed an agent of NMSF.




	44






	     2. The Manager, at its own expense, shall furnish to each Portfolio office space in the offices of Manager or in such other place as may be agreed upon from time to time, and all necessary office facilities, equipment and personnel for managing the affairs and investments and keeping the books of the Portfolios, and shall arrange, if desired by NMSF, for members of the Managers organization to serve without salaries from NMSF as officers or agents of NMSF. The Manager assumes and shall pay or reimburse each Portfolio for their share of the compensation (if any) of the directors and officers of NMSF as such, and all expenses not hereinafter specifically assumed by the Portfolios that are incurred by the Manager or by the Portfolio in connection with the management of the investment and reinvestment of the assets of the Portfolios and the administration of the affairs of the Portfolios.





	Balanced, Select Bond and Money Market Portfolios





	     Each of the Balanced, Select Bond and Money Market Portfolios assumes and shall pay all interest charges and expenses; brokers commissions and issue and transfer taxes chargeable to the Portfolio in connection with securities transactions to which the Portfolio is a party; all taxes payable by the Portfolio to federal, state or other governmental agencies, and any extraordinary or non-recurring expenses incurred in connection with the operation of the Portfolio.





	All Portfolios except the Balanced, Select Bond and Money Market Portfolios




	     

	Each Portfolio (except the Balanced, Select Bond and Money Market Portfolios) assumes and shall pay charges and expenses of any custodian or depository appointed by the Portfolio for the safekeeping of its cash, securities and other property; charges and expenses of independent auditors; charges and expenses of any transfer agents and registrars appointed by the Portfolio; the cost of stock certificates representing shares of the Portfolio; fees and expenses involved in registering and maintaining registration of the Portfolio and of its shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission (including the preparation and printing of prospectuses for filing with the Commission); all expenses of shareholders' and directors' meetings and of preparing and printing reports to shareholders; charges and expenses of legal counsel in connection with the Portfolio's corporate existence, corporate and financial structure and relations with its
	shareholders; broker's commissions and issue and transfer taxes, chargeable to the Portfolio in connection with securities transactions to which the Portfolio is a party; and all taxes payable by the Portfolio to federal, state or other governmental agencies, including foreign taxes.





	All Portfolios




	     

	In connection with purchases or sales of portfolio securities for the account of each Portfolio, neither the Manager nor any of its directors, officers or employees will act as a principal or receive any commission as agent.




	45








	     The services of the Manager to the Portfolios hereunder are not to be deemed exclusive, and the Manager shall be free to render similar services to others so long as its services hereunder are not impaired thereby.



	     

	3. For the services to be rendered and the charges and expenses assumed and to be paid by the Manager as provided in paragraph 2 hereof, each Portfolio shall pay to the Manager compensation at the annual rate of the percentage of the current value of the net assets of the Portfolio as set forth in the Investment Advisory Fee Schedule which is part of this Agreement.



	     

	Such compensation shall be payable monthly. Such compensation shall be calculated on the basis of the aggregate of the averages of all the valuations of the net assets of the Portfolio made as of the close of business on each valuation day during the period for which such compensation is paid.



	     

	Such compensation shall be charged to each Portfolio on each valuation day. The amount of the compensation will be deducted on each valuation day from the value of the Portfolio prior to determining the Portfolio's net asset value for the day and shall be transmitted or credited to the Manager. 



	     

	4. The Portfolios shall cooperate with the Manager in the registration or qualification of its shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Each Portfolio shall use its best efforts to maintain such registration and qualifications.



	     

	5. NMSF shall cause the books and accounts of each Portfolio to be audited at least once each year by a reputable independent public accountant or organization of public accountants who shall render a report to NMSF.



	     

	6. Subject to the Articles of Incorporation of NMSF and of the Manager respectively, it is understood that directors, officers, employees, agents and stockholders of NMSF are or may be interested in the Manager (or any successor thereof) as directors, officers, employees, agents, or stockholders, or otherwise, that directors, officers, agents and stockholders of the Manager are or may be interested in NMSF as directors officers, employees, agents or stockholders or otherwise, and that the Manager (or any successor) is or may be interested in NMSF as a stockholder or otherwise.



	     

	7. In the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence, or reckless disregard of obligations or duties hereunder on the part of the Manager or its corporate affiliates, the Manager and its corporate affiliates shall not be subject to liability to NMSF for any act or omission in the course of, or connected with, rendering services hereunder or for any losses that may be sustained in the purchase, holding, or sale of any security. No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to protect the Manager and its corporate affiliates from liability in violation of section 17(i) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.




	46





	     

	8. This Agreement shall continue in effect so long as its continuance is specifically approved at least annually by the vote of a majority of those directors of NMSF who are not parties to the Agreement or interested persons of any such party cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval and by either a majority of the Board of Directors of NMSF or a majority of the outstanding voting securities of each Portfolio (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940). Shareholder approval shall be effective with respect to any Portfolio vote for the approval, notwithstanding that a majority of the outstanding voting securities of NMSF or of the other Portfolios have not voted for approval.




	     This Agreement may at any time be terminated without the payment of any penalty either by vote of the Board of Directors of NMSF or by vote of the majority of the voting securities of any Portfolio, on sixty days written notice to the Manager. This Agreement may also be terminated by the Manager on ninety days written notice to NMSF. This Agreement shall immediately terminate in the event of its assignment (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940). Any notice under this Agreement shall be given in writing, addressed and delivered, or mailed postpaid, to the other party at any office of such party.




	     9. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement NMSF hereby authorizes the


	Manager to employ one or more investment sub-advisers for the purpose of providing investment management services for any or each of the Portfolios pursuant to this Agreement,



	provided



	, however, that (1) the compensation to be paid to such investment sub-advisers shall be the sole responsibility of the Manager, (2) the duties and responsibilities of the investment sub-advisers shall be as set forth in sub-advisory agreements including MSA and the investment sub-adviser as parties, (3) such sub-advisory agreements shall be adopted and approved in conformity with the applicable laws,



	and



	regulations



	and any exemptive orders issued to NMSF



	, and (4) such
	sub-advisory agreements may be terminated at any time by MSA, the Board of Directors of NMSF, or by a majority vote of the relevant Portfolio's outstanding voting securities on not more than 60 days' written notice to the sub-adviser.



	     


	10. For each Portfolio where the Manager elects to employ a sub-advisor or sub-advisors

	for the purpose of providing investment management services to the Portfolio, the Manager shall (1)



	evaluate potential sub-advisors and present to the Board of Directors its recommendation regarding a


	sub-advisor or sub-advisors the Manager believes is or are well-suited to manage the Portfolios assets,


	(2) determine the portion of the Portfolios assets to be managed by each sub-advisor when it deems


	appropriate, (3) supervise and oversee the activities of the sub-advisors, including monitoring and


	evaluating




	the investment performance of the sub-advisor or sub-advisors, and (4) recommend the


	termination or replacement of a sub-advisor or
	sub-advisors when deemed appropriate by Manager.











	47






	     

	11



	. This Agreement may be amended at any time by mutual consent of the parties, provided that such consent on the part of NMSF shall have been approved, with respect to any Portfolio, by vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the Portfolio (as defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940) as provided in paragraph 8, if such vote is required by the Investment Company Act of 1940.




	     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this



	Amended



	Agreement on the day and year first above written.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.

Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
