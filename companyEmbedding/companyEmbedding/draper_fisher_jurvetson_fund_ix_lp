History[edit]
DFJ was founded in 1985.[3] The founders are Timothy C. Draper, John H.N. Fisher, and Steve Jurvetson.
In 2013, founding partner Draper announced his departure from the fund along with John Fisher.[4] Draper announced he will continue investing out of his personal fund Draper Associates and assisting his son in running an incubator.
As of October 2015[update], DFJ is one of the six largest and most active investors in the space sector, which has had over US$10 billion of private capital invested in it since 2005.[5]
Organization[edit]
The firm is headquartered in Menlo Park, California, and is currently investing DFJ Venture XII, a $350 million fund, which closed in 2016[6][7] and DFJ Growth’s second fund of $470 million,[8] which closed in 2014. DFJ’s core funds have raised more than $5 billion,[9] deployed in more than 300 companies.[10]
Since 2014, Heidi Roizen has been the firm’s operating partner.[11]
Affiliates[edit]
As part of Draper's DFJ funds, the Draper Venture Network was set up in 1990 to franchise the ideals behind the main DFJ fund.[12] Sixteen funds participate in the network including 11 outside of the US, including China, India, and the United Kingdom. In 2013 this network was restructured.[13]
In 2000, DFJ Esprit was set up in London, United Kingdom, as an affiliate fund focusing on early-stage European investment. In 2015, it was rebranded Draper Espirit reflecting the continued affiliation between Tim Draper but no longer DFJ.[14]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

History[edit]
DFJ was founded in 1985.[3] The founders are Timothy C. Draper, John H.N. Fisher, and Steve Jurvetson.
In 2013, founding partner Draper announced his departure from the fund along with John Fisher.[4] Draper announced he will continue investing out of his personal fund Draper Associates and assisting his son in running an incubator.
As of October 2015[update], DFJ is one of the six largest and most active investors in the space sector, which has had over US$10 billion of private capital invested in it since 2005.[5]
Organization[edit]
The firm is headquartered in Menlo Park, California, and is currently investing DFJ Venture XII, a $350 million fund, which closed in 2016[6][7] and DFJ Growth’s second fund of $470 million,[8] which closed in 2014. DFJ’s core funds have raised more than $5 billion,[9] deployed in more than 300 companies.[10]
Since 2014, Heidi Roizen has been the firm’s operating partner.[11]
Affiliates[edit]
As part of Draper's DFJ funds, the Draper Venture Network was set up in 1990 to franchise the ideals behind the main DFJ fund.[12] Sixteen funds participate in the network including 11 outside of the US, including China, India, and the United Kingdom. In 2013 this network was restructured.[13]
In 2000, DFJ Esprit was set up in London, United Kingdom, as an affiliate fund focusing on early-stage European investment. In 2015, it was rebranded Draper Espirit reflecting the continued affiliation between Tim Draper but no longer DFJ.[14]

Draper Fisher Jurvetson - Silicon Valley office

History[edit]
DFJ was founded in 1985.[3] The founders are Timothy C. Draper, John H.N. Fisher, and Steve Jurvetson.
In 2013, founding partner Draper announced his departure from the fund along with John Fisher.[4] Draper announced he will continue investing out of his personal fund Draper Associates and assisting his son in running an incubator.
As of October 2015[update], DFJ is one of the six largest and most active investors in the space sector, which has had over US$10 billion of private capital invested in it since 2005.[5]
Organization[edit]
The firm is headquartered in Menlo Park, California, and is currently investing DFJ Venture XII, a $350 million fund, which closed in 2016[6][7] and DFJ Growth’s second fund of $470 million,[8] which closed in 2014. DFJ’s core funds have raised more than $5 billion,[9] deployed in more than 300 companies.[10]
Since 2014, Heidi Roizen has been the firm’s operating partner.[11]
Affiliates[edit]
As part of Draper's DFJ funds, the Draper Venture Network was set up in 1990 to franchise the ideals behind the main DFJ fund.[12] Sixteen funds participate in the network including 11 outside of the US, including China, India, and the United Kingdom. In 2013 this network was restructured.[13]
In 2000, DFJ Esprit was set up in London, United Kingdom, as an affiliate fund focusing on early-stage European investment. In 2015, it was rebranded Draper Espirit reflecting the continued affiliation between Tim Draper but no longer DFJ.[14]

Welcome to DFJ
At DFJ, we work with big thinkers to bring their bold ideas to life. We like to think you can experience the DFJ difference by just walking through our front door. No fancy art here – instead you'll find rockets, satellites, robots, and 3D printers – the fruits of great entrepreneurial achievement. We invest in technology companies serving the needs of consumers and enterprises, as well as companies creating disruptive technologies such as commercial space exploration, robotics, and sustainable transportation. Some of our investments include Baidu (Nasdaq: BIDU), Box (NYSE: BOX), Cylance, Nervana (Intel), Planet, Skype, SolarCity (Nasdaq: SCTY), SpaceX, Tesla Motors (Nasdaq: TSLA), Twilio (NYSE: TWLO), Twitter (NYSE: TWTR), Tumblr (Yahoo!), Unity, Yammer (Microsoft), and Zoox.
We back early stage and growth stage companies

DFJ began in 1985 with a focus on early-stage companies. A decade ago, we added our Growth team dedicated to late-stage investing. Today, we have two teams investing two funds. Our Venture team works with founders in the early phases of company building. Our Growth team partners with companies entering hyper-growth mode. DFJ has backed 24 companies that have each achieved more than $1 billion in realized value through an initial public offering or acquisition.
DFJ supports bold thinkers who 
build enduring companies – 
24 DFJ investments have exited 
at greater than $1 billion each.
We are committed to building successful businesses
Entrepreneurs with the most ambitious visions come to us to nurture and launch companies that change the world. We work with entrepreneurs like Aaron Levie, Robin Li, Elon Musk, and Lyndon Rive to answer the central question in any market disruption: How big would this opportunity be if we put the right team together with the right resources? Our team helps clear the path for great new businesses to thrive and we work side by side with the entrepreneur and his or her team to help with recruiting, business development, partnering – whatever it takes. We genuinely understand what it takes for a company to succeed.

Draper Fisher Jurvetson - Silicon Valley office

History[edit]
DFJ was founded in 1985.[3] The founders are Timothy C. Draper, John H.N. Fisher, and Steve Jurvetson.
In 2013, founding partner Draper announced his departure from the fund along with John Fisher.[4] Draper announced he will continue investing out of his personal fund Draper Associates and assisting his son in running an incubator.
As of October 2015[update], DFJ is one of the six largest and most active investors in the space sector, which has had over US$10 billion of private capital invested in it since 2005.[5]
Organization[edit]
The firm is headquartered in Menlo Park, California, and is currently investing DFJ Venture XII, a $350 million fund, which closed in 2016[6][7] and DFJ Growth’s second fund of $470 million,[8] which closed in 2014. DFJ’s core funds have raised more than $5 billion,[9] deployed in more than 300 companies.[10]
Since 2014, Heidi Roizen has been the firm’s operating partner.[11]
Affiliates[edit]
As part of Draper's DFJ funds, the Draper Venture Network was set up in 1990 to franchise the ideals behind the main DFJ fund.[12] Sixteen funds participate in the network including 11 outside of the US, including China, India, and the United Kingdom. In 2013 this network was restructured.[13]
In 2000, DFJ Esprit was set up in London, United Kingdom, as an affiliate fund focusing on early-stage European investment. In 2015, it was rebranded Draper Espirit reflecting the continued affiliation between Tim Draper but no longer DFJ.[14]
