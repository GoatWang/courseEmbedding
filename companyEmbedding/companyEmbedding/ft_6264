Asked by: Ewald

            Thank you for your recent inquiry with The Home Depot. Unfortunately, we do not stock this item in an 8' x 10' size. The largest we carry is 5' x 8'.

It looked great when we first received it. However after a couple vacuums the edges are coming undone. I expected it to be better quality with Home Depot putting there name by it.

        Great rug, but gets very dirty easily.
This rug is amazing, however the white colors show dirt too easily. I have it in my office here in Hawaii and the white parts of the "G" are already turning orange after a week or two. Might be permanently stained. Looks awesome though!
