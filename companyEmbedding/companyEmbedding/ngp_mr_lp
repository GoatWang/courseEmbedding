Natural Gas Partners Announces Growth Equity Commitment to MS Energy Services | Business Wire
























































Natural Gas Partners Announces Growth Equity Commitment to MS Energy 
      Services






February 27, 2014 09:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



IRVING, Texas--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Natural Gas Partners, through its most recent fund, NGP Natural 
      Resources X, L.P., and NGP Energy Technology Partners II, L.P. 
      (collectively “NGP”) have made a $100 million equity commitment to MS 
      Energy Services, LLC (“MS Energy” or the “Company”). MS Energy is a 
      leading independent, vertically-integrated directional drilling company 
      with operations in most major onshore oil and gas basins in the United 
      States. Denham Capital (“Denham”), the current majority owner of MS 
      Energy, will maintain its ownership position in the Company going 
      forward.
    


      NGP’s growth equity investment will be used primarily to fund MS 
      Energy’s organic growth opportunities, allowing the Company to further 
      expand its current fleet of over 1,300 directional drilling motors, 
      which have a long history of providing superior performance through the 
      use of MS Energy’s proprietary technology and experienced personnel. 
      This investment gives MS Energy the ability to keep up with increasing 
      demand resulting from the proliferation of horizontal drilling and 
      increasing lateral lengths. In addition to directional drilling motors, 
      MS Energy will also expand its fleet of measurement-while-drilling 
      (“MWD”) and survey equipment, offering its customers some of the latest, 
      most advanced horizontal drilling technologies on the market today.
    

      MS Energy is led by Allen Neel, an experienced oilfield services 
      executive with a track record of creating value in the directional 
      drilling business. Mr. Neel has a successful background developing and 
      managing an array of oilfield services operations, including wireline, 
      survey, MWD and various other directional drilling services. Mr. Neel 
      has been the Chief Executive Officer of MS Energy since August 2004. 
      Prior to serving in his current role, Mr. Neel held senior management 
      positions at MS Energy’s predecessor, Warrior Energy Services (formerly 
      Black Warrior Wireline Corp.). Prior to Warrior Energy Services, Mr. 
      Neel held management roles at Graves Well Drilling and Halliburton 
      Services.
    

      MS Energy is also led by Neel’s long-time partners Paul Culbreth 
      (President and Chief Operating Officer) and Ron Whitter (Executive Vice 
      President and Chief Financial Officer). Prior to serving in his current 
      role as President and Chief Operating Officer of MS Energy, Mr. Culbreth 
      held various senior management and operations positions at Warrior 
      Energy Services, Phoenix Drilling Services and Ocean Drilling and 
      Exploration. Mr. Culbreth was also a founder of Houston Directional 
      Services. Prior to serving in his current role as Executive Vice 
      President and Chief Financial Officer of MS Energy, Mr. Whitter served 
      as Chief Accounting Officer of Stewart & Stevenson LLC, Chief Financial 
      Officer of Warrior Energy Services, and held other financial and 
      accounting positions with Oil States Industries, Norfolk Energy and 
      Transco Energy.
    

      “I am very excited to partner with NGP,” said Mr. Neel. “This investment 
      allows us to continue meeting our customers’ directional drilling 
      equipment and service needs, and also provides capital to further 
      enhance our existing product lines while also developing new 
      cutting-edge technologies to help our clients drill laterals longer, 
      quicker, and with more precision than ever before. With involvement from 
      two leading energy-focused private equity firms in NGP and Denham, I am 
      confident that we can continue growing the company to meet the 
      industry’s ever-expanding needs.”
    

      “NGP is extremely pleased to be partnering with MS Energy and Denham, as 
      this investment represents numerous core tenets of NGP. MS Energy is led 
      by a cohesive, experienced management team with a track record of 
      creating outsized returns in oilfield services, and the Company has 
      multiple attractive uses of capital. As the unconventional revolution 
      continues to resemble a manufacturing operation, best-in-class service 
      providers such as MS Energy will play a major role in E&P operators’ 
      ability to drill wells on time and on budget,” said Kenneth A. Hersh, 
      CEO of NGP Energy Capital Management.

      With over 20 years of experience in the industry, MS Energy is ranked as

Irving, Texas – February 27, 2014 – Natural Gas Partners, through its most recent fund, NGP Natural Resources X, L.P., and NGP Energy Technology Partners II, L.P. (collectively “NGP”) have made a $100 million equity commitment to MS Energy Services, LLC (“MS Energy” or the “Company”).  MS Energy is a leading independent, vertically-integrated directional drilling company with operations in most major onshore oil and gas basins in the United States.  Denham Capital (“Denham”), the current majority owner of MS Energy, will maintain its ownership position in the Company going forward.
NGP’s growth equity investment will be used primarily to fund MS Energy’s organic growth opportunities, allowing the Company to further expand its current fleet of over 1,300 directional drilling motors, which have a long history of providing superior performance through the use of MS Energy’s proprietary technology and experienced personnel.  This investment gives MS Energy the ability to keep up with increasing demand resulting from the proliferation of horizontal drilling and increasing lateral lengths.  In addition to directional drilling motors, MS Energy will also expand its fleet of measurement-while-drilling (“MWD”) and survey equipment, offering its customers some of the latest, most advanced horizontal drilling technologies on the market today.
MS Energy is led by Allen Neel, an experienced oilfield services executive with a track record of creating value in the directional drilling business. Mr. Neel has a successful background developing and managing an array of oilfield services operations, including wireline, survey, MWD and various other directional drilling services.  Mr. Neel has been the Chief Executive Officer of MS Energy since August 2004.  Prior to serving in his current role, Mr. Neel held senior management positions at MS Energy’s predecessor, Warrior Energy Services (formerly Black Warrior Wireline Corp.).  Prior to Warrior Energy Services, Mr. Neel held management roles at Graves Well Drilling and Halliburton Services.
MS Energy is also led by Neel’s long-time partners Paul Culbreth (President and Chief Operating Officer) and Ron Whitter (Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer). Prior to serving in his current role as President and Chief Operating Officer of MS Energy, Mr. Culbreth held various senior management and operations positions at Warrior Energy Services, Phoenix Drilling Services and Ocean Drilling and Exploration.  Mr. Culbreth was also a founder of Houston Directional Services.  Prior to serving in his current role as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of MS Energy, Mr. Whitter served as Chief Accounting Officer of Stewart & Stevenson LLC, Chief Financial Officer of Warrior Energy Services, and held other financial and accounting positions with Oil States Industries, Norfolk Energy and Transco Energy.“I am very excited to partner with NGP,” said Mr. Neel. “This investment allows us to continue meeting our customers’ directional drilling equipment and service needs, and also provides capital to further enhance our existing product lines while also developing new cutting-edge technologies to help our clients drill laterals longer, quicker, and with more precision than ever before.  With involvement from two leading energy-focused private equity firms in NGP and Denham, I am confident that we can continue growing the company to meet the industry’s ever-expanding needs.”
“NGP is extremely pleased to be partnering with MS Energy and Denham, as this investment represents numerous core tenets of NGP.  MS Energy is led by a cohesive, experienced management team with a track record of creating outsized returns in oilfield services, and the Company has multiple attractive uses of capital.  As the unconventional revolution continues to resemble a manufacturing operation, best-in-class service providers such as MS Energy will play a major role in E&P operators’ ability to drill wells on time and on budget.” said Kenneth A. Hersh, CEO of NGP Energy Capital Management.
