Population, the stock of houses, and other variables important to real estate prices have remained almost constant. Which of the following is most likely?Asset inflation has occurredIf nominal wealth increases faster than real wealth,asset inflation has occurredWhen real wealth increases,the economy can produce more goods and services than it did beforeTo calculate GDPweight the output of each final good and service produced in an economy in a year by its price in that year and then sum the resultThe reason economists include only the value of final goods and services when they calculate GDP is that intermediate goodswould be double counted otherwiseTransfers of assets, such as stock sales arenot included in GDP because they do not increase domestic productionWhich of the following would increase this year's GDP?A commission charged by your broker when you sold 100 shares of Borden stockAggregate income is a measure ofhousehold and business earnings from the sale of productive resourcesThe key to the equality of output and income isprofitDepreciationestimates the decrease in value of capital goods due to wear and tear over the yearIn 2008, gross investment was $2,593 billion and net investment was $873 billion; therefore depreciation was$1,720 billionIn comparing the per capita GDPs of two countries, purchasing power parity adjusts for differences inpricesThe total annual market value of a nation's final output of goods and services computed at existing prices is callednominal GDPReal GDP is calculated bydividing nominal GDP by the appropriate price index times 100Given nominal GDP of $4.2 trillion and a GDP deflator which is 40 percent greater than the base year, we can conclude that real GDP is equal to$3.0 trillionBhutan's government publishes a "gross national happiness" measure that embraces everything from protecting national resources to promoting a strong national culture and ensuring democratic government. This approach to measuring progress is similar to the approach that the text callsGenuine Progress IndicatorIf real GDP has increased by 3% and nominal GDP has increased by 5%, theninflation is 2%As a result of the Great Depression, economic thought placed greater emphasis onshort-run fluctuationsModern macroeconomics developed as an attempt to explainshort-run business cyclesThe study of economic growth focuses on the factors that cause aneconomy's production possibility curve to shift outSay's Law allows growth theorists toignore aggregate demand and focus only on aggregate supplyThe Rule of 72 implies that a country with a growth rate of 8 percent will double its income in about9 yearsSuppose Botswana doubles its income in 6 years while South Africa doubles its income in 9 years. According to the Rule of 72, the growth rate in Botswana is4 percentage points higher than the growth rate in South AfricaMarkets help to promote growth byincreasing specialization and the division of laborBy increasing specialization and the division of labor, markets make it possible for a country to focus its production more heavily on its area of comparative advantage. This increases efficiency and productivitymakes the average person better off but may worsen the distribution of incomeEconomic growth through the market hashelped both rich and poorIf output increases by 5 percent and population growth is 3 percent, per capita outputgrows by 2 percentIf the distribution of the gains from growth matter, growth in median income isa more informative measure of growth than growth in per capita income when the gains from growth are concentrated on a small segment of the populationWhat effect would we expect the market for loanable funds if people increase their saving?Supply will shift right and demand will not changeIn the early 2000s, analysts feared that low academic achievement in math in the United States may reduce U.S. economic growth by as much as half a percentage point a year. In terms of factors leading to growth, the low math scores indicate that the U.S. may be at a disadvantage in terms ofhuman capitalSome economists argue that well-functioning capital markets that allow funds to move from those who have but do not need funds to those who need but do not have funds, are essential for rapid economic growth. Well-functioning capital markets are an example ofgrowth compatible institutionsOver the last three decades, the Chinese government has adopted a series of market-oriented reforms that have shifted control of many parts of the Chinese economy from government officials to private individuals. These reforms have most likely stimulated China's growth for which of the following reasons?They have provided individuals with a greater incentive to be efficientThe Indian government is known for creating obstacles to foreign investment with tariffs, investment caps and tons of red tape. What effect does "red tape" have on growth?it discourages entrepreneurshipGrowth compatible institutionshave incentives built into them that lead people to put forth effortWhich of the following would tend to inhibit growth?Government approval of all economic activityMany economists now de-emphasize capital accumulation as a source of growth becausecapital accumulation alone does not necessarily lead to growthTo an economist, a production function isan equation showing how much output can be produced from various combinations of inputsThe law of diminishing marginal productivity implies that opportunity costincreases as one input is increased to produce successive units of outputThe most important policy implication of the Classical growth model is thatpolicies to stimulate saving and investment will stimulate economic growthJamaica has far less capital than Singapore. Based on this, the Classical growth model would predict that as each accumulates more capital Jamaica would growmore rapidly than SingaporeHow do investment in technology and investment in capital differ?They have different effects on output because of the positive externalities associated with investments in technologyLearning by doing implies thatgreater experience increases efficiencyThe law of diminishing marginal productivitymay apply even when learning by doing is present. New growth theory emphasizes the importance of all of the following exceptdiminishing marginal productivityNetwork externalitiescan explain why the economy fails to adopt the most efficient technologiesKeynesian economists believe. government can implement policy proposals that can positively impact the economy. Laissez-faire economists believemost government policies would probably make things worse"Classical economist" is often used interchangeably with which term?Laissez-faire economistKeynesian economists focus their analysis onthe short runBetween 2007 and 2009, the U.S. unemployment rate rose from under 5 percent to over 8 percent. A Keynesian economist would most likely blame this increase in unemployment ona decline in the level of aggregate demandWhich of the following statements would a Classical economist of the 1930s most likely disagree with?Unions do not impede wage and price adjustmentThe Classical economists argued thatif unemployment occurs, it will cure itself because wages and prices will fallWhich of the following was not a solution to the Depression favored by Classical economists?Hire unemployed workers for public works programsEquilibrium income is that level of incometoward which the economy gravitates in the short-runKeynes believed equilibrium income wasnot fixed at the economy's potential incomeIn 2009, the personal savings rate rose. If the additional savings were not translated into investment, Keynes would predict that aggregate income woulddecline and remain thereThe paradox of thrift occurs whenan increase in saving reduces outputKeynes argued thatthe short-run is a more important policy concern than the long-runThe shapes of the curves in the AS/AD model are basedon the relationship between the price level and total outputHow is the AS/AD model related to the supply and demand model of microeconomics?It looks similar to the supply and demand model but is not based on itAs prices fall, people become richer and buy more. This occurs as a result ofthe money wealth effectAn increase in the price leveldecreases the purchasing power of money, leading to higher interest rates and decreases investmentIf the price level rises, the interest rate effect will cause investmentand the quantity of aggregate demand to decreaseA rise in the U.S. price level will causeexports to decrease and imports to increaseIn the AS/AD model, the repercussions that a change in quantity demanded has on production and subsequently on income and expenditures is called themultiplier effectThe multiplier effect exists becauseproduction and expenditures are interdependentWhen aggregate demand is declining and the price level needs to fall to bring about equilibrium, pressure for the price level to fall brings expectations of falling aggregate demand, lower asset prices, and financial panics triggered by the decline in the value of financial assets. If these forces are strong enough, these dynamic effects can create aleftward shift in the aggregate demand curveA decrease in the expected future income of the U.S. would likelyshift its AD curve to the leftWhich of the following would shift the aggregate demand curve to the right?an increase in foreign incomeA change in the distribution of income affects the AD curve becauseworkers are more likely than stockholders to spend the income they receiveIf the multiplier effect is 4, a $15 billion increase in government expenditures will shift the AD curveto the right by $60 billionIf productivity increases by 5% but wages increase by 2%, then it is most likely that the price level willfall by 3 percentIf actual output exceeds potential output, the economyis experiencing an inflationary gapFiscal policies are policies that directly affectgovernment spending and taxesA policy that raises taxes or reduces government spending is calleda contractionary fiscal policyContractionary fiscal policies are most appropriate when the economy is inan inflationary gapoutput is beneath potential output soexpansionary fiscal policy like a tax cut is most appropriateAn expansionary fiscal policy is most appropriate whenan economy is experiencing a recessionary gapA contractionary fiscal policy is most appropriate whenan economy is experiencing an inflationary gap,When output equals potential output an economy is in long-run equilibrium,so no change in fiscal policy is desirableThe multiplier modelprovides numerical estimates of how equilibrium output changes in response to changes in aggregate expendituresThe multiplier model is designed to answer which one of the following questions?How will output be affected by changes in aggregate expenditures?Graphically, the aggregate production curve is a straight line that. goes through the origin and has a slope of 1At all points on the aggregate production curveincome equals productionAutonomous expenditures are defined as expenditures thatoccur regardless of the level of incomeInduced expenditures are defined as expenditures thatchange as income changesAutonomous expenditures are expenditures that occur whenincome is zeroThe marginal propensity to expend equals the ratio ofthe change in aggregate expenditure to a change in incomeAs the mpe rises, the slope of the expenditures curveincreasesThe marginal propensity to expenddepends on the marginal propensity to consume but is not entirely determined by itAn increase in the marginal propensity to importwill reduce the marginal propensity to expendIncome tends to varymore than induced aggregate expendituresAn increase in the marginal propensity to expendraises output by raising induced expendituresThe multiplier effect would not occur ifthe marginal propensity to expend equaled 0During the first year of the Reagan administration, taxes were cut significantly. At that time, potential GDP was $5.4 trillion while actual GDP was $5.3 trillion. Given this, the tax cut most likelydecreased a recessionary gapAssume the mpe = 0.8, GDP = $2,400 billion, and potential GDP = $2,200 billion. According to the multiplier model, the economy could achieve potential GDP if government spending weredecreased by $40 billionIf the marginal propensity to consume is 0.8, the marginal tax rate is 0.25, and the marginal propensity to import is 0.1, the multiplier is2Suppose the marginal propensity to consume is 0.8 and the tax rate is 0.25 and all other components of aggregate expenditures are determined outside the model.

Fidelity® VIP Technology Portfolio: Portfolio Manager Q&A

DECEMBER 31, 2016

Q&A


An interview with Portfolio Manager Charlie Chai

Charlie, how did the fund perform for the year ending December 31, 2016?
The fund's share classes gained roughly 11%, trailing the 13.85% return of the MSCI U.S. IMI Information Technology 25/50 Index and falling just behind the 11.96% return of the broader S&P 500®. However, the fund outpaced its peer group average.
Considerable market volatility and investors' preference for defensive stocks and sectors weighed on the fund's relative results in the first six months of the year, penalizing my emphasis on growth-oriented stocks in secular-growth industries, and secondarily on cyclically sensitive stocks with improving fundamentals.
In the second half of the year, investors grew less defensive and focused more on company fundamentals. This "risk-on" attitude helped a number of the fund's holdings, particularly in the semiconductor space, where stock choices and an overweighting jointly made that industry easily our largest contributor. Positioning in systems software also added value.

Specifically, where did the fund run into problems versus the MSCI sector index?
Stock selection and an overweighting in internet software & services weighed on relative results, along with non-benchmark exposure to internet & direct marketing.
The first group was home to the fund's largest detractor, China-based online advertising provider 58.com. This out-of-benchmark stock was hurt by selling pressure related to the company's purchase of privately held rival Ganji.com, as well as the challenges of integrating Ganji and other recent acquisitions. Additionally, 58.com issued disappointing revenue guidance in November. Recently imposed regulations by local Chinese governments intended to curb real estate speculation – including higher down-payment requirements – played a part in the firm lowering expectations for property-related advertising on its platform.
I continued to believe in the longer-term prospects for this stock, as I saw it as a potential beneficiary of the growth of China's middle class, one of the broader themes I keep my eye on. For risk-management purposes, I reduced this position somewhat but retained most of it at period end.
Also detracting was an overweighting in electric automaker Tesla Motors, among the fund's top-10 holdings at period end. After hitting a high for the year in early April, the stock consolidated somewhat below that level for the remainder of the period. Investors remained cautious amid the company's recurring production problems and its decision to purchase solar panel maker SolarCity. With that said, Tesla increased production by an impressive 64% to nearly 84,000 vehicles for all of 2016, and I believe the firm's rapidly increasing market share could alleviate many of its growing pains.
Finally, I'll mention untimely ownership of an out-of-benchmark position in DeNA, a Japan-based provider of online gaming and e-commerce services. Although the stock rose for the year overall, I increased our position here in December shortly before the share price dropped on allegations of inaccurate, plagiarized articles on Welq, its website for health care information. I continued to like DeNA because of the company's joint venture with Nintendo to support the latter's development of a mobile game platform. The first entry for this platform was the highly anticipated Super Mario Run, released in mid-December. Other games are already in the pipeline.
Overall, the fund's holdings of foreign stocks were a drawback this period amid the U.S. dollar's strong appreciation in the fourth quarter of 2016.

What about contributors?
A large overweighting in semiconductor maker Marvell Technology Group was the fund's largest relative contributor, with our position rising 58% this period. The company attracted activist investors and went through a major restructuring process with new management. I considerably reduced this position as the stock advanced, taking profits along the way. 
Overweighting Micron Technology – a maker of DRAM, NAND flash and other kinds of digital memory – also stood out for its positive impact on our relative results. I increased this position as the shares fell to a mid-single-digit price-earnings (P/E) ratio early in 2016 – well below the broader market's P/E ratio. Based on my expectations for Micron's earnings in 2016, I thought this was far too pessimistic. This turned out to be a good call, as the stock enjoyed a sustained rally from mid-May through the end of December. I reduced this position, too, given the robust gains it delivered.
A non-benchmark stake in Japan-based Sumco, a producer of silicon wafers for semiconductor manufacturers, proved timely as well. After a cyclical downturn for wafer demand and pricing depressed the stock in the first half of 2016, the supply-demand balance began to normalize in the second half of the year, leading to expectations of better pricing for wafer companies. I established a stake here in August. These developments helped our position post a 59% return for the period.

What is your outlook as of period end?While I expect global technology spending to remain muted in the near term, I am optimistic about longer-term trends for the major themes I've identified, such as cloud computing, software as a service (SaaS), big data, artificial intelligence and the "Internet of Things."
Over the past decade, services, internet and software companies have been steadily taking market share from hardware firms. The cloud and SaaS are better value propositions for customers. The advantages include smoothing capital expenditures, rationalizing hardware costs, eliminating the need to manage IT infrastructure and keeping clients on the cutting edge of technology.
More recently, we have witnessed the significant development of artificial intelligence and machine learning with applications such as image and voice recognition. This development has been driven by the vast amount of data collected in many internet-based applications, the material improvement in machine-learning algorithms and the significant reduction in unit computing costs.
I believe we are in the early to middle innings of this and many other paradigm shifts in the tech sector. Similar to the mainframe and client-server eras, I believe big shifts in profit pools and market capitalization are possible, and my goal is to monitor these changes closely and position the fund to take advantage of them. ■






Charlie Chai on opportunities in international tech companies:


"Consistent with my longstanding strategy, I continue to look for new ideas in the international markets, where many companies are undiscovered or underfollowed by research analysts. I believe these markets are a source of compelling growth opportunities.
"For example, in the consumer segment, internet services and e-commerce companies remain attractive growers, especially those that sit at the intersection of the social, mobile and local themes. In Asian markets – especially China, South Korea and Japan – these industries have generally seen a pace of innovation as fast as, if not faster than, their Western peers. This pace has been driven by a less intrusive regulatory environment and incumbent companies in certain industries that are much less mature.
"Internet finance is another area of rapid growth. Consumer credit offerings have very low penetration in markets such as China. And in Southeast Asia, smartphone adoption has started to resemble growth trends seen in China three years ago. I believe considerable long-term value will be created in this region.
"After a period of significant capital inflows, we've seen a recent decline in corporate fundraising activity, which I believe is very positive for existing internet companies because it means higher barriers to entry and less competition." 



Key Takeaways



The fund's share classes gained roughly 11% for the year ending December 31, 2016, lagging the 13.85% return of the MSCI U.S. IMI Information Technology 25/50 Index.

Growth-oriented stocks in secular-growth industries favored by Portfolio Manager Charlie Chai struggled early in the year amid considerable market volatility and investors' preference for defensive stocks and sectors.

Versus the MSCI sector index, stock selection and an overweighting in internet software & services weighed on results, along with non-benchmark exposure to internet & direct marketing. Conversely, stock choices and an overweighting in semiconductors contributed most, while positioning in systems software also added value.

Although Charlie expects global technology spending to remain muted in the near term, he's optimistic about longer-term prospects for the major themes he's identified.





MARKET RECAP


The S&P 500® index returned 11.96% in 2016, rising sharply on post-election optimism for economic growth. The year began during a fairly volatile stretch, with stocks hampered by persistent oil-price weakness and U.S.-dollar strength. Markets regained momentum in February amid U.S. job gains, a rally in energy and other stimuli that helped keep the roughly seven-year uptrend intact. Markets tumbled briefly following the U.K.'s June 23 vote to exit the European Union – dubbed "Brexit" – then recovered quickly and settled into a flattish stretch until the November 8 U.S. presidential election. Stocks reacted to the outcome by reaching a series of all-time highs. For the year, energy (+27%) led the way amid two strong rallies in commodity prices, one in the spring and another in November. Telecommunication services (+23%) was close behind, as demand for dividend-paying equities was high early in the period. Cyclical sectors, including financials (+22%), industrials (+18%) and materials (+17%), also posted strong gains. Conversely, consumer staples (+5%) and consumer discretionary (+6%) lagged the index, the latter hurt as online competition continued to pressure brick-and-mortar retailers. Real estate (+3%) struggled due to expectations for rising interest rates, while health care (-2%) was hampered by an uncertain political and regulatory outlook.



Performance Summary

Variable annuity contracts are issued by insurance companies through separate accounts that are part of the insurer. The value of a variable annuity contract depends on the values of units of subaccounts of the separate account. Each subaccount purchases shares of a corresponding mutual fund. Subaccount investment performance is based on the performance of the mutual fund in which it invests, less insurance company charges made against the assets of the separate account. A subaccount is not a mutual fund. 
The information provided in this Performance Summary contains performance information for the fund, or class, and each variable subaccount, with comparisons over different time periods to the fund's relevant benchmarks – including an appropriate index as well as a group of similar funds whose average returns are compiled and monitored by an independent mutual fund research company. Figures for more than one year assume a steady compounded rate of return and are not a class' year-by-year results, which fluctuated over the periods shown. Fund performance numbers are net of all underlying fund operating expenses, but do not include any insurance charges imposed by your insurance company's separate account. If fund performance information included the effect of these additional charges, the total returns would have been lower. The performance table also contains performance information for certain insurance company subaccounts that invest in the fund. Each variable subaccount's performance, as shown, is net of all fees and expenses, including those charges imposed by your insurance company. Seeing the returns over different time periods can help you assess the performance against relevant measurements and across multiple market environments. The performance information includes average annual total returns and cumulative total returns and is further explained in this section.*
Investing in a variable annuity involves risk of loss – investment returns, contract value, and, for variable income annuities, payment amounts are not guaranteed and will fluctuate. Withdrawals of taxable amounts from an annuity are subject to ordinary income tax, and, if taken before age 59 1/2, may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty.
Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted below. An investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. For month-end performance figures, please visit www.fidelity.com/annuityperformance or call Fidelity. The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.

By visiting or using the Site you agree to the provisions of our Terms of Use and this Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Policy, please do not use or access the Site or use the Services (defined below). This Policy only applies to information collected while you are on the Site. For more information on how the Site may redirect you to other web sites, please see the "Links and Redirection to Third Party Sites" section below.
Information We Collect
We collect and store information that you voluntarily provide to us as well as data related to your Site visit.
In some areas of the Site, we request or may request that you provide personally identifiable information, including your name, address, email address, telephone number, username, and other information from which your identity is or may be discernible. We collect personally identifiable information from our users at several different points on the Site. We will also allow you the opportunity to provide information identifying yourself as an investor or borrower and, if you are a borrower, the amount you will be seeking, your desired target rate, the intended use of funds and loan duration. Such information is collected for the purpose of contacting you with information regarding prospective investment or borrowing opportunities (as applicable) based on your specified interests (the "Services"). It is solely up to you whether you furnish such information. If you do provide such information, you are thereby consenting to the use of that information in accordance with the policies and practices described in this Policy. This information may be stored on our servers, and on the servers of third party service providers.
In addition, during your visit we automatically collect certain aggregate information and analytical data related to your Site visit (see "Use of Cookies" below). Aggregate information is non-personally identifiable or anonymous information about you, including the date and time of your visit, the IP address of your computer or mobile device, your computer or mobile device browser information, the Internet address that you visited prior to and after reaching the Site, the name of the domain and host you used to access the Internet, the type of mobile device you use, your mobile device's unique device ID and the features of our Site which you accessed. This data is in no way associated with your personally identifiable information.
How We Use Information
We use collected information to make available and to improve our high standard of reliable services. We use such information to:

respond to inquiries or service requests and monitor such responses;
provide information about and market our Services;
resolve problems; and
manage the Site and assess its usage and usage of the Services.

Disclosure of Information
We do not sell or rent personally identifiable information to third parties who are not affiliates of the Company. Information that you provide will not be shared with any other user of the Site without your consent. We may disclose personally identifiable information to appropriate affiliates of the Company, including strategic alliance affiliates and third party service providers, to respond to a request for service or to provide information about available products or services. We are not limited in our use of non-personal information that does not permit direct association with any specific individual, or non-identifiable aggregate information about our users (such as the number of users of our Services, the geographic distribution of our users, the amount of information located and/or removed, etc.).
We disclose information that we, in good faith, believe is appropriate to cooperate in investigations of fraud or other illegal activity, or to conduct investigations of violations of our Terms of Use. For example, this means that if we conduct a fraud investigation and conclude that one side has engaged in deceptive practices, we can give that person or entity's contact information to victims who request it.
We disclose information in response to a subpoena, warrant, court order, levy, attachment, order of a court-appointed receiver or other comparable legal process, including subpoenas from private parties in a civil action. If the subpoena seeks information about an identified user or limited group of users, we'll make reasonable business efforts to contact the user(s) before providing information to the party that requests it. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to contact the user(s) in all cases, whether because of a time limit, court order, inability to effectively contact a user, or for any other reason.
We may disclose information to your agent or legal representative (such as the holder of a power of attorney that you grant, or a guardian appointed for you).
We share information with companies that provide public relations and marketing services for us. Such information will only be shared by us to customize, measure and improve our products, Services and advertising; it will not be shared with third parties for their marketing purposes. These third parties are obligated to protect your information and are prohibited from using your personally identifiable information for any other purpose.
As with any other business, it is possible that in the future we could merge with or be acquired by another company. If such an acquisition occurs, the successor company would have access to the information maintained by us, including customer account information, but would continue to be bound by this Policy unless and until it is amended.
We share your information with our parent, subsidiaries and joint ventures to help coordinate the Services we provide to you, enforce our terms and conditions, and promote trust and safety.
We may share aggregate (non-personally identifiable) information with certain third parties such as advertisers, national industry organizations, and prospective affiliates. In addition, we reserve the right to disclose aggregate information and personally identifiable information to third parties as required or permitted by law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights.

In Our Clients' Words




                            EquityZen gets shares of companies that others don't. They have interesting ways of getting exposure to shares of companies I really couldn't find anywhere else.
                        

Savneet Singh

                            It was great doing business with you guys. You are much better than your competitors who I was dealing with! 10 million times!

Shareholder In Multi-billion-dollar Company^




                            Through EquityZen, I got cash for my private stock, at both a better price and larger volume than the company itself offered through SecondMarket. The whole process was very straightforward and efficient.

                            EquityZen is helping us buy a house and is making it much easier to get it done. We are grateful for your service.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

5 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 5 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 1277 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

 funds
                       




What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund scores Above Average because it delivered returns that were in the top 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Below Average because they fall between the 20th and 40th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category







How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.




How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



Seeks growth of capital over the long term.




Strategy



Normally investing at least 80% of assets in blue chip companies (companies whose stock is included in the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and companies with market capitalizations of at least $1 billion if not included in either index). Investing in companies that FMR believes have above-average growth potential (stocks of these companies are often called "growth" stocks). Normally investing primarily in common stocks of well-known and established companies.


Risk



The value of equity securities fluctuates in response to issuer, political, market, and economic developments. In the short term, equity prices can fluctuate dramatically in response to these developments. Different parts of the market and different types of equity securities can react differently to these developments. For example, 'growth' stocks can react differently from 'value' stocks. Foreign securities, foreign currencies, and securities issued by U.S. entities with substantial foreign operations can involve additional risks. You may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.



Short Term Redemption Fee
None



Who May Want To Invest

Someone who is seeking the potential for long-term share-price appreciation.
Someone who is willing to accept the generally greater price volatility associated with growth-oriented stocks.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average

This fund scores Above Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average


This fund scores Above Average because it delivered returns that were in the top 22.5% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.




How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



The value of equity securities fluctuates in response to issuer, political, market, and economic developments. In the short term, equity prices can fluctuate dramatically in response to these developments. Different parts of the market and different types of equity securities can react differently to these developments. For example, 'growth' stocks can react differently from 'value' stocks. Foreign securities, foreign currencies, and securities issued by U.S. entities with substantial foreign operations can involve additional risks. You may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Quarterly Fund Review






Portfolio Manager Q&A






Chairman's Message







							Investment Approach
						











© 2016 Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
2. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
3. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
4. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time.  They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments.  The Top Ten Holdings and Top 5 Issuers do not include money market instruments or futures contracts, if any.  Depository receipts are normally combined with the underlying security.  Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different.Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment option reports its holdings. Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section. Some report them in this section in addition to the equity, bond and other allocation shown. Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown. If the allocation without the foreign component equals (or rounds to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
5. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
6. The percent of net assets invested in both domestic and foreign Equities (common stocks, preferred stocks, rights and warrants, convertible preferred stocks and stock index futures and options), Bond (all debt instruments, including investment grade, non-investment grade, non-rated securities and convertible bonds), and Cash & Net Other Assets (cash, repurchase agreements, receivables and payables).
7. "Tax-Advantaged Domiciles" represent countries whose tax policies may be favorable for company incorporation.
8. Net Other Assets can include fund receivables, fund payables, and offsets to other derivative positions, as well as certain assets that do not fall into any of the Portfolio Composition categories. Depending on the extent to which the fund invests in derivatives and the number of positions that are held for future settlement, Net Other Assets can be a negative number.
9. StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.


Generally, the issuer of a mutual fund is the fund or trust which issues the shares; the issuer of collective investment trusts is the underlying trust or investment vehicle which issues the units; the issuer of a stock fund is the company which issues the shares; the issuer of options such as separate accounts and strategies is the plan which makes them available; the issuer of a fixed return option is the insurance company or other company which offers the investment; the issuer of an annuity contract is the insurance company and/or the insurance company separate account.

Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

Friess Small Cap Growth Fund
OverviewPerformanceFund AnalyticsOverviewBackground


Smaller companies played such a significant role in the early growth of Friess Associates that we concluded in 1982 that the small-cap category warranted specialized attention. For the next 35 years, the firm managed small-cap-only portfolios exclusively for institutions and high-net-worth individuals capable of meeting substantial investment minimums. Friess Small Cap Growth Fund makes our time-tested approach to investing in smaller companies widely available for the first time.

Fund Focus and Strategy


The small-cap category is a fruitful hunting ground for our approach because the core of our investment strategy is performing exhaustive research legwork to build a portfolio of underappreciated companies. Fewer Wall Street analysts follow smaller companies, which we believe contributes to one of the market’s most promising opportunities to outperform through in-depth research and analysis. We focus our efforts on isolating smaller companies poised for rapid earnings growth that sell at reasonable prices.
We interview companies of all sizes in our search for great smaller companies. We conduct all-cap research, meaning that our research into a small-cap company might also include its mid-cap supplier and large-cap customer. We believe taking a broader view that spans a company’s complete “food chain” positions us to uncover trends that point to opportunity or foreshadow trouble before they become obvious to managers whose focus is narrower.
Friess Small Cap Growth Fund capitalizes on the relationship between earnings performance and stock prices by holding companies experiencing above-average earnings growth that also show promise to exceed consensus earnings expectations. While the Fund’s market-cap characteristics reflect its small-cap focus, the portfolio’s sector weightings result from a true bottom-up, company-by-company approach and do not reflect the composition of any market index. Friess Small Cap Growth Fund aims to beat benchmarks, not mimic them.


Where This Fund May Fit As Part Of Your Asset Allocation


The Fund may be appropriate for your overall investment allocation if you are:

Looking to gain exposure to small-cap stocks
Seeking long-term growth of capital
Willing to accept short-term volatility of returns





Investors should carefully consider the Friess Small Cap Growth Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing. For this and other information, please call (855) 656-3017 or visit www.friessfunds.com. Read the Prospectus carefully before investing.




Risks
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Friess Small Cap Growth Fund invests in small-cap companies, which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. The Fund may also invest in depositary receipts, which are generally subject to the same risks as the foreign securities because their values depend on the performance of the underlying foreign securities.

The performance shown represents past performance and is not a guarantee of future results. Monthly and quarterly performance displayed is that of the Predecessor Fund due to the Fund’s effective date of May 31, 2017. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. The investment return and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. From time to time, the advisor has waived fees or reimbursed expenses, which may have resulted in higher returns. The listed returns of the Fund are net of expenses, and the returns of the indices exclude expenses. Performance prior to May 31, 2017 is represented by the Predecessor Fund, which commenced operations on August 6, 2002, and has not been adjusted to reflect the Fund’s share class’ fees and expenses and would be lower if reflected. Inception date used for Life of Fund performance is August 6, 2002.

The Fund is a newly registered mutual fund and does not have a full calendar year of performance as a mutual fund. Performance shown prior to May 31, 2017 is for Series B Units of the Friess Small Cap Trust (the “Predecessor Fund”), an unregistered Delaware Business Trust that commenced operations on August 6, 2002. The Predecessor Fund offered Series A and Series B Units. Performance is shown for Series B Units because Series B Units have been outstanding since inception of the Predecessor Fund. Returns for Series A Units, for the periods they were outstanding, would generally have been higher than returns for Series B Units. The Predecessor Fund was reorganized into the Fund by transferring all of the Predecessor Fund’s assets to the Fund in exchange for Institutional Class shares of the Fund on May 31, 2017, the date that the Fund commenced operations (the “Reorganization”). The Predecessor Fund has been managed in the same style as the Fund will utilize and by the same Investment Adviser and Sub-Adviser. The Fund’s investment objective, policies, guidelines and restrictions are, in all material respects the same as those of the Predecessor Fund. At the time of the Reorganization the Predecessor Fund’s investment portfolio was managed by the same portfolio manager and team of investment professionals who will manage the Fund’s investment portfolio. 
The Predecessor Fund was not subject to certain investment restrictions, diversification requirements and other restrictions of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”) or Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), which, if they had been applicable, might have adversely affected the Predecessor Fund’s performance. After the Reorganization, the Fund’s performance will be calculated using the standard formula set forth in rules promulgated by the SEC, which differs in certain respects from the methods used to compute total return for the Predecessor Fund.
Investors should carefully consider the Friess Small Cap Growth Fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing. For this and other information, please call (855) 656-3017 or visit www.friessfunds.com. Read the Prospectus carefully before investing.

Investor Class shares of the Fund would have similar annual returns to Institutional Class shares and the Predecessor Fund because they are invested in the same portfolio of securities; however, the returns for Investor Class shares would be lower than those of the Institutional Class shares and the Predecessor Fund because Investor Class shares have different expenses than Institutional Class shares and the Predecessor Fund.

Summary







 


Overall Rating

5 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 5 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 1277 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.





3 Yrs





                         Out of
1,277
 funds
                     	




What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High


This fund scored High because it delivered returns that were in the top 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category over a 3-year period.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Below Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Below Average because they fall between the 20th and 40th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category.

Fund Overview




Objective



Seeks capital appreciation.




Strategy



Normally investing primarily in common stocks. Investing in companies that FMR believes have above-average growth potential (stocks of these companies are often called "growth" stocks). Investing in domestic and foreign issuers. Using fundamental analysis of factors such as each issuer's financial condition and industry position, as well as market and economic conditions, to select investments.


Risk



Stock markets, especially foreign markets, are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks. "Growth" stocks can perform differently from the market as a whole and other types of stocks and can be more volatile than other types of stocks.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High

This fund scores High because Morningstar has rated its risk above the 80th percentile when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High


This fund scored High because it delivered returns that were in the top 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category over a 3-year period.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

© 2016 Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. The Morningstar information contained herein: (1) is proprietary to Morningstar and/or its content providers; (2) may not be copied or redistributed; and (3) is not warranted to be accurate, complete or timely. Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. No Transaction Fee Fidelity funds are available without paying a trading fee to Fidelity or a sales load to the fund. However, the fund may charge a short-term trading or redemption fee to protect the interests of long-term shareholders of the fund. Shares are subject to the fund's management and operating expenses. See Expenses & Fees for more information.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time.  They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments.  The Top Ten Holdings and Top 5 Issuers do not include money market instruments or futures contracts, if any.  Depository receipts are normally combined with the underlying security.  Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different.Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment option reports its holdings. Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section. Some report them in this section in addition to the equity, bond and other allocation shown. Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown. If the allocation without the foreign component equals (or rounds to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
6. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.
7. The percent of net assets invested in both domestic and foreign Equities (common stocks, preferred stocks, rights and warrants, convertible preferred stocks and stock index futures and options), Bond (all debt instruments, including investment grade, non-investment grade, non-rated securities and convertible bonds), and Cash & Net Other Assets (cash, repurchase agreements, receivables and payables).
8. "Tax-Advantaged Domiciles" represent countries whose tax policies may be favorable for company incorporation.
9. Net Other Assets can include fund receivables, fund payables, and offsets to other derivative positions, as well as certain assets that do not fall into any of the Portfolio Composition categories. Depending on the extent to which the fund invests in derivatives and the number of positions that are held for future settlement, Net Other Assets can be a negative number.
10. StyleMap® depictions of mutual fund characteristics are produced using data and calculations provided by Morningstar, Inc. StyleMapsSM estimate characteristics of a fund's equity holdings over two dimensions: market capitalization and valuation. The percentage of fund assets represented by these holdings is indicated beside each StyleMap. Current StyleMap characteristics are calculated each time Morningstar receives updated portfolio holdings from a fund and are denoted with a dot. Historical StyleMap characteristics are calculated for the shorter of either the past 3 years or the life of the fund, and are represented by the shading of the box(es) previously occupied by the dot. StyleMap characteristics represent an approximate profile of the fund's equity holdings (e.g., domestic stocks, foreign stocks, and American Depositary Receipts), are based on historical data, and are not predictive of the fund's future investments. Although the data are gathered from reliable sources, accuracy and completeness cannot be guaranteed.
11. Expense Cap is a limit that the fund company has placed on the level of the expenses borne by the fund until 1/31/2021 and indicates the maximum level of expenses (with certain exceptions) that the fund would be paying until that time.  After the expiration date, the expense cap may be terminated or revised, which may lower the fund's yield and return.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

Our Mission
Our mission is to improve the way startup employees are paid by unlocking the value of their equity compensation in a way that benefits all key players: the shareholder, the company, and the investor.

This must be accomplished in a manner that keeps the focus on company growth, the number one priority for all stakeholders. Investors that previously couldn't access late-stage private companies due to investment minimums, can now invest in private growth companies.
