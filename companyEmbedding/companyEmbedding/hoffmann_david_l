Description

                    This book comprises twelve essays on Stalinism by leading international historians, whose work presents a range of interpretations regarding Stalinism's origins and consequences. In particular the essays address the following questions: why did the October Revolution of 1917 result not in a communist utopia but in the Stalinist dictatorship, with prison camps, bloody purges, and unprecedented state repression? was Stalin personally to blame or were these events the result of social forces, socialist ideology, or the international threat? how did Stalinism affect women and gender roles? what was Stalinist policy toward ethnic and national minorities? what impact did the Second World War have on Soviet society? The chapters include work by both eminent historians and younger scholars who have conducted research in the newly-opened Russian archives. These perspectives are brought together by the editor who provides a contextualizing chapter and introductions to the debates. The book provides students and teachers with a valuable overview of the scholarship on Stalinism and an understanding of the debates that have shaped the field of Soviet history.show more

Review quote

                            "The often contentious scholarly arguments about the character of Stalinism are fully represented in this important volume assembled and introduced by Ohio State's David Hoffmann. Perfect for the classroom, the essays in this book contain some of the best recent research and thinking about Stalin's key role in Russian History."Norman Naimark, Stanford University   "This is a collection of enormous value to anyone seeking to understand the causes and consequences of Stalin's despotic transformation of Soviet society. It brings together some of the finest historical writing, including more recent scholarship, to reflect the diversity of interpretation of this grim but vitally important episode in twentieth-century history." Steve Smith, University of Essex "Soviet historical studies have been reanimated ... Students and teachers oof this period confront a proliferation of authorities and viewpoints. The strength of David Hoffmann's collection is in its attempt to replect this variety of views." Continuity and Change "Brilliant and illuminating analyses. Hoffman provides a range of first-rate critiques of the regime from various angles." Journal of Genocide Researchshow more

Back cover copy

                            This book comprises twelve essays on Stalinism by leading international historians, whose work presents a range of interpretations regarding Stalinism's origins and consequences. In particular the essays address the following questions: 
  
  why did the October Revolution of 1917 result not in a communist utopia but in the Stalinist dictatorship, with prison camps, bloody purges, and unprecedented state repression? 
  was Stalin personally to blame or were these events the result of social forces, socialist ideology, or the international threat? 
  how did Stalinism affect women and gender roles? 
  what was Stalinist policy toward ethnic and national minorities? 
  what impact did the Second World War have on Soviet society?  
  The chapters include work by both eminent historians and younger scholars who have conducted research in the newly-opened Russian archives. These perspectives are brought together by the editor who provides a contextualizing chapter and introductions to the debates. The book provides students and teachers with a valuable overview of the scholarship on Stalinism and an understanding of the debates that have shaped the field of Soviet history.show more

IP Due Diligence | Hoffman Patent Group























































TURNING NEW IDEAS, NAMES, PRODUCTS & COMPUTER PROGRAMS INTO POWERFUL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

 
IP Due Diligence



When acquiring, merging with or investing in another company, the Hoffman Patent Group helps evaluate the IP, including the IP strengths and weaknesses.  We help write the IP warranties to protect your company and work with business counsel to get the job done within a reasonable budget.  Business counsel can put the deal together, and the IP can be valued based on the target company’s revenues, but there can be IP weaknesses that only an IP attorney can spot.
-Is your company obtaining patents, trademarks and/or copyrights that are enforceable in court?
-Is your business’ IP paperwork in order-do you have all the appropriate documents and signatures?
-Hoffman Patent Group can help solidify the IP before a sale so that your company can obtain the maximum price.

IP Clearance | Hoffman Patent Group






















































TURNING NEW IDEAS, NAMES, PRODUCTS & COMPUTER PROGRAMS INTO POWERFUL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

 
IP Clearance



All businesses seek to introduce new products and new services and to improve existing products and services.  Any new or modified products or services create patent infringement liability risks.  Any names for the new products or services create trademark infringement risks. Depending on your company’s projected sales and risk factors, Hoffman Patent Group designs a sensible clearance process to minimize risk of serious issues, litigation and business disruption.
Clearing any intellectual property is a multi-step process. Hoffman Patent Group will:


Perform a patent or trademark search and prepare an opinion advising regarding infringement risk


Help modify a trademark when there is too much risk into a safer trademark


Strategize designing around a patent to avoid infringement


Perform a patent invalidity search and analysis where necessary


Determine the owner (if any) of the intellectual property.


Contact them and negotiate an agreement, if appropriate.


Handle any issues involving use and licensing.

About the Author(s)

 Daniel Hoffman is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at the University of Victoria in British Columbia.  
 David M. Weiss is the Director of the Software Production Research Department at Avaya Laboratories. His technical work has evolved into the invention of processes  that incorporate ideas from families, design for change, measurement,  precise specification, and technology transfer. The result has been a  software production process based on family-oriented abstraction,  specification, and translation, known as FAST.
