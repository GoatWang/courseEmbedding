The Eternal Debate: Color Hardener vs Integral Color
11/24/2015 by Aaron Szerletich
Color Hardener and Integral Color are two distinct options for achieving the same goal - coloring concrete. Each presents a specific set of pros and cons that will help inform your decision. Read on to find which is best for your application. 


Fall Training Recap
11/24/2015 by Aaron Szerletich
On a mild, if chilly, late October day, a couple dozen men and women stood patiently outside. The sound of diesel engines clattered in the background as a truck from the local ready mix producer backed up to the tent.


Fibers, and Finishers, and Sealers! Oh My!
11/25/2015 by Aaron Szerletich
Water is a big deal. Without it, it’s nearly impossible to place and work concrete using traditional methods. With too much, concrete takes too long to set and is compromised in strength and durability. Adding water to the surface makes the slab easier to work and finish, but it increases the chances of surface defects down the line. Solomon Colors offers a variety of products to help manage this element of concrete and maximize the performance of every yard.

People matter. As an ESOP company, Solomon Colors aims to take care of the people that make the company work. 


Concrete Countertops: Like Nothing Else

From simple and classic to wild and avant garde, concrete countertops offer a variety of decorative possibilities for the home, office, or business. 


Good Made Better: How the UF500 Automated System Revolutionizes Secondary Fiber Reinforcement
12/15/2015 by Aaron Szerletich
Secondary reinforcing fibers can be a double-edged sword. They can control cracks and generally improve performance, but they can be time consuming, difficult, and even hazardous to add to the mix. Manually adding bags of fiber to the trucks slows batching, it is difficult to track, and exposes workers to risk of injury from carrying heavy bags up ladders. In addition to being the superior fiber, UltraFiber 500 offers a solution to these issues with the superior dispenser. 


This Old Dump Truck: Part 1
12/23/2015 by Aaron Szerletich
This year, Solomon Colors got an early Christmas present. A couple weeks ago, a 1927 Chevrolet Series LM Capitol dump truck arrived at the Springfield plant from a barn in Alhambra, Illinois - where the truck had sat untouched for almost two decades.


Better than Carpet; Superior to Tile
12/28/2015 by Aaron Szerletich
Concrete is a viable alternative to many traditional flooring materials such as carpet and tile. This article will give a brief overview of the low-maintenance, cleanly, and affordable concrete options as they compare to linoleum, vinyl tile, natural stone, ceramic, and carpet flooring.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
