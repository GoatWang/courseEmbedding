Dentistry reviews in Rensselaer

        Real People ~ Real Reviews ~ Real Results      




This final stage of fitting the bridge anchored by implants was the last in a sequence of several appointments.  Dr. Provider name locked. has always been accommodating with appt. times, and has explained to me every step of the long process.  He takes the time necessary for a good result.  
My family and I have gone to Dr. Provider name locked. and his wife, Dr. Provider name locked. Walls for 33 years, since the children were small.  The practice is conveniently located for us and the staff are friendly.  Drs. Provider name locked. and Walls are highly trained and competent.  This is thoroughly professional practice with the warmth of old friends.  Their practice is located in an older house.  The interior has been modernized and is clean and inviting.  Dr Provider name locked. no longer works chairside, and Dr. Provider name locked. works only Tues, Weds, and Thurs.  There is a new young partner, Dr. Tropper, who seems personable and competent.  He will provide the continuity and extra appt. times needed by Provider name locked. Family Dentists.
 

            - Barbara I.          




It is rare to find a dentist who is as thorough, knowledgable, caring and patient as Dr. Provider name locked. .
Having a very difficult mouth to correct and treat,  I was most pleased with the outcome.
I greatly appreciated the manner in which he explained all procedures. In addition, he is always
available for emergencies . I can recall him coming to the office on his day off,  with a smile on his face, to treat an issue that 
required immediate attention . His entire  staff is most friendly , efficient, and competent , which makes
going to the dentist a pleasant experience.

Provider name locked. B







 

            - Arleen B.          




The procedure itself appeared to go ok. however in the months that followed it was revealed (by an oral surgeon) that I had sinus infection resulting from the extraction (left side). Provider name locked. had "diagnosed" no sinus infection (by closing the right nostril and to breath out through the left...since no air came out, he said there was no sinus infection. and said that there was now an opening in the gum/tooth root area that he could offer a procedure to repair, by taking gum tissue from another part of the mouth (pallette, I believe, was one choice), which he sketched out on a diagram for me. I was feeling anxious and asked if he could recommend an oral surgeon, which he did. (However, the oral surgeon he recommended was either unavailable to see me (at any time?) or did not want to, for whatever reason.)
long story short: another oral surgeon I consulted said he could not do the gum repair work until the sinus infection was resolved. He referred me to an ENT Dr (Ears, Nose, Throat), who confirmed the sinus infection, and "hole" connecting the oral cavity with the left sinus, caused by the dental extraction.  Surgery in November (Riverside, general anesthetic). 
New Dentist now, evaluated situation, and referred me to a gum doctor/denist in periodontics. Who offered me a procedure to do a graft. and did the best he could with the situation...not able to fully close the gap created, so now while it's better than it was, it requires constant attention to clear out food trapping, etc.
If I had it to do over again, I would not. the Provider name locked. teeth were fairly "high" up, and not in imminent Provider name locked. or threatening the adjacent teeth. Provider name locked. recommended a proactive approach, and I regret my decision to go ahead with his recommendation.  I was 63.5 years old at the time, and one dentist I consulted opined that, at my age, and in these circumstances, would 1) not have gone ahead, and 2) at least go to an oral surgeon to have the work done.
If you need upper Provider name locked. teeth removed, go to an oral surgeon, not a dentist who would like to do this form of oral surgety.
to be fair, Provider name locked. successfully removed my lower Provider name locked. teeth about 10 years prior (approx). and Provider name locked. 's other work is very good. cosmetic repair, etc. is good.
Let's just say that I think I would have been served better by a more conservative approach, vs. the aggressive ("proactive") approach Provider name locked. chose. I'm sure he meant well. but the result, and the offer to do more oral surgery to repair the damage, just scared the heck out of me to consider going any further.
 

            - CLAUDE R G.
