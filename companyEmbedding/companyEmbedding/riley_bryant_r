Eryn Riley joins Bryant volleyball coaching staff








Jul 10, 2017





SMITHFIELD, R.I. – Bryant University head volleyball coach Theresa Garlacy is pleased to announce the addition of Eryn Riley to the coaching staff for the 2017 season.
Riley joins the Bulldogs after spending the last two years working for Gold Medal Squared and Bakersfield Jamba Volleyball Club. She will also be working towards her MBA while at Bryant.
A Bakersfield, Calif., native, Riley taught fundamentals, life lessons and also scouted opponents during her time with Bakersfield Jamba Volleyball. At Gold Medal Squared, Riley worked weeklong, high-level high school camps across the country. She helped organize all facets of the camp and also worked with high school coaches on game management and team building practices.
Riley spent the fall of 2015 at her alma mater, Cal State Bakersfield, as a student assistant coach. She assisted in the organization and execution of practices, maintained and communicated with the program's alumni network, managed game day video and coordinated all facets of travel.
A 2014 graduate of Cal State Bakersfield, Riley was a four-year member of the volleyball team and also competed three years in beach volleyball. As a defensive specialist/libero for the indoor team, she played in 112 matches tallying 488 digs, 47 aces, and 46 assists. Riley helped lead the team to its first Western Athletic Conference Championship after two consecutive trips to the finals and to CSUB's first Division I NCAA tournament berth. As a senior, Riley led the team in aces and was fourth in digs.
Riley earned a bachelor's degree in exercise science in 2015 from Cal State Bakersfield.

                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time.

Bed Bath & Beyond® Credit Card


                                            The Bed Bath & Beyond Mastercard was purchased from US Bank in October 2016. My advice: If you have been with US Bank and made the transition to Comenity - check your credit report. Comenity reports twice and never reports the old account closed, so it looks like you have 2...show more

                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

                                            i love banking with veridian, but the new updated online banking is garbage.10x harder to navigate than before staring from the log in page. Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

I don't have this problem with any of my other credit accounts. Had my account over a year in good standing. Paid it down to zero twice. What a joke!

If the company isn't reporting the account correctly, you can submit a dispute to the credit bureaus asking them to correct it.

If you were a grad victim you don't need to fill out a fraud package. Google it. And send it to the credit bureaus.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related.

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Are there really companies you can pay that guarantee to raise your credit score in 2 months or less or they'll double your money back?

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/21/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.

DALLAS, June 27 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Carreker Corporation (Nasdaq: CANI), a leading provider of technology and consulting solutions for the financial industry, announced today that Bryant R. Riley, the founder and chairman of B. Riley & Co., Inc., has joined the Company's board of directors as of June 26, 2006, filling a vacancy created by the resignation of a Class III director. Mr. Riley is one of Carreker's largest shareholders, holding approximately 9.8% of shares outstanding.
B. Riley & Co., Inc. is a Southern California-based brokerage firm providing research and trading services primarily to institutional investors, and has been maintaining research coverage of Carreker Corporation since January 2006. Founded in 1997, B. Riley & Co. also has offices in San Francisco and New York.

He is chairman of the board of directors of Alliance Semiconductor, Inc, and also serves on the board of directors of Aldila, Inc. Celeritek, Inc., and Mossimo, Inc., each a Nasdaq-listed company.
J. D. (Denny) Carreker, chairman and chief executive of Carreker Corporation said, "Carreker is committed to enhancing the value of the Company for all shareholders. As we pursue our examination of strategic alternatives, we now have two of our largest non-management shareholders represented on the board of directors. Bryant brings the Board significant financial expertise and business experience, particularly in strategic planning and has substantial insight into our Company from the perspective of both an investor and analyst. We look forward to his contribution."
Simultaneously with Mr. Riley's appointment to the Company's board of directors, Mr. Riley and various affiliates entered into a board representation agreement with the Company, a copy of which will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
