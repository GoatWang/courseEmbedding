Zimperium raises $25 mln


June 7, 2016
By Luisa Beltran
 Follow @LuisaRBeltran





Zimperium Inc said June 7 that it closed $25 million in Series C funding led by Warburg Pincus. Existing investors Sierra Ventures, Telstra Ventures and Lazarus Israel Opportunities Fund LLLP also participated. San Francisco-based Zimperium provides a mobile threat management platform. Investors include Samsung.
PRESS RELEASE
Zimperium Closes $25 Million Series C Funding Led By Warburg Pincus
Mobile defense leader will use financing to expand global customer reach
SAN FRANCISCO — June 7, 2015 — Zimperium, Inc., provider of the industry’s first mobile threat management platform to deliver continuous and real-time cyber threat protection for mobile devices and applications, announced today it has closed $25 million in Series C funding. Warburg Pincus, a global private equity firm focused on growth investing, led the round with participation from existing investors Sierra Ventures, Telstra Ventures and Lazarus Israel Opportunities Fund LLLP. Warburg Pincus Managing Directors Cary Davis and Ashutosh Somani will join Zimperium’s board of directors.
 
Zimperium plans to use the funding to expand its global customer reach and mobile partner ecosystem. The funding will also support Zimperium as it continues to add new capabilities to its existing Mobile Threat Protection product suite, which safeguards against advanced known and unknown mobile cyberattacks, as well as develop new products. 





 
“We have been evaluating the mobile threat management industry closely and see significant potential in this large and growing market,” commented Cary Davis, Managing Director in the Technology, Media and Telecommunications group, Warburg Pincus. “As today’s workforce becomes increasingly dependent on mobile devices, enterprises must be prepared for the inevitable mobile-based cyberattack. With its differentiated approach to mobile threat defense and machine learning, Zimperium is uniquely suited to address the challenges its customers face, and to scale across applications and markets.”
 
“2016 has been a year of exceptional growth for our company,” said Shridhar Mittal, Chief Executive Officer of Zimperium. “With this new funding, and our recent integrations and partnerships, Zimperium is equipped to expand our global customer presence and enhance our product development. Unlike traditional security methods, Zimperium is a truly comprehensive platform for managing mobile risk. We stop cyber criminals and eliminate threats before they can damage a business.”
 
Zimperium has a growing number of integrations and partnerships; thus far in 2016, Deutsche Telekom, one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world, SIRIN LABS, a high-end smartphone maker, and SmarTone, a leading wireless communications carrier in Hong Kong, all selected Zimperium’s technology to power their latest security products.
 
“We’re excited to continue to support Zimperium as they pioneer innovative solutions to strengthen enterprise security,” said Mark Fernandes, managing director at Sierra Ventures. “This latest funding is a testament to the company’s global excellence at a time when data security should be top of mind for every executive.” 





 
“With the number of mobile vulnerabilities increasing by the day, it’s important for companies to understand the latest security risks and stay ahead of emerging threats,” said Mark Sherman, managing director of Telstra Ventures. “Zimperium’s top-notch research team, zLabs, is leading the game when it comes to action-oriented research that helps protect the entire mobile security ecosystem.”
 
About Zimperium
Zimperium is a leading enterprise mobile threat protection provider. Only the Zimperium platform delivers continuous and real-time threat protection to both devices and applications. With Zimperium, businesses protect devices and apps against known and unknown cyberattacks from a single platform to boost mobile productivity, while safeguarding employee, customer and company data.
