The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

Incorporated's R&D Chair was developed for the offices of Snap Fort Greene in conjunction with Design NYC. Built from elements purchased at your local hardware store, this DYI chair is easy to assemble and customizable. Special thanks to Meghan Eplett for her help on the graphics.

Silkscreen Storage
With the Silkscreen Storage, Incorporated is exploring simple plywood box shapes with silkscreened with graphics that express the wood grain.











Endless Chair
The Endless chair was developed from the outline of a chair constructed in sheet metal and clad with fabric or felt. Two chair profiles allow for any combination of curves. Because they can be used individually or in groups, they work well for food and beverage establishments. The Endless Chair is currently not in production.

Ladder Shelving
Ladder shelving is an adjustable shelving system based on the painters ladder that could be used for commercial or residential applications.











Box Slot Lighting
Incorporated's Box Slot Light was developed as a lighting solution for the 9/11 Memorial Exhibition. The exhibitions walls needed to be evenly lit in a clean modern way from the ground. The Box Slot was our translation of this idea into a fixture. It can use LED or T5 fluorescent tubes and comes in black, white or walnut finishes.

Folding Spider Table
This radial table can be folded for storage.











Potluck Light
Incorporated’s Potluck lighting extends the investigation of their “Endless Furniture” propositions which explores systemic ordering and modular relationships, offering infinite possibility for the objects ultimate configuration, color and size. Functionally, the Potluck embraces the modern need for flexibility. The light qualities possible in this system include task lighting, up lighting, under-table foot lighting and bounced lighting. Theoretically, it offers a visual metaphor for an open-ended design process. The consumer by selecting the color and configuration desired can share authorship of the object with the designer in the context of the commercial transaction. One can imagine an endless landscape of Potluck lights in ever changing configurations defined by the consumer. The form of Potluck is borrowed from the simple industrial geometries of the pots, pans and bake forms found in commercial kitchens.
















Zerforated Chair
















Man Ray Award
After many successful collaborations with The Jewish Museum in Manhattan, Incorporated was asked to design the first in a series of Man Ray awards recognizing persons who contribute to the arts. This years winner was Cindy Sherman. Because the award was related to Man Ray, Incorporated used his art as the starting point; specifically his use of perception of form. The concept was to create a shadow of an award that could also be used as a bookend.





















Endless Storage


























Branch Table
A tree grows in Beta. The Incorporated Branch Table explores systems of branching and random order to create a side table of unique design. Mimicking the geometry of a tree, the Branch Table was developed in collaboration with Guy Snover from the Stevens Institute of Technology, the oldest engineering school in the United States. The Branch Table utilizes a computer algorithm to grow one of kind branching objects, each one unique. These unique branch structures are then fabricated in this case using stereolithography 3D printing technologies. Each Branch Table is just one iteration of endless random geometric possibilities.

Hex Chair & Ottoman
Incorporated’s Hex Ottoman extends the Hex series into the realm of upholstered goods. The series originated with the Hex table which explores systemic ordering and modular relationships, offering infinite possibility for the table’s ultimate configuration and size. Functionally, the Hex Ottoman embraces the modern need for flexibility. Theoretically, it offers a visual metaphor for the design process – the suggestion of an open-ended repetition that counters the conventional architectural fascination with a teleological development from idea to conception. One can imagine an endless landscape of Hex furnishings in ever changing configurations. On one hand, the form of the Hex Ottoman is indebted to the timeless geometry of nature, a foundation for architectural principles. On the other hand, it enters the historic discourse of American minimalism.

Functionally, the table embraces the modern need for flexibility. Theoretically, it offers a visual metaphor for the design process – the suggestion of an open-ended repetition that counters the conventional architectural fascination with a teleological development from idea to conception. The design also explores the relationship of surface to space; its steel material combines utility and ornament, albeit in a subtle, modernist guise. On one hand, the form of the Hex Table is indebted to the timeless geometry of nature, a foundation for architectural principles. On the other hand, it enters the historic discourse of American minimalism, in which the relationships between parts and the phenomenology of form was paramount.

						Support & Service					



						Budget-Friendly					





A Better World through You You believe in your mission, and you work very hard to see that mission come to fruition. We believe that it is our job to work just as hard to help you achieve it. Every day, we make it our mission to be right beside you helping you become more effective through better donor management practices. Our company is built on the belief that nonprofits are working for a better world, and we are working to achieve a better world through you. When you become a FundRaiser Customer, you become part of the FundRaiser Family. Meet the FundRaiser Family 


Right Beside YouSimply stated, we've been doing this for a long time (since 1983!), and we'll be here for a long time to come. Our small company provides donor management software that is used by more than 5,000 nonprofits worldwide, and that means that we have a very strong commitment to staying in the game. We believe that we are helping the world through you, and we look forward to doing so for many more decades. FundRaiser History 


Real Customer Service
Part of our mission is to provide excellence in  service, and we are passionate about our mission. We believe that we must all work for a better world, and our part in it is to support you and your mission. We do that by pledging to be right beside you every step of the way with the best customer service you have ever experienced. Our customers use words like "refreshing", "informative", "patient", "unparalleled" and "tremendous" when they talk about the support they receive from us - but we think that providing the best service we can is our responsibility, so we just call it real customer service. Don't take our word for it, though: take a look at what our customers say about our support & service by checking out our Testimonials.



Affordable for all NonprofitsOrganizations of all types and sizes use FundRaiser, but our target customers are small, mid-sized, and growing organizations, so we work very hard to keep our software both powerful and affordable. All three of our programs can be purchased or leased, and we offer the most flexible interest-free payment plans in the industry. With our low prices and built-in growth path, FundRaiser Software is the ideal choice for organizations that are looking for an affordable option that will grow with them.

Latest Features
For most of Blackbaud NetCommunity’s seven-year history, we’ve spent our energy and expertise perfecting the world’s richest integration between a platform and fundraising database. In our latest release, we’ve thought outside the box to bring you exciting new audience-facing features that will make your website an even more effective marketing and communications tool.
Friendly URLs


Friendly web addresses (“URLs”) are much easier to remember for your supporters, and also help search engines like Google® to index your site. With 40% of web traffic driven by search engines, NetCommunity now makes it easier for you to create friendly URLs and perform search engine optimisation (SEO) on your website and web pages. You now have the ability to view and edit existing URLs on your site, making them easier to recognise and enhancing your search engine rankings.

Bulk Asset Management


Improved usability of the content management system within the site explorer now allows you to filter content based on folders. The bulk asset management utility drastically reduces the amount of time it takes you to move multiple parts from one folder to another, resulting in easier management of your websites’ files, images, and web parts. Additionally, the email lists management tools are now more consistent with the site explorer, with new folder and search tabs.

Enhanced Email Notification Tools


Email notifications are available for events, memberships, donations, and form builder submissions. Now, whenever a supporter completes any of these online forms, select members of your staff will receive an email outlining the transaction details. Regardless of whether you access NetCommunity daily or rarely, your staff members can now keep track of online activity instantly through email!

Faster Email Logging and Processing

Improved email reliability and deliverability means a significant and immediate improvement in the time needed to process and send email jobs. The email delivery status report has also been enhanced to include additional diagnostic details through each step of the process — alerting users to a clear next action in the event of an error.

New Merge Fields for Event Information

New merge fields allow you to include additional event details, which are available in the acknowledgement email, confirmation screen, and notification email.
