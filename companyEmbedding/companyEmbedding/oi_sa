OI LINE: ABSOLUTE BEAUTY FOR ALL HAIR TYPES the extension to Davines’ OI Essential Haircare line Discover OI MILK features 
The OI Essential Haircare line has now been enhanced by 3 new products in line with the bestselling OI/OIL, new representations of a formulation philosophy that combines concrete solutions for all needs with a concept of beauty treatment that the cosmetic industry has so far reserved for skincare.

Hence the challenge: OI/OIL, a refined multi-purpose oil launched by Davines in 2011 that is a perfect synthesis of treatment and styling, whose success led to the creation of the revolutionary OI/All in One Milk, the initiator of a new type of multi-purpose product, and the pair OI/Shampoo and OI/Conditioner, special complementary products that share the same origin, style and formulation concept as OI/OIL. The results warrant the definition of “absolute beauty products”.
The properties of the products in the OI family are also linked to Roucou Oil, originally from the Amazon, which has a restructuring action on the hair. This is joined by a selection of special ingredients in a formula that is ideal for obtaining results that are immediate and evident, and can be enhanced by using with other OI specialities. Roucou Oil is abounding in beta-carotene with antioxidant and restructuring properties, and in ellagic acid with its free radical-neutralizing action.
From concept to results the OI line shares an inimitable approach underlined by the elegance of its style. In packaging that plays with the intensity of black and transparency; and in terms of ethics, including the line in the Zero Impact LifeGate project, common to the entire Essential Haircare line.

Where applicable, a project is considered as such until the end of construction and ramp-up to full capacity (with the exception of mining projects, where the date of commissioning signifies the end of the project). Projects must have a:  a) Start date b) Estimate for completion c) Initial investment estimate  Data For state-owned projects, initial information about the start date and estimates for completion and investment are taken from original signed contracts, along with addendums and annexes. If original contracts cannot be obtained, information is taken from public documents, presentations, news articles from BNamericas archives, and external sources. In cases where contracts are subject to approval by legislators, the start date is the date of the law or legislative approval. In the case of private projects, information is taken from public sources, such as stock exchange filings, annual reports, company presentations, third party research and press releases. In judging the timing of investment decisions for private projects, great care was taken to differentiate between large projects receiving environmental approval and proceeding directly to construction, and smaller projects where the investment decision hinges on securing financing. Best care is taken to ensure that recorded data is correct at the time of entry and that each entry is backed with a relevant source. The greatest care possible was taken to ensure consistency of information in order make a like-for-like comparison in project costs. Insofar as the figures rely on disclosure by the organization or company responsible, the figures can be considered to be conservative in nature. No attempt was made to adjust figures for inflation during the course of research or for consideration of the time value of money. Validation In the case of state-owned projects, validation is carried out where possible with either a member of the consortium, EPC contractor, a relevant state agency or advisors to either party. Currency Projects costs are measured in US dollars. Where project costs are measured in a local currency, amounts are converted to US dollars at the date of the relevant announcement, signature or report.  Severity of deviation from original estimates The severity of deviation from original estimates is defined according to set criteria. Timing    Status Condition     Ahead of time 95% of original estimate or below (measured in months)   On time 95% to 105% of original estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original estimate   Medium changes 120% to 160% of original estimate   Major changes Over 160% of original estimate    Budget    Status Condition     Ahead of budget 95% of original budget estimate or below   To budget 95% to 105% of original budget estimate   Minor changes 105% to 120% of original budget estimate   Medium changes 120% to 140% of original budget estimate   Major changes Over 140% of original budget estimate    Changes in Scope Changes in scope beyond the start date are not accounted for. Language definitions Where guidance is non-specific as to dates for completion, the following is used. Project to be completed by 2018 = December 31, 2017 Project to be completed in 2018 = December 31, 2018
