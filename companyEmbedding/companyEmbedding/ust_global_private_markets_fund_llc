ITEM 8.
GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT.  Description of the
Company  UST Global Private Markets Fund, LLC (the Company or the Registrant) is a limited liability company
organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on February 2, 2007 and is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), as a closed-end non-diversified management investment company. The Company
will offer and sell units of limited liability company interests in the Company (the Units or Interests) in minimum denominations of $50,000 to accredited investors and qualified clients. (See
Item 10.1). The Company is seeking capital commitments (the Commitments) from potential investors (an Investor). The minimum offering size is $60 million. Bank of America Capital Advisors LLC (the Investment
Adviser) serves as the investment adviser of the Company. U.S. Trust Hedge Fund Management, Inc. or an affiliate, will serve as the special member (the Special Member) of the Company. Investors who purchase Interests will be
admitted to the Company by the Investment Adviser and will become members of the Company (the Members).  The Company is
seeking Commitments from Investors. The minimum Commitment in the Company is $50,000, although the Board reserves the right to accept Commitments of lesser amounts in its discretion.  The Company has not yet identified all of the potential investments that it will make with the Commitments. The Investors full Commitment will not
be immediately invested. The Company will invest in Portfolio Funds as Commitments are drawn. The Company may not draw on the full Commitment. Any amounts drawn (except for cash reserved to cover Company expenses) will be invested within six (6)
months of the drawdown date (such investments may take the form of a binding legal commitment).  Investors understand that by agreeing to
invest in the Company, each is making an irrevocable commitment to the Company of the entire amount of the Commitment, which will be drawn down over time. Even though not all the money will be requested immediately, if there is a capital call
Investors are committing to make funds available within the time designated. Investors should understand that if a capital call is received, they will have to either immediately transfer additional funds to their account at Bank of America
Corporation (Bank of America) or immediately direct Bank of America to liquidate investments in their account and to transfer them to the Company 
  
A-2 



to honor the Commitment. Investors understand that if they close their account at Bank of America, the total amount of any outstanding Commitments will be
immediately due and payable.  Investment Objective  The investment objective of the Company is long-term capital appreciation. Neither the Company nor the Investment Adviser guarantees any level of return or risk on investments and there can be no assurance that the
investment objective will be achieved. However, it is the expectation that the Company will generate a total return over the life of the Company that will exceed the return of the global public equities market and compensate the Investor for the
additional risk taken by investing in Portfolio Funds.  Investment Philosophy  The Investment Adviser is guided by a set of principles that it believes is essential to make successful private equity investments. They are outlined as
follows:   


 
1.
Developing a private equity allocation is a long-term process that requires an investor to continuously and selectively commit capital to private equity investments.
  


 
2.
Building successful private equity portfolios requires skillful management of risks associated with portfolio cash flows, manager selection and concentrations among strategies,
vintage years Portfolio Funds, fund sponsors, geographies and industries.   


 
3.
Attractive private equity returns are generated by investing in funds managed by professionals with demonstrated track record of success across multiple market, industry, technology
and innovation cycles.   


 
4.
Investors are better served by investing in Portfolio Funds that exhibit a strong alignment of interest with their investors as expressed in the terms of the Portfolio Funds
limited partnership agreement and the manner in which the fund sponsor manages its organization.   


 
5.
Given the long-term illiquid nature of private equity investing, investors should have a strong appreciation for the potential risk presented by each Portfolio Fund investment.
  


 
6.
A value orientation should be maintained when allocating among private equity strategies and selecting Portfolio Funds.  Investment Strategy  The Company will seek to achieve
its objective by pursuing a strategy of committing at least 80% of Commitments in Portfolio Funds.  Private equity funds may include
Portfolio Funds pursuing investment strategies in buyouts, venture capital and special situations (distressed debt, mezzanine, secondaries, natural resources, opportunistic real estate, royalties and other private equity strategies perceived to be
attractive by the Investment Adviser). Such funds often have a focus on one or more industry, country, region or investment-related themes. Such funds seek to generate returns primarily through long-term capital appreciation; however at times some
Portfolio Funds may generate some current income and short-term capital appreciation.  The Company will seek to identify six to fifteen
Portfolio Funds within eighteen months of the Companys final closing. The Company will leverage the relationships established by the Investment Adviser among private equity fund sponsors to gain access to attractive Portfolio Funds. The
Investment Adviser will employ a proactive, disciplined and diligent investment process by which prospective Portfolio Funds will be sourced, reviewed and selected.  The Company will seek to tactically over-weight or under-weight its allocation to the various private equity strategies perceived by the Investment Adviser to be more or less attractive from an expected risk and
return perspective. Tactical allocations are influenced by a value-oriented perspective with regards to capital flows within a private equity strategy, valuations for new investments to be made by Portfolio Funds, risk within transaction structures,
expectations for change within a strategy over the near-term and perceived attractiveness for a private equity strategy. The exposures to specific private equity strategies will also be influenced by the Investment 
  
A-3 



Advisers ability to gain access to top-tier fund sponsors in a specific strategy. Although, the Investment Adviser may target specific strategies,
regions or industries for investment, the Investment Adviser will not compromise on the caliber of the fund sponsors pursued for investment in order to make an allocation to a targeted strategy. The chart below(1) presents the expected private equity strategy allocations for the Company in the current market environment relative to the long-term capital flows in private equity.

(1)
There can be no assurance that the positions created by the Portfolio Funds selected for the Company will create a portfolio with the allocations described above. The Investment
Adviser does not control and does not have influence on the investment activity of the fund sponsors investing the capital of the Portfolio Funds. The Investment Advisers expected allocations to each Portfolio Fund will be guided by the
historical investment activity and the expected investment activity as articulated by the fund sponsors in the offering memoranda and accompanying due diligence information for their respective Portfolio Funds.  Investment Policies and Restrictions  The Company has
adopted certain fundamental investment restrictions, which cannot be changed without the vote of a majority of the Companys outstanding voting securities (as defined by the 1940 Act). The Companys fundamental investment restrictions are
as follows:   


 
1.
The Company will not invest 25% or more of the value of its total assets in the securities (other than U.S. Government Securities) of issuers engaged in any single industry. (This
restriction does not apply to the Companys investments in Portfolio Funds.)   


 
2.
The Company will not issue senior securities representing stock, except that, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, (a) the Company may borrow money from banks, brokers and
other lenders, to finance portfolio transactions and engage in other transactions involving the issuance by the Company of senior securities representing indebtedness, and (b) the Company may borrow money from banks for temporary or
emergency purposes.   
A-4 




 
3.
The Company will not underwrite securities of other issuers, except insofar as the Company may be deemed an underwriter under the Securities Act in connection with the disposition
of its portfolio securities.   


 
4.
The Company will not make loans of money or securities to other persons, except through purchasing fixed-income securities, lending portfolio securities or entering into repurchase
agreements in a manner consistent with the Companys investment policies.   


 
5.
The Company will not purchase or sell commodities or commodity contracts, except that it may purchase and sell foreign currency, options, futures and forward contracts, including
those related to indexes, and options on indices, and may invest in commodity pools and other entities that purchase and sell commodities and commodity contracts.   


 
6.
The Company will not purchase, hold or deal in real estate, except that it may invest in securities that are secured by real estate or that are issued by companies that invest or
deal in real estate.  The investment objective of the Company is also fundamental and may not be changed without a vote of a
majority of the Companys outstanding voting securities.  Under the 1940 Act, the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting
securities of an investment company, such as the Company, means the vote, at an annual or a special meeting of the security holders of the Company duly called, (A) of 67% or more of the voting securities present at the meeting, if the holders
of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Company are present or represented by proxy or (B) of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Company, whichever is less.  With respect to these investment restrictions, and other policies described in this Registration Statement, the Company will not look through the
Portfolio Funds. In addition, if a percentage restriction is adhered to at the time of an investment or transaction, a later change in percentage resulting from a change in the values of investments or the value of the Companys total assets,
unless otherwise stated, will not constitute a violation of such restriction or policy.  The Company may engage in borrowing to cover
Company expenses, to bridge capital contributions, cover Investor defaults or to make future capital contributions to Portfolio Funds. The Company may borrow from an affiliate, subject to regulatory approvals, or third-party, pursuant to
a credit facility. The Company may borrow in advance of a closing with Investors to permit making initial capital contributions to a Portfolio Fund or a later date to fulfill ongoing commitments. Thus, the Company may be significantly leveraged
prior to closing or thereafter. Drawdowns from Investors or distributions from Portfolio Funds may be used to fulfill obligations (including, but not limited to, the payment of any interest due) under any credit facility. In the event the Company
does not have sufficient commitments to pay its borrowings in full, it is possible that it would default on its borrowing or its commitments to a Portfolio Fund or Portfolio Funds, and unless another source of funds is obtained, Investors in the
Company could be adversely affected. In addition, private equity acquisitions by Portfolio Funds will generally include significant leverage at the portfolio company level. Such leverage can increase the return on an investment, but it also creates
additional risk because, in the event that decreases in value cause the investment to be worth less than the amount borrowed, the investment can be lost. However, there is no guarantee that the Company will borrow or that a credit facility will be
available for the Company.  The 1940 Act requires a registered investment company to satisfy an asset coverage requirement of 300% if
its indebtedness, including amounts borrowed, measured at the time the investment company incurs the indebtedness (the Asset Coverage Requirement). This requirement means that the value of the investment companys total indebtedness
may not exceed one-third the value of its total assets (including the indebtedness). In addition, the Investment Adviser, may, at its discretion, exclude a defaulting Investor from future capital calls.  Risk Factors  In
considering participation in the Company, the prospective Investors should be aware of certain risk factors, which include the following:   


 
1.
Business and Market Risks  The Companys investment
portfolio will consist of Portfolio Funds which will hold securities issued primarily by privately held companies, and operating results for the portfolio companies in a specified period will be difficult to predict. Such investments involve a high
degree of business and financial risk that can result in substantial losses.   
A-5 


Buyout Funds. Buyout transactions may result in new enterprises that are subject to
extreme volatility, require time for maturity and may require additional capital. In addition, they frequently rely on borrowing significant amounts of capital, which can increase profit potential but at the same time increase the risk of loss.
Leveraged companies may be subject to restrictive financial and operating covenants. The leverage may impair the ability of these companies to finance their future operations and capital needs. Also, their flexibility to respond to changing business
and economic conditions and to business opportunities may be limited. A leveraged companys income and net assets will tend to increase or decrease at a greater rate than if borrowed money was not used. Although these investments may offer the
opportunity for significant gains, such buyout investments involve a high degree of business and financial risk that can result in substantial losses, which risks generally are greater than the risks of investing in public companies that may not be
as leveraged.  Venture Funds. Venture capital funds primarily invest in private companies that have limited operating
history, are attempting to develop or commercialize unproven technologies or to implement novel business plans or are not otherwise developed sufficiently to be self-sustaining financially or to become public. Although these investments may offer
the opportunity for significant gains, such investments involve a high degree of business and financial risk that can result in substantial losses, which risks generally are greater than the risks of investing in public companies that may be at a
later stage of development.   


 
2.
Lack of Operating History  The Company is a newly formed
entity and has no operating history upon which prospective Investors can evaluate its performance. The investment program of the Company should be evaluated on the basis that there can be no assurance that the Investment Advisers assessment of
the short-term or long-term prospects of investments will prove accurate or that the Company will achieve its investment objectives. Past performance of the managers of the Portfolio Funds is no indication of future performance.   


 
3.
Dependence on the Investment Adviser.  The success of the
Company is significantly dependent upon the ability of the Investment Adviser to achieve the Companys investment objectives. The performance of the Investment Advisers prior investments is not necessarily indicative of the Companys
future results.   


 
4.
Investment in Junior Securities  The securities in which
each Portfolio Fund will invest may be among the most junior in a portfolio companys capital structure and, thus, subject to the greatest risk of loss. Generally, there will be no collateral to protect an investment once made.   


 
5.
Leveraged Investments  A Portfolio Funds
investments, depending upon its strategy, may be in companies whose capital structures are highly leveraged. Such investments involve a high degree of risk in that adverse fluctuations in the cash flow of such companies, or increased interest rates,
may impair their ability to meet their obligations, which may accelerate and magnify declines in the value of any such portfolio company investments in a down market.   


 
6.
Limited Transferability of Interests  There will be no
public market for the Interests, and none is expected to develop. There are substantial restrictions upon the transferability of Interests under the Limited Liability Company Agreement of the Registrant (the Company Agreement) and
applicable securities laws.   


 
7.
Diversification of Investments  The Company is a
non-diversified investment company. Thus, there are no percentage limitations imposed by the 1940 Act on the percentage of the Companys assets that may be invested in the securities of any one issuer. However, the Company generally
will not commit more than 20% of the value of its total Commitments (measured at the time of commitment) in the securities of a single Portfolio Fund. The Investment Adviser believes that this approach helps to reduce overall investment risk.
  
A-6 




 
8.
Concentration of Portfolio Fund Investments  Each
Portfolio Fund will participate in a limited number of investments and may seek to make several investments in one industry or one industry segment. As a result, each Portfolio Funds investment portfolio could become highly concentrated, and
the performance of a few holdings may substantially affect its aggregate return. Furthermore, to the extent that the capital raised is less than the targeted amount, a Portfolio Fund may invest in fewer portfolio companies and thus be less
diversified.   


 
9.
Illiquidity; Lack of Current Distributions  An investment
in the Company is illiquid. In addition, the Company will acquire privately offered interests in Portfolio Funds. Transfers of interests and withdrawals, within Portfolio Funds, will be severely restricted. It is uncertain as to when profits, if
any, will be realized. Losses on unsuccessful investments may be realized before gains on successful investments are realized. The return of capital and the realization of gains, if any, generally will occur only upon the partial or complete
disposition of an underlying investment by a Portfolio Fund. While an investment may be sold at any time, it is not generally expected that this will occur for a number of years after the initial investment. Before such time, there may be no current
return on the investment.  Due to the pattern of cash flows in private equity funds and the illiquid nature of their investments, Investors
typically will see negative returns in the Companys early stages; in particular it can take several years for Portfolio Fund investments to be realized during which time management fees will be continued to be drawn from committed capital and
certain underperforming investments may be written down or written off. Then as investments are able to realize liquidity events, such as a sale or initial public offering, positive returns will be realized if the Portfolio Fund is successful in
achieving its investment strategy.   


 
10.
Absence of Regulatory Oversight  The Portfolio Funds will
not be registered as investment companies under the 1940 Act and the Company, as an investor in these Portfolio Funds, will not have the benefit of the protection afforded by the 1940 Act to investors in registered investment companies (which, among
other protections, require investment companies to have a majority of disinterested directors, require securities held in custody at all times to be individually segregated from the securities of any other person and marked to clearly identify such
securities as the property of such investment company, and regulate the relationship between the adviser and the investment company).   


 
11.
Tax Laws Subject to Change  It is possible that the
current federal, state, local, or foreign income tax treatment accorded an investment in the Company will be modified by legislative, administrative, or judicial action in the future. The nature of additional changes in federal or non-U.S. income
tax law, if any, cannot be determined prior to enactment of any new tax legislation. However, such legislation could significantly alter the tax consequences and decrease the after tax rate of return of an investment in the Company. Potential
Investors therefore should seek, and must rely on, the advice of their own tax advisers with respect to the possible impact on their investments of recent legislation, as well as any future proposed tax legislation or administrative or judicial
action.   


 
12.
In-Kind Distributions  Portfolio Funds may make in-kind
distributions to the Company, and, particularly in the event of a dissolution of a Portfolio Fund such distribution, may contain securities which are not marketable. While the general policy of the Company will be to liquidate such investment and
distribute proceeds to the Members, under certain circumstances when deemed appropriate by the Board, a Member may receive in-kind distributions from the Company.   


 
13.
Projections  Projected operating results of a company in
which a Portfolio Fund invests normally will be based primarily on financial projections prepared by each companys management. In all cases, projections are only estimates of future results that are based upon information received from the
company and assumptions made at the time the projections are developed. There can be no assurance that the results are set forth in the projections will be attained, and actual results may be significantly different from the projections. Also,
general economic factors, which are not predictable, can have a material effect on the reliability of projections.   
A-7 




 
14.
Carried Interest  The carried interest held by the Special
Member or equivalent of a Portfolio Fund may create an incentive for the Investment Adviser to make high risk portfolio investments in hope of achieving a larger return for the holder of the carried interest.   


 
15.
Need for Follow-On Investments  Following its initial
investment in a given portfolio company, a Portfolio Fund may decide to provide additional funds to such portfolio company or may have the opportunity to increase its investment in a successful portfolio company. There is no assurance that a
Portfolio Fund will make follow-on investments or that a Portfolio Fund will have sufficient funds to make all or any of such investments. Any decision by a Portfolio Fund not to make follow-on investments or its inability to make such investments
(i) may have a subsequent negative effect on a portfolio company in need of such an investment, (ii) result in a lost opportunity for a Portfolio Fund to increase its participation in a successful operation, or (iii) result in a loss of certain
anti-dilution protection.   


 
16.
Non-U.S. Investments  The Company may invest in a
Portfolio Fund that is organized outside of the United States or a Portfolio Fund may invest in portfolio companies that are organized or have substantial sales or operations outside of the United States. Such investments may be subject to certain
additional risk, due to, among other things, potentially unsettled points of applicable governing law, the risks associated with fluctuating currency exchange rates, capital repatriation regulations, the application of complex U.S. and foreign tax
rules to cross-border investments and imposition of foreign taxes on the Company and/or the Members.   


 
17.
Independent Counsel  No independent counsel has been
retained to represent the interests of the Members. Neither the Memorandum nor the Company Agreement has been reviewed by any attorney on behalf of the Members. Legal counsel to the Company and Investment Adviser does not represent any Member.
  


 
18.
Increased Regulatory Scrutiny  In the environment
following the events of September 11, 2001, the Company and the Investment Adviser expect increased scrutiny by government regulators, investigators, auditors and law enforcement officials regarding the identities and sources of funds of investors
in private investment funds. In that connection, in the future the Company may become subject to additional obligations, such as reporting requirements regarding its investors, including, without limitation, such requirements and restrictions as may
apply under the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the Patriot Act). Each Member will be required to provide to the Company such information as may
be required to enable the Company to comply with all applicable legal or regulatory requirements, including, without limitation, the requirements of the Patriot Act (and/or all rules and regulations related thereto), and each Member will be required
to acknowledge and agree that the Company may disclose such information to governmental and/or regulatory or self-regulatory authorities to the extent required by applicable law or regulation and may file such reports with such authorities as may be
required by applicable law or regulation. If required by applicable law, regulation or interpretation thereof, the Company may suspend all activity with respect to a Members account with the Company, including suspending the Members
right to redeem funds or assets from the Company pending the Companys receipt of instructions regarding the Members account from the appropriate governmental or regulatory authority.   


 
19.
Private Offering Exemption  This offering has not been
registered under the Securities Act, in reliance on the exemptive provisions of Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D promulgated thereunder. Section 18(b)(4)(D) of the Securities Act, added by the National Securities Markets
Improvement Act of 1996, preempts state registration of transactions in securities exempt pursuant to rules and regulations issued by the SEC under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. Preemption therefore applies to transactions exempt
under Regulation D, but not to transactions exempt under Section 4(2) alone. Because of the lack of uniformity among the states securities laws and their general complicated nature, the Company has chosen not to incur the expense and burden of
reviewing exemptions under each states laws, but rather rely on the uniform exemption provided by Regulation D.  No assurance can be
given that the offering currently qualifies or will continue to qualify under the exemptive provisions of Regulation D because of, among other things, the adequacy of disclosure and the manner of distribution, the timeliness of filings, the
existence of similar offerings in the past or in the future, or the retroactive change of any securities law or regulation. If the Regulation D exemption is lost, the Company may not be able to avail itself of other state exemptions and successful
claims or suits for rescission may be brought and successfully concluded for failure to register these offerings or for acts or omissions constituting offenses under the Exchange Act, or applicable state securities laws.   
A-8 




 
20.
Manager Liability  In certain circumstances each Portfolio
Fund is expected to receive the right to appoint a representative to the board of directors of the companies in which it invests. Serving on the board of directors of a portfolio company exposes the Portfolio Funds representatives, and
ultimately the Portfolio Fund, to potential liability. Although portfolio companies often have insurance to protect directors and officers from such liability, not all portfolio companies may obtain such insurance, which may be insufficient if
obtained.   


 
21.
Public Company Holdings  A Portfolio Funds
investment portfolio may contain securities issued by publicly held companies. Such investments may subject the Portfolio Fund to risks that differ in type or degree from those involved with investments in privately held companies. Such risks
include, without limitation, greater volatility in the valuation of such companies, increased obligations to disclose information regarding such companies, limitations on the ability of the Portfolio Fund to dispose of such securities at certain
times, increased likelihood of shareholder litigation against such companies board members, and increased costs associated with each of the aforementioned risks.   


 
22.
Delayed Schedule K-1s  The Company will not be able to
provide final Schedule K-1s to Members for any given fiscal year until after April 15 of the following year. Investors should be prepared for a substantial delay in receiving final Schedule K-1s. The final Schedule K-1s will not be available until
the Company has received tax-reporting information from its Portfolio Funds necessary to prepare final Schedule K-1s. Members will likely be required to obtain extensions of the filing dates for their U.S. federal, state, and local income tax
returns. Members will be responsible for any and all costs and fees incurred by them in connection with obtaining the tax extensions. Each prospective Investor should consult with its own adviser as to the advisability and tax consequences of an
investment in the Company. Portfolio Funds and their portfolio companies may engage in business, otherwise derive income from, and in general be subject to taxing authority in numerous state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. Members, by virtue of
their participation in the Company, may be subject to tax payment and reporting obligations in such jurisdictions under their widely varying rules and regulations. Each Investor should consult an independent adviser regarding how an investment in
the Company may affect his, her, or its state, local, and foreign tax payment and reporting obligations.   


 
23.
Risks of Private Equity Investments Generally  The
investments made by the Portfolio Funds will entail a high degree of risk and in most cases be highly illiquid and difficult to value. Unless and until those investments are sold or mature into marketable securities they will remain illiquid. In
addition to the extent a Portfolio Fund focuses on venture capital investments the companies in which the Portfolio Fund will invest may be in a conceptual or early stage of development, may not have a proven operating history, may offer services or
products that are not yet developed or ready to be marketed or that have no established market, may be operating at a loss or have significant fluctuations in operating results, may be engaged in a rapidly changing business, may require substantial
additional capital to support their operations to finance expansion or to maintain their competitive position, or otherwise may have a weak financial condition. As a general matter, companies in which the Portfolio Fund invests may face intense
competition, including competition from companies with far greater financial resources; more extensive research, development, technological, marketing and other capabilities; and a larger number of qualified managerial and technical personnel.
 The Company will not obtain or seek to obtain any control over the management of any portfolio company in which any Portfolio Fund may
invest. The success of each investment made by a Portfolio Fund will largely depend on the ability and success of the management of the portfolio companies in addition to economic and market factors.   
A-9 




 
24.
Capital Contributions  The Company has not yet identified
all of the potential investments that it will make with the Commitments. The Investors full Commitment will not be immediately invested. The Company will invest in Portfolio Funds as Commitments are drawn (within 6 months of any drawdown). It
may take a significant amount of time to fully draw down and invest the committed amounts (approximately 4 years). The Companys performance will only include the Commitments that have been drawn-down, thus an Investors individual
performance may be lower than the performance of the Company.   


 
25.
Default  The Company will not always contribute the full
amount of its commitment to a Portfolio Fund at the time of its admission to the Portfolio Fund. Instead, the Company will be required to make incremental contributions pursuant to capital calls issued from time to time, by the Portfolio Fund. If
the Company defaults on its commitment or fails to satisfy capital calls in a timely manner then, generally, it will be subject to significant penalties, including the complete forfeiture of the Companys investment in the Portfolio Fund. Any
failure by the Company to make timely capital contributions in respect of its commitments may (i) impair the ability of the Company to pursue its investment program, (ii) force the Company to borrow, (iii) cause the Company, and, indirectly, the
Investors to be subject to certain penalties from the Portfolio Funds (including the complete forfeiture of the Companys investment in a Portfolio Fund), or (iv) otherwise impair the value of the Companys investments (including the
complete devaluation of the Company).  Similarly, Investors will not contribute the full amount of their Commitments to the Company at the
time of their admission. Investors will be required to make incremental contributions pursuant to capital calls issued from time to time, by the Company. Unlike the Portfolio Funds, the Company will have limited recourse in retrieving un-drawn
Commitments in the instance that an Investor defaults on a Commitment. An Investor, or Investors, that default(s) on his/her/its/their Commitment to the Company may cause the Company to, in-turn, default on its commitment to a Portfolio Fund. Thus
the Company, and especially the non-defaulting Investors, will bear the penalties of such default (as outlined above, including, but not limited to, the complete forfeiture of the Companys investment in a Portfolio Fund and the complete
devaluation of the Company). While the Investment Adviser has taken steps to mitigate this risk, including seeking Commitments from Investors that exceed the commitments that are made to the Portfolio Funds, there is no guarantee that such measures
will be sufficient or successful.   


 
26.
Recall of Distributions  The Company may be subject to
terms of the Portfolio Funds which permit the recall of distributions to meet Company obligations. In the event funds are recalled for this purpose, the Company may in turn require Members to return amounts previously distributed to them.
  


 
27.
Limited Investment Opportunities  In sourcing investment
opportunities, the Company will leverage the relationships established by the Investment Adviser and its affiliates among private equity fund sponsors to gain access to attractive Portfolio Funds. However, as a registered investment company, the
Company will be required to make certain public disclosures and regulatory filings regarding the Companys operations, financial status, portfolio holdings, etc. While these filings are designed to enhance investor protections, private equity
fund sponsors may view such filings as contrary to their business interests and deny access to the Company; but may permit other, non-registered funds or accounts, managed by the Investment Adviser or its affiliates, to invest. As a result, the
Company may not be invested in certain private equity funds that are held by other unregistered funds or accounts managed by the Investment adviser or its affiliates, even though those private equity funds are consistent with the Companys
investment objective. In addition, certain provisions of the 1940 Act prohibit the Company from engaging in transactions with the Investment Adviser; however; unregistered funds also managed by the Investment Adviser are not prohibited from the same
transactions. As a result, the Company, due to its status as a registered investment company, may be ineligible to participate in certain opportunities that will be available to unregistered investment companies advised by the Investment Adviser.
  
A-10 




 
28.
Competition for Investment Opportunities  Many
institutional investors, including other fund of funds entities, may seek to invest in many of the same underlying funds in which the Company may also seek to invest. Some of those underlying funds may limit the number of investors and the amount of
capital they raise, which may limit or eliminate the ability of the Company to invest in those underlying funds.  In addition, numerous
investors will be competing with the Portfolio Funds for desirable investment opportunities. Because of this competition, the Portfolio Funds might not be able to participate in attractive investments that would otherwise be available to them. In
addition, competition for investments may also increase the pre-money value of prospective portfolio companies, which may adversely affect investment returns.   


 
29.
Economic Conditions  Changes in economic conditions,
including, for example, interest rates, inflation rates, industry conditions, competition, technological developments, trade relationships, political and diplomatic events and trends, tax laws and innumerable other factors, can substantially and
adversely affect the business and prospects of the Portfolio Funds and the Company. These conditions are not within the control of the Investment Adviser or the sponsors of the portfolio Funds.   


 
30.
Portfolio Company Risks  Portfolio companies in which the
Portfolio Funds invest will be subject to the risk that a proposed service or product cannot be developed successfully with the resources available to the enterprise. There can be no assurance that the development efforts of any portfolio company
will be successful or, if successful, will be completed within the budget or time originally estimated. Additional funds may be necessary to complete such development, to achieve market acceptance, to support expansion or to achieve or maintain
competitive positions. The portfolio companies may not be able to obtain such funds on favorable terms, or at all.  Many of the portfolio
companies of a Portfolio Fund may operate at a loss or with highly erratic operating results. Such companies may face intense competition, including competition from companies with much greater financial resources, much more extensive development,
production, marketing and service capabilities and a much larger number of qualified managerial and technical personnel. The Investment Adviser anticipates that the Company (through the Portfolio Funds) will be making significant investments in
companies in a number of sectors, some of which are rapidly changing, and such companies may face increased risks of product or service obsolescence. There can be no assurance that any particular portfolio company will succeed.   


 
31.
Currency Risks.  The Companys investments that are
denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are subject to the risk that the value of the particular currency will change in relation to one or more other currencies. As a result, the Company could realize a net loss on an investment, even
if there were a gain on the underlying investment before currency losses were taken into account. Among the factors that may affect currency values are trade balances, the level of short-term interest rates, differences in relative values of similar
assets in different currencies, long-term opportunities for investment and capital appreciation and political developments. The Investment Adviser may try to hedge these risks by investing in foreign currencies, forward foreign currency exchange
contracts, or any combination thereof, but there can be no assurance that such strategies will be effective.   


ITEM 9.
MANAGEMENT.  ITEM 9.1(a)  Board of Managers   All members of the Companys
Board of Managers (the Board or Managers) are Independent Managers (as defined below). The Board has overall responsibility for monitoring and overseeing the investment program of the Company and its management and
operations. The Board will monitor and oversee the business affairs of the Company, including the complete and exclusive authority to oversee and establish policies regarding the 
  
A-11 



management, conduct and operation of the Companys business. The Board exercises the same powers, authority and responsibilities on behalf of the
Company as are customarily exercised by the directors of an investment company registered under the 1940 Act organized as a corporation and has complete and exclusive authority to oversee and establish policies regarding the management, conduct and
operation of the Companys business.  Although the Managers review policies regarding the management of the Company and review
information regarding the investment program of the Company in connection with periodic meetings of the Board, they do not have an active role in supervising the Companys ongoing operations. This means, for example, that the Managers do not
select or approve the Companys investments. The Managers, in their capacity as such, are not Members of the Company and, accordingly, each Manager in his or her capacity as such has no liability as Members. Managers will not contribute to the
capital of the Company in their capacity as Managers, but may subscribe for Units, subject to the eligibility requirements described in this Registration Statement.  Board of Managers and Officers  Any vacancy on the Board of Managers may be filled by the remaining
Managers, except to the extent the 1940 Act requires the election of Managers by the Members. The Companys officers are appointed by the Managers and oversee the management of the day-to-day operations of the Company under the supervision of
the Board. All of the officers of the Company are directors, officers or employees of the Investment Adviser or its affiliates. Certain of the Managers identified below are not affiliated with the Investment Adviser, or its affiliates and are not
interested persons as defined under Section 2(a)(19) of the 1940 Act of either the Company or the Investment Adviser (the Independent Managers). The Managers and officers of the Company also may be directors and officers
of other investment companies managed or advised by the Investment Adviser. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, including the 1940 Act, the Company Agreement indemnifies the Managers and officers for all costs, liabilities and expenses
that they may experience as a result of their service as such.  Information regarding the Board of Managers, including brief biographical
information, is set forth below.  Independent Managers  Independent Managers

Currently, the Independent Managers are each paid an annual retainer of $5,000 ($6,000 for the
Chairperson of the Board and $500 for the Chairperson of the Audit Committee) and per-meeting fees of: $2,000 for in-person attendance at quarterly meetings of the Board ($2,500 for the Chairperson of the Board); $1,000 for telephone participation
at a quarterly Board meeting or for participation at a telephonic special meeting of the Board; and $750 for each Audit Committee meeting (whether held in-person or by telephone). The Independent Managers are also reimbursed for travel-related

Companys accounting and financial reporting policies and practices, its internal controls and, as the Audit Committee may deem necessary or appropriate, the internal controls of certain of the Companys service providers; (2) to
oversee the quality and objectivity of the Companys financial statements and the independent audit of those statements; (3) to assist the Board in selecting the Companys independent registered public accounting firm, to directly
supervise the compensation and performance of such independent registered public accountants and generally to act as a liaison between the independent registered public accountants and the Board; and (4) to review and, as appropriate, approve
in advance non-audit services provided by such independent registered public accountants to the Company, the Investment Adviser, and, in certain cases, other affiliates of the Company.  The Board has formed a Valuation Committee, currently composed of three Independent Managers, whose function, subject to the oversight of the Board, is
to review the Companys valuation methodologies, valuation determinations and any relevant information provided to the Valuation Committee by the Investment Adviser. The Valuation Committee will act in accordance with the Companys
valuation procedures.   


ITEM 9.1(b)
 Investment Adviser  Bank of America Capital Advisors LLC will serve as the Investment Adviser to the Company. U.S. Trust Hedge Fund Management, Inc., or one of its
affiliates, will serve as the Special Member of the Company.  The Investment Adviser was created in 1998 principally to serve as an
investment manager and advisor for third-party investors and Bank of America affiliates desiring investments in the private equity asset class. The Investment Adviser is registered as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act.  The Investment Adviser, subject to supervision by the Board, has overall responsibility for the investment selection, management and operation of the
Company, pursuant to an investment advisory agreement between the Company and the Investment Adviser (the Investment Advisory Agreement). The Investment Adviser may, at its discretion, enter into agreements with its affiliates or third
parties (Consultants) to provide the Investment Adviser with investment research, analytical data due diligence, and/or other consulting services, which the Investment Adviser may use in evaluating prospective Portfolio Funds and in
monitoring the strategies and investment performance of the managers to the Portfolio Funds. A Consultant may make recommendations as to the selection of Portfolio Funds for investment by the Company; however, the determination of the Portfolio
Funds in which the Company invests is made solely by the Investment Adviser. Fees payable to the Consultants, if any, are paid by the Investment Adviser and are not borne by the Company.  The Investment Adviser is organized within Bank of Americas Alternative Investment Group. As of August 1, 2007, the group was overseeing
approximately $5.0 billion in client assets comprising a range of diversified alternative investment solutions encompassing private equity, hedge funds and real estate offered through fund of funds, single-manager and separate accounts. The
Alternative Investment Group is dedicated to delivering investment solutions to institutional and high net worth clients that extend beyond traditional stock and bond offerings.  The Alternative Investment Group is a business unit within Global Wealth & Investment Management (GWIM), a division of Bank of
America. GWIMs other business units include Banc of America Investment Services, Inc., The Private Wealth Management, Premier Banking and Investments, and Columbia Management and Investment Products Group.  The Investment Adviser and the Special Member are indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Bank of America. Bank of America is a Delaware corporation, a
bank holding company and a financial holding company that provides 
  
A-16 



a diverse range of financial services and products. Bank of America, headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, operates in 29 states and the District of
Columbia, and has offices located in 150 foreign countries. Bank of America provides a diversified range of banking and certain non-banking financial services and products both domestically and internationally through four business segments. The
GWIM division provides comprehensive banking and investment services tailored to meet the changing wealth-management goals of more than three million individual and institutional customers. Clients have access to services offered through three
primary businesses: Premier Banking & InvestmentsTM, The Private Wealth Management, and Columbia Management. As of July 1, 2007, the asset management businesses of GWIM, including Columbia Management and its affiliates, managed assets
of approximately $650 billion.  The Investment Advisory Agreement was initially approved by the Board (including a majority of the
Independent Managers) at a meeting held in person on October 17, 2007, and was also approved on such date by the then sole Member of the Company. The Investment Advisory Agreement is effective as of October 29, 2007 and is terminable
without penalty, on 60 days prior written notice: by the Board of Managers; by vote of a majority (as defined by the 1940 Act) of the outstanding voting securities of the Company; or by the Investment Adviser. After the initial term of two
(2) years, the Investment Advisory Agreement may continue in effect from year to year if such continuance is approved annually by either the Board or the vote of a majority (as defined by the 1940 Act) of the outstanding voting securities of
the Company; provided that in either event the continuance is also approved by a majority of the Independent Managers by vote cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of voting on such approval. The Investment Advisory Agreement also
provides that it will terminate automatically in the event of its assignment, as defined by the 1940 Act and the rules thereunder. The Investment Advisory Agreement also provides that if the Investment Advisory Agreement is terminated,
for any reason, the Special Member (or an affiliate) will still be entitled to collect the carried interest, if any, for any investments made during the term of the Investment Advisory Agreement.  The Investment Advisory Agreement provides that, in the absence of willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of its
obligations to the Company, the Investment Adviser and any member, director, officer or employee thereof, or any of their affiliates, executors, heirs, assigns, successors or other legal representative, will not be liable to the Company for any
error of judgment, for any mistake of law or for any act or omission by such person in connection with the performance of services to the Company. The Investment Advisory Agreement also provides for indemnification, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, by the Company or the Investment Adviser, or any member, director, officer or employee thereof, and any of their affiliates, executors, heirs, assigns, successors or other legal representatives, against any liability or expense to which such
person may be liable which arise in connection with the performance of services to the Company, provided that the liability or expense is not incurred by reason of the persons willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless
disregard of its obligations to the Company.

ITEM 9.1(d)

A-20 


There is no placement fee for purchases of Interests:   


 
1.
by or on behalf of accounts for which any of the Placement Agents (as defined below) or the Investment Adviser or one of their affiliates acts in a fiduciary, advisory, custodial or
similar capacity; or   


 
2.
by individuals who are employees of Bank of America at the time of their Commitment.  To receive a placement fee waiver in accordance with the above provisions, Investors must, at the time of purchase, give the Placement Agent sufficient information to permit confirmation of the qualification.
Placement fee amounts, if any, are in addition to the Commitments made and are due upon acceptance by the Company. Bank of America, N.A, Banc of America Investment Services, Inc. and UST Securities Corp. serve as the placement agents to the Company
(each, a Placement Agent and collectively the Placement Agents).  Advisory Fees  In consideration of the advisory and other services provided by the Investment Adviser, the Company shall pay the Investment Adviser:   


 

 
 a fixed fee of $2 million per annum, plus   


 

 
 a variable fee of 0.65% of the Companys NAV (exclusive of assets held in cash and cash equivalents) per annum.  The advisory fee is payable quarterly, in arrears, based on the end of the preceding quarters NAV (exclusive of assets held in cash and cash
equivalents) during a quarter. No advisory fees will be paid by the Company until the final closing.  In addition, an affiliate of the
Investment Adviser will receive a carried interest of 10% (See Allocation of Profit and Loss; Distributions below).  Company Expenses
 The Investment Adviser bears all of its own costs incurred in providing investment advisory and administrative services to the
Company, including preliminary due diligence investigations of potential investments. The Investment Adviser will also bear all of the Companys organizational expenses, expenses relating to the offer and sale of Units (except the commitment
fees), and all Company expenses until the final closing.  The Company will bear all advisory fees and carried interest paid to the
Investment Adviser and/or Special Member, accounting, audit and tax preparation fees and expenses; administrative expenses and fees; legal fees and expenses, custody and escrow fees and expenses; the costs of any errors and omissions / directors and
officers liability insurance or any fidelity bond; all costs and charges for equipment or services used in communicating information regarding the Companys transactions among the Investment Adviser and any custodian or other agent engaged by
the Company; expenses (including financing, due diligence, travel and other costs) related to the holding, monitoring, follow-on investments and disposition of the Portfolio Funds; interest expenses; any extraordinary expenses; and such other
expenses as may be approved from time to time by the Board. The Company will also indirectly bear the management fees of the Portfolio Funds, as well as carried interest allocations in such Portfolio Funds; investment-related expenses and other
expenses, including, but not limited to, non-investment related interest expense and fees and disbursements of attorneys and accountants engaged on behalf of the Portfolio Fund. Drawdowns from Investors or distributions from Portfolio Funds may be
used to fulfill obligations (including, but not limited to, the payment of any interest due) under any credit facility.  Generally, the
Portfolio Funds are expected to have management fees of approximately 1.0% to 2.5% of the Portfolio Funds commitments and carried interest allocations of 20% to 30% of the Portfolio Funds profits.  Allocation of Profit and Loss; Distributions  The
Company maintains a separate capital account for each Member that contributes capital to the Company. The initial balance of a Members capital account will equal the amount of the initial drawdown of the Members Commitment to the Company
and will be adjusted to reflect any additional drawdowns and distributions. For 
  
A-21 



purposes of calculating an Investors capital account, each drawdown against committed capital will be treated as a separate investment. The net profits
or net losses of the Company are credited to or debited against the capital accounts of Member as of the end of each fiscal period in accordance with their respective investment percentages for the period. Each Members investment percentage is
determined each fiscal period in a manner reflecting the distribution provisions of the Company Agreement.  Distributions from the Company
are made as follows: (i) to the Members (including the Special Member) until they have received a 125% return of all drawn Commitments and (ii) then a 90%/10% split between the Members and the Special Member, respectively. The Special Member will
not receive any of the carried interest that it may have earned until after the fourth anniversary of the final closing (the anticipated time frame in which all, or substantially all, of the Commitments that the Company intends to invest will have
been drawn). For example, assume an investor makes Commitments of $100,000, of which 90% is drawn by the Company. Then the investor will need to receive $112,500 ($90,000 x1.25) in distributions before any carried interest is withheld. After that
investor receives the $112,500 in distributions, all future distributions will be split between the investors (90%) and the Special Member (10%).  ITEM 9.1(g)  Not Applicable.   


ITEM 9.2
Not Applicable.   


ITEM 9.3
 Before the commencement of the Companys
operations, the Investment Adviser (or an affiliate of the Investment Adviser) may be deemed to control the Company. As sole member of the Company, David R. Bailin may be deemed to be a control person of the Company. However, Mr. Bailin shall
withdraw from the Company immediately preceding the commencement of operations of the Company.   


ITEM 10.
CAPITAL STOCK, LONG-TERM DEBT, AND OTHER SECURITIES.   


ITEM 10.1.
 The Company is organized as a limited liability
company under the laws of the State of Delaware and intends to be classified as a partnership for income tax purposes. The beneficial interest in the Company shall be divided into interests (the Interests or Units). The
number of Interests in the Company shall be unlimited. All Interests issued by the Company shall be fully paid and nonassessable. Interest holders shall have no preemptive or other rights to subscribe to any additional Interests or other securities
issued by the Company. The Company will establish on its books a separate capital account (a Capital Account) in respect of each Investor. Net profits and net losses of the Company for each quarter are allocated on the last business day
of that quarter (or at such other times as the Board, in its discretion, may determine) among the Capital Accounts maintained for Investors in proportion to the relative balances in such Capital Accounts. The Company will make distributions as
received from Portfolio Funds in accordance with Capital Accounts distributions. An investment in the Company involves substantial restrictions on liquidity and its Interests are not freely transferable. There is no market for the Interests, and no
market is expected to develop. Consequently, Investors may be unable to redeem or liquidate their Interests.  Investors in the Company must
be accredited investors, as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act, and qualified clients as defined in Rule 205-3 under the Advisers Act. The Investment Adviser may decline to admit any Investor.
Interests may not be purchased by nonresident aliens, foreign corporations, foreign partnerships, foreign trusts or foreign estates, all as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Investors generally will be required to represent
to the Company that such Investor:   


 

 
 is investing in the Company for its own account, for investment purposes only, and not with a view to distributing Units;   


 

 
 is a sophisticated Investor capable of evaluating the risks and merits of an investment in the Company;   


 

 
 has had access to sufficient information needed to make an investment decision about the Company;   


 

 
 can tolerate illiquidity, which is characteristic of privately placed securities in general and this investment in particular;   


 

 
 satisfies the standards of an accredited investor as set forth in Regulation D under the Securities Act; and   
A-22 




 

 
 satisfies the qualified client standards of Rule 205-3 under the Advisers Act.  Summary Of Company Agreement  The following is a
summary description of additional items and of select provisions of the Company Agreement. The description of such items and provisions is not definitive and reference should be made to the complete text of the form of Company Agreement contained as
an exhibit.  Liability of Members  Members of the Company will be members of a limited liability company as provided under Delaware law. Under Delaware law and the Company Agreement, a Member will be liable for the debts and obligations of the Company only to the extent of
its capital commitments and any contributions to the capital of the Company (plus any accretions in value thereto prior to withdrawal) and a Member, in the discretion of the Board, may be obligated to satisfy withholding tax obligations with respect
to such Member.  Duty of Care  The
Company Agreement provides that neither the Managers nor, if applicable, the Investment Adviser (including certain of its affiliates, among others) shall be liable to the Company or any of its Members for any loss or damage occasioned by any act or
omission in the performance of their respective services as such in the absence of willful misconduct, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of their duties. The Company Agreement also contains provisions for the indemnification, to the
extent permitted by law, of the Managers by the Company, but not by the Members individually, against any liability and expense to which any of them may be liable which arises in connection with the performance of their activities on behalf of the
Company. A Manager will not be personally liable to any Member for the repayment of any balance in such Members capital account or for contributions by such Member to the capital of the Company or by reason of any change in the federal or
state income tax laws applicable to the Company or its Members. The rights of indemnification and exculpation provided under the Company Agreement do not provide for indemnification of a Manager for any liability, including liability under federal
securities laws that, under certain circumstances, impose liability even on persons that act in good faith, to the extent, but only to the extent, that such indemnification would be in violation of applicable law.  Power of Attorney  By investing and by signing the
Company Agreement (which each Member will do by virtue of signing a Member certification form), each Member will appoint each of the Managers and its designees as such Members attorney-in-fact for purposes of filing required certificates and
documents relating to the formation and continuation of the Company as a limited liability company under Delaware law or signing all instruments effecting authorized changes in the Company or the Company Agreement and conveyances and other
instruments deemed necessary to effect the dissolution or termination of the Company.  Dissolution and Liquidation  The Company will be dissolved upon the occurrence of any of the following:   


 

 
 the expiration of its term, except as otherwise extended pursuant to the Company Agreement;   


 

 
 upon the affirmative vote by the Managers, subject, to the extent required by the 1940 Act, to the consent of the Members;   


 

 
 the sale or other disposition at any one time of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; and   


 

 
 dissolution required by operation of law.  Upon the occurrence of any event of dissolution, the Managers or a liquidator acting as such under appointment by the Managers is charged with winding up the affairs of the Company and liquidating its assets. Net profits or net losses
during the fiscal period including the period of liquidation will be allocated as described in the Company Agreement.  Upon the dissolution
of the Company, its assets are to be distributed to Members in accordance with the positive balance in their respective capital accounts, after providing for all obligations of the Company.

Voting  Each Member has the right to cast a number of votes equal to the number of Interests held by such Member at a meeting of Members called by the Managers. Members will be entitled to vote on any matter on which shareholders of a registered
investment company organized as a corporation would normally be entitled to vote, including the election of Managers, approval of the Companys agreement with any investment adviser to the Company, and certain other matters, to the extent that
the 1940 Act requires a vote of Members on any such matters. Except for the exercise of their voting privileges, Members in their capacity as such are not entitled to participate in the management or control of the Companys business, and may
not act for or bind the Company.  Reports to Members  The Company will furnish to Members, as soon as practicable after the end of each taxable year, financial statements and such information as is necessary for them to complete their income tax or information returns,
along with any other tax information required by law. The Company will not be able to provide final K-1s to Members for any given tax year until significantly after April 15 of the following year. The Company will provide Schedule K-1s as soon
as practicable after it receives all necessary information.  Fiscal Year  The Companys fiscal year for financial reporting purposes is the 12-month period ending on March 31. The Companys taxable year is the
12-month period ending December 31.

ITEM 10.4.
 The Company intends to be classified as a
partnership and not as an association taxable as a corporation for federal tax purposes or a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation. Accordingly, the Company should not be subject to federal income tax, and each Member will
be required to report on its own annual tax return such Members share of the Companys taxable income or loss.  If it were to be
determined that the Company should be treated as an association or a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation, the taxable income of the Company may be subject to corporate income tax and any distributions of profits from the Company
would be treated as dividends.

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES.  Part A of this
Registration Statement contains basic information about the investment objective, policies and limitations of the Company.   


ITEM 18.
MANAGEMENT.  Information about the managers and
officers of the Company, their roles in the management of the Company, the compensation of the Managers, and the committees of the Company is included in Part A of this Registration Statement.  The Investment Adviser and its affiliates (and the directors/trustees, officers and employees) may buy and sell securities or other investments for their
own accounts, and may have conflicts of interest with respect to investments made on behalf of the Company. As a result of differing trading and investment strategies or constraints, positions may be taken by these parties that are the same,
different from or made at different times from positions taken for the Company. To lessen the possibility that the Company will be adversely affected by this personal trading, the Company and the Investment Adviser has each adopted a code of ethics
(each, a Code of Ethics) in compliance with Section 17(j) of the 1940 Act that restrict securities trading in the personal accounts of investment professionals and others who normally come into possession of information regarding
the Companys portfolio transactions. The Codes of Ethics for the Company and the Investment Adviser can be reviewed and copied at the SECs Public Reference Room in Washington, D.C. Information on the operation of the Public Reference
Room may be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-202-551-8090. The Code of Ethics also is available on the EDGAR Database on the SECs Internet site at http://www.sec.gov, and copies may be obtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by e-mail at
publicinfo@sec.gov or by writing to the SECs Public Reference Section, Washington, D.C. 20549-0102.  The Investment Adviser and its
affiliates will not purchase securities or other property from, or sell securities or other property to, the Company except that the Company may, in accordance with rules under the 1940 Act, engage in transactions with accounts that are affiliated
with the Company as a result of common officers, directors/trustees, advisers or managing general partners. These transactions would be effected in circumstances in which the Investment Adviser determined that it would be appropriate for the Company
to purchase and another client to sell, or the Company to sell and another client to purchase, the same security or instrument on the same day.  Personnel of the Investment Adviser serve as portfolio managers to certain clients and registered and unregistered investment companies that may utilize an investment program that is substantively similar to that of the Company. In
addition, the Investment Adviser currently serves, or may in the future serve, as investment advisers to other registered investment companies, unregistered investment companies or accounts (including proprietary accounts), some of which provide for
incentive compensation (such as performance fees). Consequently, the Investment Advisers investment management activities may present conflicts between the interests of the Company and those of the Investment Adviser, and, potentially, among
the interests of various accounts managed by the Investment Adviser principally with respect to allocation of investment opportunities among similar strategies.  Future investment activities of the Investment Adviser and its affiliates and its principals, partners, director/trustees, officers or employees may give rise to conflicts of interest other than those described above.
 Each Member has the right to cast a number of votes equal to the number of Interests held by such Member at a meeting of Members called by
the Companys Managers. Members will be entitled to vote on any matter on which shareholders of a registered investment company organized as a corporation would be entitled to vote, including certain elections of a Manager and approval of the
Investment Advisory Agreement, in each case to the each case to the extent that voting by shareholders is required by the 1940 Act. Notwithstanding their ability to exercise their voting privileges, Members in their capacity as such are not entitled
to participate in the management or control of the Companys business, and may not act or bind the Company.   
B-1 


The Company may limit its investment position (combined with other investment positions of certain of its
affiliates) in any one Portfolio Fund to less than 5% of the Portfolio Funds outstanding voting securities, absent an order of the SEC (or assurances from the SEC staff) under which the Companys contribution and withdrawal of capital
from a Portfolio Fund in which the Company and certain of its affiliates hold 5% or more of the outstanding interests will not be subject to various 1940 Act prohibitions on affiliated transactions. The Company is not required to adhere to this 5%
investment limitation to the extent that it relies on certain SEC rules that provide exemptions from the 1940 Act provisions on affiliated transactions. However, to facilitate investments in smaller Portfolio Funds deemed attractive by the
Investment Adviser, the Company may purchase non-voting securities of, or waive its right to vote its interests in, Portfolio Funds. Although the Company may hold non-voting interests, the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder may
nevertheless require the Company to limit its position, aggregated with the positions of certain of its affiliates, in any one Portfolio Fund, if investments in a Portfolio Fund by the Company and certain of its affiliates will equal or exceed 25%
of the Portfolio Funds assets, or such lower percentage limit as may be determined by the Company in consultation with its counsel. These restrictions may be changed by the Board, subject to the limitations of applicable laws, rules or
interpretations thereof.  The Company does not presently intend to invest in Portfolio Funds managed by the Investment Adviser or any of
its affiliates; however, it may do so in the future, subject to obtaining such exemptions from the 1940 Act as may be necessary.  Proxy
Voting Policies and Procedures. Under the 1940 Act, the Board has a right and an obligation to vote proxies relating to the Companys securities as part of their general fiduciary obligations to the Company and its Members. Because of its
investments in Portfolio Funds, the Company generally does not receive proxy solicitations. However, the Board has adopted the proxy voting policies and procedures of the Investment Adviser as the Companys proxy voting policies and procedures.
Subject to the Boards oversight, the Company has delegated responsibility to vote any proxies the Company may receive to the Investment Adviser. The Investment Advisers general policy is to vote proxy proposals, amendments, consents or
resolutions relating to the Company in a manner that serves the best interests of the Company. A copy of the Investment Advisers proxy voting policies and procedures is attached as Appendix A to this Part B.   


ITEM 19.
CONTROL PERSONS AND PRINCIPAL HOLDERS OF SECURITIES.  No officers or Managers of the Company currently own any of the outstanding Interests in the Company.  Before the
commencement of the Companys operations, Bank of America Capital Advisors LLC, 100 Federal Street, Boston, MA 02110 may be deemed to control the Company. As sole member of the Company, David R. Bailin may be deemed to be a control person of
the Company. However, Mr. Bailin shall withdraw from the Company immediately preceding the commencement of operation of the Company.   


ITEM 20.
INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND OTHER SERVICES.  Information of the investment management and other services provided for or on behalf of the Company is contained in Part A of this Registration Statement.  PricewaterhouseCooper serves as the independent registered public accounting firm of the Company.  Mintz,
Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C., One Financial Center, Boston, Massachusetts, 02111, acts as counsel to the Company, the Investment Adviser and certain of its affiliates.  Stroock & Stroock & Lavan LLP acts as counsel to the Independent Managers.  The Company is registered under the 1940 Act as a closed-end management investment company. The Company was formed as a limited liability company under
the laws of the State of Delaware on February 2, 2007. The Companys principal place office is located at 100 Federal Street, Boston, MA 02110. The telephone number is (888) 786-9977.

 Real, potential or apparent conflicts of interest may arise should members of the Portfolio
Management Team have day-to-day portfolio management responsibilities with respect to more than one fund. Portfolio Management Team members may manage other accounts with investment strategies similar to the Company, including other investment
companies, pooled investment vehicles and separately managed accounts. Fees earned by the Investment Adviser may vary among these accounts and Portfolio Management Team members may personally invest in these accounts. These factors could create
conflicts of interest because the Portfolio Management Team members may have incentives to favor certain accounts over others that could result in other accounts outperforming the Company. A conflict may also exist if a Portfolio Management Team
member identifies a limited investment opportunity that may be appropriate for more than one account, but the Company is not able to take full advantage of that opportunity due to the need to allocate that opportunity among multiple accounts. In
addition, a Portfolio Management Team member may execute transactions for another account that may adversely impact the value of securities held by the Company. However, the Investment Adviser believes that these risks are mitigated by the fact that
accounts with like investment strategies managed by the Portfolio Management Team members are generally managed in a similar fashion and the Investment Adviser has a policy that seeks to allocate opportunities on a fair and equitable basis.
 Investment Opportunities May Be Allocated to Investment Adviser Affiliates. Affiliates of the Investment Adviser may be
interested in some of the same investment opportunities as the Investment Adviser. Accordingly, an affiliate of the Investment Adviser may make an investment that would otherwise be appropriate for the Company. As among the Company and the
Investment Advisers other fund of funds vehicles or other clients, investment opportunities presented to the Investment Adviser will be allocated in a fair and equitable manner, among the Investment Advisers existing clients.
Opportunities that are suitable for more than one of the Investment Advisers fund of funds vehicles, including the Company, or other clients and for which there is insufficient capacity to fulfill each fund of funds vehicles or other
clients need, will be allocated among such clients pro rata in proportion to its amount available to invest in such opportunity.  The
Company may invest in underlying funds in which the Investment Adviser and/or its affiliates (including, to the extent permitted by applicable law, other fund of funds products that have been or may be established by the Investment Adviser and/or
its affiliates) has an investment, and the Investment Adviser and/or its affiliates may invest in Portfolio Funds in which the Company has made an investment. The Board has adopted procedures governing the co-investment in securities acquired in
private placements with certain clients of the Investment Adviser.  The Investment Adviser may aggregate or bunch orders for its clients,
including the Company, and to aggregate such orders with those for clients of affiliates when it is determined that it is in the best interests of its clients. However, in order to avoid even the appearance that all participants in the aggregation
are not treated fairly and equitably, the Investment Adviser has adopted procedures governing the aggregation of orders and their subsequent allocation to participating accounts.  The Investment Adviser is not obligated, however, to invest for the Company in any underlying fund that Bank of America, or its affiliates, may acquire
for its or their own accounts if the Investment Adviser concludes that it is not in the best interests of the Company to acquire a position in such underlying fund. The investors in the Company will not benefit from investments made by Bank of
America and its other affiliates.  Investment Opportunities May Be Sourced to the Company. One source of potential
investments for the Company which may be made available to the Company is through an arrangement (the Arrangement) to which GWIM is a party. The Arrangement itself will not, since the Company is not a party to it, be a policy of the
Company and may be changed by the parties to it; any changes would be monitored by the Investment Adviser and called to the attention of the Board.  The participants in the Arrangement are Conversus Asset Management, LLC (ManageCo), BAC, and Oak Hill Investment Management, L.P. (OHIM). Each of them has agreed to allocate investment opportunities in private equity
funds sourced by them or among ManageCo, BAC (on a proprietary basis and with respect to GWIM) and/or OHIMs clients in a fair and equitable manner. The fair and equitable manner initially will be based on the capital under management (or with
respect to BACs proprietary investments, its internal balance sheet allocation to private equity funds as an asset class) of ManageCo, BAC or of GWIM and OHIMs applicable clients, subject to investment limitations, pre-existing
commitments, legal, tax and other similar factors and agreement by the fund manager. For such purpose, capital under management means net asset value (excluding the cash assets and the unfunded commitments of the applicable party to
underlying investments) or original capital commitments (including both funded and unfunded commitments made by investors to the applicable party). If ManageCo, BAC, GWIM or the OHIM clients fail to use all or any portion of an allocated
opportunity, the excess opportunity will be made available pro rata based on such parties original allocation to the parties that have not otherwise declined the opportunity; provided that BAC may give all or part of its proprietary allocation
to GWIM. ManageCo, BAC and OHIM may in the future determine to allocate investment opportunities in private equity funds sourced by them in a fair and equitable manner on any other reasonable basis, as long as it is fair and equitable. 
As described above, the Company has adopted its own policies for co-investment and aggregation of orders. Those policies and procedures would govern
the internal allocation within GWIM of opportunities sourced under the Arrangement. Since the Company is not a party to the Arrangement, it would not become part of the Companys own policies.   
B-5 


Each member of the Portfolio Management Team is a senior executive from business units within GWIM. As
such, the compensation packages for the members on the Portfolio Management Team are composed of the same components used with all Bank of America senior executives: base salary, annual incentive performance bonus and equity awards. There is no
direct link between any members specific compensation and the Companys investment performance.  In determining the base
salaries, Bank of America intends to be competitive in the marketplace and ensure salaries are commensurate with each members experience and ultimate responsibilities within each members respective business unit. Bank of America
regularly evaluates base salary levels with external industry studies and analysis of industry trends.  Each Portfolio Management Team
members annual bonus and equity awards are discretionary awards distributed after measuring each members contributions against quantitative and qualitative goals relative to their individual business responsibilities. Quantitative goals
are relative to the individuals business unit, and are not directly related to the performance of the Company or any other portfolio relative to any benchmark, or to the size of the Company. An example of a quantitative measure is associate
turnover ratio. Qualitative measures may include staff management and development, process management (ex: adherence to internal and external policies), business management and strategic business input to the business platform.  As of the date of this Registration Statement, no one owns Interests.   


ITEM 22.
BROKERAGE ALLOCATION AND OTHER PRACTICES.  Each
Portfolio Funds manager is directly responsible for placing orders for the execution of portfolio transactions for the Portfolio Fund that it manages and for the allocation of brokerage. Transactions on U.S. stock exchanges and on some foreign
stock exchanges involve the payment of negotiated brokerage commissions. On many foreign stock exchanges, commissions are fixed. No stated commission is generally applicable to securities traded in over-the-counter markets, but the prices of those
securities include undisclosed commissions or mark-ups. In selecting brokers and dealers to execute transactions on behalf of a Portfolio Fund, it is expected that each Portfolio Fund manager will generally seek to obtain the best price and
execution for the transactions, taking into account factors, such as price, size of order, difficulty of execution and operational facilities of a brokerage firm, the scope and quality of brokerage services provided, and the firms risk in
positioning a block of securities. Although it is expected that each Portfolio Fund manager generally will seek reasonably competitive commission rates, a Portfolio Fund manager will not necessarily pay the lowest commission available on each
transaction. The Portfolio Fund managers will typically have no obligation to deal with any broker or group of brokers in executing transactions in portfolio securities.  Brokerage practices adopted by Portfolio Fund managers with respect to Portfolio Funds may vary and will be governed by each Portfolio Funds organizational documents.  Consistent with the principle of seeking best price and execution, a Portfolio Fund manager may place orders for a Portfolio Fund with brokers that
provide the Portfolio Fund manager and its affiliates with supplemental research, market and statistical information, including advice as to the value of securities, the advisability of investing in, purchasing or selling securities, and the
availability of securities or purchasers or sellers of securities, and furnishing analyses and reports concerning issuers, industries, securities, economic factors and trends, portfolio strategy and the performance of accounts. The expenses of the
Portfolio Fund managers are not necessarily reduced as a result of the receipt of this supplemental information, which may be useful to the Portfolio Fund managers or their affiliates in providing services to clients other than the Portfolio Funds.
In addition, not all of the supplemental information is necessarily used by a Portfolio Fund manager in connection with the Portfolio Fund it manages. Conversely, the information provided to a Portfolio Fund manager by brokers and dealers through
which other clients of the Portfolio Fund manager or its affiliates effect securities transactions may be useful to the Portfolio Fund manager in providing services to the Portfolio Fund.  Based on representations in the Portfolio Funds offering documents, the Company generally believes that Portfolio Funds will follow practices
similar to those described above. The Company has no control over Portfolio Fund brokerage arrangements or operations and there is a risk of Portfolio Fund misconduct.   


ITEM 23.
TAX STATUS.  The following is a summary of certain
aspects of the income taxation of the Company that should be considered by a prospective Investor. The Company has not sought a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service or any other federal, state, or local agency with respect to any of the tax
issues affecting the Company. Further, the Company has not obtained an opinion of counsel with respect to any federal tax issues other than the characterization of the Company as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.  This discussion is based on the Companys intended plan of operation applying the federal income tax laws as currently in effect as contained in the
Internal Revenue Code (Code), Treasury Regulations, and relevant judicial decisions and administrative guidance. The federal tax laws are subject to change, and any such change may materially affect the tax consequences of an investment
in the Company. Neither the Investment Adviser nor its 
  
B-6 



counsel has any continuing duty to advise the Company or any Member of any changes in the tax law that may affect any party or cause any part of this
discussion to become inaccurate. No rulings or opinions of counsel (except as noted above with respect to the Companys partnership status) have been or will be requested with respect to any tax-related matter discussed herein. There can be no
assurance that the positions the Company takes on its tax returns will be accepted by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). This discussion relates only to U.S. federal income taxes and not to any local, state or foreign taxes or U.S.
federal taxes other than income taxes.  Because this discussion is a general summary, it does not address all aspects of federal income
taxation that may be relevant to a particular investor in light of the Investors particular circumstances, nor does it address, unless explicitly noted (and only to the extent so noted), certain types of Investors subject to special treatment
under the federal income tax laws, including but not limited to tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, financial institutions, broker-dealers, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market
method of accounting for their securities, partners who are themselves partnerships or other pass-through entities for federal income tax purposes, regulated investment companies, real estate investment companies, real estate mortgage investment
conduits, expatriates, persons liable for alternative minimum tax, persons whose functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, persons holding their investment as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion, straddle, or other
risk-reducing transaction, and persons acquiring their interests in the Company in connection with the performance of services. Except as otherwise explicitly noted under Non-U.S. Investors below, this summary addresses only individual
citizens or residents of the United States, corporations or other business entities organized under the laws of the United States, any state, or the District of Columbia, estates with income subject to United States federal income tax, or trusts
subject to primary supervision by a United States court or for which United States persons control all substantial decisions.  Portions of
this discussion address the ability of Investors to utilize items of loss or deduction allocated to them by the Company. Potential Investors are cautioned that the Company will not be operated for the purpose of generating tax deductions, losses,
credits, or other benefits. Investors should not anticipate that an investment in the Company will yield items of deduction, loss, or credit to offset items of income or gain from other sources.  Potential Investors should consult with their own tax advisers in order to understand the federal, state, local and foreign income tax consequences of an
investment in the Company.  The Companys Tax Status  The Company intends to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, and the Companys legal counsel will provide an opinion to Investors that the Company will be so treated. As a partnership, the
Company will not be subject to federal income tax. Instead, each Member will be required annually to take into account its respective distributive share of the Companys items of taxable income, gain, loss, deduction and credit, without regard
to whether any distributions are made by the Company. Generally, ordinary income or loss earned or incurred by the Company will be ordinary income or loss to the Members, and capital gain or loss earned or incurred by the Company will be capital
gain or loss to the Members. Distributive shares of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit are allocated in accordance with the Company Agreement. The Company expects that such allocations will be respected by the IRS as either having
substantial economic effect (and complying with other regulatory safe harbor provisions) or being determined in accordance with a partners interest in the partnership. However, the regulations regarding when allocations
are respected for tax purposes are very complex, and there can be no assurance that the allocations described in the Company Agreement will be respected by the IRS.  Generally, distributions received by a Member from the Company (as opposed to allocations of taxable income or loss) will only be taxable to the extent a Member receives money in excess of the Members basis in
its Company Interest. The Company expects to qualify as an investment partnership within the meaning of Section 731(c)(3)(C) of the Code as long as the Company does not actively and substantially participate in the management of any
Portfolio Fund or hold 20 percent or more of the total capital and profits interests in any Portfolio Fund. If the Company does not so qualify, a Member receiving a distribution of marketable securities from the Company may recognize taxable gain to
the extent the fair market value of the distributed securities plus any distributed money exceeds the Members basis in its Units. A Member selling appreciated securities distributed to it tax-free by the Company will generally recognize
taxable gain based on the total appreciation in the value of the securities (subject to certain adjustments and exceptions in the case of a distribution in liquidation of a Members interest in the Company), including such appreciation that
accrued while the securities were held by the Company.   
B-7 


The Company will file U.S. federal partnership information returns, reporting its operations for each
fiscal year. The Company also will provide Members with statements to assist Members in determining and reporting on their federal income tax returns items of taxable income, gain, loss, deduction and credit arising from their investment in the
Company. Because the Company must receive tax-reporting information from the Portfolio Funds and await the results of its annual audit before it can prepare such statements, the Company will not be able to provide tax-reporting statements to the
Members until significantly after April 15 of each year. Members must be prepared to obtain extensions for filing their U.S. federal, state, and local income tax returns each year.  Investments in Portfolio Funds  The Company expects to invest in Portfolio Funds rather than directly
engage in any business operations. The Company anticipates, but can provide no assurance that, the Portfolio Funds will be treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes and will, in turn, invest in the equity or debt securities of
portfolio companies. Assuming for the remainder of this discussion that this is so, the federal income tax consequences of the Companys investment in a Portfolio Fund will depend heavily on the structure and other circumstances of the
portfolio companies selected by Portfolio Funds. Beyond its ability to choose among Portfolio Funds in which to invest, the Company will have no control over the Portfolio Funds and their choice of investments. Therefore, Members must be prepared
for allocations presenting a wide variety of federal income tax consequences.  To the extent Portfolio Funds invest in domestic portfolio
companies taxed as corporations, unlike those taxed as partnerships, such companies are subject to federal income tax and will report separately their income, gains, losses, deductions, and credits on their own tax return. Interest or dividends
earned from such portfolio companies will generally be ordinary income. Generally, the federal income tax consequences of a Portfolio Funds disposition of investments in domestic portfolio companies will depend on whether the Portfolio Fund is
treated as an investor or trader (i.e., realizing capital gains or losses), or a dealer (i.e., realizing ordinary income or loss) for tax purposes.  To the extent Portfolio Funds invest in domestic portfolio companies taxed as partnerships, such portfolio companies, like the Company itself, will not be subject to federal income tax. The Portfolio Funds, and indirectly the Company and
the Members themselves, must take into account for tax purposes a distributive share of such a portfolio companys items of taxable income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit without regard to whether the portfolio company ever makes
distributions. Moreover, the Portfolio Funds, Company, and Members will be deemed engaged in any trade or business carried on by a portfolio company taxed as a partnership. As noted above, the federal income tax consequences of a Portfolio
Funds disposition of investments in domestic portfolio companies will depend on whether the Portfolio Fund is treated as an investor, trader, or a dealer for tax purposes. In addition, when disposing of a domestic portfolio company treated as
a partnership, gain or loss attributable to inventory or unrealized receivables (defined broadly to include, among others, recapture items, market-discount bonds, short-term obligations, and stock in certain foreign corporations) that might
otherwise be capital gain will instead be ordinary income or loss.  To the extent the Portfolio Funds invest in foreign entities, the tax
consequences will vary widely depending on the jurisdiction and structure of the portfolio company. Foreign portfolio companies treated as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be classified as controlled foreign
corporations or passive foreign investment companies under the Code, subject to a variety of unfavorable federal income tax consequences, including but not limited to accelerating the timing of taxable income to the Members or
altering the character (i.e., ordinary vs. capital gain) of a Members income. Gains or losses from certain foreign currency transactions attributable to exchange rate fluctuations are treated as ordinary income or loss. In addition to taxing
the portfolio companys operations, foreign jurisdictions may impose withholding taxes on dividends, interest, or other payments to the Portfolio Funds. Subject to numerous limitations, Members may be entitled to a credit or deduction for their
share of such withholding taxes and certain other foreign taxes incurred by the Portfolio Funds or the Company.  Portfolio Funds and their
portfolio companies may engage in business in, otherwise derive income from, and in general be subject to taxing authority in numerous state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. Members, by virtue of their participation in the Company, may be subject
to tax payment and reporting obligations in such jurisdictions under their widely varying rules and regulations. Each Investor should consult an independent adviser regarding how an investment in the Company may affect his, her, or its state, local,
and foreign tax payment and reporting obligations.   
B-8 


Net Asset Valuation  The Company will compute its NAV as of the last business day of each quarter and at such other times as deemed appropriate by the Valuation Committee of the Board. In determining its NAV, the Company will value its
investments as of such quarter-end. The NAV of the Company will equal the value of the total assets of the Company, less all of its liabilities, including accrued fees and expenses. The NAV per Unit of the Company will equal the NAV of the Company
divided by the number of outstanding Units.  The Board and the Valuation Committee have approved procedures pursuant to which the Company
will value its investments in Portfolio Funds at fair value. In accordance with these procedures, fair value as of each quarter-end ordinarily will be the value determined as of such quarter-end for each Portfolio Fund in accordance with the
Portfolio Funds valuation policies and reported at the time of the Companys valuation. As a general matter, the fair value of the Companys interest in a Portfolio Fund will represent the amount that the Company could reasonably
expect to receive from a Portfolio Fund if the Companys interest were redeemed at the time of valuation (although it is not generally expected that the types of Portfolio Funds in which the Company may invest will provide the Company with
redemption rights), based on information reasonably available at the time the valuation is made and that the Company believes to be reliable. In the event that a Portfolio Fund does not report a quarter-end value to the Company on a timely basis,
the Company would determine the fair value of such Portfolio Fund based on the most recent value reported by the Portfolio Fund, as well as any other relevant information available at the time the Company values its portfolio.  Prior to investing in any Portfolio Fund, the Investment Adviser will conduct a due diligence review of the valuation methodology utilized by the
Portfolio Fund, which as a general matter will utilize market values when available and otherwise utilize principles of fair value that the Investment Adviser reasonably believes to be consistent with those used by the Company for valuing its own
investments. Although the procedures approved by the Board provide that the Investment Adviser and the Valuation Committee will review the valuations provided by the investment advisers to the Portfolio Funds, neither the Investment Adviser nor the
Valuation Committee will be able to confirm independently the accuracy of valuations provided by such investment advisers (which are unaudited).  In addition, through written and telephone communication and in-person meetings, the Investment Adviser will maintain close relationships with the managers of the Portfolio Funds in order to protect the interests of the Company and its
Members. Representatives of the Investment Adviser plan to regularly attend fund investor meetings. To keep abreast of each Portfolio Funds activities, the Investment Adviser will review their periodic reports as well as the reports of the
underlying portfolio companies in which the Portfolio Funds invest, to the extent which underlying Company reports are made available.  The
Companys valuation procedures require the Investment Adviser and the Valuation Committee to consider all relevant information available at the time the Company values its portfolio. The Investment Adviser and the Valuation Committee will
consider such information, and may conclude in certain circumstances that the information provided by the investment adviser of a Portfolio Fund does not represent the fair value of the Companys interests in the Portfolio Fund. Following
procedures adopted by the Board and the Valuation Committee, in the absence of specific transaction activity in interests in a particular Portfolio Fund, the Company would consider whether it was appropriate, in light of all relevant circumstances,
to value such a position at its NAV as reported at the time of valuation, or whether to adjust such value to reflect a premium or discount to NAV. Generally, the Company would not anticipate applying a discount or a premium to the NAV reported to it
with respect to its Portfolio Fund investments because it is anticipated that the valuation methodologies used by the Portfolio Funds would already be reflective of the illiquid nature of the Companys investment in such Portfolio Funds. Any
such decision would be made in good faith, and subject to the review and supervision of the Valuation Committee.  The valuations reported
by the managers of the Portfolio Funds, upon which the Company calculates its quarter end NAV and NAV per Unit, may be subject to later adjustment, based on information reasonably available at that time. These valuations may be adjusted by the
Valuation Committee in its sole discretion as it deems appropriate to reflect the fair market value of the Portfolio Funds and their interests in portfolio companies or other assets. Circumstances that would justify an adjustment of the valuations
reported to the Valuation Committee by the investment advisers of the Portfolio Fund would include information available to the Valuation Committee that was not reflected in the valuations supplied by the Portfolio Funds including: (i) changes
in prices of publicly traded securities held by the Portfolio Funds, (ii) the pricing obtained for new rounds of financing, particularly financing obtained in significant amounts from new unrelated investors, (iii) the discontinuation of
operations or an important 
  
B-9 



component of operations or the commencement of insolvency or reorganization proceedings of a portfolio company in the Portfolio Funds and (iv) any other
factor or set of factors which, when viewed in the totality of the circumstances would compel an investment professional to conclude that there had occurred an objectively verifiable change in the circumstances of the issuer or in the environment
which is not likely to be reversed in any relevant time frame and which renders current valuation an obsolete, misleading measure of current value for which there is a readily determined and more reliable measure (as would clearly be the case, for
instance, where there is a new round of financing from a new unrelated source or where insolvency proceedings have commenced). Other adjustments may occur from time to time.  Prospective Investors should be aware that there can be no assurance that the fair values of interests in Portfolio Funds as determined under the
procedures described above will in all cases be accurate to the extent that the Company and the Valuation Committee do not generally have access to all necessary financial and other information relating to the Portfolio Funds to determine
independently the NAVs of the Companys interests in those Portfolio Funds. The results of the Valuation Committees valuation of securities whose market value is not readily ascertainable will be based upon the Valuation Committees
assessment of the fair value of such securities and their issuers and, therefore, are the result of the Committees interpretation.  To the extent the Company purchases or holds securities, other than interests in Portfolio Funds, those securities will be valued in accordance with the Companys valuation procedures. The Companys valuation procedures provide
that:  Domestic exchange traded equity securities (other than options) will be valued at their last sale prices as reported
on the exchanges where those securities are traded. If no sales of a security are reported on a particular day, the security will be valued based on its bid price for a security held long, or its ask price for a security held short, as reported by
those exchanges. Securities traded primarily on Nasdaq will be valued at the Nasdaq Official Closing Price (NOCP). If no NOCP is available, the security will generally be valued at the latest bid price as reported on Nasdaq. 
Forward foreign currency contracts will generally be valued using market quotations from a widely used quotation system that reflects
the current cost of covering or off-setting the contract. Exchange-traded options will generally be valued at the latest reported sale price on the exchange on which they trade. If there is no reported sale for an option on the valuation date, the
option will generally be valued at the mean between the latest bid and asked prices. Over-the-counter options will generally be valued using the mean between the latest bid and asked prices. If market quotations are not readily available, these
instruments may be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by, or in accordance with procedures adopted by, the Valuation Committee.  Debt securities will generally be valued by using a third party pricing system, agent, or dealer selected by the Investment Adviser, which may include the use of valuations furnished by a pricing service that employs
a matrix to determine valuations for normal institutional size trading units. The Board and the Valuation Committee will monitor periodically the reasonableness of valuations provided by any such pricing service. Debt securities with remaining
maturities of 60 days or less, absent unusual circumstances, will be valued at amortized cost, so long as such valuations are determined by the Valuation Committee to represent fair value.  Prospective Investors should be aware that situations involving uncertainties as to the value of portfolio positions could have an adverse effect on the
Companys NAV if the judgments of this Board, the Valuation Committee, the Investment Adviser, or managers to the Portfolio Funds should prove incorrect.  Limitations on Certain Deductions  The Company intends to engage in investment activities rather than in any active trade or
business. As a result, noncapitalized expenses of the Company (e.g., fees paid to the Investment Adviser) will represent miscellaneous itemized deductions for non-corporate taxpayers, deductible only to the extent they exceed 2 percent
of a taxpayers adjusted gross income. Overall itemized deductions for individual taxpayers are subject to further limitations. Moreover, an investment in the Company will not constitute a passive activity for purposes of the
passive activity loss rules, and a Member will not be able to utilize losses and deductions from passive activities to offset the Members share of the Companys income and gain (until the Member disposes of its interest in the passive
activity).   
B-10 


The Code limits the ability of Members to utilize other losses and deductions that may arise from the
Companys activities. For instance, allocations of loss or deduction from the Company, or the ability to utilize such allocations, may be limited by a Members adjusted capital account or its adjusted basis in its interest in the Company.
Additionally, the use of capital losses is subject to significant limitations, as is the use of deductions for investment interest should the Company or Portfolio Funds use leverage in their investments. Individuals and certain closely
held corporations are subject to the at risk rules that limit a Members ability to utilize losses to the amount the taxpayer has at risk in the Companys activities. The Companys organizational expenses may be
amortizable only over a 15-year period, if at all. Certain expenses incurred by the Company in offering and selling Company interests will be non-deductible altogether.  Disposition of Interest in the Company  A Members gain or loss upon a disposition of its
interest in the Company will typically be capital gain or loss, long-term if the Member holds the interest for more than one year, except that gains or losses attributable to inventory or unrealized receivables (defined broadly to include, among
others, recapture items, market-discount bonds, short-term obligations, and stock in certain foreign corporations) will be ordinary income or loss. As described above, the use of capital losses is subject to significant limitations.  Tax-Exempt Investors  The discussion below addresses
how certain investors such as tax-exempt organizations, qualified plans, individual retirement accounts and annuities, and state colleges and universities (Tax-Exempt Investors) may be subject to unrelated business income tax
(UBIT) due to the Companys activities.  Income from a trade or business, regularly carried on, that is unrelated to a
Tax-Exempt Investors exempt purposes, and income derived from debt-financed property, are subject to UBIT. If the Portfolio Funds invests in companies treated as partnerships for tax purposes, a Tax-Exempt Investors distributive share of
income earned by the Company will be subject to UBIT if such income would have been subject to UBIT if earned directly by the Tax-Exempt Investor. Moreover, certain income from foreign portfolio companies treated as corporations, such as insurance
income from controlled foreign corporations, may be subject to UBIT. Furthermore, if a Tax-Exempt Investor debt-finances its investment in the Company, the Company debt-finances its investment in a Portfolio Company, or a Portfolio Fund uses
leverage in its own investment activities, some or all of the Tax-Exempt Investors distributive share of income from the Company may be subject to UBIT.  The Company makes no assurance that Tax-Exempt Investors will not incur UBIT as a result of their investment in the Company. Each potential investor should consult an independent tax advisor regarding the UBIT
consequences of an investment in the Company in light of the investors particular circumstances.  Non-U.S. Investors  The discussion below addresses the application of certain federal income tax laws to investors who are not United States citizens, residents, business
entities, estates, or trusts (Non-U.S. Investors). The application of the federal tax laws to non-U.S. persons is complex, and this summary does not address all aspects of those laws.  Except to the extent of income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business (in all cases to include the disposition of U.S. real
property or U.S. real property holding corporations), a Non-U.S. Investors distributive share of the Companys capital gains will not be subject to U.S. tax, and its distributive share of the Companys dividends, interest, and
certain other income will be subject only to a 30 percent withholding tax. Under certain circumstances, the withholding tax may be reduced or eliminated if a Non-U.S. Investor properly certifies to its entitlement to tax treaty benefits or the
portfolio interest exception.  If the Company, a Portfolio Fund, or a portfolio company treated as a partnership for federal
tax purposes is deemed engaged in a U.S. trade or business, then a Non-U.S. Investor will be deemed engaged in a U.S. trade or business. A Non-U.S. Investor deemed engaged in a U.S. trade or business is subject to federal income tax on any income
effectively connected with that trade or business on similar terms and rates as a U.S. person. In those 
  
B-11 



circumstances, the Company must withhold tax on the Non-U.S. Investors distributive share of effectively connected income, and the Non-U.S. Investor
must file a U.S. tax return. Furthermore, the Non-U.S. Investor may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its gain from the disposition of its interest in Company, and, if a corporation, the Non-U.S. Investor may be subject to an additional 30
percent branch profits tax on its earnings and profits effectively connected with the U.S. trade or business.  The Company makes no
assurance that Non-U.S. Investors will not be deemed engaged in a U.S. trade or business as a result of their investment in the Company. Each potential Investor should consult an independent tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of an
investment in the Company in light of the investors particular circumstances.  ERISA Considerations  Persons who are fiduciaries with respect to an employee benefit plan, IRA, Keogh plan or other arrangement subject to the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended (ERISA) or the Code (an ERISA Plan) should consider, among other things, the matters described below before determining whether to invest in the Company.  ERISA imposes certain general and specific responsibilities on persons who are fiduciaries with respect to an ERISA Plan, including prudence,
diversification, prohibited transaction and other standards. In determining whether a particular investment is appropriate for an ERISA Plan, Department of Labor (DOL) regulations provide that a fiduciary of an ERISA Plan must give
appropriate consideration to, among other things, the role that the investment plays in the ERISA Plans portfolio, taking into consideration whether the investment is designed reasonably to further the ERISA Plans purposes, an
examination of the risk and return factors, the portfolios composition with regard to diversification, the liquidity and current return of the total portfolio relative to the anticipated cash flow needs of the ERISA Plan, the income tax
consequences of the investment, and the projected return of the total portfolio relative to the ERISA Plans funding objectives. Before investing the assets of an ERISA Plan in the Company, a fiduciary should determine whether such an
investment is consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities and the foregoing regulations. For example, a fiduciary should consider whether an investment in the Company may be too illiquid or too speculative for a particular ERISA Plan, and whether
the assets of the ERISA Plan would be sufficiently diversified. If a fiduciary with respect to any such ERISA Plan breaches his responsibilities with regard to selecting an investment or an investment course of action for such ERISA Plan, the
fiduciary may be held personally liable for losses incurred by the ERISA Plan as a result of such breach.  Because the Company will
register as an investment company under the 1940 Act, the underlying assets of the Company should not be considered to be plan assets of the ERISA Plans investing in the Company for purposes of ERISAs fiduciary responsibility and
prohibited transaction rules. Thus, the Investment Adviser will not be a fiduciary within the meaning of ERISA.  The Investment Adviser
will require an ERISA Plan proposing to invest in the Company to represent that it, and any fiduciaries responsible for the ERISA Plans investments, are aware of and understand the Companys investment objective, policies and strategies,
that the decision to invest plan assets in the Company was made with appropriate consideration of relevant investment factors with regard to the ERISA Plan and is consistent with the duties and responsibilities imposed upon fiduciaries with regard
to their investment decisions under ERISA.  Certain prospective ERISA Plan investors may currently maintain relationships with the
Investment Adviser or with other entities which are affiliated with the Investment Adviser. Each of such persons may be deemed to be a party in interest to and/or a fiduciary of any ERISA Plan to which it provides investment management, investment
advisory or other services. ERISA prohibits ERISA Plan assets to be used for the benefit of a party in interest and also prohibits an ERISA Plan fiduciary from using its position to cause the ERISA Plan to make an investment from which it or certain
third parties in which such fiduciary has an interest would receive a fee or other consideration. ERISA Plan investors should consult with counsel to determine if participation in the Company is a transaction which is prohibited by ERISA or the
Code. Fiduciaries of ERISA Plan investors will be required to represent that the decision to invest in the Company was made by them as fiduciaries independent of such affiliated persons and duly authorized to make such investment decision and that
they have not relied on any individualized advice or recommendation of such affiliated persons as a basis for the decision to invest in the Company.   
B-12 


The provisions of ERISA are subject to extensive and continuing administrative and judicial interpretation and review.
The discussion of ERISA contained in this Registration Statement, is, of necessity, general and may be affected by future publication of regulations and rulings. Potential investors should consult with their legal advisors regarding the consequences
under ERISA of the acquisition and ownership of Interests.

SEC-registered investment advisor that exercises voting authority over clients proxies must adopt written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that those proxies are voted in the best economic interests of clients. An
advisors policies and procedures must address how the advisor resolves material conflicts of interest between its interests and those of its clients. An investment advisor must comply with certain record keeping and disclosure requirements
with respect to its proxy voting responsibilities. In addition, an investment advisor to ERISA accounts has an affirmative obligation to vote proxies for an ERISA account, unless the client expressly retains proxy voting authority. 
 
This policy will be reviewed no less frequently than semi-annually and is scheduled to be reviewed on November 30,
2007 or promptly thereafter.  Appendix A-1 


The Alternative Investment Group (AI Group)
conducts its business through two SEC-registered investment advisors (referenced in the Policy Summary section below), that exercise voting authority over Clients1 securities. As such, the AI Group Proxy Policy is set forth below.  Policy Summary 
AI Group Clients invest all or substantially all of their assets in limited partnership interests, limited liability company interests, shares or other equity
interests issued by unregistered Funds (Underlying Funds). AI Group Clients may also invest in high quality, short-term instruments for cash management purposes and may be authorized to acquire securities for hedging or investment
purposes. Securities held by a Client that are not Underlying Fund interests are referred to as Direct Investments.  On rare occasions, an AI
Group Client may hold securities distributed to it by an Underlying Fund as an in kind distribution. The Advisors will generally attempt to liquidate Direct Investments received as in kind distributions within 30 days. (See
Best Execution Policy for further details.) An Advisor may vote a proxy in the event a proxy vote be solicited for shareholders of record during the limited time that the AI Group Client held the security prior to the securitys
liquidation.  This policy applies to the following Advisors: Banc of America Investment Advisors, Inc. and Bank of America Capital Advisors LLC (the
Advisors). Other policies apply to the voting of securities held by Advisor Clients that are not AI Group Clients.  Policy  Except with respect to Adverse Measures (defined below), in determining how AI Group should vote a security, AI Group
Portfolio Management shall:   


 

 
 recommend against adoption of a measure if Portfolio Management determines in its discretion that such measure, if adopted:  would result in the affected AI Group Client holding a security in violation of such Clients investment objective(s), policies or restrictions; or
 has a reasonable probability of materially diminishing the economic value and/or utility of the related security in the hands of such
Client over the anticipated holding period of such security; and   


 1
 As used in this policy, Clients include private investment
funds (Private Funds) exempt from the definition of an investment company pursuant to Section 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the 1940 Act), closed-end investment
companies (RICs) registered under the 1940 Act, Private Funds that are plan assets under ERISA and other institutional and high net worth investors [For the purposes of this policy, Clients do not
include Private Funds or RICs that are sub-advised by third parties.]   
This policy will be reviewed no less frequently than semi-annually and is scheduled to be reviewed on November 30,
2007 or promptly thereafter.  Appendix A-2 




 

 
 recommend adoption of a measure if Portfolio Management in its discretion determines that such measure, if adopted:  would not result in the affected AI Group Client holding a related security in violation of such Clients investment objective(s), policies or
restrictions; and  has a reasonable probability of enhancing (or not materially diminishing) the economic value and/or utility of the
related security in the hands of such AI Group Client over the anticipated holding period of such security.  As described above in the Policy
Summary section, most votes cast by Advisors on behalf of Clients will relate to the voting of limited partnership interests, limited liability company interests, shares or similar equity interests in Underlying Funds in which AI Group Clients
invest. Such votes are typically by written consent and no investor meeting is generally called. Although determining whether or not to give consent may not be considered to be proxy voting, such action is governed by this Proxy Voting
Policy. It is also anticipated that frequently an Underlying Fund will request the AI Group Client either to vote in favor of measures that reduce the rights, powers and authority, and/or increase the duties and obligations, associated with the
security in question (Adverse Measures) or to redeem its interests in the Underlying Fund.  It is expected that AI Group Portfolio
Management will ordinarily recommend voting a security in favor of an Adverse Measure only if:   


 

 
 Portfolio Management believes that voting for the Adverse Measure is the only way to continue to hold such security, and that their is a reasonable probability that
the benefits that would be conferred on the affected AI Group Client by continuing to hold such security would outweigh the adverse affect(s) of such Adverse Measure (e.g., increased fees, reduced liquidity); and   


 

 
 Adoption of such Adverse Measure would not result in such Fund holding the related security in violation of its investment objective(s), policies or restrictions.
 Based on the foregoing, it is expected that Portfolio Management ordinarily will recommend adoption of routine, non-Adverse Measures
supported by management, such as proposals to appoint or ratify the appointment of auditors.  Conflicts of Interest:  Portfolio Management is under an obligation to (a) be alert to potential conflicts of interest on the part of AI Group, be mindful of other potential conflicts of
interest as they pertain to affiliates of the Advisors or in his or her own personal capacity, with respect to a decision as to how a proxy should be voted, and (b) bring any such conflict of interest or other conflict of interest which he or
she is aware to the attention of the other members of the Investment Committee and the AI Group Compliance SME.   
This policy will be reviewed no less frequently than semi-annually and is scheduled to be reviewed on November 30,
2007 or promptly thereafter.  Appendix A-3 


AI Group will not implement any decision to vote a proxy in a particular manner unless and until the Compliance SME
has assessed:   


 

 
 whether AI Group (or AI Group personnel) are subject to a conflict of interest in voting such proxy; and if so then   


 

 
 assess whether such conflict is material or not, and if so then   


 

 
 address the material conflict in a manner designed to serve the best interests of the affected AI Group Client.  Notice to Investors:  AI Group will deliver a summary of AI
Groups proxy voting policies and procedures to each prospective investor by delivering the Advisors Form ADV Part II to prospective investors. The summary is contained in Schedule F of the referenced document.  Responses to Investor Requests:  AI Group will, upon the reasonable
request of a prospective investor or current investor, provide such prospective investor or current investor with a copy of the then-current version of this Policy.  AI Group will, upon the reasonable request of a current investor, provide the current investor with how AI Group has voted proxies, for the prior one year period, on behalf of the specific AI Group Client that said
investor has invested in.  AI Group will track proxy policy and proxy voting record requests it receives from current and prospective investors.
 Means of Achieving Compliance  AI Group will
establish procedures to implement this policy to ensure that proxy voting is performed in accordance with the policy expressed above.  Supervision
 Each Portfolio Management Director is responsible for implementing this policy for his or her platform and the Investment Committee is responsible
for overseeing the implementation of this policy.   
This policy will be reviewed no less frequently than semi-annually and is scheduled to be reviewed on November 30,
2007 or promptly thereafter.  Appendix A-4 


Escalation  The applicable AI Group Portfolio Management Directors must promptly report all unapproved exceptions to this policy to the Investment Committee and the AI Group Compliance SME, who together will determine the remedial action to be taken,
if any. The Compliance SME will report all material exceptions to the Chief Compliance Officer.  The Chief Compliance Officer will report any exception
that is not resolved to his or her satisfaction, that cannot be resolved, or that otherwise suggests a material internal compliance controls issue, to AI Group Senior Management.  Monitoring/Oversight  The AI Group Compliance SME is responsible for monitoring compliance with this policy on
an ongoing basis. As needed, but not less than semi-annually, the Compliance SME will request from Portfolio Management a list of all proxies voted during a given period. The Compliance SME will examine the way AI Group has voted and compare to the
AI Group Proxy Policy to ensure that AI Group has been consistent with policy. Evidence of the review will be kept via a Compliance Monitoring Checklist.  Recordkeeping  Records should be retained for a period of not less than six years. Records should be retained in an appropriate
office of AI Group for the first three years. Examples of the types of documents to be maintained as evidence of AI Groups compliance with this policy may include:

 Related Policy Summary  The related policy discussed the situations in which AI Group may be called to vote a security on behalf of its Clients, the general guidelines for how AI Group will vote, and the importance of identifying and
addressing potential and actual conflicts of interest.  Procedure Summary  To comply with applicable law and in accordance with the Advisors responsibilities to its clients, the following procedures detail the steps to be taken when AI Group receives a proxy vote request or request for
consent. These procedures will help ensure that securities are voted according to policy and that potential conflicts of interest, as they pertain to voting, are identified and addressed. Failure to follow these procedures may result in a violation
of the Advisors corresponding policies and potentially breach regulatory requirements. Although determining whether or not to give consent may not be considered to be proxy voting, such action is governed by these Proxy Voting
Procedures.  The procedures below are designed to be read in conjunction with AI Groups Proxy Voting Policy.  Procedure  Upon AI Group Portfolio Managements receipt
of a written consent request or proxy materials relating to a security held by one more AI Group Clients, Portfolio Management will determine how such proxies should be voted in accordance with the AI Group Proxy Voting Policy and these
procedures.   
This procedure will be reviewed no less frequently than semi-annually and is scheduled to be reviewed on November
30, 2007 or promptly thereafter.  Appendix A-6 


Portfolio Management will:  A. prepare a memorandum that contains a brief explanation of the proposed measure(s) described in such materials, the reasons for such measure(s) (if disclosed in such materials), the effective date of such measure(s), Portfolio
Managements voting recommendation of such measure(s), if adopted, the AI Group Client(s) that would be affected by such measure(s), the deadline for voting the proxy/consent, and related matters; and then  B. submit such memorandum to the AI Group Compliance SME who will seek to identify whether AI Group (or AI Group personnel) are subject to a conflict of interest in
voting such security and if so, to address such conflict as set forth in these procedures; and  C. submit such memorandum to all members of the AI Group
Investment Committee for approval at the next Investment Committee meeting (or sooner depending on the proxy vote/consent deadline). The Investment Committee will not approve any voting activity that is not in concert with AI Group Proxy Voting
Policy. Investment Committee decisions will be documented in the Investment Committee Meeting minutes.  Pursuant to item B above, the Compliance SME
will follow the procedures below for 1) identifying conflicts of interest 2) addressing whether a conflict of interest is material and 3) addressing a material conflict of interest.  Conflicts of Interest Defined:  A conflict of interest is any situation that presents an incentive to act other than
in the best interest of an AI Group Client.  A conflict of interest can arise when the firm engages in a transaction or arrangement that has effect of
favoring or the potential to favor:  1. the firms or one of its affiliates interests over a clients or investors
interest  2. an associates interest over a clients or investors interest, or  3. one clients interest over another clients interest.   

This procedure will be reviewed no less frequently than semi-annually and is scheduled to be reviewed on November
30, 2007 or promptly thereafter.  Appendix A-7 


Procedures for Identifying Conflicts of Interest  The Compliance SME may rely on the following to seek to identify conflicts of interest with respect to voting:  1. The
obligations of members of Portfolio Management and the Investment Committee to bring conflicts of interest of which they are aware to the attention of the Compliance SME (e.g., whether a member of the above referenced owns the security in question
or whether the AI Group is aware of a business relationship or potential business relationship with the issuer or the manager.).  2. The Compliance SME
will consult with the personal trading Compliance Officer to determine whether any AI Group associate owns the security or interest in question.  3. Based
on information provided to the Compliance SME pursuant to subsections 1-2 above, the Compliance SME, in consultation with such other AI Group personnel as he or she determines to be appropriate under the circumstances, shall determine whether AI
Group is subject to a conflict of interest in voting a security.  4. If the Compliance SME determines that AI Group is subject to a conflict of interest in
voting a security, he or she shall implement the procedures set forth below to assess whether such conflict of interest is material.  Procedures for
Assessing Whether a Conflict of Interest Is Material  1. If the Compliance SME determines that AI Group is subject to a conflict of interest in voting a
security, he or she shall, in consultation with such other AI Group personnel as he or she determines to be appropriate under the circumstances, determine whether such conflict is material. A conflict of interest will be considered material if it
can reasonably be argued that AI Group, its affiliates or their personnel have an incentive to vote the proxy in a manner designed to benefit AI Group, its affiliates or their personnel rather than the affected AI Group Client (even if there is no
ostensible detriment to the affected AI Group Client from voting the security in that manner). All materiality determinations will be based on an assessment of the particular facts and circumstances. The Compliance SME shall memorialize each such
materiality determination in his or her files.  2. If the Compliance SME determines that AI Group is subject to a conflict of interest in voting a security
but that such conflict is not material, the Compliance SME shall memorialize the finding that such conflict of interest is not material in his or her files.   
This procedure will be reviewed no less frequently than semi-annually and is scheduled to be reviewed on November
30, 2007 or promptly thereafter.  Appendix A-8 


3. If the Compliance Officer determines that AI Group is subject to a conflict of interest in voting a security and
that such conflict is material, he or she shall implement the procedures set forth below to address such conflict.  Procedures for Addressing a Material
Conflict of Interest  1. If the Compliance SME determines that AI Group is subject to a conflict of interest in voting a security and that such conflict
is material, he or she shall, in consultation with such other AI Group personnel as he or she determines to be appropriate under the circumstances, determine how to address such conflict.  2. In determining how to address a material conflict of interest, the Compliance SME may consider the following potential solution, as well as any other solutions he or
she wishes to consider:  - Disclosing the conflict of interest to the investors in such AI Group Client or the Board of Managers of an RIC and obtaining
their consent (in accordance with the governing documents of such Client) to voting the security in the manner recommended by AI Group. Such disclosure must provide sufficient information regarding the conflict to enable a reasonable person to make
an informed decision as to whether to consent to voting the proxy in the manner recommended by AI Group. -  In cases where the AI Compliance SME determines
that AI Group is subject to a conflict of interest in voting a proxy/consent and that such conflict is material, he or she shall not issue an instruction to vote such proxy without: (1) first determining that such vote or recommendation is in
the best interests of the affected AI Group Client; and (2) memorializing such determination in the Compliance SMEs files.  Supervision
 Each Portfolio Management Director is responsible for implementing these procedures for his or her platform and the Investment Committee is
responsible for overseeing the implementation of these procedures.  Escalation  The applicable AI Group Portfolio Management Directors must promptly report all unapproved exceptions to these procedures to the Investment Committee and the AI Group Compliance SME, who together will determine the
remedial action to be taken, if any. The Compliance SME will report all material exceptions to the Chief Compliance Officer.   
This procedure will be reviewed no less frequently than semi-annually and is scheduled to be reviewed on November
30, 2007 or promptly thereafter.  Appendix A-9 


The Chief Compliance Officer will report any exception that is not resolved to his or her satisfaction, that cannot
be resolved, or that otherwise suggests a material internal compliance controls issue, to AI Group Senior Management.  Monitoring/Oversight 
 As needed, the Portfolio Management Directors review the above-named procedures with members of their team. Any relevant issues are discussed at team
meetings or on an ad-hoc basis. As needed, but no less frequently then annually, Compliance will review these procedures to ensure their integrity. Evidence of the review will be kept via a Compliance Review Checklist.  Recordkeeping  Records should be retained for a period of not
less than six years. Records should be retained in an appropriate office of AI Group for the first three years. Examples of the types of documents to be maintained as evidence of AI Groups compliance with these procedures may include:

 Portfolio Management Memorandum Describing Proxy Vote Request   


 

 
 Compliance SME Files Pertaining to Proxy Voting

Potential Conflicts of Interests                                                

      Real, potential or apparent conflicts of interest may arise should members
of the Portfolio Management Team have day-to-day portfolio management           
responsibilities with respect to more than one fund. Portfolio Management Team  
members may manage other accounts with investment strategies similar to the     
Company, including other investment companies, pooled investment vehicles and   
separately managed accounts. Fees earned by the Investment Adviser may vary     
among these accounts and Portfolio Management Team members may personally invest
in these accounts. These factors could create conflicts of interest because the 
Portfolio Management Team members may have incentives to favor certain accounts 
over others, that could result in other accounts outperforming the Company. A   
conflict may also exist if an Portfolio Management Team member identifies a     
limited investment opportunity that may be appropriate for more than one        
account, but the Company is not able to take full advantage of that opportunity 
due to the need to allocate that opportunity among multiple accounts. In        
addition, a Portfolio Management Team member may execute transactions for       
another account that may adversely impact the value of securities held by the   
Company. However, the Investment Adviser believes that these risks are mitigated
by the fact that accounts with like investment strategies managed by the        
Portfolio Management Team members are generally managed in a similar fashion and
the Investment Adviser has a policy that seeks to allocate opportunities on a   
fair and equitable basis.                                                       

(a)(3) Compensation Structure of Portfolio Manager(s) or Management Team Members
- As of March 31, 2008:                                                         

   Each member of the Portfolio Management Team is a senior executive from
business units within Global Wealth Investment Management. As such, the         
compensation packages for the members on the Portfolio Management Team are      
composed of the same components used with all Bank of America senior executives:
base salary, annual incentive performance bonus and equity awards. There is no  
direct link between any member's specific compensation and the Company's        
investment performance.                                                         

In determining the base salaries, Bank of America intends to be     
competitive in the marketplace and ensure salaries are commensurate with each   
member's experience and ultimate responsibilities within each member's          
respective business unit. Bank of America regularly evaluates base salary levels
with external industry studies and analysis of industry trends.                 

      Each Portfolio Management Team member's annual bonus and equity awards are
discretionary awards distributed after measuring each member's contributions    
against quantitative and qualitative goals relative to their individual business
responsibilities. Quantitative goals are relative to the individual's business  
unit, and are not directly related to the performance of the Company or any     
other portfolio relative to any benchmark, or to the size of the Company. An    
example of a quantitative measure is associate turnover ratio. Qualitative      
measures may include staff management and development, process management (ex:  
adherence to internal and external policies), business management and strategic 
business input to the business platform.                                        

   There are no pre-set allocations regarding the split between salary and
bonus.                                                                          

(a)(4) Disclosure of Securities Ownership - As of March 31, 2008:               

As of March 31, 2008, no Portfolio Management Team member owned any Interests in
the registrant.

ITEM  10.  SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS. 
--------------------------------------------------------------                  

There have been no material changes to the procedures by which members may      
recommend nominees to the Registrant's board of managers that would require     
disclosure.                                                                     

ITEM 11.  CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES. 
----------------------------------                                              

(a) The Registrant's Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer
have concluded that the Registrant's disclosure controls and procedures (as     
defined in Rule 30a-3(c) under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended   
(the "1940 Act")) were effective as of a date within 90 days of the filing date 
of this report that includes the disclosure required by this paragraph, based on
their evaluation of the effectiveness of the Registrant's disclosure controls   
and procedures, as required by Rule 30a-3(b) of the 1940 Act.                   

(b) There were no changes in the Registrant's internal control over financial   
reporting (as defined in Rule 30a-3(d) under the 1940 Act) that occurred during 
the second fiscal quarter of the period covered by this report that has         
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the          
Registrant's internal control over financial reporting.

Overview  This Code of Ethics (the “Code”) covers a wide range of ethical conduct with a focus on obligations with respect to personal securities trading. You are obligated to comply with the terms of this Code, and
thus you are a “Covered Person” for purposes of this Code, if you have been notified by Bank of America’s Compliance Department (“Compliance”) that this Code applies to you.  You will likely be notified by Compliance that this Code applies to you if you are a director, officer or employee of one of the following companies (the business
conducted by the following companies will be collectively referred to as the “Asset Management Business”):   


 
•
 
 Columbia Management Advisors, LLC (“CMA”)   


 
•
 
 Banc of America Investment Advisors, Inc.   


 
•
 
 Bank of America Capital Advisors, LLC   


 
•
 
 BACAP Alternative Advisors, Inc.   


 
•
 
 Columbia Management Distributors, Inc.   


 
•
 
 Columbia Management Services, Inc.  You may be
notified by Compliance that this Code applies to you, and thus you are a “Covered Person” for purposes of this Code, if you are a support partner of the Asset Management Business. For example, associates in legal, risk, compliance,
technology and other support units, while not employees of the Asset Management Business, are likely to be notified that this Code applies to them due to their status as a support partner of the Asset Management Business.  You may be notified by Compliance that this Code applies to you, and thus you are a “Covered Person” for purposes of this Code, if you work for Bank of
America, N.A. For example, Bank of America, N.A. associates in the Private Bank and Product Group are likely to be notified that this Code applies to them due to their access to certain research of, or other interaction with, the Asset Management
Business.  You may be notified by Compliance that this Code applies to you, and thus you are a “Covered Person” for purposes of this Code, if you
work for United States Trust Company, NA, UST Advisers, Inc. or a related company (“US Trust”). Such notification may state that the provisions of the U.S. Trust Investment Adviser Code of Ethics (“US Trust Code”), rather than
the provisions contained in this Code, apply to you. If you are notified that the provisions of the US Trust Code apply to you, then you are obligated to comply with the provisions of the US Trust Code, and you are not obligated to comply with the
provisions contained in this Code, until you are otherwise notified by Compliance.  Certain Covered Persons, including but not limited to portfolio
managers, traders and research analysts, may also be designated by Compliance as “Investment Persons” and have heightened responsibility under this Code. Investment Persons are obligated to comply with all provisions of the Code applicable
to Covered Persons and additional provisions applicable to Investment Persons.  If you are registered with the NASD, you may have additional obligations
not identified in this Code due to such registration.  If you believe you should have been notified by Compliance that this Code applies to you and have
not been so notified, you are obligated to contact Compliance.  This Code governs, among other things, personal securities transactions of you and members
of your immediate household. You should be familiar with the terms “Personal Securities Transaction” as defined in Appendix B and “Beneficial Ownership” as defined in Appendix A. These terms are very broad for purposes of the
Code and may include transactions and securities that you intuitively would not expect to be included.  Part I of this Code sets forth certain general
principals relating to the Code. Part II identifies certain prohibited transactions and activities. Part III identifies your obligation to pre-clear your personal security transactions. Part IV 
  
1 



identifies your reporting obligations with respect to your Personal Securities Transactions and holdings. Part V sets forth sanctions for failure to comply
with this Code.  The Asset Management Code of Ethics Oversight Committee (the “Committee”) is responsible for enforcing compliance with this
Code. Failure to comply with this Code may result in disciplinary action, including termination of employment.  This Code is intended to satisfy the
requirements of Rule 204A-1 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”) and Rule 17j-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Investment Company Act”). In addition, this Code is intended to satisfy certain
NASD requirements for registered personnel.  Terms used herein that are capitalized have the meaning set forth in Appendix B   
2 


Part I – Statement of General Principles  Our relationship with our Clients is fiduciary in nature. A fiduciary has an affirmative duty of care, loyalty, honesty and good faith. A number of specific obligations
flow from the fiduciary duty we owe to our Clients, including:  To act solely in the best interests of Clients and to make full and fair disclosure of all
material facts, particularly where the Asset Management Business’ interest may conflict with those of its Clients;   


 
•
 
 To have a reasonable, independent basis for our investment advice;   


 
•
 
 To ensure that our investment advice is suitable to the Client’s investment objectives, needs and circumstances;   


 
•
 
 To refrain from effecting Personal Securities Transactions inconsistent with our Clients’ interests;   


 
•
 
 To obtain best execution for our Clients’ securities transactions;   


 
•
 
 To refrain from favoring the interest of a particular Client over the interests of another Client;   


 
•
 
 To keep all information about Clients (including former Clients) confidential, including the Client’s identity, Client’s securities holdings information,
and other non-public information; and   


 
•
 
 To exercise a high degree of care to ensure that adequate and accurate representations and other information is presented.  All Covered Persons are in a position of trust and that position of trust dictates that you act at all times with the utmost integrity, avoid any actual or potential
conflict of interest (described below), and not otherwise abuse that position of trust. As a fiduciary, you are required to put the interests of our Clients before your personal interests. All Covered Persons have a fiduciary duty with respect to
each and all of our Clients.  A conflict of interest is any situation that presents an incentive to act other than in the best interest of a Client. A
conflict of interest may arise, for example, when a Covered Person engages in a transaction that potentially favors: (i) BAC’s interests over a Client’s interest, (ii) an associate’s interest over a Client’s interest,
or (iii) one Client’s interest over another Client’s interest.  The Asset Management Business has adopted various policies designed to
prevent, or otherwise manage, conflicts of interest. To effectively manage conflicts of interest, all Covered Persons must seek to prevent conflicts of interest, including the appearance of a conflict. Covered Persons must be vigilant about
circumstances that present a conflict of interest and immediately seek assistance from their manager or one of the other resources identified in Part I.D of this Code.  Independence in the investment decision-making process is paramount. All Covered Persons must avoid situations that might compromise or call into question their exercise of independent judgment in the interest of
Clients. For example, Covered Persons should not take personal advantage of unusual or limited investment opportunities appropriate for Clients.  The
general principles discussed in this section govern all conduct, regardless of whether or not such conduct is also covered by more specific standards and procedures set forth in other sections of this Code.   


A.
Compliance with the Spirit of the Code  Sound, responsible
personal securities trading is an appropriate activity when it is not excessive in nature, when it is conducted consistent with the Code and when it does not cause any actual, potential or apparent conflict of interest.  Personal trading activity which is inconsistent with duties to our Clients or which injures the reputation and professional standing of our organization will not be
tolerated. Technical compliance with the specific requirements of this Code will not insulate you from sanction should a review of your personal securities trades indicate breach of your duty of loyalty to a Client or otherwise pose harm to our
organization’s reputation.  The Committee has the authority to grant written waivers of the provisions of this Code. It is expected that this
authority will be exercised only in rare instances.

B.
Federal Law Prohibits Fraudulent and Deceptive Acts  All
Covered Persons are required to comply with all Federal Securities Laws, including but not limited to Rule 204A-1 of the Advisers Act, Rule 17j-1 of the Investment Company Act and the anti-fraud provisions of both the Advisers Act and Investment
Company Act.  The Advisers Act makes it unlawful for any investment adviser, directly or indirectly, to employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud
any client or prospective client, or to engage in any transaction or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit on such persons.  The Investment Company
Act makes it unlawful for any director, trustee, officer or employee of an investment adviser of an investment company, as well as certain other persons, in connection with the purchase or sale, directly or indirectly, by such person of a security
held or to be acquired by the investment company:   


 
1.
To employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud the fund;   


 
2.
To make to the fund any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state to the fund a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading;   


 
3.
To engage in any act, practice, or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the fund; or   


 
4.
To engage in any manipulative practice with respect to the fund.   


C.
Compliance with other BAC Policies  Compliance with this
Code is in addition to your obligation to comply with other BAC policies that may be applicable to you, including but not limited to those set forth on Appendix C.   


D.
Contacts for Questions and Reporting Violations of this Code  Each Covered Person must promptly report any conduct that he or she reasonably believes constitutes or may constitute a violation of the Code. Covered Persons must promptly report all relevant facts and circumstances relating to such
potential violation of the Code to either the CCO (currently, Linda Wondrack at 617.772.3543) or the Ethics and Compliance Helpline at 888.411.1744 (domestic) or 770.623.6334 (international). If you wish to remain anonymous, you may simply refer to
yourself as a “BAC Associate.” You will not be retaliated against for reporting information in good faith in accordance with this policy.  All
questions, comments or concerns may be directed to Columbia Management’s Ombudsperson (currently, Kevin V. Wasp at 212.893.7246).  In addition, if you
have any questions relating to a Personal Securities Transaction, you may call the Associate Investment Monitoring Department directly at 980.388.3300 or send an email to “Corporate Compliance, PST.” And if you have any questions relating
to the conflict of interest provisions of this Code, you may contact Columbia Management’s Conflicts of Interest Officer directly (currently, Lee Faria at 617.772.3786).   


E.
Training and Education  Training on this Code will occur
periodically. All Covered Persons are required to attend all training sessions and read any applicable materials.

Part II – Prohibited Transactions and Activities  Part II of the Code focuses on personal securities trading and identifies certain prohibited transactions and activities. In the event there is a stated exception to a
prohibited transaction and you qualify for the exception, you are not relieved of any other obligation you may have under this Code, including any requirement to pre-clear and report the transaction.   


A.
Prohibited Transactions in Mutual Funds   


1.
Short-Term Trading Prohibition.  No Covered Person shall engage in
a Personal Securities Transaction that involves the purchase and subsequent sale or exchange of the same class of shares of a Reportable Fund within 30 calendar days of one another. Therefore, if a Covered Person purchases shares of a Reportable
Fund, he or she will not be permitted to sell or exchange any shares of that fund, including shares previously purchased, for at least 30 calendar days. The CCO has the authority to grant exceptions to the requirements of this section; however, such
exceptions will be granted in only rare cases of hardship or other unusual circumstances.   


2.
Late Trading Prohibition.  Late trading of mutual funds is illegal.
No Covered Person shall engage in any transaction in any mutual fund shares where the order is placed after the fund is closed for the day and the transaction is priced using the closing price for that day. In addition to being illegal, late trading
presents a conflict of interest and a violation of fiduciary duty.   


3.
Market Timing Prohibition.  No Covered Person shall engage in
mutual fund market timing activities. The Committee believes that the interests of a mutual fund’s long-term shareholders and the ability of a mutual fund to manage its investments may be adversely affected when fund shares are repeatedly
bought, sold or exchanged by any individual or entity within short periods of time to take advantage of short-term differentials in the net asset values of such funds. This practice, known as “market timing,” can occur in direct purchases
and sales of mutual fund shares, through rapid reallocation of funds held in a 401(k) plan or similarly structured retirement plan or other accounts invested in mutual fund assets, or through the rapid reallocation of funds held in variable annuity
and variable life policies invested in mutual fund assets. In addition to being prohibited by this Code, mutual fund market timing presents a conflict of interest and is a violation of fiduciary duty.   


B.
Prohibited Transactions in Reportable Securities    


1.
Client Conflict.  No Covered Person shall engage in a Personal
Securities Transaction that involves the purchase or sale of a Reportable Security seven days before or seven days after such security is purchased or sold by a Client Account when such Covered Person has advance knowledge that such security will be
purchased or sold by a Client Account. Whether a Covered Person has “advance knowledge” will depend upon the facts and circumstances and such knowledge may be imputed where the facts and circumstance indicate that a prudent person would
conclude that there is a reasonable probability that a Client Account may transact in the security. Certain types of Covered Persons, such as portfolio managers, traders and analysts, will be subject to heightened scrutiny for compliance with this
section.  No Covered Person shall engage in a Personal Securities Transaction that involves the purchase or sale of any Reportable Security when, at the
time of such purchase or sale, the Covered Person knew or should have known, that the same class of security is the subject of an open buy or sell order for a Client Account or is Being Considered for Purchase or Sale by a Client Account.
 These restrictions do not apply:   


 
•
 
 to securities of an issuer that has a market capitalization of $10 billion or more at the time of the transactions; or   
5 




 
•
 
 when the personal trade matches with a Client Account which principally follows a passive investment strategy of attempting to replicate the performance of an
index.   


2.
IPOs and Limited Offerings.  No Covered Person shall engage in a
Personal Securities Transaction that involves the purchase of a security in an IPO or Limited Offering except with the prior written approval of the CCO. Covered Persons registered with the NASD are prohibited from investing in IPOs. In approving
such purchase, the CCO will consider whether the purchase conflicts with the Code or its underlying policies, whether the investment opportunity should be reserved for Clients, and whether the opportunity has been offered to the Covered Person
because of the Covered Person’s relationship with a Client. The CCO may approve acquisition under certain circumstances, such as:   


 
•
 
 An opportunity to acquire securities of an insurance company converting from a mutual ownership structure to a stockholder ownership structure, if the Covered
Person’s ownership of an insurance policy issued by the IPO company or an affiliate of the IPO company conveys the investment opportunity;   


 
•
 
 An opportunity resulting from the Covered Person’s pre-existing ownership of an interest in the IPO company or status of an investors in the IPO company; or
  


 
•
 
 An opportunity made available to the Covered Person’s spouse, in circumstances permitting the CCO reasonably to determine that the opportunity is being made
available for reasons other than the Covered Person’s relationship with BAC or its Clients (for example, because of the spouse’s employment).   


3.
Short-Term Trading (30 Calendar Days) .  No Covered Person shall
engage in a Personal Securities Transaction that results in a profit from any purchase and sale, or any sale and purchase, of the same class of Reportable Security within any period of 30 calendar days or less. Note, regarding this restriction,
that:   


 
(a)
The 30 calendar day restriction period commences the day after the purchase or sale of any Reportable Security.   


 
(b)
The 30-day restriction applies on a “last in, first out basis.” As a result, any transaction that results in a profit from any purchase and sale, or any sale and purchase,
of the same class of Reportable Security within any period of 30 calendar days or less is prohibited, regardless of whether the specific shares involved were held longer than 30 days.   


 
(c)
Purchase and sale transactions in the same security within 30 days that result in a loss are not restricted.   


 
(d)
The 30-day restriction does not apply to the exercise of options to purchase shares of BAC stock and the immediate sale of the same or identical shares, including so-called
“cashless exercise” transactions.   


 
(e)
Strategies involving options with expirations of less than 30 days may result in violations of the short-term trading ban.   


 
(f)
Exceptions to the short-term trading ban may be requested in writing, addressed to the CCO, in advance of a trade and will generally be granted only in rare cases of hardship,
gifting of securities or other unusual circumstances where it is determined that no abuse is involved and the equities of the situation strongly support an exception to the ban. Circumstances that could provide the basis for an exception from
short-term trading restriction might include, for example, among others:   


 
•
 
 an involuntary transaction that is the result of unforeseen corporate activity;   


 
•
 
 the disclosure of a previously nonpublic, material corporate, economic or political event or activity that could cause a reasonable person in like circumstances to
sell a security even if originally purchased as a long-term investment; or   
6 




 
•
 
 the Covered Person’s economic circumstances materially change in such a manner that enforcement of the short-term trading ban would result in the Covered
Person being subjected to an avoidable, inequitable economic hardship.   


 
•
 
 An irrevocable gift of securities provided no abuse is intended.   


4.
Bank of America Closed-end Funds.  No Covered Person shall engage
in a Personal Securities Transaction that involves the purchase of shares of any Closed-end Fund advised by BAC except with the prior written approval of Compliance.   


5.
Excessive Trading.  Covered Persons are strongly discouraged from
engaging in excessive Personal Securities Transactions. Although this Code does not define excessive Personal Securities Transactions, Personal Securities Transactions that exceed thirty per month will be reviewed by Compliance.   


6.
Restricted List.  When certain equity analysts initiate coverage or
change a rating on a Reportable Security, the security is put on a restricted list and remains on the restricted list for seven calendar days. No Covered Person shall engage in a Personal Securities Transaction involving a Reportable Security that
he or she knows, or should have known, is on the restricted list.   


C.
Other Prohibitions   


1.
Disclosure of Nonpublic Information.  Covered Persons are
prohibited from disclosing to persons outside of BAC any material nonpublic information about any Client, the securities investments made on behalf of a Client, information about contemplated securities transactions, or information regarding our
trading strategies, except as required to effectuate securities transactions on behalf of a Client or for other legitimate business purposes. Disclosure of nonpublic information is a breach of fiduciary duty.   


2.
Restriction on Service as Officer or Director by Covered Persons.  Covered Persons are prohibited from serving as an officer or director of any publicly traded company, other than Bank of America Corporation, absent prior authorization from Compliance based on a determination that the board service would
not be inconsistent with the interests of any Client. Covered Persons serving as a director or officer of a private company may be required to resign, either immediately or at the end of the current term, if the company goes public during his or her
term as director or officer.   


3.
Participation in Investment Clubs.  Covered Persons may participate
in private investment clubs or other similar groups only upon advance written approval from Compliance, subject to such terms and conditions as Compliance may determine to impose. Investment Persons may not participate in private investment clubs or
other similar groups.   


4.
Additional Restrictions for Specific Sub-Groups.  Specific
sub-groups in the organization may be subject to additional restrictions, as determined by Compliance. Compliance shall keep separate applicable procedures and communicate accordingly to these groups.   


D.
Additional Trading Restrictions Applicable to Investment Persons   


1.
Fourteen Calendar Day Blackout Period.  No Investment Person shall
engage in a Personal Securities Transaction that involves the purchase or sale of any Reportable Security within a period of seven calendar days before or after a purchase or sale of the same class of security by a Client Account with which the
Investment Person or their team are regularly associated. The spirit of this Code requires that no Investment Person intentionally delay trades on behalf of a Client Account so that their own personal trades avoid falling within the fourteen day
blackout period. This restriction does not apply:   


 
•
 
 to securities of an issuer that has a market capitalization of $10 billion or more at the time of the transactions; however, an Investment Person must pre-clear
these trades as with any other personal trade; or   
7 




 
•
 
 when the personal trade matches one in a Client Account which principally follows a passive index tracking investment strategy.   


2.
IPOs and Limited Offerings.  All Investment Persons are required to
obtain written manager pre-approval for Personal Securities Transactions involving IPOs and Limited Offerings. This means you are required to obtain approval from your immediate manager or their designee. After obtaining manager pre-approval,
Investment Persons must obtain pre-approval from the CCO. The form to request such approval, and instructions relating to the form, are available on Columbia Management’s intranet site under the Compliance tab.  Investment Persons who have been authorized to acquire securities in a Limited Offering are required to disclose that investment to their manager when, within thirty
days of the Investment Person’s acquisition, the Investment Person plays a role in any Client’s consideration of an investment in the issuer. In such circumstances, the decision to purchase securities of the issuer for the Client should be
made either by another employee or, at a minimum, should be subject to an independent review by investment personnel with no personal interest in the issuer.   


3.
Special Restriction on CMA Portfolio Managers  A CMA Portfolio
Manager is prohibited from engaging in a Personal Securities Transaction that involves selling short or otherwise transacting in a security for his or her own account if such Portfolio Manager would be prohibited from taking such action in a Client
Account under CMA’s Short Sales policy.   


4.
Special Restriction on CMA Research Analysts  Each CMA Research
Analyst and Research Associate is prohibited from engaging in a Personal Securities Transaction that involves securities issued by issuers on his or her Coverage List; provided, however, that such person is not restricted from buying a class of an
issuer’s securities for which they are not making recommendations. For example, a CMA bond Research Analyst would be restricted from buying bonds of an issuer on his or her Coverage List, but would not be restricted from buying stock of the
issuer. This restriction includes securities convertible into, options on, and derivatives of, such securities, but does not apply to any position opened prior to July 1, 2007 or open at the time such CMA Research Analyst or Research Associate
is hired by CMA.   


E.
Exemptions  The following Personal Securities Transactions
are exempt from the prohibitions contained in this Part II:   


 
•
 
 Transactions effected pursuant to an Automatic Investment Plan; provided, however, that this exemption does not apply to: (i) transactions that override or
otherwise depart from the pre-determined schedule or allocation features of the investment plan and (ii) the Special Restrictions on CMA Research Analysts contained in Part II - Section D4   


 
•
 
 Purchases effected upon the exercise of rights issued by an issuer pro rata to all holders of a class of its securities, to the extent such rights were acquired
from such issuer, and sales of such rights so acquired.   


 
•
 
 Transactions that are non-volitional (e.g., stock splits, automatic conversions).   


 
•
 
 Transactions involving securities issued by BAC; provided, however, that this exemption does not apply to BAC securities purchased in a Limited Offering. BAC
securities are subject to the short-term trading provisions of this Code and the standards of conduct and liability discussed in the Bank of America Corporation’s General Policy on Insider Trading.   
8 


Part III – Pre-Clearance of Transactions   


A.
General Requirement to Pre-clear  Covered Persons must
pre-clear all Personal Securities Transactions in Reportable Securities using the appropriate pre-clearance procedures. In addition, Covered Persons must pre-clear Personal Securities Transactions involving redemptions or exchanges of Reportable
Funds.   


B.
Procedures  Pre-clearance procedures are described on
Columbia Management’s intranet homepage. Pre-clearance requests must be submitted during New York Stock Exchange hours. Pre-clearance approvals are valid until 4:00 pm eastern time of the same business day as approval. For example, if a
pre-clearance approval is granted on Tuesday, the approval is valid only until 4:00 pm eastern time Tuesday.   


C.
Exemptions  The following transactions are exempt from the
pre-clearance requirement:   


 
•
 
 Transactions in BAC Retirement Plans   


 
•
 
 Transactions in Company-Directed 401(k) Plans

•
 
 Transactions by a Covered Person on an official leave of absence who does not have home system access.   


 
•
 
 Transactions effected pursuant to an Automatic Investment Plan. Note this does not include transactions that override or otherwise depart from the pre-determined
schedule or allocation features of the investment plan.   


 
•
 
 Purchases effected upon the exercise of rights issued by an issuer pro rata to all holders of a class of its securities, to the extent such rights were acquired
from such issuer, and sales of such rights so acquired.   


 
•
 
 Transactions that are non-volitional (e.g., stock splits, automatic conversions).   


 
•
 
 Securities issued by BAC.

address:  Bank of America Compliance Risk Management  Personal Trading Department  100 North Tryon Street  Charlotte, NC 28255  NC1-002-32-27
  


C.
Exceptions from the above Reporting Requirements  The
designation of any Covered Person on an official leave of absence will be reviewed by the CCO to determine whether the individual should still be considered a Covered Person. The CCO will consider factors such as whether the employee continues to
have password access to electronic firm and client data and whether the employee 
  
10 



continues to be in contact with other Covered Persons at the firm. If the CCO determines the individual is not a Covered Person, the individual will be
exempt from the above reporting requirements while on leave. However, any Covered Person on an official leave of absence with such access will be responsible for the above reporting.  The following Investment Accounts do not need to be reported:   


 
•
 
 BAC Retirement Plans   


 
•
 
 Company-Directed 401(k) Plans that do not hold any Reportable Funds or Reportable Securities  The following Personal Securities Transactions do not need to be reported:   


 
•

•

schedule or allocation features of the investment plan.   


D.
Code Administration  The Committee has charged Compliance
with the responsibility of day-to-day administration of this Code. Compliance will quarterly provide reports to the Committee that will include all material violations noted during the period. The quarterly report will include associate name, job
title, manager name, description of the violation, and a record of any recommended sanction.  The CCO shall report any relevant issues to the respective
Fund CCO and mutual fund board of trustees as required by Rule 17j-1 of the Investment Company Act and such fund’s code of ethics.  Part V
– Penalties for Non-Compliance  Upon discovering a violation of the Code, Compliance shall take whatever remedial steps it deems necessary and
available to correct an actual or apparent conflict (e.g., trade reversal, etc.). Following those corrective efforts, the Committee may impose sanctions if, based upon all of the facts and circumstances considered, such action is deemed appropriate.
The magnitude of these penalties varies with the severity of the violation, although repeat offenders will likely be subjected to harsher punishment. It is important to note that violations of the Code may occur without employee fault (e.g., despite
pre-clearance). In those cases, punitive action may not be warranted, although remedial steps may still be necessary. Violations of the Code include, but are not limited to, the following:   


 
•
 
 Execution of a Personal Securities Transaction without proper pre-clearance;   


 
•
 
 Execution of a Personal Securities Transaction with pre-clearance, but Client account activity in the same issuer occurs within seven days of the employee’s

Appendix A – Beneficial Ownership  You should carefully read this Appendix A to determine securities that are deemed to be beneficially owned by you for purposes of the Code. The definition
of “Beneficial Ownership” for purposes of the Code is very broad and may include securities you would not intuitively consider to be owned by you. You should review this entire Appendix A and if you have any questions as to whether you
beneficially own a security for purposes of the Code, contact the Associate Investment Monitoring Department at 980.388.3300 or send an email to “Corporate Compliance, PST”.  For purposes of this Appendix A, the term “you” includes members of your immediate family sharing the same household with you. Your
“immediate family” includes any child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, spouse, significant other, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law (but does not
include aunts and uncles, or nieces and nephews). The term “you” also includes any immediate family member not living in your household if the family member is economically dependent upon you.  Definitions  Beneficial Ownership. For purposes of the
Code, you are deemed to have “Beneficial Ownership” of a security if you have: (i) a Pecuniary Interest in such security and Influence or Control over such security or (ii) Influence or Control over such security and such
Influence or Control arises outside of your regular employment duties.  Influence or Control. To have “Influence or Control” over a
security, you must have an ability to prompt, induce or otherwise effect transactions in the security. Whether you have influence or control over a security is based upon the facts and circumstances of each case; however, the determining factor in
each case will be whether you have an ability to prompt, induce or otherwise effect transactions in the security.  Pecuniary Interest. The term
“Pecuniary Interest” means the opportunity, directly or indirectly, to profit or share in any profit derived from a transaction in the subject securities whether through any contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship or otherwise.
This standard looks beyond the record owner of securities to reach the substance of a particular arrangement. You not only have a Pecuniary Interest in securities held by you for your own benefit, but also securities held (regardless of whether or
how they are registered) by others for your benefit, such as securities held for you by custodians, brokers, relatives, executors, administrators, or trustees. The term also includes any security owned by an entity directly or indirectly controlled
by you.   
13 


Examples of How the Definition of Beneficial Ownership is Applied  Set forth below are some examples of how the definition of Beneficial Ownership is applied in different contexts.   


 
•
 
 Family Holdings. You are deemed to have Beneficial Ownership of securities held by members of your immediate family sharing the same household with you. Your
“immediate family” includes any child, stepchild, grandchild, parent, stepparent, grandparent, spouse, significant other, sibling, mother-in-law, father-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-law (but does not
include aunts and uncles, or nieces and nephews). You are deemed to have Beneficial Ownership of securities held by an immediate family member not living in your household if the family member is economically dependent upon you.
  


 
•
 
 Partnership and Corporate Holdings. You are deemed to have Beneficial Ownership of securities held by an entity you directly or indirectly control. If you are a
limited partner in a partnership, you will generally not be deemed to have Beneficially Ownership of securities held by such limited partnership, provided that you do not own a controlling voting interest in the partnership. If you own or otherwise
control a corporation, limited liability company or other legal entity, you will be deemed to have Beneficial Ownership of such entity’s securities.   


 
•
 
 Trusts. You are deemed to have Beneficial Ownership of securities held by a trust if you control the trust or if you have the ability to prompt, induce or otherwise
effect transactions in securities held by the trust. For example, you would be deemed to have Beneficial Ownership of securities held by a trust if you have the power to revoke the trust without the consent of another person, or if you have actual
or de facto investment control over the trust. In a typical blind trust, you would not be deemed to have Beneficial Ownership of the securities held by the trust.   


 
•
 
 Estates. You are typically not deemed to have Beneficial Ownership of securities held by executors or administrators in estates in which you are a legatee or
beneficiary unless, under the facts and circumstances, you have the ability to prompt, induce or otherwise effect transactions in the securities held by the estate. You are typically deemed to have Beneficial Ownership of securities held by an
estate if you act as the executor or administrator of such estate and, under the facts and circumstances, you have the ability to prompt, induce or otherwise effect transactions in the securities held by the estate.   


 
•
 
 Where You Have Given Investment Discretion to Another Party. You are typically not deemed to have Beneficial Ownership of securities managed by someone other than
yourself where you have given such party sole investment discretion. For example, you are not deemed to have Beneficial Ownership of securities held in an account at the Private Bank or BAI if the Private Bank or BAI exercises sole investment
discretion with respect to such securities.   


 
•
 
 Where You Have Received Investment Discretion from Another Party Outside of Your Employment. You are typically deemed to have Beneficial Ownership of securities
held in an account or other vehicle if you manage such account or other vehicle outside of your employment, even if you do not have an economic interest in such securities. For example, you are deemed to have Beneficial Ownership of securities held
in a brokerage account if you have a power of attorney with respect to the account. Similarly, you are deemed to have Beneficial Ownership of securities held in an Education Trust if you have an ability to prompt, induce or otherwise effect
transactions in such securities, even if you do not have an economic interest in the asset of the trust.

FEE TABLE AND SYNOPSIS.  The following Fee Table
and Synopsis summarizes the aggregate expenses of UST Global Private Markets Fund, LLC (the “Registrant” or “Company”), and are intended to assist prospective Investors (as defined below) in understanding the costs and expenses
borne directly or indirectly by investing in the Company. The Company emphasizes allocation of Member (as defined below) capital by investing in a diversified group of private equity funds formed by a fund sponsor or sponsors experienced in making
private equity investments. Private equity funds may include funds pursuing investment strategies in buyout, venture capital and special situations (the “Portfolio Funds”).  This fee table assumes that Company raises $150 million in total commitments, 50% of total commitments are drawn down in the first year (after the final
closing), and that 90% of drawn-down commitments are invested.

ITEM 8.
GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRANT.  Description of the
Company  UST Global Private Markets Fund, LLC (the “Company” or the “Registrant”) is a limited liability company
organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on February 2, 2007 and is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “1940 Act”), as a closed-end non-diversified management investment company. The Company
will offer and sell units of limited liability company interests in the Company (the “Units” or “Interests”) in minimum denominations of $50,000 to “accredited investors” and “qualified clients.” The Company
is seeking capital commitments (the “Commitments”) from investors. The minimum offering size is $60 million. UST Advisers, Inc. (the “Investment Adviser”) serves as the investment adviser of the Company. U.S. Trust Hedge Fund
Management, Inc. or an affiliate, will serve as the special member (the “Special Member”) of the Company. CTC Consulting, Inc. (the “Investment Consultant”) serves as the investment consultant to the Investment Adviser. Investors
who purchase Interests will be admitted to the Company by the Investment Adviser and will become members of the Company (the “Members”).  Investment Objective  The investment objective of the Company is long-term capital appreciation. Neither the Company nor the
Investment Adviser guarantees any level of return or risk on investments and there can be no assurance that the investment objective will be achieved. However, it is the expectation that the Company will generate a total return over the life of the
Company that will exceed the return of the global public equities market and compensate the Investor for the additional risk taken by investing in private equity funds formed by fund sponsors experienced in making private equity investments
(“Portfolio Funds”). Diversification benefits based on vintage years, although possible, are not an objective of the Company.   
A-3 


Investment Philosophy  The Investment Adviser is guided by a set of principles that it believes is essential to make successful private equity investments. They are outlined as follows:   


 
1.
Developing a private equity allocation is a long-term process that requires an investor to continuously and selectively commit capital to private equity investments.
  


 
2.
Building successful private equity portfolios requires skillful management of risks associated with portfolio cash flows, manager selection and concentrations among strategies,
vintage years Portfolio Funds, fund sponsors, geographies and industries.   


 
3.
Attractive private equity returns are generated by investing in funds managed by professionals with demonstrated track record of success across multiple market, industry, technology
and innovation cycles.   


 
4.
Investors are better served by investing in Portfolio Funds that exhibit a strong alignment of interest with their investors as expressed in the terms of the Portfolio Fund’s
limited partnership agreement and the manner in which the fund sponsor manages its organization.   


 
5.
Given the long-term illiquid nature of private equity investing, investors should have a strong appreciation for the potential risk presented by each Portfolio Fund investment.
  


 
6.
Maintain a value orientation when allocating among private equity strategies and selecting Portfolio Funds.  Investment Strategy  The Company will seek to achieve
its objective by pursuing a strategy of committing at least 85% of Commitments in Portfolio Funds.  Private equity funds may include
Portfolio Funds pursuing investment strategies in buyouts, venture capital and special situations (distressed debt, mezzanine, secondaries, natural resources, opportunistic real estate, royalties and other private equity strategies perceived to be
attractive by the Investment Adviser). Such funds often have a focus on one or more industry, country, region or investment-related themes. Such funds seek to generate returns primarily through long-term capital appreciation; however at times some
Portfolio Funds may generate some current income and short-term capital appreciation.  The Company will seek to identify six to fifteen
Portfolio Funds within eighteen months of the Company’s final closing. The Company will leverage the relationships established by the Investment Adviser among private equity fund sponsors to gain access to attractive Portfolio Funds. The
Investment Adviser will employ a proactive, disciplined and diligent investment process by which prospective Portfolio Funds will be sourced, reviewed and selected.   
A-4 


The Company will seek to tactically over-weight or under-weight its allocation to the various private
equity strategies perceived by the Investment Adviser to be more or less attractive from an expected risk and return perspective. Tactical allocations are influenced by a value-oriented perspective with regards to capital flows within a private
equity strategy, valuations for new investments to be made by Portfolio Funds, risk within transaction structures, expectations for change within a strategy over the near-term and perceived attractiveness for a private equity strategy. The exposures
to specific private equity strategies will also be influenced by the Investment Adviser’s ability to gain access to top-tier fund sponsors in a specific strategy. Although, the Investment Adviser may target specific strategies, regions or
industries for investment, the Investment Adviser will not compromise on the caliber of the fund sponsors pursued for investment in order to make an allocation to a targeted strategy. The chart below (1) presents the expected private equity
strategy allocations for the Company in the current market environment relative to the long-term capital flows in private equity.  Private Equity Strategy Allocation

(1)
There can be no assurance that the positions created by the Portfolio Funds selected for the Company will create a portfolio with the allocations described above. The Investment
Adviser does not control and does not have influence on the investment activity of the fund sponsors investing the capital of the Portfolio Funds. The Investment Adviser’s expected allocations to each Portfolio Fund will be guided by the
historical investment activity and the expected investment activity as articulated by the fund sponsors in the offering memoranda and accompanying due diligence information for their respective Portfolio Funds.  Investment Policies and Restrictions  The Company has
adopted certain fundamental investment restrictions, which cannot be changed without the vote of a majority of the Company’s outstanding voting securities (as defined by the 1940 Act). The Company’s fundamental investment restrictions are
as follows:   


 
1.
The Company will not invest 25% or more of the value of its total assets in the securities (other than U.S. Government Securities) of issuers engaged in any single industry. (This
restriction does not apply to the Company’s investments in Portfolio Funds.)   
A-5 




 
2.
The Company will not issue senior securities representing stock, except that, to the extent permitted by the 1940 Act, (a) the Company may borrow money from banks, brokers and
other lenders, to finance portfolio transactions and engage in other transactions involving the issuance by the Company of “senior securities” representing indebtedness, and (b) the Company may borrow money from banks for temporary or
emergency purposes.   


 
3.
The Company will not underwrite securities of other issuers, except insofar as the Company may be deemed an underwriter under the Securities Act in connection with the disposition
of its portfolio securities.   


 
4.
The Company will not make loans of money or securities to other persons, except through purchasing fixed-income securities, lending portfolio securities or entering into repurchase
agreements in a manner consistent with the Company’s investment policies.   


 
5.
The Company will not purchase or sell commodities or commodity contracts, except that it may purchase and sell foreign currency, options, futures and forward contracts, including
those related to indexes, and options on indices, and may invest in commodity pools and other entities that purchase and sell commodities and commodity contracts.   


 
6.
The Company will not purchase, hold or deal in real estate, except that it may invest in securities that are secured by real estate or that are issued by companies that invest or
deal in real estate.  The investment objective of the Company is also fundamental and may not be changed without a vote of a
majority of the Company’s outstanding voting securities.  Under the 1940 Act, the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting
securities of an investment company, such as the Company, means the vote, at an annual or a special meeting of the security holders of the Company duly called, (A) of 67% or more of the voting securities present at the meeting, if the holders
of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the Company are present or represented by proxy or (B) of more than 50% of the outstanding voting securities of the company, whichever is less.  With respect to these investment restrictions, and other policies described in this Registration Statement, the Company will not look through the
Portfolio Funds. In addition, if a percentage restriction is adhered to at the time of an investment or transaction, a later change in percentage resulting from a change in the values of investments or the value of the Company’s total assets,
unless otherwise stated, will not constitute a violation of such restriction or policy.   
A-6 


Risk Factors  In considering participation in the Company, the prospective Investors should be aware of certain risk factors, which include the following:   


 
1.
Business and Market Risks  The Company’s investment
portfolio will consist of Portfolio Funds which will hold securities issued primarily by privately held companies, and operating results for the portfolio companies in a specified period will be difficult to predict. Such investments involve a high
degree of business and financial risk that can result in substantial losses.   


 
2.
Lack of Operating History  The Company is a newly formed
entity and has no operating history upon which prospective Investors can evaluate its performance. The investment program of the Company should be evaluated on the basis that there can be no assurance that the Investment Adviser’s assessment of
the short-term or long-term prospects of investments will prove accurate or that the Company will achieve its investment objectives. Past performance of the managers of the Portfolio Funds is no indication of future performance.   


 
3.
Dependence on the Investment Adviser  The success of the
Company is significantly dependent upon the ability of the Investment Adviser to achieve the Company’s investment objectives. The performance of the Investment Adviser’s prior investments is not necessarily indicative of the Company’s
future results.   


 
4.
Investment in Junior Securities  The securities in which
each Portfolio Fund will invest may be among the most junior in a portfolio company’s capital structure and, thus, subject to the greatest risk of loss. Generally, there will be no collateral to protect an investment once made.   


 
5.
Leveraged Investments  A Portfolio Fund’s
investments, depending upon its strategy, may be in companies whose capital structures are highly leveraged. Such investments involve a high degree of risk in that adverse fluctuations in the cash flow of such companies, or increased interest rates,
may impair their ability to meet their obligations, which may accelerate and magnify declines in the value of any such portfolio company investments in a down market.   


 
6.
Limited Transferability of Interests  There will be no
public market for the Interests, and none is expected to develop. There are substantial restrictions upon the transferability of Interests under the Limited Liability Company Agreement of the Company (the “Company Agreement”) and
applicable securities laws.   
A-7 




 
7.
Diversification/Concentration of Investments  The Company
is a “non-diversified” investment company. Thus, there are no percentage limitations imposed by the 1940 Act on the percentage of the Company’s assets that may be invested in the securities of any one issuer. However, the Company
generally will not commit more than 20% of the value of its total Commitments (measured at the time of commitment) in the securities of a single Portfolio Fund. The Investment Adviser believes that this approach helps to reduce overall investment
risk. In addition, each Portfolio Fund will participate in a limited number of investments and may seek to make several investments in one industry or one industry segment. As a result, each Portfolio Fund’s investment portfolio could become
highly concentrated, and the performance of a few holdings may substantially affect its aggregate return. Furthermore, to the extent that the capital raised is less than the targeted amount, a Portfolio Fund may invest in fewer portfolio companies
and thus be less diversified.   


 
8.
Illiquidity; Lack of Current Distributions  An investment
in the Company is illiquid. It is uncertain as to when profits, if any, will be realized. Losses on unsuccessful investments may be realized before gains on successful investments are realized. The return of capital and the realization of gains, if
any, generally will occur only upon the partial or complete disposition of an underlying investment by a Portfolio Fund. While an investment may be sold at any time, it is not generally expected that this will occur for a number of years after the
initial investment. Before such time, there may be no current return on the investment.  Due to the pattern of cash flows in private equity
funds and the illiquid nature of their investments, Investors typically will see negative returns in the Company’s early stages; in particular it can take several years for Portfolio Fund investments to be realized during which time management
fees will be continued to be drawn from committed capital and certain underperforming investments may be written down or written off. Then as investments are able to realize liquidity events, such as a sale or initial public offering, positive
returns will be realized if the Portfolio Fund is successful in achieving its investment strategy.   


 
9.
Absence of Regulatory Oversight  The Portfolio Funds will
not be registered as investment companies under the 1940 Act and the Company, as an investor in these Portfolio Funds, will not have the benefit of the protection afforded by the 1940 Act to investors in registered investment companies (which, among
other protections, require investment companies to have a majority of disinterested directors, require securities held in custody at all times to be individually segregated from the securities of any other person and marked to clearly identify such
securities as the property of such investment company, and regulate the relationship between the adviser and the investment company).   


 
10.
Tax Laws Subject to Change  It is possible that the
current federal, state, local, or foreign income tax treatment accorded an investment in the Company will be modified by legislative, administrative, or judicial action in the future. The nature of additional changes in federal or non-U.S. income
tax law, if any, cannot be determined prior to enactment of any new tax legislation. However, such 
  
A-8 



legislation could significantly alter the tax consequences and decrease the after tax rate of return of an investment in the Company. Potential Investors
therefore should seek, and must rely on, the advice of their own tax advisers with respect to the possible impact on their investments of recent legislation, as well as any future proposed tax legislation or administrative or judicial action.
  


 
11.
In-Kind Distributions  Portfolio Funds may make in-kind
distributions to the Company, and, particularly in the event of a dissolution of a Portfolio Fund such distribution, may contain securities which are not readily marketable. While the general policy of the Company will be to liquidate such
investment and distribute proceeds to the Members, under certain circumstances when deemed appropriate by the Board, a Member may receive in-kind distributions from the Company.   


 
12.
Projections  Projected operating results of a company in
which a Portfolio Fund invests normally will be based primarily on financial projections prepared by each company’s management. In all cases, projections are only estimates of future results that are based upon information received from the
company and assumptions made at the time the projections are developed. There can be no assurance that the results are set forth in the projections will be attained, and actual results may be significantly different from the projections. Also,
general economic factors, which are not predictable, can have a material effect on the reliability of projections.   


 
13.
Carried Interest  The carried interest held by the Special
Member or equivalent of a Portfolio Fund may create an incentive for the Investment Adviser to make high risk portfolio investments in hope of achieving a larger return for the holder of the carried interest.   


 
14.
Need for Follow-On Investments  Following its initial
investment in a given portfolio company, a Portfolio Fund may decide to provide additional funds to such portfolio company or may have the opportunity to increase its investment in a successful portfolio company. There is no assurance that a
Portfolio Fund will make follow-on investments or that a Portfolio Fund will have sufficient funds to make all or any of such investments. Any decision by a Portfolio Fund not to make follow-on investments or its inability to make such investments
(i) may have a subsequent negative effect on a portfolio company in need of such an investment, (ii) result in a lost opportunity for a Portfolio Fund to increase its participation in a successful operation, or (iii) result in a loss
of certain anti-dilution protection.   


 
15.
Non-U.S. Investments  The Company may invest in a
Portfolio Fund that is organized outside of the United States or a Portfolio Fund may invest in portfolio companies that are organized or have substantial sales or operations outside of the United States. Such investments may be subject to certain
additional risk, due to, among other things, potentially unsettled points of applicable 
  
A-9 



governing law, the risks associated with fluctuating currency exchange rates, capital repatriation regulations, the application of complex U.S. and foreign
tax rules to cross-border investments and imposition of foreign taxes on the Company and/or the Members.   


 
16.
Independent Counsel  No independent counsel has been
retained to represent the interests of the Members. Neither the Registration Statement nor the Company Agreement has been reviewed by any attorney on behalf of the Members. Legal counsel to the Company and Investment Adviser does not represent any
Member.   


 
17.
Increased Regulatory Scrutiny  In the environment
following the events of September 11, 2001, the Company and the Investment Adviser expect increased scrutiny by government regulators, investigators, auditors and law enforcement officials regarding the identities and sources of funds of
investors in private investment funds. In that connection, in the future the Company may become subject to additional obligations, such as reporting requirements regarding its investors, including, without limitation, such requirements and
restrictions as may apply under the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the “Patriot Act”). Each Member will be required to provide to the Company such
information as may be required to enable the Company to comply with all applicable legal or regulatory requirements, including, without limitation, the requirements of the Patriot Act (and/or all rules and regulations related thereto), and each
Member will be required to acknowledge and agree that the Company may disclose such information to governmental and/or regulatory or self-regulatory authorities to the extent required by applicable law or regulation and may file such reports with
such authorities as may be required by applicable law or regulation. If required by applicable law, regulation or interpretation thereof, the Company may suspend all activity with respect to a Member’s account with the Company, including
suspending the Member’s right to redeem funds or assets from the Company pending the Company’s receipt of instructions regarding the Member’s account from the appropriate governmental or regulatory authority.   


 
18.
Private Offering Exemption  This offering has not been
registered under the Securities Act, in reliance on the exemptive provisions of Section 4(2) of the Securities Act and Regulation D promulgated thereunder. Section 18(b)(4)(D) of the Securities Act, added by the National Securities Markets
Improvement Act of 1996, preempts state registration of transactions in securities exempt pursuant to “rules and regulations issued by the SEC under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.” Preemption therefore applies to transactions
exempt under Regulation D, but not to transactions exempt under Section 4(2) alone. Because of the lack of uniformity among the state’s securities laws and their general complicated nature, the Company has chosen not to incur the expense
and burden of reviewing exemptions under each state’s laws, but rather rely on the uniform exemption provided by Regulation D.   
A-10 


No assurance can be given that the offering currently qualifies or will continue to qualify under the
exemptive provisions of Regulation D because of, among other things, the adequacy of disclosure and the manner of distribution, the timeliness of filings, the existence of similar offerings in the past or in the future, or the retroactive change of
any securities law or regulation. If the Regulation D exemption is lost, the Company may not be able to avail itself of other state exemptions and successful claims or suits for rescission may be brought and successfully concluded for failure to
register these offerings or for acts or omissions constituting offenses under the Exchange Act, or applicable state securities laws.   


 
19.
Manager Liability  In certain circumstances each Portfolio
Fund is expected to receive the right to appoint a representative to the board of directors of the companies in which it invests. Serving on the board of directors of a portfolio company exposes the Portfolio Fund’s representatives, and
ultimately the Portfolio Fund, to potential liability. Although portfolio companies often have insurance to protect directors and officers from such liability, not all portfolio companies may obtain such insurance, which may be insufficient if
obtained.   


 
20.
Public Company Holdings  A Portfolio Fund’s
investment portfolio may contain securities issued by publicly held companies. Such investments may subject the Portfolio Fund to risks that differ in type or degree from those involved with investments in privately held companies. Such risks
include, without limitation, greater volatility in the valuation of such companies, increased obligations to disclose information regarding such companies, limitations on the ability of the Portfolio Fund to dispose of such securities at certain
times, increased likelihood of shareholder litigation against such companies’ board members, and increased costs associated with each of the aforementioned risks.   


 
21.
Delayed Schedule K-1s  The Company will not be able to
provide final Schedule K-1s to Members for any given fiscal year until after April 15 of the following year. Investors should be prepared for a substantial delay in receiving final Schedule K-1s. The final Schedule K-1s will not be available
until the Company has received tax-reporting information from its Portfolio Funds necessary to prepare final Schedule K-1s. Members will likely be required to obtain extensions of the filing dates for their U.S. federal, state, and local income tax
returns. Members will be responsible for any and all costs and fees incurred by them in connection with obtaining the tax extensions. Each prospective Investor should consult with its own adviser as to the advisability and tax consequences of an
investment in the Company. Portfolio Funds and their portfolio companies may engage in business, otherwise derive income from, and in general be subject to taxing authority in numerous state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. Members, by virtue of
their participation in the Company, may be subject to tax payment and reporting obligations in such jurisdictions under their widely varying rules and regulations. Each Investor should consult an independent adviser regarding how an investment in
the Company may affect his, her, or its state, local, and foreign tax payment and reporting obligations.   
A-11 




 
22.
Risks of Private Equity Investments Generally  The
investments made by the Portfolio Funds will entail a high degree of risk and in most cases be highly illiquid and difficult to value. Unless and until those investments are sold or mature into marketable securities they will remain illiquid. In
addition to the extent a Portfolio Fund focuses on venture capital investments the companies in which the Portfolio Fund will invest may be in a conceptual or early stage of development, may not have a proven operating history, may offer services or
products that are not yet developed or ready to be marketed or that have no established market, may be operating at a loss or have significant fluctuations in operating results, may be engaged in a rapidly changing business, may require substantial
additional capital to support their operations to finance expansion or to maintain their competitive position, or otherwise may have a weak financial condition. As a general matter, companies in which the Portfolio Fund invests may face intense
competition, including competition from companies with far greater financial resources; more extensive research, development, technological, marketing and other capabilities; and a larger number of qualified managerial and technical personnel.
  


 
23.
Capital Contributions  The Company has not yet identified
all of the potential investments that it will make with the capital contributions. Only certain amounts of capital commitments will be drawn-down and the Investor’s full capital commitment will not be immediately invested. It may take a
significant amount of time to fully invest the committed amounts (approximately 4 years). The Company’s performance will only include any commitments that have been drawn-down, thus an Investor’s individual performance will be lower than
the performance of the Company.   


 
24.
Default  The Company will not always contribute the full
amount of its commitment to a Portfolio Fund at the time of its admission to the Portfolio Fund. Instead, the Company will be required to make incremental contributions pursuant to capital calls issued from time to time, by the Portfolio Fund. If
the Company defaults on its commitment or fails to satisfy capital calls in a timely manner then, generally, it will be subject to significant penalties, including the complete forfeiture of the Company’s investment in the Portfolio Fund. Any
failure by the Company to make timely capital contributions in respect of its commitments may (i) impair the ability of the Company to pursue its investment program, (ii) force the Company to borrow, (iii) cause the Company, and,
indirectly, the Investors to be subject to certain penalties from the Portfolio Funds (including the complete forfeiture of the Company’s investment in a Portfolio Fund), or (iv) otherwise impair the value of the Company’s investments
(including the complete devaluation of the Company).  Similarly, Investors will not contribute the full amount of their Commitments to the
Company at the time of their admission. Investors will be required to make incremental contributions pursuant to capital calls issued from time to time, by the Company. Unlike the Portfolio Funds, the Company will have limited recourse in retrieving
un-drawn Commitments in the instance that an Investor defaults on a Commitment. An Investor, or Investors, that default(s) on his/her/its/their Commitment to the Company may cause the Company to, in-turn, default on 
  
A-12 



its commitment to a Portfolio Fund. Thus the Company, and especially the non-defaulting Investors, will bear the penalties of such default (as outlined
above, including, but not limited to, the complete forfeiture of the Company’s investment in a Portfolio Fund and the complete devaluation of the Company). While the Investment Adviser has taken steps to mitigate this risk, including seeking
Commitments from Investors that exceed the commitments that are made to the Portfolio Funds, there is no guarantee that such measures will be sufficient or successful.   


 
25.
Recall of Distributions  The Company may be subject to
terms of the Portfolio Funds which permit the recall of distributions to meet Company obligations. In the event funds are recalled for this purpose, the Company may in turn require Members to return amounts previously distributed to them.
  


ITEM 9.
MANAGEMENT.   


ITEM 9.1(a)
 Board of Managers  The Company’s Board of Managers (the “Board” or “Managers”) has overall responsibility for monitoring and overseeing the
investment program of the Company and its management and operations. The Board will monitor and oversee the business affairs of the Company, including the complete and exclusive authority to oversee and establish policies regarding the management,
conduct and operation of the Company’s business. The Board exercises the same powers, authority and responsibilities on behalf of the Company as are customarily exercised by the directors of an investment company registered under the 1940 Act
organized as a corporation and has complete and exclusive authority to oversee and establish policies regarding the management, conduct and operation of the Company’s business.  Although the Managers review policies regarding the management of the Company and review information regarding the investment program of the Company in
connection with periodic meetings of the Board, they do not have an active role in supervising the Company’s ongoing operations. This means, for example, that the Managers do not select or approve the Company’s investments. The Managers,
in their capacity as such, are not Members of the Company and, accordingly, each Manager in his or her capacity as such has no liability as Members. Managers will not contribute to the capital of the Company in their capacity as Managers, but may
subscribe for Units, subject to the eligibility requirements described in this Registration Statement.  Board of Managers and Officers 
Any vacancy on the Board of Managers may be filled by the remaining Managers, except to the extent the 1940 Act requires the election of Managers by
the Members. The Company’s officers are appointed by the Managers and oversee the management of the day-to-day operations of the Company under the supervision of the Board. All of the officers of the Company are directors, officers or employees
of the Investment Adviser or its affiliates. Certain of the Managers identified below are not affiliated with the Investment Adviser, or its affiliates and are not “interested persons” as defined under Section 2(a)(19) 
  
A-13 



of the 1940 Act of either the Company or the Investment Adviser (the “Independent Managers”). The Managers and officers of the Company also may be
directors and officers of other investment companies managed or advised by the Investment Adviser. To the fullest extent allowed by applicable law, including the 1940 Act, the Company Agreement indemnifies the Managers and officers for all costs,
liabilities and expenses that they may experience as a result of their service as such.  Information regarding the Board of Managers,
including brief biographical information, is set forth below.  Independent Manager Nominees  Independent Manager Nominees

selected for their expertise in certain alternative capabilities. As of December 31, 2006, the Group’s assets under management totaled [$1.8 billion] representing [11] investment vehicles focused on investing in hedge funds, direct private
real estate and private equity.  [The Investment Adviser has entered into an agreement with the Investment Consultant, a company with
significant experience assisting institutional and private clients in identifying and evaluating private investment funds. Pursuant to this agreement, the Investment Consultant provides the Investment Adviser with investment research, analytical
data and due diligence services, which the Investment Adviser uses in evaluating prospective Portfolio Funds and in monitoring the strategies and investment performance of the managers to the Portfolio Funds. The Investment Consultant may make

The Investment Adviser may, at its discretion, receive similar services from other consultants or terminate the Investment Consultant.]  The Investment Consultant is an investment consulting firm providing counsel to wealthy family offices, trusts, endowments and foundations. 
The Investment Adviser is a wholly-owned subsidiary of United States Trust Company, N.A. (“USTCNA”). USTCNA, the Special Member and the

Company’s Investment Adviser, CTC Consulting, Inc., the Investment Consultant and UST Securities Corp., the Company’s Placement Agent. The Sale is expected to be consummated in the 3rd quarter of 2007 and is subject to Federal Reserve

error of judgment, for any mistake of law or for any act or omission by such person in connection with the performance of services to the Company. The Investment Advisory Agreement also provides for indemnification, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, by the Company or the Investment Adviser, or any member, director, officer or employee thereof, and any of their affiliates, executors, heirs, assigns, successors or other legal representatives, against any liability or expense to which such
person may be liable which arise in connection with the performance of services to the Company, provided that the liability or expense is not incurred by reason of the person’s willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless
disregard of its obligations to the Company.]

Member’s capital commitment to the Company and will be adjusted to reflect any additional drawdowns and distributions. For purposes of calculating an Investor’s capital account, each drawdown against committed capital will be treated as a
separate investment. The net profits or net losses of the Company are credited to or debited against the capital accounts of Member as of the end of each fiscal period in accordance with their respective investment percentages for the period. Each
Member’s investment percentage is determined each fiscal period in a manner reflecting the distribution provisions of the Company Agreement.  Distributions from the Company are made as follows: (i) a 125% return of all drawn Commitments to Members (including the Special Member) and (ii) a 90%/10% split of the remaining realized, Company profits between the Members and

Commitments that the Company intends to invest will have been drawn).  The Investment Adviser will also bear all of the Company’s
organizational expenses, expenses relating to the offer and sale of Units (except the commitment fees), and Company expenses until the final closing.

ITEM 10.
CAPITAL STOCK, LONG-TERM DEBT, AND OTHER SECURITIES.   


ITEM 10.1.
 The Company is organized as a limited liability
company under the laws of the State of Delaware and intends to be classified as a partnership for income tax purposes. The beneficial interest in the Company shall be divided into interests (the “Interests” or “Units”). The
number of Interests in the Company shall be unlimited. All Interests issued by the Company shall be fully paid and nonassessable. Interest holders shall have no preemptive or other rights to subscribe to any additional Interests or other securities
issued by the Company. The Company will establish on its books a separate capital account (a “Capital Account”) in respect of each Investor. Net profits and net losses of the Company for each quarter are allocated on the last business day
of that quarter (or at such other times as the Board, in its discretion, may determine) among the Capital Accounts maintained for Investors in proportion to the relative balances in such Capital Accounts. The Company will make distributions as
received from Portfolio Funds in accordance with Capital Accounts distributions. An investment in the Company involves substantial restrictions on liquidity and its Interests are not freely transferable. There is no market for the Interests, and no
market is expected to develop. Consequently, Investors may be unable to redeem or liquidate their Interests.  Investors in the Company must
be “accredited investors,” as defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D under the Securities Act, and “qualified clients” as defined in Rule 205-3 under the Advisers Act. The Investment Adviser may decline to admit any Investor.
Interests may not be purchased by nonresident aliens, foreign corporations, foreign partnerships, foreign trusts or foreign estates, all as defined in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Investors generally will be required to represent
to the Company that such Investor:   


 
•
 
 is investing in the Company for its own account, for investment purposes only, and not with a view to distributing Units;   


 
•
 
 is a sophisticated Investor capable of evaluating the risks and merits of an investment in the Company;   


 
•
 
 has had access to sufficient information needed to make an investment decision about the Company;   


 
•
 
 can tolerate illiquidity, which is characteristic of privately placed securities in general and this investment in particular;   


 
•

Summary Of Company Agreement  The following is a summary description of additional items and of select provisions of the Company Agreement. The description of such items and provisions is not definitive and reference should be made to the complete
text of the form of Company Agreement contained as an exhibit.  Liability of Members  Members of the Company will be members of a limited liability company as provided under Delaware law. Under Delaware law and the Company Agreement, a
Member will be liable for the debts and obligations of the Company only to the extent of its capital commitments and any contributions to the capital of the Company (plus any accretions in value thereto prior to withdrawal) and a Member, in the
discretion of the Board, may be obligated to satisfy withholding tax obligations with respect to such Member.  Duty of Care  The Company Agreement provides that neither the Managers nor, if applicable, the Investment Adviser (including certain of its affiliates, among others)
shall be liable to the Company or any of its Members for any loss or damage occasioned by any act or omission in the performance of their respective services as such in the absence of willful misconduct, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless
disregard of their duties. The Company Agreement also contains provisions for the indemnification, to the extent permitted by law, of the Managers by the Company, but not by the Members individually, against any liability and expense to which any of
them may be liable which arises in connection with the performance of their activities on behalf of the Company. A Manager will not be personally liable to any Member for the repayment of any balance in such Member’s capital account or for
contributions by such Member to the capital of the Company or by reason of any change in the federal or state income tax laws applicable to the Company or its Members. The rights of indemnification and exculpation provided under the Company
Agreement do not provide for indemnification of a Manager for any liability, including liability under federal securities laws that, under certain circumstances, impose liability even on persons that act in good faith, to the extent, but only to the
extent, that such indemnification would be in violation of applicable law.  Power of Attorney  By investing and by signing the Company Agreement (which each Member will do by virtue of signing a Member certification form), each Member will appoint
the officers of the Company and each of the Managers his or her attorney-in-fact for purposes of filing required certificates and documents relating to the formation and continuation of the Company as a limited liability company under Delaware law
or signing all instruments effecting authorized changes in the Company or the Company Agreement and conveyances and other instruments deemed necessary to effect the dissolution or termination of the Company.  Dissolution and Liquidation  The Company will be
dissolved upon the occurrence of any of the following:   


 
•
 
 the expiration of its term, except as otherwise extended pursuant to the Company Agreement;   
A-26 




 
•
 
 upon the affirmative vote by the Managers, subject, to the extent required by the 1940 Act, to the consent of the Members;   


 
•
 
 the sale or other disposition at any one time of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company; and   


 
•
 
 dissolution required by operation of law.  Upon the occurrence of any event of dissolution, the Managers or a liquidator acting as such under appointment by the Managers is charged with winding up the affairs of the Company and liquidating its assets. Net profits or net losses
during the fiscal period including the period of liquidation will be allocated as described in the Company Agreement.  Upon the dissolution
of the Company, its assets are to be distributed to Members in accordance with the positive balance in their respective capital accounts, after providing for all obligations of the Company.  Voting  Each Member has the right to cast a number of
votes equal to the number of Interests held by such Member at a meeting of Members called by the Managers. Members will be entitled to vote on any matter on which shareholders of a registered investment company organized as a corporation would
normally be entitled to vote, including the election of Managers, approval of the Company’s agreement with any investment adviser to the Company, and certain other matters, to the extent that the 1940 Act requires a vote of Members on any such
matters. Except for the exercise of their voting privileges, Members in their capacity as such are not entitled to participate in the management or control of the Company’s business, and may not act for or bind the Company.  Reports to Members  The Company will furnish to
Members, as soon as practicable after the end of each taxable year, financial statements and such information as is necessary for them to complete their income tax or information returns, along with any other tax information required by law. The
Company will not be able to provide final K-1s to Members for any given tax year until significantly after April 15 of the following year. The Company will provide Schedule K-1s as soon as practicable after it receives all necessary
information.  Fiscal Year  The
Company’s fiscal year for financial reporting purposes is the 12-month period ending on March 31. The Company’s taxable year is the 12-month period ending December 31.

 The Company intends to be classified for tax
purposes as a partnership and not as an association or a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation. Accordingly, the Company should not be subject to federal income tax, and each Member will be required to report on its own annual tax
return such Member’s share of the Company’s taxable income or loss.  If it were to be determined that the Company should be
treated as an association or a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation, the taxable income of the Company may be subject to corporate income tax and any distributions of profits from the Company would be treated as dividends.

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE AND POLICIES.  Part A of this
Registration Statement contains basic information about the investment objective, policies and limitations of the Company.   


ITEM 18.
MANAGEMENT.  Information about the managers and
officers of the Company, their roles in the management of the Company, the compensation of the Managers, and the committees of the Company is included in Part A of this Registration Statement.  [The Investment Adviser and its affiliates (and the directors/trustees, officers and employees) may buy and sell securities or other investments for
their own accounts, and may have conflicts of interest with respect to investments made on behalf of the Company. As a result of differing trading and investment strategies or constraints, positions may be taken by these parties that are the same,
different from or made at different times from positions taken for the Company. To lessen the possibility that the Company will be adversely affected by this personal trading, the Company and the Investment Adviser has each adopted a code of ethics
(each, a “Code of Ethics”) in compliance with Section 17(j) of the 1940 Act that restrict securities trading in the personal accounts of investment professionals and others who normally come into possession of information regarding
the Company’s portfolio transactions. The Codes of Ethics for the Company and the Investment Adviser can be reviewed and copied at the SEC’s Public Reference Room in Washington, D.C. Information on the operation of the Public Reference
Room may be obtained by calling the SEC at 1-202-551-8090. The Code of Ethics also is available on the EDGAR Database on the SEC’s Internet site at http://www.sec.gov, and copies may be obtained, after paying a duplicating fee, by e-mail at
publicinfo@sec.gov or by writing to the SEC’s Public Reference Section, Washington, D.C. 20549-0102.]  The Investment Adviser and its
affiliates will not purchase securities or other property from, or sell securities or other property to, the Company except that the Company may, in accordance with rules under the 1940 Act, engage in transactions with accounts that are affiliated
with the Company as a result of common officers, directors/trustees, advisers or managing general partners. These transactions would be effected in circumstances in which the Investment Adviser determined that it would be appropriate for the Company
to purchase and another client to sell, or the Company to sell and another client to purchase, the same security or instrument on the same day.   
B-1 


Personnel of the Investment Adviser serve as portfolio managers to certain clients and registered and
unregistered investment companies that may utilize an investment program that is substantively similar to that of the Company. In addition, the Investment Adviser currently serves, or may in the future serve, as investment advisers to other
registered investment companies, unregistered investment companies or accounts (including proprietary accounts), some of which provide for incentive compensation (such as performance fees). Consequently, the Investment Adviser’s investment
management activities may present conflicts between the interests of the Company and those of the Investment Adviser, and, potentially, among the interests of various accounts managed by the Investment Adviser principally with respect to allocation
of investment opportunities among similar strategies.  Future investment activities of the Investment Adviser and its affiliates and its
principals, partners, director/trustees, officers or employees may give rise to conflicts of interest other than those described above.  Each Member has the right to cast a number of votes equal to the number of Interests held by such Member at a meeting of Members called by the Company’s Managers. Members will be entitled to vote on any matter on which shareholders of
a registered investment company organized as a corporation would be entitled to vote, including certain elections of a Manager and approval of the Investment Advisory Agreement, in each case to the each case to the extent that voting by shareholders
is required by the 1940 Act. Notwithstanding their ability to exercise their voting privileges, Members in their capacity as such are not entitled to participate in the management or control of the Company’s business, and may not act or bind
the Company.  The Company may limit its investment position (combined with other investment positions of certain of its affiliates) in any
one Portfolio Fund to less than 5% of the Portfolio Fund’s outstanding voting securities, absent an order of the SEC (or assurances from the SEC staff) under which the Company’s contribution and withdrawal of capital from a Portfolio Fund
in which the Company and certain of its affiliates hold 5% or more of the outstanding interests will not be subject to various 1940 Act prohibitions on affiliated transactions. The Company is not required to adhere to this 5% investment limitation
to the extent that it relies on certain SEC rules that provide exemptions from the 1940 Act provisions on affiliated transactions. However, to facilitate investments in smaller Portfolio Funds deemed attractive by the Investment Adviser, the Company
may purchase non-voting securities of, or waive its right to vote its interests in, Portfolio Funds. Although the Company may hold non-voting interests, the 1940 Act and the rules and regulations thereunder may nevertheless require the Company to
limit its position, aggregated with the positions of certain of its affiliates, in any one Portfolio Fund, if investments in a Portfolio Fund by the Company and certain of its affiliates will equal or exceed 25% of the Portfolio Fund’s assets,
or such lower percentage limit as may be determined by the Company in consultation with its counsel. These restrictions may be changed by the Board, subject to the limitations of applicable laws, rules or interpretations thereof.  The Company does not presently intend to invest in Portfolio Funds managed by the Investment Adviser or any of its affiliates; however, it may do so in
the future, subject to obtaining such exemptions from the 1940 Act as may be necessary.   
B-2 


[Proxy Voting Policies and Procedures. Under the 1940 Act, the Board of Directors has a right and an
obligation to vote proxies relating to the Company’s securities as part of their general fiduciary obligations to the Company and its Members. Because of its investments in Portfolio Funds, the Company generally does not receive proxy
solicitations. However, the Board has adopted the proxy voting policies and procedures of the Investment Adviser as the Company’s proxy voting policies and procedures. Subject to the Board’s oversight, the Company has delegated
responsibility to vote any proxies the Company may receive to the Investment Adviser. The Investment Adviser’s general policy is to vote proxy proposals, amendments, consents or resolutions relating to the Company in a manner that serves the
best interests of the Company. A copy of the Investment Adviser’s proxy voting policies and procedures is attached as Appendix A to this Part B.]   


ITEM 19.
CONTROL PERSONS AND PRINCIPAL HOLDERS OF SECURITIES.  No officers of Managers of the Company currently own any of the outstanding Interests in the Company.  Before the commencement of
the Company’s operations, UST Advisers, Inc., 225 High Ridge Road, Stamford, CT 06905 may be deemed to control the Company. As sole member of the Company, David R. Bailin may be deemed to be a control person of the Company. However, Mr. Bailin
shall withdraw from the Company immediately preceding the commencement of operation of the Company.   


ITEM 20.
INVESTMENT ADVISORY AND OTHER SERVICES.  Information of the investment management and other services provided for or on behalf of the Company is contained in Part A of this Registration Statement.

Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo, P.C., One Financial Center, Boston, Massachusetts, 02111, acts as counsel to the Company, the Investment
Adviser and certain of its affiliates.  [            ] acts as counsel
to the Independent Managers.  The Company is registered under the 1940 Act as a closed-end management investment company. The Company was
formed as a limited liability company under the laws of the State of Delaware on February 2, 2007. The Company’s principal place office is located at 225 High Ridge Road, Stamford, CT 06905. The telephone number is (800) 647-6972, (x

 Real, potential or apparent conflicts of interest may arise should members of the Investment
Committee have day-to-day portfolio management responsibilities with respect to more than one fund. Committee members may manage other accounts with investment strategies similar to the Company, including other investment companies, pooled
investment vehicles and separately managed accounts. Fees earned by the Investment Adviser may vary among these accounts and Investment Committee members may personally invest in these accounts. These factors could create conflicts of interest
because the Investment Committee members may have incentives to favor certain accounts over others that could result in other accounts outperforming the Company. A conflict may also exist if Investment Committee members identifies a limited
investment opportunity that may be appropriate for more than one account, but the Company is not able to take full advantage of that opportunity due to the need to allocate that opportunity among multiple accounts. In addition, a team member may
execute transactions for another account that may adversely impact the value of securities held by the Company. However, the Investment Adviser believes that these risks are mitigated by the fact that accounts with like investment strategies managed
by the Investment Committee members are generally managed in a similar fashion and the Investment Advisor has a policy that seeks to allocate opportunities on a fair and equitable basis.  [The Investment Committee’s compensation consists of a combination of a fixed salary and a discretionary bonus. The discretionary bonus is not tied
directly to the value of assets, of the Company or any other fund managed by the Investment Adviser. The discretionary bonus is not tied directly to the performance of the Company; however, the Company’s performance is a factor in the amount of
bonus paid to members of the Investment Committee. Additional factors include, without limitation, the financial performance of the Investment Adviser, execution of managerial responsibilities, client interactions, support and general teamwork. The
Investment 
  
B-5 



Committee, currently, is not allocated any portion of the carried interest. However, members of the Investment Committee may, in the future, be allocated a
portion of the carried interest.]  As of the date of this Registration Statement, no one owns Interests.   


ITEM 22.
BROKERAGE ALLOCATION AND OTHER PRACTICES.  Each
Portfolio Fund’s manager is directly responsible for placing orders for the execution of portfolio transactions for the Portfolio Fund that it manages and for the allocation of brokerage. Transactions on U.S. stock exchanges and on some foreign
stock exchanges involve the payment of negotiated brokerage commissions. On many foreign stock exchanges, commissions are fixed. No stated commission is generally applicable to securities traded in over-the-counter markets, but the prices of those
securities include undisclosed commissions or mark-ups. In selecting brokers and dealers to execute transactions on behalf of a Portfolio Fund, it is expected that each Portfolio Fund manager will generally seek to obtain the best price and
execution for the transactions, taking into account factors, such as price, size of order, difficulty of execution and operational facilities of a brokerage firm, the scope and quality of brokerage services provided, and the firm’s risk in
positioning a block of securities. Although it is expected that each Portfolio Fund manager generally will seek reasonably competitive commission rates, a Portfolio Fund manager will not necessarily pay the lowest commission available on each
transaction. The Portfolio Fund managers will typically have no obligation to deal with any broker or group of brokers in executing transactions in portfolio securities.  Brokerage practices adopted by Portfolio Fund managers with respect to Portfolio Funds may vary and will be governed by each Portfolio Fund’s organizational documents.  Consistent with the principle of seeking best price and execution, a Portfolio Fund manager may place orders for a Portfolio Fund with brokers that
provide the Portfolio Fund manager and its affiliates with supplemental research, market and statistical information, including advice as to the value of securities, the advisability of investing in, purchasing or selling securities, and the
availability of securities or purchasers or sellers of securities, and furnishing analyses and reports concerning issuers, industries, securities, economic factors and trends, portfolio strategy and the performance of accounts. The expenses of the
Portfolio Fund managers are not necessarily reduced as a result of the receipt of this supplemental information, which may be useful to the Portfolio Fund managers or their affiliates in providing services to clients other than the Portfolio Funds.
In addition, not all of the supplemental information is necessarily used by a Portfolio Fund manager in connection with the Portfolio Fund it manages. Conversely, the information provided to a Portfolio Fund manager by brokers and dealers through
which other clients of the Portfolio Fund manager or its affiliates effect securities transactions may be useful to the Portfolio Fund manager in providing services to the Portfolio Fund.  Based on representations in the Portfolio Funds’ offering documents, the Company generally believes that Portfolio Funds will follow practices
similar to those described above. The Company has no control over Portfolio Fund brokerage arrangements or operations and there is a risk of Portfolio Fund misconduct.   
B-6 




ITEM 23.
TAX STATUS.  The following is a summary of certain
aspects of the income taxation of the Company that should be considered by a prospective Investor. The Company has not sought a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service or any other federal, state, or local agency with respect to any of the tax
issues affecting the Company. Further, the Company has not obtained an opinion of counsel with respect to any federal tax issues other than the characterization of the Company as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.  This discussion is based on the Company’s intended plan of operation applying the federal income tax laws as currently in effect as contained in the
Internal Revenue Code (“Code”), Treasury Regulations, and relevant judicial decisions and administrative guidance. The federal tax laws are subject to change, and any such change may materially affect the tax consequences of an investment
in the Company. Neither the Investment Adviser nor its counsel has any continuing duty to advise the Company or any Member of any changes in the tax law that may affect any party or cause any part of this discussion to become inaccurate. No rulings
or opinions of counsel (except as noted above with respect to the Company’s partnership status) have been or will be requested with respect to any tax-related matter discussed herein. There can be no assurance that the positions the Company
takes on its tax returns will be accepted by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”). This discussion relates only to U.S. federal income taxes and not to any local, state or foreign taxes or U.S. federal taxes other than income taxes.
 Because this discussion is a general summary, it does not address all aspects of federal income taxation that may be relevant to a
particular investor in light of the Investor’s particular circumstances, nor does it address, unless explicitly noted (and only to the extent so noted), certain types of Investors subject to special treatment under the federal income tax laws,
including but not limited to tax-exempt organizations, insurance companies, financial institutions, broker-dealers, dealers in securities or currencies, traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of accounting for their
securities, partners who are themselves partnerships or other pass-through entities for federal income tax purposes, regulated investment companies, real estate investment companies, real estate mortgage investment conduits, expatriates, persons
liable for alternative minimum tax, persons whose “functional currency” is not the U.S. dollar, persons holding their investment as part of a hedging, constructive sale or conversion, straddle, or other risk-reducing transaction, and
persons acquiring their interests in the Company in connection with the performance of services. Except as otherwise explicitly noted under “Non-U.S. Investors” below, this summary addresses only individual citizens or residents of the
United States, corporations or other business entities organized under the laws of the United States, any state, or the District of Columbia, estates with income subject to United States federal income tax, or trusts subject to primary supervision
by a United States court or for which United States persons control all substantial decisions.  Portions of this discussion address the
ability of Investors to utilize items of loss or deduction allocated to them by the Company. Potential Investors are cautioned that the Company will not be operated for the purpose of generating tax deductions, losses, credits, or other benefits.
Investors should not anticipate that an investment in the Company will yield items of deduction, loss, or credit to offset items of income or gain from other sources.   
B-7 


Potential Investors should consult with their own tax advisers in order to understand the federal, state,
local and foreign income tax consequences of an investment in the Company.  The Company’s Tax Status  The Company intends to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, and the Company’s legal counsel will provide an opinion to
Investors that the Company will be so treated. As a partnership, the Company will not be subject to federal income tax. Instead, each Member will be required annually to take into account its respective distributive share of the Company’s items
of taxable income, gain, loss, deduction and credit, without regard to whether any distributions are made by the Company. Generally, ordinary income or loss earned or incurred by the Company will be ordinary income or loss to the Members, and
capital gain or loss earned or incurred by the Company will be capital gain or loss to the Members. Distributive shares of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit are allocated in accordance with the Company Agreement. The Company expects that
such allocations will be respected by the IRS as either having “substantial economic effect” (and complying with other regulatory safe harbor provisions) or being determined in accordance with a “partner’s interest in the
partnership.” However, the regulations regarding when allocations are respected for tax purposes are very complex, and there can be no assurance that the allocations described in the Company Agreement will be respected by the IRS. 
Generally, distributions received by a Member from the Company (as opposed to allocations of taxable income or loss) will only be taxable to the
extent a Member receives money in excess of the Member’s basis in its Company Interest. The Company expects to qualify as an “investment partnership” within the meaning of Section 731(c)(3)(C) of the Code as long as the Company
does not actively and substantially participate in the management of any Portfolio Fund or hold 20 percent or more of the total capital and profits interests in any Portfolio Fund. If the Company does not so qualify, a Member receiving a
distribution of marketable securities from the Company may recognize taxable gain to the extent the fair market value of the distributed securities plus any distributed money exceeds the Member’s basis in its Units. A Member selling appreciated
securities distributed to it tax-free by the Company will generally recognize taxable gain based on the total appreciation in the value of the securities (subject to certain adjustments and exceptions in the case of a distribution in liquidation of
a Member’s interest in the Company), including such appreciation that accrued while the securities were held by the Company.  The
Company will file U.S. federal partnership information returns, reporting its operations for each fiscal year. The Company also will provide Members with statements to assist Members in determining and reporting on their federal income tax returns
items of taxable income, gain, loss, deduction and credit arising from their investment in the Company. Because the Company must receive tax-reporting information from the Portfolio Funds and await the results of its annual audit before it can
prepare such statements, the Company will not be able to provide tax-reporting statements to the Members until significantly after April 15 of each year. Members must be prepared to obtain extensions for filing their U.S. federal, state, and
local income tax returns each year.   
B-8 


Investments in Portfolio Funds  The Company expects to invest in Portfolio Funds rather than directly engage in any business operations. The Company anticipates, but can provide no assurance that, the Portfolio Funds will be treated as partnerships
for federal income tax purposes and will, in turn, invest in the equity or debt securities of portfolio companies. Assuming for the remainder of this discussion that this is so, the federal income tax consequences of the Company’s investment in
a Portfolio Fund will depend heavily on the structure and other circumstances of the portfolio companies selected by Portfolio Funds. Beyond its ability to choose among Portfolio Funds in which to invest, the Company will have no control over the
Portfolio Funds and their choice of investments. Therefore, Members must be prepared for allocations presenting a wide variety of federal income tax consequences.  To the extent Portfolio Funds invest in domestic portfolio companies taxed as corporations, unlike those taxed as partnerships, such companies are subject to federal income tax and will report separately their income,
gains, losses, deductions, and credits on their own tax return. Interest or dividends earned from such portfolio companies will generally be ordinary income. Generally, the federal income tax consequences of a Portfolio Fund’s disposition of
investments in domestic portfolio companies will depend on whether the Portfolio Fund is treated as an investor or trader (i.e., realizing capital gains or losses), or a dealer (i.e., realizing ordinary income or loss) for tax purposes. 
To the extent Portfolio Funds invest in domestic portfolio companies taxed as partnerships, such portfolio companies, like the Company itself, will
not be subject to federal income tax. The Portfolio Funds, and indirectly the Company and the Members themselves, must take into account for tax purposes a distributive share of such a portfolio company’s items of taxable income, gain, loss,
deduction, and credit without regard to whether the portfolio company ever makes distributions. Moreover, the Portfolio Funds, Company, and Members will be deemed engaged in any trade or business carried on by a portfolio company taxed as a
partnership. As noted above, the federal income tax consequences of a Portfolio Fund’s disposition of investments in domestic portfolio companies will depend on whether the Portfolio Fund is treated as an investor, trader, or a dealer for tax
purposes. In addition, when disposing of a domestic portfolio company treated as a partnership, gain or loss attributable to inventory or unrealized receivables (defined broadly to include, among others, recapture items, market-discount bonds,
short-term obligations, and stock in certain foreign corporations) that might otherwise be capital gain will instead be ordinary income or loss.  To the extent the Portfolio Funds invest in foreign entities, the tax consequences will vary widely depending on the jurisdiction and structure of the portfolio company. Foreign portfolio companies treated as corporations for U.S. federal
income tax purposes may be classified as “controlled foreign corporations” or “passive foreign investment companies” under the Code, subject to a variety of unfavorable federal income tax consequences, including but not limited
to accelerating the timing of taxable income to the Members or altering the character (i.e., ordinary vs. capital gain) of a Member’s income. Gains or losses from certain foreign currency transactions attributable to exchange rate fluctuations
are treated as ordinary income or loss. In addition to taxing the portfolio company’s operations, foreign jurisdictions may impose withholding taxes on dividends, interest, or other payments to the Portfolio Funds. Subject to numerous
limitations, Members may be entitled to a credit or deduction for their share of such withholding taxes and certain other foreign taxes incurred by the Portfolio Funds or the Company.   
B-9 


Portfolio Funds and their portfolio companies may engage in business in, otherwise derive income from,
and in general be subject to taxing authority in numerous state, local, and foreign jurisdictions. Members, by virtue of their participation in the Company, may be subject to tax payment and reporting obligations in such jurisdictions under their
widely varying rules and regulations. Each Investor should consult an independent adviser regarding how an investment in the Company may affect his, her, or its state, local, and foreign tax payment and reporting obligations.  Limitations on Certain Deductions  The Company
intends to engage in investment activities rather than in any active trade or business. As a result, noncapitalized expenses of the Company (e.g., fees paid to the Investment Adviser) will represent “miscellaneous itemized deductions” for
non-corporate taxpayers, deductible only to the extent they exceed 2 percent of a taxpayer’s adjusted gross income. Overall itemized deductions for individual taxpayers are subject to further limitations. Moreover, an investment in the Company
will not constitute a “passive activity” for purposes of the passive activity loss rules, and a Member will not be able to utilize losses and deductions from passive activities to offset the Member’s share of the Company’s income
and gain (until the Member disposes of its interest in the passive activity).  The Code limits the ability of Members to utilize other
losses and deductions that may arise from the Company’s activities. For instance, allocations of loss or deduction from the Company, or the ability to utilize such allocations, may be limited by a Member’s adjusted capital account or its
adjusted basis in its interest in the Company. Additionally, the use of capital losses is subject to significant limitations, as is the use of deductions for “investment interest” should the Company or Portfolio Funds use leverage in their
investments. Individuals and certain closely held corporations are subject to the “at risk” rules that limit a Member’s ability to utilize losses to the amount the taxpayer has at risk in the Company’s activities. The
Company’s organizational expenses may be amortizable only over a 15-year period, if at all. Certain expenses incurred by the Company in offering and selling Company interests will be non-deductible altogether.  Disposition of Interest in the Company  A
Member’s gain or loss upon a disposition of its interest in the Company will typically be capital gain or loss, long-term if the Member holds the interest for more than one year, except that gains or losses attributable to inventory or
unrealized receivables (defined broadly to include, among others, recapture items, market-discount bonds, short-term obligations, and stock in certain foreign corporations) will be ordinary income or loss. As described above, the use of capital
losses is subject to significant limitations.  Tax-Exempt Investors  The discussion below addresses how certain investors such as tax-exempt organizations, qualified plans, individual retirement accounts and annuities, and state colleges and universities (“Tax-Exempt
Investors”) may be subject to unrelated business income tax (“UBIT”) due to the Company’s activities.

Income from a trade or business, regularly carried on, that is unrelated to a Tax-Exempt Investor’s
exempt purposes, and income derived from debt-financed property, are subject to UBIT. If the Portfolio Funds invests in companies treated as partnerships for tax purposes, a Tax-Exempt Investor’s distributive share of income earned by the
Company will be subject to UBIT if such income would have been subject to UBIT if earned directly by the Tax-Exempt Investor. Moreover, certain income from foreign portfolio companies treated as corporations, such as insurance income from controlled
foreign corporations, may be subject to UBIT. Furthermore, if a Tax-Exempt Investor debt-finances its investment in the Company, the Company debt-finances its investment in a Portfolio Company, or a Portfolio Fund uses leverage in its own investment
activities, some or all of the Tax-Exempt Investor’s distributive share of income from the Company may be subject to UBIT.  The
Company makes no assurance that Tax-Exempt Investors will not incur UBIT as a result of their investment in the Company. Each potential investor should consult an independent tax advisor regarding the UBIT consequences of an investment in the
Company in light of the investor’s particular circumstances.  Non-U.S. Investors  The discussion below addresses the application of certain federal income tax laws to investors who are not United States citizens, residents, business
entities, estates, or trusts (“Non-U.S. Investors”). The application of the federal tax laws to non-U.S. persons is complex, and this summary does not address all aspects of those laws.  Except to the extent of income “effectively connected” with a U.S. trade or business (in all cases to include the disposition of U.S. real
property or U.S. real property holding corporations), a Non-U.S. Investor’s distributive share of the Company’s capital gains will not be subject to U.S. tax, and its distributive share of the Company’s dividends, interest, and
certain other income will be subject only to a 30 percent withholding tax. Under certain circumstances, the withholding tax may be reduced or eliminated if a Non-U.S. Investor properly certifies to its entitlement to tax treaty benefits or the
“portfolio interest” exception.  If the Company, a Portfolio Fund, or a portfolio company treated as a partnership for federal
tax purposes is deemed engaged in a U.S. trade or business, then a Non-U.S. Investor will be deemed engaged in a U.S. trade or business. A Non-U.S. Investor deemed engaged in a U.S. trade or business is subject to federal income tax on any income
“effectively connected” with that trade or business on similar terms and rates as a U.S. person. In those circumstances, the Company must withhold tax on the Non-U.S. Investor’s distributive share of effectively connected income, and
the Non-U.S. Investor must file a U.S. tax return. Furthermore, the Non-U.S. Investor may be subject to U.S. federal income tax on its gain from the disposition of its interest in Company, and, if a corporation, the Non-U.S. Investor may be subject
to an additional 30 percent branch profits tax on its earnings and profits effectively connected with the U.S. trade or business.   
B-11 


The Company makes no assurance that Non-U.S. Investors will not be deemed engaged in a U.S. trade or
business as a result of their investment in the Company. Each potential Investor should consult an independent tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of an investment in the Company in light of the investor’s particular circumstances.
 ERISA Considerations  Persons who are
fiduciaries with respect to an employee benefit plan, IRA, Keogh plan or other arrangement subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”) or the Code (an “ERISA Plan”) should consider, among
other things, the matters described below before determining whether to invest in the Company.  ERISA imposes certain general and specific
responsibilities on persons who are fiduciaries with respect to an ERISA Plan, including prudence, diversification, prohibited transaction and other standards. In determining whether a particular investment is appropriate for an ERISA Plan,
Department of Labor (“DOL”) regulations provide that a fiduciary of an ERISA Plan must give appropriate consideration to, among other things, the role that the investment plays in the ERISA Plan’s portfolio, taking into consideration
whether the investment is designed reasonably to further the ERISA Plan’s purposes, an examination of the risk and return factors, the portfolio’s composition with regard to diversification, the liquidity and current return of the total
portfolio relative to the anticipated cash flow needs of the ERISA Plan, the income tax consequences of the investment, and the projected return of the total portfolio relative to the ERISA Plan’s funding objectives. Before investing the assets
of an ERISA Plan in the Company, a fiduciary should determine whether such an investment is consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities and the foregoing regulations. For example, a fiduciary should consider whether an investment in the Company
may be too illiquid or too speculative for a particular ERISA Plan, and whether the assets of the ERISA Plan would be sufficiently diversified. If a fiduciary with respect to any such ERISA Plan breaches his responsibilities with regard to selecting
an investment or an investment course of action for such ERISA Plan, the fiduciary may be held personally liable for losses incurred by the ERISA Plan as a result of such breach.  Because the Company will register as an investment company under the 1940 Act, the underlying assets of the Company should not be considered to be
“plan assets” of the ERISA Plans investing in the Company for purposes of ERISA’s fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction rules. Thus, the Investment Adviser will not be a fiduciary within the meaning of ERISA. 
The Investment Adviser will require an ERISA Plan proposing to invest in the Company to represent that it, and any fiduciaries responsible for the
ERISA Plan’s investments, are aware of and understand the Company’s investment objective, policies and strategies, that the decision to invest plan assets in the Company was made with appropriate consideration of relevant investment
factors with regard to the ERISA Plan and is consistent with the duties and responsibilities imposed upon fiduciaries with regard to their investment decisions under ERISA.  Certain prospective ERISA Plan investors may currently maintain relationships with the Investment Adviser or with other entities which are affiliated

  
B-12 



with the Investment Adviser. Each of such persons may be deemed to be a party in interest to and/or a fiduciary of any ERISA Plan to which it provides
investment management, investment advisory or other services. ERISA prohibits ERISA Plan assets to be used for the benefit of a party in interest and also prohibits an ERISA Plan fiduciary from using its position to cause the ERISA Plan to make an
investment from which it or certain third parties in which such fiduciary has an interest would receive a fee or other consideration. ERISA Plan investors should consult with counsel to determine if participation in the Company is a transaction
which is prohibited by ERISA or the Code. Fiduciaries of ERISA Plan investors will be required to represent that the decision to invest in the Company was made by them as fiduciaries independent of such affiliated persons and duly authorized to make
such investment decision and that they have not relied on any individualized advice or recommendation of such affiliated persons as a basis for the decision to invest in the Company.  The provisions of ERISA are subject to extensive and continuing administrative and judicial interpretation and review. The discussion of ERISA contained
in this Registration Statement, is, of necessity, general and may be affected by future publication of regulations and rulings. Potential investors should consult with their legal advisors regarding the consequences under ERISA of the acquisition
and ownership of Interests.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  The Company will issue a
complete set of financial statements on an annual basis prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.  Appendix A

B-13 


PROXY VOTING POLICIES AND PROCEDURES  Overview  U.S. Trust and its affiliates1 often have authority to vote proxies for shareholders with accounts managed
by U.S. Trust and its affiliates. As an investment adviser or as a trustee, U.S. Trust has a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of its clients (maximizing shareholder value over time) when exercising this authority. At U.S. Trust, we
recognize that in those cases where we have voting authority, we must make voting decisions that are in the best long-term economic interest of our clients (or, in the case of ERISA accounts, in the interest of the plan’s participants and their
beneficiaries).  Set forth below are U.S. Trust’s Policies and Procedures with respect to any voting or consent rights of clients (including mutual
funds) for which any U.S. Trust entity has voting authority. Recognizing that proxy voting is a rare event in the realm of fixed income investing and is typically limited to solicitation of consent to changes in features of debt securities, these
Policies and Procedures also apply to any voting rights and/or consent rights of U.S. Trust, on behalf of its clients, with respect to debt securities, including but not limited to, plans of reorganization, and waivers and consents under applicable
indentures. To the extent issues are not covered by U.S. Trust’s Policies and Procedures, U.S. Trust will vote proxies in its discretion after taking into consideration the best long-term economic interest of its clients. These Policies and
Procedures may be revised from time to time. Appendix A and Appendix B set forth the Proxy Committee’s current policies with respect to how U.S. Trust will vote with regard to specified matters that may arise from time to time.
 Special Fiduciary Services Division  These
policies and procedures do not apply to the qualified or unqualified employee benefit plan accounts for which the Special Fiduciary Services Division of United States Trust Company, N.A. (“SFS”) acts as a plan fiduciary. SFS has
established its own proxy policies and procedures. The SFS client accounts commonly hold large concentrations of employer securities. Due to the special nature of these accounts, U.S. Trust and SFS may reach different voting decisions on a
particular matter.  Limitations Relating to Proxy Voting  While U.S. Trust uses its best efforts to vote proxies, in certain circumstances it may be impractical or impossible for U.S. Trust to vote proxies. Such circumstances include when a client has loaned securities to a third party and is
unable to recall the securities 
  



 1
 U.S. Trust includes United States Trust Company, National Association, U.S. Trust New York Asset
Management Division, UST Advisers, Inc., and U.S. Trust Company of Delaware.  Appendix A-1 



in sufficient time to vote the proxies by the required deadline or if an account would lose security lending income if the securities were recalled.
Additionally, U.S. Trust may not be able to vote proxies in connection with certain holdings of foreign securities if U.S. Trust does not receive the proxy statement in time to vote the proxies or is unable to meet the requirements necessary to vote
the proxies (e.g. share blocking, limited value, unjustifiable costs, custodial processing delays or securities on loan). In circumstances where a client held a security as of record date, but the security is sold prior to the shareholder meeting,
U.S. Trust will abstain from voting that security.  Proxy Committee  The Proxy Committee of United States Trust Company, N.A. is responsible for establishing and implementing these proxy voting policies and procedures. The Proxy Committee may also consider special proxy issues that may
arise from time to time, including voting proxies for which the Policies and Procedures do not provide clear and definitive guidance and/or where an exception to the established Policies and Procedures may be in the interest of U.S. Trust’s
proxy voting clients. The Proxy Committee is comprised of personnel of United States Trust Company, N.A., its Director of Equity Research, a senior representative from its Equity Research Operations, Trust, International Investments, Equity Income,
Risk Management, and Wealth Management. At least annually, the Proxy Committee reviews the voting guidelines set forth in Appendices A and B and the use of the third party proxy voting service. The Proxy Committee may call upon
research analysts and investment professionals for their opinion on a particular issue based upon their in-depth knowledge of the issuer and the issues involved.  Voting and Use of Proxy Voting Service  U.S. Trust has engaged an independent proxy voting service, Institutional Shareholder
Services, Inc. (“ISS”), a nationally recognized provider of proxy voting services, to assist in the voting of proxies. ISS is responsible for voting, on behalf of U.S. Trust, in accordance with the guidelines stipulated in Appendices A
and B and for maintaining copies of voting records and proxy statements received by issuers. ISS will refer proxy questions to a member of the Equity Research Operations Group for instructions under circumstances where : (1) the application
of the Proxy Policies and Procedures is unclear; (2) a particular ballot item is not covered by the Proxy Policies and Procedures; or (3) the Proxy Policies and Procedures call for input from U.S. Trust. ISS also may provide the Proxy
Committee with recommendations regarding particular proxy matters.  Proxy Coordination  A member of the Equity Research Operations Group is responsible for working with the proxy voting service, soliciting feedback from the Proxy Committee as required, and
for communicating to ISS the Proxy Policies and Procedures. ISS produces monthly reports 
  
Appendix A-2 



of ballots cast on behalf of clients and the Security Operations Group does a random sampling of the ballots cast by the proxy voting service against these
Policies and Procedures to verify adherence by ISS to these Policies and Procedures.  Conflicts of Interest  From time to time, U.S. Trust may experience material conflicts of interest with respect to proxy voting. Because these Policies and Procedures are pre-determined and
designed to be in the best interests of clients, application of the Policies and Procedures to vote client proxies should, in most cases, adequately address any possible conflicts of interest. U.S. Trust will follow the procedures set forth in
Appendix C in connection with voting shares issued by publicly traded companies affiliated with U.S. Trust and with voting shares of investment companies and alternative investment vehicles (i.e., hedge funds, private equity funds, and other
alternative investment pools) advised by U.S. Trust or an affiliate.  Reporting and Recordkeeping  Except to the extent required by applicable law or otherwise approved by U.S. Trust, U.S. Trust will not disclose to third parties how it voted a proxy on behalf of a
client. However, upon request from an appropriately authorized individual, U.S. Trust will disclose to a client or the entity delegating the voting authority to U.S. Trust for such client, how U.S. Trust voted such client’s proxy. The proxy
voting record of investment companies advised by U.S. Trust are available on the SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov. In addition, clients for which any U.S. Trust entity has voting authority, may obtain a copy or these Policies and Procedures
upon request.  Statement of Proxy Voting Guidelines  The Proxy Committee has established the following voting guidelines which provide a general indication as to how U.S. Trust will vote proxies on certain issues. However, these examples do not address all potential voting issues or the
intricacies that may surround individual proxy votes, and for that reason, actual proxy votes may differ from the guidelines presented here. In compelling circumstances, the Proxy Committee may determine to “split” the U.S. Trust vote on a
particular matter for different investment advisory clients for which it is exercising its authority to vote proxies. Any decision to “split” votes must be appropriate from the standpoint of the best long-term economic interests of each of
its clients.   
Appendix A-3 


Appendix A – Routine Issues  U.S. Trust will vote the following items as recommended by management of the issuer because U.S. Trust believes the recommendations by the issuer generally are in shareholders’ best long-term economic interests,
and therefore in the best long-term economic interests of U.S. Trust’s clients.  1. Ratification of auditors and compensation paid to auditors.
 2. Corporate housekeeping matters – including: Proposals relating to the conduct of the annual meeting, name changes, non-substantive or
corrective changes to charter or by-laws (including increasing or decreasing the number of directors), proposals as to the creation of corporate governance, nominating or other committees and proposals concerning the composition of such committees,
and proposals relating to whether one individual may act as both Chairman and CEO or otherwise hold simultaneous officer and director positions.  3.
Routine capitalization matters – including: Matters relating to adjusting authorized common or preferred stock, reverse splits or other business matters not related to anti-takeover measures, issuance of shares in connection with an
acquisition, or increase in capital stock for a shareholder rights plan.  4. Composition of the board – including: Removal of directors for cause,
establishing term limits for directors, requiring two candidates for each board seat; except that proposals relating to whether a majority of the board must be independent are not considered routine.  5. General corporate matters – including: Formation of a holding company, reincorporation into a different state or country, issuance of special reports (including
reports on employment and recruiting practices in relation to gender, race or other characteristics) and reports on charitable/political contributions and activities, adoption, renewal or amendment of shareholder rights plan, establishing or
amending employee savings, employee stock ownership plans or investment plans.  6. Routine procedural matters – including: the opening of the
shareholder meeting, acknowledge proper convening of meeting, that the meeting has been convened under local regulatory requirements, the presence of quorum, the agenda for the meeting, the election of the chair of the meeting, the appointment of
shareholders to co-sign the minutes of the meeting, regulatory filings, the designation of inspector(s) or shareholder representative(s) for the meeting, the designation of two shareholders to approve and sign minutes of the meeting, the allowance
of questions, the publication of minutes, the closing of the meeting, authorize the board to ratify and execute approved resolutions, and prepare and approve the list of shareholders.  7. Remuneration report – In several non-U.S. markets, including the United Kingdom, Sweden, Australia, and the Netherlands, shareholders are given the opportunity to ratify the company’s equity based, and
cash compensation policies. We generally vote for the routine approval of remuneration reports in non-U.S. markets.   
Appendix A-4 


8. Annual formal discharge of the board and management – In several non-U.S. markets, shareholders are asked to
approve actions taken by the board and management during the year. The annual formal discharge is a tacit vote of confidence in the company’s management. We generally vote for discharge of the board and management, unless: there are
serious questions about actions of the board or management for the year in question; or, legal action is being taken against the board by other shareholders. In addition, we typically vote against proposals to remove the annual discharge of
board and management from the agenda.   
Appendix A-5 


Appendix B – Non-Routine Issues  The Proxy Committee has adopted the following guidelines with respect to the following non-routine issues.  1 –
Proposals Regarding Director Elections   


 
i.
Election of directors – We typically vote for on individual director nominees in an uncontested election of directors. We evaluate a contested election of
directors on a case-by-case basis considering such factors as the long-term financial performance of the company relative to its industry, management’s track record, the qualifications of the nominees for both slates and an evaluation of
what each side is offering shareholders.   


 
ii.
Cumulative voting for the election of directors – Cumulative voting permits a shareholder to amass (cumulate) all his/her votes for directors and apportion these votes
among one, or a few, or all directors on a multi-candidate slate. We believe that cumulative voting favors special interest candidates who may not represent the interests of all shareholders. We typically vote against proposals for cumulative
voting and for proposals to eliminate cumulative voting.   


 
iii.
Classified boards – We believe that electing directors is one of the most basic rights that an investor can exercise in stock ownership. We believe that a non-classified
board (requiring re-election of all directors annually) increases the accountability of the board to shareholders. We typically vote against proposals seeking classification of a board and for proposals seeking declassification.
  


 
iv.
Term limits for independent directors – We believe that term limits can result in arbitrarily discarding knowledgeable, experienced directors. We believe that qualified
and diligent directors should be allowed to continue to serve the interests of a company’s shareholders and that term limits do not serve shareholder’s interests. We typically vote against proposals to set term limits.
  


 
v.
Proposals concerning whether a majority of the board must be independent – We believe that it is beneficial for a majority of the board of directors of a company to be
comprised of independent directors. As such, we typically vote for such proposals.   
Appendix A-6 




 
vi.
Proposals requiring a majority vote for election of directors – We will typically vote for reasonably crafted shareholder proposals calling for directors to be
elected with an affirmative majority of votes cast and/or the elimination of the plurality standard for electing directors (including binding resolutions requesting that the board amend the company’s bylaws), provided the proposal includes a
carve-out for a plurality voting standard when there are more director nominees than board seats (e.g., contested elections).  2 – Other
Director-Related Proposals   


 
(i)
Proposals limiting liability or providing indemnification of directors – We believe that in order to attract qualified, effective and experienced persons to serve as
directors, it is appropriate for a company to offer appropriate and competitive protection to directors from exposure to unreasonable personal liability potentially arising from serving as a director. We typically vote for such
proposals.   


 
(ii)
Proposals regarding director share ownership – Similarly to employee stock ownership, director stock ownership aligns the interests of directors and shareholders.
Whether through outright purchase (with the director’s cash compensation) or through option grants, we believe director share ownership is in the interests of shareholders. We typically vote for such proposals. 
3 – Anti-Takeover Proposals and Shareholder rights   


 
(i)
Shareholder rights plans and poison pills – Poison pills are used as a defense against takeover offers that are not welcomed by incumbent management. Such plans
typically allow shareholders (other than the shareholder making the takeover offer) to purchase stock at significantly discounted prices. Such a plan may serve to entrench management and directors and may effectively prevent any take-over, even at a
substantial premium to shareholders. We typically vote against poison pill plans and against proposals to eliminate a requirement that poison pill plans be submitted to shareholders for approval.   


 
(ii)
Defensive Use of Share Issuances – We typically vote against management requests to issue shares in the event of a takeover offer or exchange bid for the
company’s shares.   


 
(iii)
Other anti-takeover provisions – We typically vote against other anti-takeover provisions, such as blank check preferred stock, greenmail provisions, shark
repellants and increases in authorized shares for anti-takeover purposes and typically vote for proposals such as fair price amendments.   
Appendix A-7 




 
(iv)
Limitations on shareholder rights – We typically vote against proposals which limit shareholders’ corporate rights, including, the right to act by written
consent, the right to remove directors, to amend by-laws, to call special meetings, or nominate directors.   


 
(v)
Proposals regarding supermajority vote requirement – We support shareholders’ ability to approve or reject matters based on a simple majority. We typically vote
against proposals to institute a supermajority vote requirement.   


 
(vi)
Proposals regarding confidential voting – Confidential voting allows shareholders to vote anonymously and we believe helps large institutional shareholders avoid undue
influence that may be exerted by special interest groups. Prohibiting confidential voting may discourage some shareholders from exercising their voting rights, which we believe is not in the best interests of a company’s shareholders. We
typically vote for the adoption of confidential voting proposals and against proposals to prohibit confidential voting.   


 
(vii)
Discretionary voting of unmarked proxies – Such proposals often provide management with the discretion to vote unmarked proxies as management determines. Except for the
discretion to vote unmarked proxies with respect to a proposal to adjourn a meeting and to set a new meeting date, we believe it is not proper to provide management with the discretion to vote unmarked proxies. We typically vote against such
proposals.  4 - Management Compensation Proposals   


 
(i)
Equity-based compensation plans – We will assess the potential cost of equity-based compensation plans by using the proxy voting service’s quantitative approach to
evaluating such plans. The quantitative approach is designed to estimate the total cost of a proposed plan, both in terms of voting dilution cost and transfer of shareholder value. We will evaluate whether the estimated cost is reasonable by
comparing the cost to an allowable cap. The allowable cap is industry-specific, market cap-based, and pegged to the average amount paid by companies performing in the top quartile of their peer groupings. We typically vote for equity-based
plans with costs within the allowable cap and against those with costs above the allowable cap. In addition, we generally vote against plans that provide: a) for repricing of underwater stock, b) excessive CEO compensation relative to
company performance, i.e. pay-for-performance disconnect, or c) excessive three-year average burn rate. We may also vote against an equity-based plan proposal if there are significant concerns about egregious compensation practices, even if
the costs of such plans are within the allowable cap.   
Appendix A-8 




 
(ii)
Shareholder proposals on compensation – disclosure/setting levels or types of compensation for executives and directors – We typically vote for shareholder
proposals seeking additional disclosure of executive and director pay information, provided the information requested is relevant to shareholders’ needs, would not put the company at a competitive disadvantage relative to its industry, and is
not unduly burdensome to the company. We typically vote against shareholder proposals seeking to set absolute levels on compensation or otherwise dictate the amount or form of compensation. We typically vote against shareholder
proposals requiring director fees be paid in stock only.   


 
(iii)
Performance-based awards – We typically vote for shareholder proposals advocating the use of performance-based awards like indexed, premium-priced, and
performance-vested options or performance-based shares, unless: a) the proposal is overly restrictive (e.g., it mandates that awards to all employees must be performance-based or all awards to top executives must be a particular type, such as
indexed options); and b) the company demonstrates that it is using a substantial portion of performance-based awards for its top executives, where substantial portion would constitute 50 percent of the shares awarded to those executives for that
fiscal year.   


 
(iv)
Severance agreements for executives/golden parachutes – We typically vote for shareholder proposals to require golden parachutes or executive severance agreements
to be submitted for shareholder ratification, unless the proposal requires shareholder approval prior to entering into employment contracts. We typically vote for proposals to ratify or cancel golden parachutes if they include the following:
a) The triggering mechanism is beyond the control of management; b) The amount does not exceed three times base salary (defined as the average annual taxable W-2 compensation during the five years prior to the year in which the change of control
occurs); and c) change-in-control payments include the following double-triggers: (I) after a change in control has taken place, and (II) termination of the executive as a result of the change in control. A change in control is
defined as a change in the company ownership structure.   


 
(v)
Supplemental executive retirement plans (SERPs) – We typically vote for shareholder proposals requesting to put extraordinary benefits contained in SERP
agreements to a shareholder vote unless the company’s executive pension plans do not contain excessive benefits beyond what is offered under employee-wide plans.   
Appendix A-9 




 
(vi)
Retirement bonuses for directors and statutory auditors – We typically vote against payment of retirement benefits to non-executive directors and statutory
auditors. When one or more of the individuals to whom the grants are being proposed has not served in an executive capacity for the company for at least three years, we oppose payment, particularly as the size of these payments may be at the
discretion of the board. If any one individual does not meet our criteria, we typically vote against the entire proposal.  All other shareholder proposals regarding executive and director pay will be voted on a case-by-case basis taking into account company performance, pay level versus peers, pay level versus industry, and long term corporate outlook.
 5 - Non-Routine General Corporate Matters   


 
(i)
Proposals relating to asset sales, mergers, acquisitions, reorganizations & restructurings – These proposals are typically brought by management for underlying
business reasons. We believe that management best understands the corporation’s business and is best situated to take appropriate courses of action. Thus, we typically vote for such proposals.   


 
(ii)
Financial results/director and auditor reports – We typically vote for approval of financial statements and director and auditor reports, unless: a) there are
concerns about the statements presented or audit procedures used; or b) the company is not responsive to shareholder questions about specific items that should be publicly disclosed.   


 
(iii)
Appointment of statutory auditors – We typically vote for the appointment or reelection of statutory auditors, unless: a) there are serious concerns about the
statutory reports presented or the audit procedures used; b) questions exist concerning any of the statutory auditors being appointed; or c) the auditors have previously served the company in an executive capacity or are otherwise considered
affiliated with the company.   


 
(iv)
Allocation of income – We typically vote for approval of the allocation of income, unless: a) the dividend payout ratio has been consistently below 30 percent
without adequate explanation; or b) the payout is excessive given the company’s financial position.   


 
(v)
Stock (scrip) dividend alternative – We generally vote for most stock (scrip) dividend proposals. However, we typically vote against proposals that do not
allow for a cash option unless management demonstrates that the cash option is harmful to shareholder value.   
Appendix A-10 




 
(vi)
Amendments to articles of incorporation or articles of association – We generally vote for proposals to amend articles of incorporation or articles of
association if: a) shareholder rights are protected; b) there is negligible or positive impact on shareholder value; c) management provides adequate reasons for the amendments; and d) the company is required to do so by law (if applicable). We
typically vote against proposals to amend articles if the amendment is deemed not to be in the long-term economic best interest of shareholders.   


 
(vii)
Change in company fiscal term – We typically vote for proposals to change a company’s fiscal term unless a company’s motivation for the change is to
postpone its Assembly General Meeting.   


 
(viii)
Lower disclosure threshold for stock ownership – We typically vote against proposals to lower the stock ownership disclosure threshold below five percent unless
specific reasons exist to implement a lower threshold.   


 
(ix)
Amend quorum requirements – We generally vote against proposals to lower the quorum requirement, unless we believe the proposal is consistent with market norms,
the company’s reasons for the change are in line with shareholders’ interests, and the company’s ownership structure would not hamper wider shareholder participation. Companies that have a substantial shareholder or shareholder group
should set their quorum requirement well above the percentage of shares owned by such shareholder or shareholder group. Quorum requirements are intended to ensure that a broad range of shareholders is represented at meetings.
  


 
(x)
Increase in borrowing powers – We generally vote for proposals to approve increases in a company’s borrowing powers after taking into account
management’s stated need for the increase, the size of the increase, and the company’s current debt-to-equity ratio or gearing level. Large increases in borrowing powers can sometimes result in dangerously high debt-to-equity ratios that
could harm shareholder value. If an increase is excessive without sufficient justification and if a company already has an exceptionally high debt-to-equity ratio compared to its industry, we typically vote against the proposal.
  


 
(xi)
Share repurchase plans – We typically vote for share repurchase plans, unless: a) clear evidence of past abuse of the authority is available; or b) the plan
contains no safeguards against selective buybacks.   


 
(xii)
Reissuance of shares repurchased – We typically vote for proposals to reissue any repurchased shares unless there is clear evidence of abuse of this authority in
the past.   
Appendix A-11 




 
(xiii)
Capitalization of reserves for bonus issues/increase in par value – We typically vote for proposals to capitalize reserves for bonus issues of shares or to
increase par value.   


 
(xiv)
Adjust par value of common stock – We typically vote for management proposals to reduce par value of common stock.   


 
(xv)
Issuances of shares with or without preemptive rights – General Issuances: We typically vote for proposals for the issuance of shares with preemptive
rights to a maximum of 100 percent over currently issued capital. We typically vote for proposals for the issuance of shares without preemptive rights to a maximum of 20 percent of currently issued capital. We typically vote against
proposals for the general issuance of shares with or without preemptive rights above and beyond the aforementioned thresholds. Specific Issuances: We typically vote on a case-by-case basis.   


 
(xvi)  
Control and profit transfer agreements – We generally vote for management proposals to approve control and profit transfer agreements between a parent and its
subsidiaries.   


 
(xvii)
  Mandatory takeover bid waivers – We generally vote against proposals to waive mandatory takeover bid requirements. The requirement that a takeover bid
should be launched when a substantial amount of shares have been acquired prevents the entrenchment of the controlling shareholder and protects minority owners. However, we are in favor of a waiver of mandatory takeover bid requirements when the
event prompting the takeover bid is a repurchase by the company of its own shares. When a company repurchases its own shares, the relative stake of a large shareholder increases even though the number of shares held by the large shareholder has not
changed. In certain markets, notably the United Kingdom, Ireland and Australia, the mandatory bid rules require a large shareholder to make a takeover bid if its stake in the company is increased on a relative basis as a result of a share repurchase
by the company. Companies in these markets may seek a waiver from the takeover bid requirement applicable to their large shareholder. Under such circumstances, we generally vote for such a waiver if the share repurchase would not push the
large shareholder’s stake in the company above 50 percent.   


 
(xviii)
  Expansion of business activities – We typically vote for the expansion of business activities unless the new business takes the company into risky
areas.   
Appendix A-12 




 
(xix)  
Related-party transactions – We generally vote for related-party transactions, unless the agreement requests a strategic move outside the company’s charter
or contains unfavorable terms to shareholders.   


 
(xx)
Proposals for extinguishing shareholder preemptive rights – Preemptive rights permit shareholders to share proportionately in any new issues of stock of the same class.
For companies having large, actively-traded equity capitalizations, individual shareholder’s proportionate ownership may easily be obtained by market purchases. We believe that greater financing flexibility and reduced expenses afforded by not
having preemptive rights are more beneficial to shareholders than the ability to maintain proportionate ownership through preemptive rights. We typically vote for proposals to extinguish such rights and against proposals to create such
rights.   


 
(xxi)  
Proposals requiring consideration of comparative fee information by independent auditors – The cost of an audit is determined mainly by the specific characteristics of
each corporation, which may not be comparable even for companies within the same industry. Thus, the comparison of one auditor’s fees with those of another auditor for a different corporation is not meaningful. We further believe that the cost
of the audit should not be the overriding factor in the selection of auditors. As such, we typically vote against such proposals.   


 
(xxii)  
Proposals mandating diversity in hiring practices or board composition – We believe that management is best able to make hiring and firing decisions and should make
those decisions, consistent with the requirements of applicable law, based on the best available talent for the position in question. We believe that federal and state anti-discrimination laws should control to prevent discriminatory practices and
that the vast majority of corporations make concerted efforts to comply with federal and state laws that prohibit employment discrimination. We typically vote against such proposals.   


 
(xxiii)  
Proposals prohibiting dealings with certain countries – The decision to prohibit business dealings with any country is a policy issue that we believe is best reserved to
the U.S. government. If the U.S. government has not prohibited trade or business dealing with companies in a particular foreign country, then we believe it is up to management to determine whether it would be appropriate for a company to do business
in that country. We typically vote against such proposals.   


 
(xxiv)
    Proposals to limit the number of other public corporation boards on which the CEO serves – We believe that service on multiple boards may
enhance the CEO’s performance by broadening his or her experience and 
  
Appendix A-13 




 
 
facilitating the development of a strong peer network. We feel that management and the board are best suited to determine the impact of multiple board
memberships on the performance of the CEO. We typically vote against such proposals.   


 
(xxv)  
Proposals to limit consulting fees to an amount less than audit fees – We believe that access to the consulting services of professionals is a valuable resource of
increasing importance in the modern world that should be at the disposal of management. We believe that restricting management’s access to such resources is not in the interests of the corporation’s shareholders. We typically vote
against such proposals.   


 
(xxvi)  
Proposals to require the expensing of stock options – Current accounting standards in the U.S. require the expensing of stock options, but not all foreign countries have
adopted this standard. We believe that the expensing of stock options is beneficial in reviewing the financial condition of an issuer. We typically vote for such proposals.   


 
(xxvii)  
Proposals restricting business conduct for social and political reasons – We do not believe that social and political restrictions should be placed on a company’s
business operations, unless determined to be appropriate by management. While, from an investment perspective, we may consider how a company’s social and political practices may affect present and prospective valuations and returns, we believe
that proposals that prohibit companies from lines of business for social or political reasons are often motivated by narrow interest groups and are not in the best interest of the broad base of shareholders of a company. We believe that management
is in the best position to determine these fundamental business questions. We typically vote against such proposals.   


 
(xxviii)  
Proposals requiring companies’ divestiture from various businesses – Proposals to require companies to divest from certain businesses, like tobacco, or from
businesses that do not follow certain labor practices, are often motivated by narrow special interest groups. We believe that management is best suited to determine a company’s business strategy and to consider the interests of all shareholders
with respect to such matters. We typically vote against such proposals.  6 - Distressed and Defaulted Securities   


 
(i)
 Waivers and consents – We may consider the following when determining whether to support a waiver or consent to changes in provisions of indentures
governing debt securities which are held on behalf of clients: (a) likelihood that the granting of such waiver or consent will potentially increase recovery to clients; (b) potential for avoiding cross-defaults under 
  
Appendix A-14 




 
 
other agreements; and (c) likelihood that deferral of default will give the obligor an opportunity to improve its business operations. We will generally
vote such proposals on a case-by-case basis.   


 
(ii)
Voting on Chapter 11 plans of liquidation or reorganization – We may consider the following when determining whether to vote for or against a Chapter 11 plan in a case
pending with respect to an obligor under debt securities which are held on behalf of clients: (a) other alternatives to the proposed plan; (b) whether clients are treated appropriately and in accordance with applicable law with respect to
their distributions; (c) whether the vote is likely to increase or decrease recoveries to clients. We will generally vote such proposals on a case-by-case basis.  7 – Investment Companies and Alternative Investment Vehicles  The voting rights of alternative investment vehicles (i.e., hedge funds, private equity funds, and other alternative investment pools) generally are rights of contract set forth in the limited liability company agreement, the limited
partnership agreement, bylaws or memorandum and articles of association. We will vote all proxies or consents for unaffiliated investment companies and alternative investment vehicles in accordance with these Policies and Procedures. To the extent a
proposal relates to one of the following matters, we will vote such proposals on a case-by-case basis: (i) approval of investment advisory and/or distribution agreements; (ii) approval of distribution plans; (iii) changes in
fees or expenses; (iv) conversion of the company from closed-end to open-end form; (v) changes in the “fundamental policies” of the company; (vi) change in side pocket limitations; (vii) change in the state or form of
organization of the company; and (viii) dispositions of assets, termination or liquidations of the fund.  For clients invested in an
investment company or an alternative investment vehicle that is advised or sub-advised by U.S. Trust or its affiliates, the procedures set forth Appendix C will be followed.  8 - Other Shareholder proposals – Other shareholder proposals may arise from time to time that have not been previously considered by management. These proposals often have a narrow parochial focus. We typically
vote with management with regard to such proposals.   
Appendix A-15 


Appendix C- Conflicts Procedures  Conflicts Related to Voting of Shares of Investment Companies and Alternative Investment Vehicles advised or sub-advised by U.S. Trust or an affiliate  We may have voting authority for shares held by our clients in mutual funds or hedge funds managed by U.S. Trust or its affiliates. In these circumstances, we may have a
conflict of interest in voting these shares on behalf of our clients, particularly in matters relating to approval of the investment management agreement, advisory or other fees or mergers and acquisitions. In all cases, it is our policy to instruct
ISS to vote these shares in accordance with its own recommendations or the recommendations of another independent third-party proxy voting firm.  Conflicts Associated with Voting of Shares Issued by Affiliated Companies  U.S. Trust is affiliated with Charles Schwab & Co.
(“Schwab”), which is a publicly registered company. U.S. Trust may have voting authority for shares held by its clients in Schwab. We may have a conflict of interest in voting these shares on behalf of our clients as a result of this
affiliation. In all cases, it is our policy to instruct ISS to vote Schwab securities in accordance with its own recommendations or the recommendations of another independent third-party proxy voting firm.  The Proxy Committee will periodically obtain representations and assurances from ISS (or any other agent selected by the Committee for purposes of these Conflicts
Procedures) that the agent is not itself conflicted from making such a recommendation. If the Proxy Committee determines that ISS (or such other agent) also has a conflict, it shall secure the services of another independent third-party proxy voting
firm and vote the shares in accordance with the recommendations of that firm.
