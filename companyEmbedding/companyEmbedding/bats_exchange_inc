LOUISVILLE SLUGGER CUSTOM BATS - HELPFUL TIPS


The importance of double-checking your designs before you purchase
On the REVIEW & BUY screen, you will have a chance to review your design choices and make changes before you purchase. This is very important because a customized bat cannot be returned and your purchase is non-refundable. PLEASE MAKE SURE ALL INFORMATION IS CORRECT before you proceed to purchase.
Making changes before you purchase
If you want to make a correction or just change things up, you can do so before you purchase. While in the Review and Buy screen, just click any pencil icon and you'll be taken back to the customize and personalize screens to make your desired changes. Once you are satisfied, remember to review your changes carefully on the REVIEW AND BUY screen because a custom bat cannot be returned.
Our right to refuse personalizations that break our rules
	  				We reserve the right to refuse any requested personalizations that contain any of the following:
	  				
Inappropriate or vulgar words, even abbreviated vulgar words.
Names of Major League players OR Major League teams
NCAA licensed marks
Any other trademarked marks, words or phrases

All final decisions are at the sole discretion of Louisville Slugger. Customize responsibly!
Sharing your masterpiece
You're an artist. A visionary. Show your friends what you just created and reveal to them your true genius! You can share your bat on Facebook, Twitter or send it to all of your family and friends via email by clicking the appropriate icon on the REVIEW AND BUY screen. This is also a great way to send someone a "hint" for the holidays or your birthday, or just because you're awesome.
Add to Cart
You've double checked all of your customizations and personalizations and you're now ready to purchase! To begin, click the "Add to Cart" button from the Review and Buy screen. You will be directed to the cart where you will enter your personal details, payment option, billing and shipping information. Once your payment is accepted, your order will be sent to our factory where we'll start building your custom Louisville Slugger bat!

Louisville Slugger Custom Bats only ship within the United States. We are currently unable to accept or ship international or APO/FPO orders.
Security
Protecting your order information is our first concern. Louisville Slugger protects your Custom Bat order information by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology, with a digital certificate provided by Network Solutions.

Your credit card will be charged immediately upon placing your Louisville Slugger Custom Bat order. Look for an email when your order has been shipped.

If approval cannot be obtained during checkout, you will be contacted either by phone or email and the problem will be indicated. You will then be given an opportunity to provide corrected information.

Trader Incentive Programs
Bats introduced the CLP program to the industry when it launched its ETF Marketplace in 2012. Since then, Bats has been at the forefront of innovation, working with traders and issuers to develop mutually beneficial programs that help ETPs succeed.

Bats Lead Market Maker Program
The Bats Lead Market Maker (LMM) Program  is a rewards-based program that incentivizes Market Makers* based on their participation in Bats-listed ETPs. As an LMM on the Bats ETF Marketplace, a firm is the exclusive Market Maker for that ETP. LMMs are rewarded for their participation through two pricing intiatives.
The Bats ETF Marketplace first rewards LMMs with outsized rebates for executed liquidity and reduced fees for removing liquidity in their registered ETPs. And, no fees are charged in the closing auction.

Secondly, our LMMs are rewarded with an incremental rebate per share above their standard equity pricing for adding displayed liquidity on the Bats BZX Exchange in all Tape B securities.
This incremental rebate is based on the total number of ETPs assigned to the LMM for the month. LMMs earn one “credit” for each ETP to which they are assigned, no matter the ETP’s size. The total number of credits is calculated monthly, and the LMMs receive the incremental rebate as shown in the table below.
For example, if an LMM has 170 ETPs assigned to them, their incremental rebate over the standard equity pricing would be $.0004 per share.

For LMM assignments that change intra month, LMMs will receive credits on a pro-rata basis. For example, if an LMM is registered for 85 Bats-listed ETPs at the beginning of the month and assumes the LMM role for 50 more listings on the 10th trading day of the month (out of 20 total trading days), the LMM will be rewarded a total of 110 credits for the month: 85 + (50 x 10/20) = 110. The LMM would qualify for a rebate of $.0003 per share for adding displayed liquidity in Tape B securities on BZX during that month.

Competitive Liquidity Provider Program
The Competitive Liquidity Provider (CLP) program is a supplemental, rewards-based program designed to encourage quoting activity for Bats-listed stocks. Issuers may take advantage of the CLP program in addition to the Bats LMM program to attract liquidity to the ETPs. The CLP program is currently operating as a pilot program on the Exchange, and unless extended, would currently expire on July 31, 2017.
ETPs are eligible to participate in the CLP program until trading in the stock reaches one million shares CADV (Consolidated Average Daily Volume). ETPs initially listed on Bats may also participate in the program for the first six months, regardless of their CADV.
Each liquidity provider must be a registered Market Maker* and register to be a CLP for the ETP. Liquidity providers may be a CLP in multiple listings.

 View This Page as a PDF

How the Program Works
The Bats CLP program attracts traders and institutions in two ways:
First, the program encourages initial involvement by allowing multiple registered CLPs to participate in the launch of the ETP. This makes it easier for liquidity providers to participate by allowing each of them to put up a smaller amount of seed capital, which may limit their individual risk. This arrangement also promotes more liquidity from the beginning because multiple CLPs have a stake in the ETP.
Secondly, the program encourages participation post-IPO with an incentive for CLPs to provide liquidity and create tighter spreads, which may result in enhanced liquidity and market quality in CLP securities. This is done with an issuer-sponsored, monetary reward in which CLPs compete against each other. It is possible that upon withdrawal from the CLP program, a CLP security may experience lower levels of liquidity and a negative price impact as compared to the period during which the security was participating in the CLP program.







CLP Reward
Each day CLPs compete for a reward ranging from $20–$400. The reward is split between the top two CLPs on the bid side and the offer side. The top two CLPs on each side receive 60% and 40% of their side's split, respectively.
For example, if the daily reward for an ETP is $200, $100 is awarded to the top two CLPs on the bid side and $100 is awarded to the top two CLPs on the offer side — $60 going to the first-place CLP, and $40 going to the second-place CLP.
To become one of the top two CLPs, Market Makers are awarded "credits" for winning SETs (Size Event Tests) during the trading day. A SET is a random testing event done within each second between 9:25 a.m. and 4:05 p.m. ET.
Winning SETs and Credit Distribution
The three CLPs with the greatest aggregate size at the NBB (or NBO) for a security will win the SET. The CLP with the most aggregate size will win first place and be awarded three credits; second place will receive two credits, and third place will receive one credit.
If there is a tie for third place, all CLPs in third place will receive one credit. If there is a tie for second place, there will be no third-place winner.

Qualification Details
In order to qualify for winning a SET:

CLPs must quote a minimum of 500 shares on a side to win that side.
CLPs must be quoting at least one round lot at or within 1.2% of their offer (bid) to have a winning-offer SET (winning-bid SET).
Only round lots will be counted toward the CLP's quoted size.

Reward Payout
At the end of the day, the two CLPs on both the bid and offer side that have earned the most credits will receive 60% and 40%, respectively. If only one CLP qualifies for the reward, the CLP will receive the entire reward.
Additionally, CLPs must win at least 10% of the SETs each day to qualify for the reward.
CLP Score Card
To track an ETP's performance and activity within the ETP, Bats provides a score card to both issuers and CLPs. The score card details SET rankings and other significant metrics, such as CLP market share percentage, and the average trade size.

        I. Introduction
On October 30, 2014, BATS Exchange, Inc. (“BATS”), BATS Y-Exchange, Inc. (“BYX”), EDGA Exchange, Inc. (“EDGA”), and EDGX Exchange, Inc.; (“EDGX”) (collectively, the “Exchanges”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”), pursuant to section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Act”) [1] 
           and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,[2] 

           proposed rule changes to establish a new market data product called the “BATS One Feed.” On November 13, 2014, each of the Exchanges filed an Amendment No. 1 to its proposed rule change. The proposed rule changes, each as amended by an Amendment No. 1, were published for comment in the Federal Register on November 20, 2014.[3] 
           On December 15, 2014, each of the Exchanges filed an Amendment No. 2 to its proposed rule change. On December 15, 2014, each of the Exchanges submitted a comment letter on its proposed rule change, each of which included a redline showing the changes made by their Amendments No. 2.[4] 
           No other comments on the proposed rule changes have been received. However, similar proposed rule changes were filed with the Commission by the Exchanges earlier this year and subsequently withdrawn; [5] 
           three Start Printed Page 78921comment letters were received in response to two of those proposed rule changes.[6] 
           The Commission is publishing this Notice and Order to solicit comment on the Amendments No. 2 and to approve each of the proposed rule changes, as modified by Amendments Nos. 1 and 2, on an accelerated basis.
II. Description of the Proposals
The Exchanges propose to establish a new market data product called the BATS One Feed, which would be offered by each of the Exchanges. The BATS One Feed would be a consolidated data feed based on market data derived from underlying data feeds offered by each of the Exchanges. Specifically, the Exchanges would use the following data feeds, which are also available to other vendors, to create the proposed BATS One Feed: the EdgeBook Depth feed for EDGX, the EdgeBook Depth feed for EDGA, the BYX PITCH Feed, and the BATS PITCH Feed. The Exchanges have represented that they will continue to make these individual underlying feeds available and that, as a result, the source of the market data they would use to create the proposed BATS One Feed would be the same as the source available to other vendors. As described more fully below, the BATS One Feed would be a data feed that disseminates, on a real-time basis, the aggregate best bid and offer (“BBO”) of all displayed orders for securities traded on the Exchanges and for which the Exchanges report quotes under the Consolidated Tape Association (“CTA”) Plan or the Nasdaq/UTP Plan. The BATS One Feed would also contain the individual last sale information for each of the Exchanges. In addition, the BATS One Feed would include messages from the Exchanges about trading on their markets. Finally, the BATS One Feed would contain an optional functionality that would enable recipients to elect to receive aggregated two-sided quotations from the Exchanges for up to five (5) price levels.
Description of the BATS One Feed
The BATS One Feed would contain the aggregate BBO of the Exchanges for all securities that are traded on the Exchanges and for which the Exchanges report quotes under the CTA Plan or the Nasdaq/UTP Plan. The aggregate BBO would include the total size of all orders at the BBO available on all Exchanges.[7] 
           The BATS One Feed would also disseminate last sale information for each of the individual Exchanges. The last sale information would include the price, size, time of execution, and the individual Exchange on which the trade was executed. The last sale message would also include the cumulative number of shares executed on all Exchanges for that trading day. The Exchanges have represented that they would disseminate the aggregate BBO of the Exchanges and last sale information through the BATS One Feed no earlier than each individual Exchange provides its BBO and last sale information to the processors under the CTA Plan or the Nasdaq/UTP Plan.
The BATS One Feed would also include Symbol Summary, Market Status, Retail Liquidity Identifier on behalf of BYX, Trading Status, and Trade Break messages. The Symbol Summary message would include the total executed volume across all of the Exchanges. The Market Status message would be disseminated to reflect a change in the status of one of the Exchanges. For example, the Market Status message would indicate whether one of the Exchanges is experiencing a systems issue or disruption and quotation or trade information from that market is not currently being disseminated via the BATS One Feed as part of the aggregated BBO. The Market Status message would also indicate when an Exchange is no longer experiencing a systems issue or disruption to properly reflect the status of the aggregated BBO.
The Retail Liquidity Identifier indicator message would be disseminated via the BATS One Feed on behalf of the BYX only pursuant to BYX's Retail Price Improvement (“RPI”) Program.[8] 

           The Retail Liquidity Identifier indicates when RPI interest priced at least $0.001 better than BYX's Protected Bid or Protected Offer for a particular security is available in the System. The Exchanges propose to disseminate the Retail Liquidity Indicator via the BATS One Feed in the same manner as it is currently disseminated through consolidated data streams (i.e., pursuant to the Consolidated Tape Association Plan/Consolidated Quotation Plan, or CTA/CQ, for Tape A and Tape B securities, and the Nasdaq UTP Plan for Tape C securities) as well as through proprietary BYX data feeds. The Retail Liquidity Identifier reflects the symbol and the side (buy or sell) of the RPI interest, but does not include the price or size of the RPI interest. In particular, like CQ and UTP quoting outputs, the BATS One Feed would include a field for codes related to the Retail Price Improvement Identifier. The codes indicate RPI interest that is priced better than BYX's Protected Bid or Protected Offer by at least the minimum level of price improvement as required by the Program.
The Trade Break message would indicate when an execution on one of the Exchanges has been broken in accordance with the individual Exchange's rules.[9] 
           The Trading Status message would indicate the current trading status of a security on each individual Exchange. For example, a Trading Status message would be sent when a short sale price restriction is in effect pursuant to Rule 201 of Regulation SHO (“Short Sale Circuit Breaker”),[10] 
           or the security is subject to a trading halt, suspension or pause declared by the listing market. A Trading Status message would be sent whenever a security's trading status changes.

Optional Functionality for Aggregate Depth of Book. The BATS One Feed would also offer an additional, optional functionality that would enable recipients to receive two-sided quotations from the Exchanges for five (5) price levels for all securities that are traded on the Exchanges. The option for Start Printed Page 78922receiving the BATS One Feed with this depth of book functionality is referred to as the “BATS One Premium Feed;” the option for receiving the BATS One Feed without this functionality is referred to as the “BATS One Summary Feed.” For each price level on one of the Exchanges, the BATS One Premium Feed option of the BATS One Feed would include a two-sided quote and the number of shares available to buy and sell at that particular price level.[11] 


Distribution of the BATS One Feed. The Exchanges represent that they have taken into consideration their affiliated relationships in the design of the BATS One Feed to assure that vendors would be able to offer a similar product on the same terms as the Exchanges, both from the perspective of latency and cost. The Exchanges have stated that they propose to offer the BATS One Feed voluntarily in response to demand from vendors and subscribers that are interested in receiving the aggregate BBO and last sale information from the Exchanges as part of a single data feed. The Exchanges assert that the BATS One Feed can be used by industry professionals and retail investors looking for a cost effective, easy-to-administer, high quality market data product with the characteristics of the BATS One Feed. The Exchanges also assert that the BATS One Feed would help protect a free and open market by providing vendors and subscribers additional choices in receiving this type of market data, thus promoting competition and innovation.
With respect to latency, the Exchanges have represented that the path for distribution by the Exchanges of BATS One Feed would not be faster than the path for distribution that would be used by a vendor to distribute an independently created a BATS One-like product. Accordingly, the Exchanges have stated, the proposed BATS One data feed is a data product that a competing vendor could create and sell without being in a disadvantaged position relative to the Exchange. In recognition that the Exchanges are the source of their own market data and affiliated with one another, the Exchanges have represented that the source of the market data they would use to create the proposed BATS One Feed is available to other vendors. Specifically, the Exchanges have represented that they would use the following data feeds to create the proposed BATS One Feed, each of which is available to other vendors: the EdgeBook Depth feed for EDGX, the EdgeBook Depth feed for EDGA, the BYX PITCH Feed, and the BATS PITCH Feed. The Exchanges have also represented that they will continue to make available these individual underlying feeds and that, as a result, the source of the market data they would use to create the proposed BATS One Feed is the same as the source available to competing vendors.
The Exchanges have also made the following representations regarding the latency of the BATS One Feed and any consolidated feed to be offered by a competing vendor. In order to create the BATS One Feed, the system creating and supporting the BATS One Feed would need to receive the individual data feeds from each Exchange and, in turn, aggregate and summarize that data to create the BATS One Feed and then distribute it to end users. This is the same process a competing vendor would undergo should it create a market data product similar to the BATS One Feed to distribute to its end users. In addition, a competing vendor could locate its servers in the same facilities as the system creating and supporting the BATS One Feed and could therefore receive the individual data feeds from each Exchange at the same time as the system creating and supporting the BATS One Feed. Thus, the Exchanges have stated that they would not have any unfair advantage over competing vendors with respect to obtaining data from the individual Exchanges, because the technology supporting the BATS One Feed would similarly need to obtain the underlying data feeds and because this connection would be on a level playing field with a competing vendor located at the same facility as the Exchanges. Likewise, the BATS One data feed would not have a speed advantage vis-à-vis competing vendors with respect to access to end user customers, whether those end users are also located in the same data center or not.
With regard to cost, the Exchanges have represented that they will file a separate rule filing with the Commission to establish fees for BATS One Feed and that these fees would be designed to ensure that vendors could compete with the Exchanges by creating a similar product. To ensure a vendor can compete with the Exchanges by creating the same product as the BATS One Feed and selling it to their clients, the Exchanges have also represented that they would charge their clients for the BATS One Feed an amount that is no less than the cost to a market data vendor to obtain all the underlying feeds, plus an amount to be determined that would reflect the value of the aggregation and consolidation function. Thus, the pricing for the BATS One Feed would enable a vendor to receive the underlying data feeds and offer a similar product on a competitive basis and with no pricing disadvantage relative to the Exchanges.
Implementation Date
The Exchanges have represented that they anticipate making the BATS One Feed available as soon as practicable after approval of the proposed rule changes by the Commission and the effectiveness of rule filings to establish the fees for the BATS One Feed.[12] 

III. Summary of Comments
As noted above, the Commission received three comment letters on previous versions of the proposed changes filed by some of the Exchanges.[13] 
           In their current proposals, the Exchanges have responded to the points raised by these commenters.
The three commenters generally oppose the proposed BATS One Feed. The Shatto Letter expressed general concerns about the transparency of order flow information to regulators. The Themis Letter expressed objections to the proposed BATS One Feed on the grounds that it would introduce a new proprietary data feed and expressed concerns generally about the complexity arising from the proliferation of new data technologies. In their response to the commenters, the Exchanges argued that the Themis Letter and Shatto Letter are not responsive to the issues raised in the proposal or are aimed at existing elements of U.S. market structure that have been previously approved by the Commission.
The SIFMA Letter primarily argues that the fees for the proposed BATS One Feed do not meet the requirements of the Act, including the requirement that such fees be “fair and reasonable” under section 11A(c)(1)(C) of the Act. SIFMA also contends that BATS has circumvented the requirement to receive Commission approval for this product by offering and marketing the BATS One Feed since August 1, 2014. In their response to the SIFMA Letter, the Exchanges noted that the thrust of the SIFMA Letter is aimed at the initially proposed fees, which have now been removed from the proposed rule changes and are to be filed with the Commission via separate rule filings. Start Printed Page 78923The Exchanges also noted that, while the SIFMA Letter correctly states that BATS has marketed the BATS One Feed since August 1, 2014, the SIFMA Letter incorrectly asserts that BATS has offered the BATS One Feed since that same date. The Exchanges have represented that all of their marketing materials have included statements that the BATS One Feed's implementation was pending to Commission approval, and at no point have the Exchanges offered the BATS One product for any use other than for testing and certification.
IV. Discussion and Commission Findings
After carefully considering the proposals and the comments submitted, the Commission finds that the proposed rule changes, as modified by Amendments Nos. 1 and 2, are consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to national securities exchanges.[14] 
           In particular, the Commission finds that the proposed rule changes are consistent with the requirements of section 11A(c)(1)(C) of the Act [15] 
           and with Rule 603(a)(2) of Regulation NMS thereunder,[16] 
           which requires that any national securities exchange, national securities association, broker, or dealer that distributes information with respect to quotations for or transactions in an NMS stock to a securities information processor, broker, dealer, or other persons shall do so on terms that are not unreasonably discriminatory. The Commission also finds that the proposed rule changes are consistent with section 6(b)(5) of the Act, which requires that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a free and open market and a national market system and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest, and section 6(b)(8) of the Act, which requires that the rules of an exchange not impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.[17] 

The Commission notes that, to create the BATS One Feed, the Exchanges would use underlying data feeds that belong to the Exchanges: the EdgeBook Depth feed for EDGX, the EdgeBook Depth feed for EDGA, the BYX PITCH Feed, and the BATS PITCH Feed. Accordingly, the Commission's review of the Exchanges' proposals has focused, in particular, on whether the proposals would result in affiliated exchanges—which are separate self-regulatory organizations under the Act—making their data products or services available to one another at terms (e.g., content, pricing, or latency) that are more favorable than those available to unaffiliated market participants.
The Exchanges have represented that the BATS One Feed would be created using underlying data feeds that are available for subscription by vendors. In recognition that the Exchanges are the source of their own market data and that they are affiliated with one another, the Exchanges have also represented that they will continue to make available all of the individual underlying feeds and that the source of the market data they would use to create the proposed BATS One Feed is the same as the source available to competing vendors.
With respect to latency, the Exchanges have represented that competing vendors could locate their servers in the same facilities as the system creating and supporting the BATS One Feed, and, therefore, could receive the underlying data feeds at the same time as the system creating and supporting the BATS One Feed. Therefore, the Exchanges have contended that, a competing vendor could obtain the underlying data feeds from the Exchanges on the same latency basis as the system that would be performing the aggregation and consolidation of the proposed BATS One Feed and could provide the same kind of product to its customers with the same latency they could achieve by purchasing the BATS One Feed from the Exchanges.[18] 
           The Exchanges have also represented that they have designed the BATS One Feed so that they would have no advantages over a competing vendor with respect to the speed of access to the underlying feeds.
With respect to pricing, although specific fees to be charged for the BATS One Feed are not part of the proposed rule changes, the Exchanges have represented that they will assess a fee that is at least equal to the aggregate cost of the underlying feeds (i.e., at least as much as the cost to a vendor of subscribing to each of the underlying data feeds), plus an additional amount (to be determined) that would reflect the value of the aggregation and consolidation function performed to create the BATS One Feed.[19] 

Based on the Exchange's representations with respect to the content, latency, and pricing of the BATS One Feed—which are central to the Commission's analysis of the proposal—the Commission finds that the Exchanges' proposals are consistent with the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to national securities exchanges. The Commission believes that these representations are designed to ensure that BATS, BYX, EDGA, and EDGX, which are separate self-regulatory organizations, do not, because of their relationship as affiliates, offer one another products or services on a more favorable basis than that available to other competing market participants.
For the foregoing reasons, the Commission finds that the proposed rule changes, as amended, are consistent with section 11A(c)(1)(C) of the Act and Rule 603(a)(2) of Regulation NMS Start Printed Page 78924thereunder,[20] 
           and sections 6(b)(5) and (b)(8) of the Act.[21] 

V. Accelerated Approval of Proposed Rule Changes, as Modified by Amendments No. 2
The Amendments No. 2 revised the proposed rule changes to: (i) Clarify how the BATS One Feed would be created, (ii) make additional clarifying statements with respect to the latency and cost of the BATS One Feed, and (iii) bring together the discussion of key aspects of the description of the proposal in the same section. Accordingly, the Commission does not believe that the Amendments No. 2 raises any novel regulatory issues and therefore finds that good cause exists to approve the proposals, as modified by Amendments Nos. 1 and 2, on an accelerated basis.

     SIFMA has objected to the BATS One Feed primarily over concerns about fees for this product being “fair and reasonable,” consistent with section 11A(c)(1)(C) of the Act. The Commission notes, however, that the proposed rule changes do not contain proposed fees and that Exchanges have represented that they will not offer the BATS One Feed until the requisite fee filings under section 19(b) of the Act have been filed and are effective. The Commission will review any such filings when they have been submitted.
 SIFMA has also argued that BATS has circumvented the process of receiving Commission approval and has been actively offering and marketing the BATS One Feed for months. The Commission notes, however, that the Exchanges have represented that, although they have been marketing the BATS One Feed, all of their marketing materials have included statements that the BATS One Feed's implementation was pending to Commission approval and at no point have the Exchanges offered the BATS One product for any use other than for testing and certification.

US SEC denies a second application to list bitcoin product

Denarium Bitcoins.


The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday denied for the second time this month a request to bring to market a first-of-its-kind product tracking bitcoin, the digital currency.
The SEC announced in a filing its decision denying Intercontinental Exchange Inc's NYSE Arca exchange the ability to list and trade the SolidX Bitcoin Trust, an exchange-traded product (ETP) that would trade like a stock and track the digital asset's price. Previously, the regulatory agency said it had concerns with a similar proposal by investors Cameron Winklevoss and Tyler Winklevoss.
"The Commission believes that the significant markets for bitcoin are unregulated," the SEC said in its filing, echoing language from its decision earlier this month on the application by CBOE's Bats exchange to list The Bitcoin ETF proposed by the Winklevoss brothers. On Friday, Bats asked the SEC to review its decision not to allow that fund to trade.

"We are reviewing the SEC's order and evaluating our next steps," said Daniel H. Gallancy, chief executive officer of SolidX Partners, a U.S. technology company that provides blockchain services. NYSE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Bitcoin had scaled to a record of more than $1,300 this month, higher than the price of an ounce of gold, as investors speculated that an ETF holding the digital currency could woo more people into buying the asset.
But after denial of the Winklevoss-proposed ETF, the digital currency's price plunged as much as 18 percent. It has rebounded partially since then and was at $1,041 on Tuesday, roughly unchanged from the previous day.
Bitcoin is a virtual currency that can be used to move money around the world quickly and with relative anonymity, without the need for a central authority, such as a bank or government.
Yet bitcoin presents a new set of risks to investors given its limited adoption, a number of massive cybersecurity breaches affecting bitcoin owners and the lack of consistent treatment of the assets by governments.
There is one remaining bitcoin ETP proposal awaiting a verdict from the SEC. Grayscale Investments' Bitcoin Investment Trust, backed by early bitcoin advocate Barry Silbert and his Digital Currency Group, filed an application last year.

History[edit]
The company was founded in June 2005 by Dave Cummings, a computer programmer. Cummings said he was inspired to start the company after observing Archipelago Holdings be acquired by the New York Stock Exchange and Instinet be acquired by NASDAQ within a week of each other in 2005. After the launch of Bats, other brokerage firms, hedge funds and other clients became involved with the company. Cummings publicized the Bats service by sending emails to companies highlighting the niche that could be carved out by trading on platforms other than the big two—NASDAQ and NYSE.[3] The niche that he sought for the company was for it to be "a neutral, private, broker-dealer owned, semi-profitable utility" with no party owning more than 20 percent.[4] He noted that the consolidation of the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ eliminated competition and they raised prices for their services. The Bats system was intended to charge less.[5] Among the items it did to draw customers was to offer free listings to companies with shares that traded a certain amount each day.[6]
Cummings stepped down in 2007 and was replaced by Joe Ratterman who had been associated with the company from the start. Cummings said in his resignation, "As Bats prepares to become an exchange, my ownership of a broker-dealer precludes me from serving in management". Cummings returned to his position as CEO at Tradebot.[4][7]
European expansion[edit]
Under the leadership of Joe Ratterman, in March 2008, Bats entered the European equities markets by establishing a multilateral trading facility (MTF) to compete on a pan-European basis against the incumbent securities exchanges. Bats Europe was formally launched in October 2008.[8][9]
In February 2011, Bats Global Markets agreed to buy Chi-X Europe, a competitor and largest pan-European MTF at the time, for $300 million. The deal was referred by the Office of Fair Trading to the Competition Commission in June 2011 for further investigation to "determine whether a substantial lessening of competition is probable as a result of the anticipated merger". However, the Competition Commission approved the transaction in late November 2011, leading to Bats closing the deal on 30 November 2011. In April 2011, Bats Global Markets confirmed that Mark Hemsley, CEO of Bats Europe, will be appointed CEO of the combined entity following Bats’ acquisition of Chi-X Europe. By April 2012 the technology integration between the two platforms was complete and Chi-X Europe customers were migrated onto the Bats Europe platform.[10][11][12][13][14]
Initial public offering[edit]
The company attempted to go public on March 23, 2012, as the first listing on its own exchange, but later withdrew the IPO the same day due to a disastrous glitch in the company's trading systems. The glitch resulted in Bats’ stock price falling from the original $16 offering price to as low as 4¢ a share. Three erroneous Apple trades on the Bats exchange triggered a circuit breaker which temporarily halted trading in that stock. Those trades were later canceled. Bats halted stocks on its exchange that were affected by the glitch and included stocks with ticker symbols beginning with letters A to BFZZZ. It later reopened trading in the affected symbols but decided to withdraw the Bats stock offering.[15][16][17]
Following the failed IPO, the Bats board of directors decided to separate the roles of chairman and CEO. Joe Ratterman had previously held both roles. Ratterman received the “unanimous support” of the directors to keep the positions of CEO and president.[18] In July 2012, Bats named Paul Atkins, a former U.S. Securities and Exchange commissioner, to the role of non-executive chairman of its board of directors.[19]
System issue[edit]
In January 2013, Bats admitted that what it called a "system issue" had generated problems with more than 400,000 trades, going back as far as 2008. Specifically, it admitted that prices had been executed that were “equal to or less than the so-called national best bid and offer price”, in violation of Reg NMS.[20]
Acquisition by CBOE[edit]
In September 2016 it was announced that BATS was to be acquired by CBOE Holdings in early 2017 and will pay about US$3.2 billion for it.[21] The transaction closed on March 1, 2017 [22]
Operations[edit]
United States[edit]
In the United States Bats operates two stock exchanges, the BZX Exchange and the BYX Exchange (The Bats Exchanges), which as of 2012 accounted for about 10-12% of all U.S. equity trading on a daily basis.[23][24] BZX and BYX are different chiefly because of their pricing structure and the BZX is almost four times bigger than the BYX.[25] Bats is the third largest stock exchange operator in the United States.[26]
In November 2008, Bats converted its ECN to a national securities exchange, BZX, which allowed Bats to participate in and earn market data fees from the United States consolidated tape plans, reduce its clearing costs and operate a primary listings business. In February 2010, Bats expanded into a new asset class by offering trading of listed equity options on BZX. In October 2010, Bats launched BYX, a second national securities exchange for trading listed cash equity securities. Bats launched a primary listings business in the United States on its BZX Exchange in December 2010 and launched its first listings of seven ETFs in January 2012.[8]
With BYX, Bats offered a different pricing model than its larger market, BZX.[27]
Europe[edit]
Bats entered the European equities markets in 2008, with the launch of Bats Europe, a pan-European multilateral trading facility (MTF).[9] In 2011 it acquired Chi-X Europe, a competitor and largest pan-European MTF at the time, this was merged with Bats Europe.[14]
Notable officers[edit]
Eric Swanson is Senior Vice President, General Counsel, and Secretary. He joined as General Counsel in January 2008.[28]
In 2014, company president William O'Brien disputed assertions in the book Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt. He was quoted in the New York Times as saying about the book's author, "Michael Lewis clearly has a blind side, as we’ve just discovered". O'Brien was "referring to a previous work by the journalist", the paper reported.[29] O'Brien's Twitter account was active[30] and he engaged in a "heated debate on live TV" with Lewis on CNBC[31] in the first days of the book's release and after an appearance by Lewis on 60 Minutes.[32] In the exchange with Lewis and IEX CEO, Brad Katsuyama, he denied that Direct Edge used low speed data sources for public pricing of trades, a point Katsuyama noted would support his own assertion that markets such as Direct Edge were structured to favor high-frequency traders. O'Brien's denial was false and he was publicly told to retract it by the New York District Attorney.[33] He left the company soon after.[34]

United States[edit]
In the United States Bats operates two stock exchanges, the BZX Exchange and the BYX Exchange (The Bats Exchanges), which as of 2012 accounted for about 10-12% of all U.S. equity trading on a daily basis.[23][24] BZX and BYX are different chiefly because of their pricing structure and the BZX is almost four times bigger than the BYX.[25] Bats is the third largest stock exchange operator in the United States.[26]

History[edit]
The company was founded in June 2005 by Dave Cummings, a computer programmer. Cummings said he was inspired to start the company after observing Archipelago Holdings be acquired by the New York Stock Exchange and Instinet be acquired by NASDAQ within a week of each other in 2005. After the launch of Bats, other brokerage firms, hedge funds and other clients became involved with the company. Cummings publicized the Bats service by sending emails to companies highlighting the niche that could be carved out by trading on platforms other than the big two—NASDAQ and NYSE.[3] The niche that he sought for the company was for it to be "a neutral, private, broker-dealer owned, semi-profitable utility" with no party owning more than 20 percent.[4] He noted that the consolidation of the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ eliminated competition and they raised prices for their services. The Bats system was intended to charge less.[5] Among the items it did to draw customers was to offer free listings to companies with shares that traded a certain amount each day.[6]
Cummings stepped down in 2007 and was replaced by Joe Ratterman who had been associated with the company from the start. Cummings said in his resignation, "As Bats prepares to become an exchange, my ownership of a broker-dealer precludes me from serving in management". Cummings returned to his position as CEO at Tradebot.[4][7]
European expansion[edit]
Under the leadership of Joe Ratterman, in March 2008, Bats entered the European equities markets by establishing a multilateral trading facility (MTF) to compete on a pan-European basis against the incumbent securities exchanges. Bats Europe was formally launched in October 2008.[8][9]
In February 2011, Bats Global Markets agreed to buy Chi-X Europe, a competitor and largest pan-European MTF at the time, for $300 million. The deal was referred by the Office of Fair Trading to the Competition Commission in June 2011 for further investigation to "determine whether a substantial lessening of competition is probable as a result of the anticipated merger". However, the Competition Commission approved the transaction in late November 2011, leading to Bats closing the deal on 30 November 2011. In April 2011, Bats Global Markets confirmed that Mark Hemsley, CEO of Bats Europe, will be appointed CEO of the combined entity following Bats’ acquisition of Chi-X Europe. By April 2012 the technology integration between the two platforms was complete and Chi-X Europe customers were migrated onto the Bats Europe platform.[10][11][12][13][14]
Initial public offering[edit]
The company attempted to go public on March 23, 2012, as the first listing on its own exchange, but later withdrew the IPO the same day due to a disastrous glitch in the company's trading systems. The glitch resulted in Bats’ stock price falling from the original $16 offering price to as low as 4¢ a share. Three erroneous Apple trades on the Bats exchange triggered a circuit breaker which temporarily halted trading in that stock. Those trades were later canceled. Bats halted stocks on its exchange that were affected by the glitch and included stocks with ticker symbols beginning with letters A to BFZZZ. It later reopened trading in the affected symbols but decided to withdraw the Bats stock offering.[15][16][17]
Following the failed IPO, the Bats board of directors decided to separate the roles of chairman and CEO. Joe Ratterman had previously held both roles. Ratterman received the “unanimous support” of the directors to keep the positions of CEO and president.[18] In July 2012, Bats named Paul Atkins, a former U.S. Securities and Exchange commissioner, to the role of non-executive chairman of its board of directors.[19]
System issue[edit]
In January 2013, Bats admitted that what it called a "system issue" had generated problems with more than 400,000 trades, going back as far as 2008. Specifically, it admitted that prices had been executed that were “equal to or less than the so-called national best bid and offer price”, in violation of Reg NMS.[20]
Acquisition by CBOE[edit]
In September 2016 it was announced that BATS was to be acquired by CBOE Holdings in early 2017 and will pay about US$3.2 billion for it.[21] The transaction closed on March 1, 2017 [22]
Operations[edit]
United States[edit]
In the United States Bats operates two stock exchanges, the BZX Exchange and the BYX Exchange (The Bats Exchanges), which as of 2012 accounted for about 10-12% of all U.S. equity trading on a daily basis.[23][24] BZX and BYX are different chiefly because of their pricing structure and the BZX is almost four times bigger than the BYX.[25] Bats is the third largest stock exchange operator in the United States.[26]
In November 2008, Bats converted its ECN to a national securities exchange, BZX, which allowed Bats to participate in and earn market data fees from the United States consolidated tape plans, reduce its clearing costs and operate a primary listings business. In February 2010, Bats expanded into a new asset class by offering trading of listed equity options on BZX. In October 2010, Bats launched BYX, a second national securities exchange for trading listed cash equity securities. Bats launched a primary listings business in the United States on its BZX Exchange in December 2010 and launched its first listings of seven ETFs in January 2012.[8]
With BYX, Bats offered a different pricing model than its larger market, BZX.[27]
Europe[edit]
Bats entered the European equities markets in 2008, with the launch of Bats Europe, a pan-European multilateral trading facility (MTF).[9] In 2011 it acquired Chi-X Europe, a competitor and largest pan-European MTF at the time, this was merged with Bats Europe.[14]
Notable officers[edit]
Eric Swanson is Senior Vice President, General Counsel, and Secretary. He joined as General Counsel in January 2008.[28]
In 2014, company president William O'Brien disputed assertions in the book Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt. He was quoted in the New York Times as saying about the book's author, "Michael Lewis clearly has a blind side, as we’ve just discovered". O'Brien was "referring to a previous work by the journalist", the paper reported.[29] O'Brien's Twitter account was active[30] and he engaged in a "heated debate on live TV" with Lewis on CNBC[31] in the first days of the book's release and after an appearance by Lewis on 60 Minutes.[32] In the exchange with Lewis and IEX CEO, Brad Katsuyama, he denied that Direct Edge used low speed data sources for public pricing of trades, a point Katsuyama noted would support his own assertion that markets such as Direct Edge were structured to favor high-frequency traders. O'Brien's denial was false and he was publicly told to retract it by the New York District Attorney.[33] He left the company soon after.[34]

Operations[edit]
United States[edit]
In the United States Bats operates two stock exchanges, the BZX Exchange and the BYX Exchange (The Bats Exchanges), which as of 2012 accounted for about 10-12% of all U.S. equity trading on a daily basis.[23][24] BZX and BYX are different chiefly because of their pricing structure and the BZX is almost four times bigger than the BYX.[25] Bats is the third largest stock exchange operator in the United States.[26]

Bats entered the European equities markets in 2008, with the launch of Bats Europe, a pan-European multilateral trading facility (MTF).[9] In 2011 it acquired Chi-X Europe, a competitor and largest pan-European MTF at the time, this was merged with Bats Europe.[14]
Notable officers[edit]
Eric Swanson is Senior Vice President, General Counsel, and Secretary. He joined as General Counsel in January 2008.[28]
In 2014, company president William O'Brien disputed assertions in the book Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt. He was quoted in the New York Times as saying about the book's author, "Michael Lewis clearly has a blind side, as we’ve just discovered". O'Brien was "referring to a previous work by the journalist", the paper reported.[29] O'Brien's Twitter account was active[30] and he engaged in a "heated debate on live TV" with Lewis on CNBC[31] in the first days of the book's release and after an appearance by Lewis on 60 Minutes.[32] In the exchange with Lewis and IEX CEO, Brad Katsuyama, he denied that Direct Edge used low speed data sources for public pricing of trades, a point Katsuyama noted would support his own assertion that markets such as Direct Edge were structured to favor high-frequency traders. O'Brien's denial was false and he was publicly told to retract it by the New York District Attorney.[33] He left the company soon after.[34]

Start Preamble
        
        
        
        July 28, 2014.
        Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Act”),[1] 
           and Rule 19b-4 thereunder,[2] 
           notice is hereby given that on July 14, 2014, BATS Exchange, Inc. (the “Exchange” or “BATS”) filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) the proposed rule change as described in Items I and II below, which Items have been prepared by the self-regulatory organization. The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.
I. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Terms of Substance of the Proposed Rule Change
The Exchange proposes to establish a new market data product called the BATS One Feed as well as to establish related market data fees. The text of the proposed BATS One Feed is attached as Exhibit 5A. The proposed changes to the fee schedule are attached as Exhibit 5B. Exhibits 5A and 5B are available on the Exchange's Web site at www.batstrading.com, at the Exchange's principal office and at the Public Reference Room of the Commission.
II. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
In its filing with the Commission, the self-regulatory organization included statements concerning the purpose of, and basis for, the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change. The text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in Item IV below. The self-regulatory organization has prepared summaries, set forth in sections A, B, and C below, of the most significant aspects of such statements.
A. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement of the Purpose of, and Statutory Basis for, the Proposed Rule Change
1. Purpose
The Exchange proposes to establish a new market data product called the BATS One Feed. As described more fully below, the BATS One Feed is a data feed that will disseminate, on a real-time basis, the aggregate best bid and offer (“BBO”) of all displayed orders for securities traded on BATS and its affiliated exchanges [3] 

           (collectively, the “BATS Exchanges”) and for which the BATS Exchanges report quotes under the Consolidated Start Printed Page 44942Tape Association (“CTA”) Plan or the Nasdaq/UTP Plan.[4] 
           The BATS One Feed will also contain the individual last sale information for BATS and each of its affiliated exchanges. In addition, the BATS One Feed will contain optional functionality which will enable recipients to elect to receive aggregated two-sided quotations from the BATS Exchanges for up to five (5) price levels.
The BATS One Feed is designed to meet the needs of prospective Members that do not need or are unwilling to pay for the individual book feeds offered by each of the individual BATS Exchanges. In addition, the BATS One Feed offers market data vendors and purchasers a suitable alternative to the use of consolidated data where consolidated data are not required to be purchased or displayed. Finally, the proposed new data feed provides investors with new options for receiving market data and competes with similar market data products offered by NYSE Technologies, an affiliate of the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. (“NYSE”) and the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (“Nasdaq”).[5] 
           The provision of new options for investors to receive market data was a primary goal of the market data amendments adopted by Regulation NMS.[6] 

Description of the BATS One Feed
The BATS One Feed will contain the aggregate BBO of the BATS Exchanges for all securities that are traded on the BATS Exchanges and for which the BATS Exchanges report quotes under the CTA Plan or the Nasdaq/UTP Plan. The aggregate BBO would include the total size of all orders at the BBO available on all BATS Exchanges.[7] 
           The BATS One Feed would also disseminate last sale information for each of the individual BATS Exchanges (collectively with the aggregate BBO, the “BATS One Summary Feed”). The last sale information will include the price, size, time of execution, and individual BATS Exchange on which the trade was executed. The last sale message will also include the cumulative number of shares executed on all BATS Exchanges for that trading day. The Exchange will disseminate the aggregate BBO of the BATS Exchanges and last sale information through the BATS One Feed no earlier than each individual BATS Exchange provides its BBO and last sale information to the processors under the CTA Plan or the Nasdaq/UTP Plan.
The BATS One Feed would also consist of Symbol Summary, Market Status, Retail Liquidity Identifier on behalf of BYX, Trading Status, and Trade Break messages. The Symbol Summary message will include the total executed volume across all BATS Exchanges. The Market Status message is disseminated to reflect a change in the status of one of the BATS Exchanges. For example, the Market Status message will indicate whether one of the BATS Exchanges is experiencing a systems issue or disruption and quotation or trade information from that market is not currently being disseminated via the BATS One Feed as part of the aggregated BBO. The Market Status message will also indicate where BATS Exchange is no longer experiencing a systems issue or disruption to properly reflect the status of the aggregated BBO.
The Retail Liquidity Identifier indicator message will be disseminated via the BATS One Feed on behalf of BYX only pursuant to BYX's Retail Price Improvement (“RPI”) Program.[8] 

           The Retail Liquidity Identifier indicates when RPI interest priced at least $0.001 better than BYX's Protected Bid or Protected Offer for a particular security is available in the System. The Exchange proposes to disseminate the Retail Liquidity Indicator via the BATS One Feed in the same manner as it is currently disseminated through consolidated data streams (i.e., pursuant to the Consolidated Tape Association Plan/Consolidated Quotation Plan, or CTA/CQ, for Tape A and Tape B securities, and the Nasdaq UTP Plan for Tape C securities) as well as through proprietary BATS data feeds. The Retail Liquidity Identifier will reflect the symbol and the side (buy or sell) of the RPI interest, but does not include the price or size of the RPI interest. In particular, like CQ and UTP quoting outputs, the BATS One Feed will include a field for codes related to the Retail Price Improvement Identifier. The codes indicate RPI interest that is priced better than BYX's Protected Bid or Protected Offer by at least the minimum level of price improvement as required by the Program.
The Trade Break message will indicate when an execution on a BATS Exchange is broken in accordance with the individual BATS Exchange's rules.[9] 
           The Trading Status message will indicate the current trading status of a security on each individual BATS Exchange. For example, a Trading Status message will be sent when a short sale price restriction is in effect pursuant to Rule 201 of Regulation SHO (“Short Sale Circuit Breaker”),[10] 
           or the security is subject to a trading halt, suspension or pause declared by the listing market. A Trading Status message will be sent whenever a security's trading status changes.

Optional Aggregate Depth of Book. The BATS One Feed will also contain optional functionality which will enable recipients to receive two-sided quotations from the BATS Exchanges for five (5) price levels for all securities that are traded on the BATS Exchanges in addition to the BATS One Summary Feed (“BATS One Premium Feed”). For each price level on one of the BATS Exchanges, the BATS One Premium Feed option of the BATS One Feed will include a two-sided quote and the number of shares available to buy and sell at that particular price level.[11] 

BATS One Feed Fees
The Exchange proposes to amend its fee schedule to incorporate fees related to the BATS One Feed. The Exchange Start Printed Page 44943proposes to charge different fees to vendors depending on whether the vendor elects to receive: (i) BATS One Summary Feed; or (ii) the optional BATS One Premium Feed. These fees include the following, each of which are described in detail below: (i) Distributor Fees; [12] 
           (ii) Usage Fees for both Professional and Non-Professional Users; [13] 
           and (iii) Enterprise Fees.[14] 
           The amount of each fee may differ depending on whether they use the BATS One Feed data for internal or external distribution. Vendors that distribute the BATS One Feed data both internally and externally will be subject to the higher of the two Distribution Fees.

Definitions. The Exchange also proposes to include in its fee schedule the following defined terms that relate to the BATS One Feed fees.

“Distributor” will be defined as “any entity that receives the BATS One Feed directly from BATS or indirectly through another entity and then distributes it internally or externally to a third party.” [15] 



“Internal Distributor” will be defined as a “Distributor that receives the BATS One Feed and then distributes that data to one or more Users within the Distributor's own entity.” [16] 



“External Distributor” will be defined as a “Distributor that receives the BATS One Feed and then distributes that data to one or more Users outside the Distributor's own entity.” [17] 



“User” will be defined as a “natural person, a proprietorship, corporation, partnership, or entity, or device (computer or other automated service), that is entitled to receive Exchange data.”
“Non-Professional User” will be defined as “a natural person who is not: (i) Registered or qualified in any capacity with the Commission, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, any state securities agency, any securities exchange or association; any commodities or futures contract market or association; (ii) engaged as an “investment adviser” as that term is defined in Section 201(11) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (whether or not registered or qualified under that Act); or (iii) employed by a bank or other organization exempt from registration under federal or state securities laws to perform functions that will require registration or qualification if such functions were performed for an organization not so exempt.” [18] 



“Professional User” will be defined as “any User other than a Non-Professional User.” [19] 



Internal Distribution Fees. Each Internal Distributor that receives only the BATS One Summary Feed shall pay an Internal Distributor Fee of $10,000.00 per month. Each Internal Distributor shall pay an Internal Distributor Fee of $15,000.00 per month where they elect to also receive the BATS One Premium Feed. The Exchange will charge no usage fees for BATS One Feed where the data is received and subsequently internally distributed to Professional or Non-Professional Users.

External Distribution Fees. The Exchange proposes to charge those firms that distribute the BATS One Feed externally an External Distributor Fee of $2,500.00 per month for the BATS One Summary Feed. Each External Distributor shall pay an External Distributor Fee of $5,000.00 per month where they elect to also receive the BATS One Premium Feed. The Exchange also proposes to establish a New External Distributor Credit under which new External Distributors will not be charged a Distributor Fee for their first three (3) months in order to allow them to enlist new Users to receive the BATS One Feed.
In addition to Internal and External Distribution Fees, the Exchange also proposes to charge recipient firms who receive the BATS One Feed from External Distributors different fees for both their Professional Users and Non-Professional Users. The Exchange will assess a monthly fee for Professional Users of $10.00 per user for receipt of the BATS One Summary Feed or $15.00 per user who elect to also receive the BATS One Premium Feed. Non-Professional Users will be assessed a monthly fee of $0.25 per user for the BATS One Summary Feed or $0.50 per user where they elects to also receive the BATS One Premium Feed.
External Distributors must count every Professional User and Non-Professional User to which they provide BATS One Feed data. Thus, the Distributor's count will include every person and device that accesses the data regardless of the purpose for which the individual or device uses the data.[20] 
           Distributors must report all Professional and Non-Professional Users in accordance with the following:

In connection with an External Distributor's distribution of the BATS One Feed, the Distributor should count as one User each unique User that the Distributor has entitled to have access to the BATS One Feed. However, where a device is dedicated specifically to a single individual, the Distributor should count only the individual and need not count the device.
The External Distributor should identify and report each unique User. If a User uses the same unique method to gain access to the BATS One Feed, the Distributor should count that as one User. However, if a unique User uses multiple methods to gain access to the BATS One Feed (e.g., a single User has multiple passwords and user identifications), the External Distributor should report all of those methods as an individual User.
External Distributors should report each unique individual person who receives access through multiple devices as one User so long as each device is dedicated specifically to that individual.
If an External Distributor entitles one or more individuals to use the same device, the External Distributor should Start Printed Page 44944include only the individuals, and not the device, in the count.

Each External Distributor will receive a credit against its monthly Distributor Fee for the BATS One Feed equal to the amount of its monthly Usage Fees up to a maximum of the Distributor Fee for the BATS One Feed. For example, an External Distributor will be subject to a $5,000.00 monthly Distributor Fee where they elect to receive the BATS One Premium Feed. If that External Distributor reports User quantities totaling $5,000.00 or more of monthly usage of the BATS One Premium Feed, it will pay no net Distributor Fee, whereas if that same External Distributor were to report User quantities totaling $4,000.00 of monthly usage, it will pay a net of $1,000 for the Distributor Fee.

Enterprise Fee. The Exchange also proposes to establish a $50,000.00 per month Enterprise Fee that will permit a recipient firm who receives the BATS Summary Feed portion of the BATS One Feed from an external distributor to receive the data for an unlimited number of Professional and Non-Professional Users and $100,000.00 per month for recipient firms who elect to also receive the BATS One Premium Feed. For example, if a recipient firm had 15,000 Professional Subscribers who each receive the BATS One Summary Feed portion of the BATS One Feed at $10.00 per month, then that recipient firm will pay $150,000.00 per month in Professional Subscriber fees. Under the proposed Enterprise Fee, the recipient firm will pay a flat fee of $50,000.00 for an unlimited number of Professional and Non-Professional Users for the BATS Summary Feed portion of the BATS One Feed. A recipient firm must pay a separate Enterprise Fee for each External Distributor that controls display of the BATS One Feed if it wishes such Subscriber to be covered by an Enterprise Fee rather than by per-Subscriber fees. A Subscriber that pays the Enterprise Fee will not have to report the number of such Subscribers on a monthly basis. However, every six months, a Subscriber must provide the Exchange with a count of the total number of natural person users of each product, including both Professional and Non-Professional Users.
Implementation Date
The Exchange will announce the effective date of the proposed rule change in a Trading Notice to be published as soon as practicable following approval of the proposed rule change by the Commission. The Exchange anticipates making available the BATS One Feed for evaluation as soon as practicable after approval of the proposed rule change by the Commission.
2. Statutory Basis
The BATS One Feed
The Exchange believes that the proposed BATS One Feed is consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act,[21] 
           in general, and furthers the objectives of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,[22] 
           in particular, in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system, and to protect investors and the public interest, and that it is not designed to permit unfair discrimination among customers, brokers, or dealers. This proposal is in keeping with those principles in that it promotes increased transparency through the dissemination of the BATS One Feed. The Exchange also believes this proposal is consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Act because it protects investors and the public interest and promotes just and equitable principles of trade by providing investors with new options for receiving market data as requested by market data vendors and purchasers that expressed an interest in exchange-only data for instances where consolidated data is no longer required to be purchased and displayed. The proposed rule change would benefit investors by facilitating their prompt access to real-time last sale information and best-bid-and-offer information contained in the BATS One Feed.
The Exchange also believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with Section 11(A) of the Act [23] 
           in that it supports (i) fair competition among brokers and dealers, among exchange markets, and between exchange markets and markets other than exchange markets and (ii) the availability to brokers, dealers, and investors of information with respect to quotations for and transactions in securities. Furthermore, the proposed rule change is consistent with Rule 603 of Regulation NMS,[24] 
           which provides that any national securities exchange that distributes information with respect to quotations for or transactions in an NMS stock do so on terms that are not unreasonably discriminatory.
In adopting Regulation NMS, the Commission granted self-regulatory organizations and broker-dealers increased authority and flexibility to offer new and unique market data to consumers of such data. It was believed that this authority would expand the amount of data available to users and consumers of such data and also spur innovation and competition for the provision of market data. The Exchange believes that the data products proposed herein are precisely the sort of market data products that the Commission envisioned when it adopted Regulation NMS. The Commission concluded that Regulation NMS—by lessening regulation of the market in proprietary data—would itself further the Act's goals of facilitating efficiency and competition: 
[E]fficiency is promoted when broker-dealers who do not need the data beyond the prices, sizes, market center identifications of the NBBO and consolidated last sale information are not required to receive (and pay for) such data. The Commission also believes that efficiency is promoted when broker-dealers may choose to receive (and pay for) additional market data based on their own internal analysis of the need for such data.[25]

        By removing “unnecessary regulatory restrictions” on the ability of exchanges to sell their own data, Regulation NMS advanced the goals of the Act and the principles reflected in its legislative history.
If the free market should determine whether proprietary data is sold to broker-dealers at all, it follows that the price at which such data is sold should be set by the market as well. The BATS One Feed is precisely the sort of market data product that the Commission envisioned when it adopted Regulation NMS.
The BATS One Feed would be distributed and purchased on a voluntary basis, in that neither the BATS Exchanges nor market data distributors are required by any rule or regulation to make this data available. Accordingly, distributors and users can discontinue use at any time and for any reason, including due to an assessment of the reasonableness of fees charged.
BATS One Feed Fees
The Exchange also believes that the proposed fees for the BATS One Feed are consistent with Section 6(b) of the Act,[26] 
           in general, and Section 6(b)(4) of the Act,[27] 

           in particular, in that it [sic] they provide for an equitable allocation of reasonable fees among users and recipients of the data and are not Start Printed Page 44945designed to permit unfair discrimination among customers, brokers, or dealers. In adopting Regulation NMS, the Commission granted self-regulatory organizations and broker-dealers increased authority and flexibility to offer new and unique market data to the public. It was believed that this authority would expand the amount of data available to consumers, and also spur innovation and competition for the provision of market data.
The Exchange also notes that products described herein are entirely optional. Firms are not required to purchase the BATS One Feed. Firms have a wide variety of alternative market data products from which to choose. Moreover, the Exchange is not required to make these proprietary data products available or to offer any specific pricing alternatives to any customers. The decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit in NetCoalition v.  SEC, 615 F.3d 525 (D.C. Cir. 2010), upheld reliance by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) upon the existence of market forces to set reasonable and equitably allocated fees for proprietary market data: 
In fact, the legislative history indicates that the Congress intended that the market system `evolve through the interplay of competitive forces as unnecessary regulatory restrictions are removed' and that the SEC wield its regulatory power `in those situations where competition may not be sufficient,' such as in the creation of a `consolidated transactional reporting system.' [28] 

The court agreed with the Commission's conclusion that “Congress intended that `competitive forces should dictate the services and practices that constitute the U.S. national market system for trading equity securities.' ” [29] 

The 2010 Dodd-Frank amendments to the Exchange Act reinforce the court's conclusions about congressional intent. On July 21, 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law H.R. 4173, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (“Dodd-Frank Act”), which amended Section 19 of the Act. Among other things, Section 916 of the Dodd-Frank Act amended paragraph (A) of Section 19(b)(3) of the Act by inserting the phrase “on any person, whether or not the person is a member of the self-regulatory organization” after “due, fee or other charge imposed by the self-regulatory organization.” As a result, all SRO rule proposals establishing or changing dues, fees, or other charges are immediately effective upon filing regardless of whether such dues, fees, or other charges are imposed on members of the SRO, non-members, or both. Section 916 further amended paragraph (C) of Section 19(b)(3) of the Exchange Act to read, in pertinent part, “At any time within the 60-day period beginning on the date of filing of such a proposed rule change in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1) [of Section 19(b)], the Commission summarily may temporarily suspend the change in the rules of the self-regulatory organization made thereby, if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of this title. If the Commission takes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings under paragraph (2)(B) [of Section 19(b)] to determine whether the proposed rule should be approved or disapproved.” The court's conclusions about Congressional intent are therefore reinforced by the Dodd-Frank Act amendments, which create a presumption that exchange fees, including market data fees, may take effect immediately, without prior Commission approval, and that the Commission should take action to suspend a fee change and institute a proceeding to determine whether the fee change should be approved or disapproved only where the Commission has concerns that the change may not be consistent with the Act. As explained below in the Exchange's Statement on Burden on Competition, the Exchange believes that there is substantial evidence of competition in the marketplace for data and that the Commission can rely upon such evidence in concluding that the fees established in this filing are the product of competition and therefore satisfy the relevant statutory standards.[30] 

           In addition, the existence of alternatives to these data products, such as proprietary last sale data from other sources, as described below, further ensures that the Exchange cannot set unreasonable fees, or fees that are unreasonably discriminatory, when vendors and subscribers can elect such alternatives. As the NetCoalition decision noted, the Commission is not required to undertake a cost-of-service or ratemaking approach.

User Fees. The Exchange believes that implementing the Professional and Non-Professional User fees for the BATS One Feed is reasonable because it will make the product more affordable and result in their greater availability to Professional and Non-Professional Users. Moreover, introducing a Non-Professional User fee for the BATS One Feed is reasonable because it provides an additional method for retail investors to access the BATS One Feed data and provides the same data that is available to Professional Users.
In addition, the proposed fees are reasonable when compared to fees for comparable products offered by the NYSE, Nasdaq, and under the CTA and CQ Plans. Specifically, Nasdaq offers Nasdaq Basic, which includes best bid and offer and last sale data for Nasdaq and the FINRA/Nasdaq TRF, for a monthly fee of $26 per professional subscriber and $1 per non-professional subscriber; alternatively, a broker-dealer may purchase an enterprise license at a rate of $100,000 per month for distribution to an unlimited number of non-professional users or $365,000 per month for up to 16,000 professional users, plus $2 for each additional professional user over 16,000.[31] 
           The Exchange notes that Nasdaq Basic also offers data for Nasdaq OMX BX and Nasdaq OMX PSX, as described below. The NYSE offers BQT, which provides BBO and last sale information for the NYSE, NYSE Arca, and NYSE MKT, for a monthly fee of $18 per professional subscriber and $1 per non-professional subscriber; alternatively, a broker-dealer may purchase an enterprise license at a rate of $365,000 per month for an unlimited number of professional users. The NYSE does not offer an enterprise license for non-professional users. BATS's proposed per-user fees are lower than the NYSE's and Nasdaq's fees. In addition, the Exchange is proposing Professional and Non-Professional User fees and Enterprise Fees that are less than the fees currently charged by the CTA and CQ Plans. Under the CTA and CQ Plans, Tape A consolidated last sale and bid-ask data are offered together for a monthly fee of $20-$50 per device, depending on the number of professional subscribers, and $1.00 per non-professional subscriber, depending on the number of non-professional subscribers.[32] 

           A monthly enterprise fee of $686,400 is available under which a Start Printed Page 44946U.S. registered broker-dealer may distribute data to an unlimited number of its own employees and its nonprofessional subscriber brokerage account customers. Finally, in contrast to Nasdaq UTP and the CTA and CQ Plans, the Exchange also will permit enterprise distribution by a non-broker-dealer.

Enterprise Fee. The proposed Enterprise Fee for the BATS One Feed is reasonable as the fee proposed is less than the enterprise fees currently charged for NYSE BQT, Nasdaq Basic, and consolidated data distributed under the Nasdaq UTP and the CTA and CQ Plans. In addition, the Enterprise Fee could result in a fee reduction for recipient firms with a large number of Professional and Non-Professional Users. If a recipient firm has a smaller number of Professional Users of the BATS One Feed, then it may continue using the per user structure and benefit from the per user fee reductions. By reducing prices for recipient firms with a large number of Professional and Non-Professional Users, the Exchange believes that more firms may choose to receive and to distribute the BATS One Feed, thereby expanding the distribution of this market data for the benefit of investors.
The Exchange further believes that the proposed Enterprise Fee is reasonable because it will simplify reporting for certain recipients that have large numbers of Professional and Non-Professional Users. Firms that pay the proposed Enterprise Fee will not have to report the number of Users on a monthly basis as they currently do, but rather will only have to count natural person users every six months, which is a significant reduction in administrative burden.
The Exchange believes that the proposed fees are equitable and not unfairly discriminatory because they will be charged uniformly to recipient firms and Users that select these products. The fee structure of differentiated professional and non-professional fees has long been used by other exchanges for their proprietary data products, and by the Nasdaq UTP and the CTA and CQ Plans in order to reduce the price of data to retail investors and make it more broadly available.[33] 
           Offering the BATS One Feed to Non-Professional Users with the same data available to Professional Users results in greater equity among data recipients. Finally, the Exchange believes that it is equitable and not unfairly discriminatory to establish an Enterprise Fee because it reduces the Exchange's costs and the Distributor's administrative burdens in tracking and auditing large numbers of users.

Distribution Fee. The Exchange believes that the proposed Distribution Fees are also reasonable, equitably allocated, and not unreasonably discriminatory. The fees for Members and non-Members are uniform except with respect to reasonable distinctions with respect to internal and external distribution.[34] 
           The Exchange believes that the Distribution Fees for the BATS One Feed are reasonable and fair in light of alternatives offered by other market centers. First, although the Internal Distribution fee is higher than those of competitor products, there are no usage fees assessed for Users that receive the BATS One Feed data through Internal Distribution, which results in a net cost that is lower than competitor products for many data recipients and will be easier to administer. In addition, for External Distribution, the Distribution Fees are similar to or lower than similar products. For example, under the Nasdaq UTP and CTA and CQ Plans, consolidated last sale and bid-ask data are offered for a combined monthly fee of $3,000 for redistribution.[35] 
           The Exchange is proposing Distribution Fees that are less than the fees currently charged by the Nasdaq UTP and CTA and CQ Plans.
B. Self-Regulatory Organization's Statement on Burden on Competition
The Exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act, as amended. An exchange's ability to price its proprietary data feed products is constrained by actual competition for the sale of proprietary market data products, the joint product nature of exchange platforms, and the existence of alternatives to the Exchange's proprietary last sale data. Because other exchanges already offer similar products,[36] 
           the Exchange's proposed BATS One Feed will enhance competition. Specifically, the BATS One Feed was developed to compete with similar market data products offered by Nasdaq and NYSE Technologies, an affiliate of the NYSE.[37] 
           The BATS One Feed will foster competition by providing an alternative market data product to those offered by Nasdaq and the NYSE for less cost, as described in more detail in Section 3(b) above. This proposed new data feed provides investors with new options for receiving market data, which was a primary goal of the market data amendments adopted by Regulation NMS.[38] 

The proposed BATS One Feed would enhance competition by offering a market data product that is designed to compete directly with similar products offered by the NYSE and Nasdaq. Nasdaq Basic is a product that includes two feeds, QBBO, which provides BBO information for all U.S. exchange-listed securities on Nasdaq and NLS Plus, which provides last sale data as well as consolidated volume from the following Nasdaq OMX markets for U.S. exchange-listed securities: Nasdaq, FINRA/Nasdaq TRF,[39] 
           Nasdaq OMX BX, and Nasdaq OMX PSX.[40] 
           Likewise, NYSE BQT includes BBO and last sale information for the NYSE, NYSE Arca, and NYSE MKT.[41] 

           As a result, Nasdaq Basic and NYSE BQT comprise a significant view of the market on any given day and both include data from multiple trading venues. As the BATS Exchanges are consistently one of the top exchange operators by market share for U.S. equities trading, excluding opening and closing auction volume, the data included within the BATS One Feed Start Printed Page 44947will provide investors with an alternative to Nasdaq Basic and NYSE BQT and a new option for obtaining a broad market view, consistent with the primary goal of the market data amendments adopted by Regulation NMS.[42] 

The BATS One Feed will not only provide content that is competitive with the similar products offered by other exchanges, but will provide pricing that is competitive as well. As previously stated, the fees for the BATS One Feed are significantly lower than alternative exchange products. The BATS One Feed is 60% less expensive per professional user and more than 85% less expensive for an enterprise license for professional users (50% less for non-professional users) when compared to a similar competitor exchange product, offering firms a lower cost alternative for similar content.
As the Exchange considers the integration of the BATS One Feed into External Distributor products an important ingredient to the product's success, the Exchange has designed pricing that enables External Distributors to spend three months integrating BATS One Feed data into their products and to enlist new Users to receive the BATS One Feed data for free with no External Distribution charges. In addition, the Exchange is providing External Distributors a credit against their monthly External Distribution Fee equal to the amount of its monthly Usage Fees up to the amount of the External Distribution Fee, which could result in the External Distributor paying a discounted or no External Distribution Fee once the free three months period has ended. With the fee incentives in place, External Distributors may freely choose to include the BATS One Feed data into their product thereby increasing competition with External Distributors offering similar products, replace alternative data provided by Nasdaq Basic or NYSE BQT with the BATS One Feed data or enhance their product to include BATS One Feed data along with data offered by competitors to create a distributor product that may be more valuable than the BATS One Feed or any competitor product alone. As with any product, the recipients of the data will determine the value of the data provided by the exchange directly or through an External Distributor. Potential subscribers may opt to disfavor the BATS One Feed based on the content provided or the pricing and may believe that alternatives offer them better value. Accordingly, the Exchange does not believe that the proposed BATS One Feed will impair the ability of External Distributors or competing venues to maintain their competitive standing in the financial markets.
The Exchange believes the BATS One Feed will further enhance competition by providing External Distributors with a data feed that allows them to more quickly and efficiently integrate into their existing products. Today, Distributors subscribe to various market data products offered by single exchanges and resell that data, either separately or in the aggregate, to their subscribers as part of the their own market data offerings. Distributors may incur administrative costs when consolidating and augmenting the data to meet their subscriber's need. Consequently, many External Distributors will simply choose to not take the data because of the effort and cost required to aggregate data from separate feeds into their existing products. Those same Distributors have expressed interest in the BATS One Feed so that they may easily incorporate aggregated or summarized BATS Exchange data into their own products without themselves incurring the costs of the repackaging and aggregating the data it would receive by subscribing to each market data product offered by the individual BATS Exchanges. The Exchange, therefore, believes that by providing market data that encompasses combined data from affiliated exchanges, the Exchange enables certain External Distributors with the ability to compete in the provision of similar content with other External Distributors, where they may not have done so previously if they were required to subscribe to the depth-of-book feeds from each individual BATS Exchange.
Although the Exchange considers the acceptance of the BATS One Feed by External Distributors as important to the success of the product, depending on their needs, External Distributors may choose not to subscribe to the BATS One Feed and may rather receive the BATS Exchange individual market data products and incorporate them into their specific market data products. For example, the BATS Premium Feed provides depth-of-book information for up to five price levels while each of the BATS Exchange's individual data feeds offer complete depth-of-book and are not limited to five price levels.[43] 
           Those subscribers who wish to view the complete depth-of-book from each individual BATS Exchange may prefer to subscribe to one or all of individual BATS Exchange depth-of-book data feeds instead of the BATS One Feed. The BATS One Feed simply provides another option for Distributors to choose from when selecting a product that meets their market data needs. Subscribers who seek a broader market view but do not need complete depth-of-book may select the BATS One Feed while subscribers that seek the complete depth-of-book information may subscribe to the depth-of-book feeds of each individual BATS Exchanges.

Latency. The BATS One Feed is not intended to compete with similar products offered by External Distributors. Rather, it is intended to assist External Distributors in incorporating aggregated and summarized data from the BATS Exchanges into their own market data products that are provided to the end user. Therefore, Distributors will receive the data, who will, in turn, make available BATS One Feed to their end users, either separately or as incorporated into the various market data products they provide. As stated above, Distributors have expressed a desire for a product like the BATS One Feed so that they may easily incorporate aggregated or summarized BATS Exchange data into their own products without themselves incurring the administrative costs of repackaging and aggregating the data it would receive by subscribing to each market data product offered by the individual BATS Exchanges.
Notwithstanding the above, the Exchange believes that External Distributors may create a product similar to BATS One Feed based on the market data products offered by the individual BATS Exchanges with minimal latency difference. In order to create the BATS One Feed, the Exchange will receive the individual data feeds from each BATS Exchange and, in turn, aggregate and summarize that data to create the BATS One Feed. This is the same process an External Distributor would undergo should it create a market data product similar to the BATS One Feed to distribute to its end users. In addition, the servers of most External Distributors are likely located in the same facilities as the Exchange, and, therefore, should receive the individual data feed from each BATS Exchange on or about the same time the Exchange would for it to create the BATS One Feed. Therefore, the Exchange believes that it will not incur any potential latency advantage that Start Printed Page 44948will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Act.

The Existence of Actual Competition. The market for proprietary data products is currently competitive and inherently contestable because there is fierce competition for the inputs necessary to the creation of proprietary data and strict pricing discipline for the proprietary products themselves. Numerous exchanges compete with each other for listings and order flow and sales of market data itself, providing virtually limitless opportunities for entrepreneurs who wish to compete in any or all of those areas, including by producing and distributing their own market data. Proprietary data products are produced and distributed by each individual exchange, as well as other entities, in a vigorously competitive market.
Competitive markets for listings, order flow, executions, and transaction reports provide pricing discipline for the inputs of proprietary data products and therefore constrain markets from overpricing proprietary market data. The U.S. Department of Justice also has acknowledged the aggressive competition among exchanges, including for the sale of proprietary market data itself. In announcing that the bid for NYSE Euronext by Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. and Intercontinental Exchange Inc. had been abandoned, Assistant Attorney General Christine Varney stated that exchanges “compete head to head to offer real-time equity data products. These data products include the best bid and offer of every exchange and information on each equity trade, including the last sale.” [44] 

It is common for broker-dealers to further exploit this recognized competitive constraint by sending their order flow and transaction reports to multiple markets, rather than providing them all to a single market. As a 2010 Commission Concept Release noted, the “current market structure can be described as dispersed and complex” with “trading volume . . . dispersed among many highly automated trading centers that compete for order flow in the same stocks” and “trading centers offer[ing] a wide range of services that are designed to attract different types of market participants with varying trading needs.” [45] 

In addition, in the case of products that are distributed through market data vendors, the vendors themselves provide additional price discipline for proprietary data products because they control the primary means of access to certain end users. These vendors impose price discipline based upon their business models. For example, vendors that assess a surcharge on data they sell are able to refuse to offer proprietary products that their end users do not or will not purchase in sufficient numbers. Internet portals, such as Google, impose price discipline by providing only data that they believe will enable them to attract “eyeballs” that contribute to their advertising revenue. Similarly, vendors will not elect to make available the products described herein unless their customers request them, and customers will not elect to purchase them unless they can be used for profit-generating purposes. All of these operate as constraints on pricing proprietary data products.

Joint Product Nature of Exchange Platform. Transaction execution and proprietary data products are complementary in that market data is both an input and a byproduct of the execution service. In fact, market data and trade executions are a paradigmatic example of joint products with joint costs. The decision whether and on which platform to post an order will depend on the attributes of the platforms where the order can be posted, including the execution fees, data quality, and price and distribution of their data products. The more trade executions a platform does, the more valuable its market data products become.
The costs of producing market data include not only the costs of the data distribution infrastructure, but also the costs of designing, maintaining, and operating the exchange's transaction execution platform and the cost of regulating the exchange to ensure its fair operation and maintain investor confidence. The total return that a trading platform earns reflects the revenues it receives from both products and the joint costs it incurs. Moreover, an exchange's broker-dealer customers view the costs of transaction executions and market data as a unified cost of doing business with the exchange.
Other market participants have noted that the liquidity provided by the order book, trade execution, core market data, and non-core market data are joint products of a joint platform and have common costs.[46] 
           The Exchange agrees with and adopts those discussions and the arguments therein. The Exchange also notes that the economics literature confirms that there is no way to allocate common costs between joint products that would shed any light on competitive or efficient pricing.[47] 

Analyzing the cost of market data product production and distribution in isolation from the cost of all of the inputs supporting the creation of market data and market data products will inevitably underestimate the cost of the data and data products. Thus, because it is impossible to obtain the data inputs to create market data products without a fast, technologically robust, and well-regulated execution system, system costs and regulatory costs affect the price of both obtaining the market data Start Printed Page 44949itself and creating and distributing market data products. It would be equally misleading, however, to attribute all of an exchange's costs to the market data portion of an exchange's joint products. Rather, all of an exchange's costs are incurred for the unified purposes of attracting order flow, executing and/or routing orders, and generating and selling data about market activity. The total return that an exchange earns reflects the revenues it receives from the joint products and the total costs of the joint products.
The level of competition and contestability in the market is evident in the numerous alternative venues that compete for order flow, including eleven equities self-regulatory organization (“SRO”) markets, as well as internalizing broker-dealers (“BDs”) and various forms of alternative trading systems (“ATSs”), including dark pools and electronic communication networks (“ECNs”). Competition among trading platforms can be expected to constrain the aggregate return that each platform earns from the sale of its joint products, but different platforms may choose from a range of possible, and equally reasonable, pricing strategies as the means of recovering total costs. For example, some platforms may choose to pay rebates to attract orders, charge relatively low prices for market data products (or provide market data products free of charge), and charge relatively high prices for accessing posted liquidity. Other platforms may choose a strategy of paying lower rebates (or no rebates) to attract orders, setting relatively high prices for market data products, and setting relatively low prices for accessing posted liquidity. In this environment, there is no economic basis for regulating maximum prices for one of the joint products in an industry in which suppliers face competitive constraints with regard to the joint offering.

Existence of Alternatives. As stated above, broker-dealers currently have numerous alternative venues for their order flow, including eleven SRO markets, as well as internalizing BDs and various forms of ATSs, including dark pools and ECNs. Each SRO market competes to produce transaction reports via trade executions, and two FINRA-regulated Trade Reporting Facilities (“TRFs”) compete to attract internalized transaction reports. Competitive markets for order flow, executions, and transaction reports provide pricing discipline for the inputs of proprietary data products.
The large number of SROs, TRFs, BDs, and ATSs that currently produce proprietary data or are currently capable of producing it provides further pricing discipline for proprietary data products. Each SRO, TRF, ATS, and BD is currently permitted to produce proprietary data products, and many currently do so or have announced plans to do so, including NASDAQ, NYSE, NYSE Amex, and NYSEArca.
Any ATS or BD can combine with any other ATS, BD, or multiple ATSs or BDs to produce joint proprietary data products. Additionally, order routers and market data vendors can facilitate single or multiple broker-dealers' production of proprietary data products. The potential sources of proprietary products are virtually limitless. The fact that proprietary data from ATSs, BDs, and vendors can by-pass SROs is significant in two respects. First, non-SROs can compete directly with SROs for the production and sale of proprietary data products, as BATS and Arca did before registering as exchanges by publishing proprietary book data on the Internet. Second, because a single order or transaction report can appear in an SRO proprietary product, a non-SRO proprietary product, or both, the data available in proprietary products is exponentially greater than the actual number of orders and transaction reports that exist in the marketplace.
Retail broker-dealers, such as Schwab and Fidelity, offer their customers proprietary data only if it promotes trading and generates sufficient commission revenue. Although the business models may differ, these vendors' pricing discipline is the same: they can simply refuse to purchase any proprietary data product that fails to provide sufficient value. The Exchange and other producers of proprietary data products must understand and respond to these varying business models and pricing disciplines in order to market proprietary data products successfully.
In addition to the competition and price discipline described above, the market for proprietary data products is also highly contestable because market entry is rapid and inexpensive. The history of electronic trading is replete with examples of entrants that swiftly grew into some of the largest electronic trading platforms and proprietary data producers: Archipelago, Bloomberg Tradebook, Island, RediBook, Attain, and TracECN. A proliferation of dark pools and other ATSs operate profitably with fragmentary shares of consolidated market volume.
Regulation NMS, by deregulating the market for proprietary data, has increased the contestability of that market. While broker-dealers have previously published their proprietary data individually, Regulation NMS encourages market data vendors and broker-dealers to produce proprietary products cooperatively in a manner never before possible. Multiple market data vendors already have the capability to aggregate data and disseminate it on a profitable scale, including Bloomberg and Thomson-Reuters.
Competitive forces constrain the prices that platforms can charge for non-core market information. A trading platform cannot generate market information unless it receives trade orders. For this reason, a platform can be expected to use its market data product as a tool for attracting liquidity and trading to its exchange.
While, by definition, information that is proprietary to an exchange cannot be obtained elsewhere, this does not enable the owner of such information to exercise monopoly power over that information vis-à-vis firms with the need for such information. Even though market information from one platform may not be a perfect substitute for market information from one or more other platforms, the existence of alternative sources of information can be expected to constrain the prices platforms charge for market data.
Besides the fact that similar information can be obtained elsewhere, the feasibility of supra-competitive pricing is constrained by the traders' ability to shift their trades elsewhere, which lowers the activity on the exchange and thus, in the long run, reduces the quality of the information generated by the exchange.
Competition among platforms has driven the Exchange to improve its platform data offerings and to cater to customers' data needs by proposing the BATS One Feed. The vigor of competition for non-core data information is significant and the Exchange believes that this proposal clearly evidences such competition. The Exchange proposes the BATS One Feed and pricing model in order to keep pace with changes in the industry and evolving customer needs. It is entirely optional and is geared towards attracting new customers, as well as retaining existing customers.
The Exchange has witnessed competitors creating new products and innovative pricing in this space over the course of the past year. In all cases, firms make decisions on how much and what types of data to consume on the basis of the total cost of interacting with the Exchange or other exchanges. The explicit data fees are but one factor in a total platform analysis. Some competitors have lower transactions fees and higher data fees, and others are vice versa. The market for this non-core data Start Printed Page 44950information is highly competitive and continually evolves as products develop and change.
In establishing the proposed fees, the Exchange considered the competitiveness of the market for proprietary data and all of the implications of that competition. The Exchange believes that it has considered all relevant factors and has not considered irrelevant factors in order to establish fair, reasonable, and not unreasonably discriminatory fees and an equitable allocation of fees among all users. The existence of numerous alternatives to the Exchange's products, including proprietary data from other sources, ensures that the Exchange cannot set unreasonable fees, or fees that are unreasonably discriminatory, because vendors and subscribers can elect these alternatives or choose not to purchase a specific proprietary data product if its cost is not justified by the returns that any particular vendor or subscriber would achieve through the purchase.

Upon completion of the business combination, DE Holdings and BGMI each became intermediate holding companies, held under a single new holding company. The new holding company, formerly named “BATS Global Markets Holdings, Inc.,” changed its name to “BATS Global Markets, Inc.” and BGMI changed its name to “BATS Global Markets Holdings, Inc.”

     Requiring that every person or device to which they provide the data is counted by the Distributor receiving the BATS One Feed is similar to the NYSE Unit-of-Count Policy. The only difference is that the NYSE Unit-of-Count Policy requires the counting of users receiving a market data product through both internal and external distribution. Because the Exchange proposes to charge Usage Fees solely to recipient firms whose Users receive data from an external distributor and not through internal distribution, it only requires the counting of Users by Distributors that disseminate the BATS One Feed externally.

     See generally Mark Hirschey, FUNDAMENTALS OF MANAGERIAL ECONOMICS, at 600 (2009) (“It is important to note, however, that although it is possible to determine the separate marginal costs of goods produced invariable proportions, it is impossible to determine their individual average costs. This is because common costs are expenses necessary for manufacture of a joint product. Common costs of production—raw material and equipment costs, management expenses, and other overhead—cannot be allocated to each individual by-product on any economically sound basis . . . . Any allocation of common costs is wrong and arbitrary.”). This is not new economic theory. See, e.g., F. W. Taussig, “A Contribution to the Theory of Railway Rates,” Quarterly Journal of Economics V(4) 438, 465 (July 1891) (“Yet, surely, the division is purely arbitrary. These items of cost, in fact, are jointly incurred for both sorts of traffic; and I cannot share the hope entertained by the statistician of the Commission, Professor Henry C. Adams, that we shall ever reach a mode of apportionment that will lead to trustworthy results.”).

LOUISVILLE SLUGGER CUSTOM BATS - HELPFUL TIPS


The importance of double-checking your designs before you purchase
On the REVIEW & BUY screen, you will have a chance to review your design choices and make changes before you purchase. This is very important because a customized bat cannot be returned and your purchase is non-refundable. PLEASE MAKE SURE ALL INFORMATION IS CORRECT before you proceed to purchase.
Making changes before you purchase
If you want to make a correction or just change things up, you can do so before you purchase. While in the Review and Buy screen, just click any pencil icon and you'll be taken back to the customize and personalize screens to make your desired changes. Once you are satisfied, remember to review your changes carefully on the REVIEW AND BUY screen because a custom bat cannot be returned.
Our right to refuse personalizations that break our rules
	  				We reserve the right to refuse any requested personalizations that contain any of the following:
	  				
Inappropriate or vulgar words, even abbreviated vulgar words.
Names of Major League players OR Major League teams
NCAA licensed marks
Any other trademarked marks, words or phrases

All final decisions are at the sole discretion of Louisville Slugger. Customize responsibly!
Sharing your masterpiece
You're an artist. A visionary. Show your friends what you just created and reveal to them your true genius! You can share your bat on Facebook, Twitter or send it to all of your family and friends via email by clicking the appropriate icon on the REVIEW AND BUY screen. This is also a great way to send someone a "hint" for the holidays or your birthday, or just because you're awesome.
Add to Cart
You've double checked all of your customizations and personalizations and you're now ready to purchase! To begin, click the "Add to Cart" button from the Review and Buy screen.

Security
Protecting your order information is our first concern. Louisville Slugger protects your Custom Bat order information by using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology, with a digital certificate provided by Network Solutions.
