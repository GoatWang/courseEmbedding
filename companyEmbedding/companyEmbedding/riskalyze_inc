Riskalyze Inc. Key Developments

Riskalyze's Next-Generation Autopilot Platform
Jun 22 17
Riskalyze announced that the next generation Autopilot platform, including the Autopilot Partner Store and Risk Number® Models, is now live and available for advisors. The multi-custodial automated account platform allows advisors to build model portfolios, assign models to client accounts and automatically generate trades across multiple custodians to deliver both personalization and scalable automation. One-Click Fiduciary™ technology keeps accounts on track after that, surfacing the right decisions for advisors to make at just the right time. As a follow-up to the initial announcement of Autopilot in February, Riskalyze is also unveiling Autopilot's pricing model. Advisors interested in using Autopilot with the Risk Number Models exclusively can use the platform for free. This development puts the industry's most advanced account automation technology at the fingertips of advisors without any additional cost to their practice, or to their clients. The Risk Number Models are 21 low-cost, tax-efficient models that advisors can customize with over 150 ETFs. Advisors can also build their own portfolios from scratch or leverage research from the Autopilot Partner Store, using over 85,000 US stocks, ETFs and mutual funds. Pricing starts at 15 bps, and drops to 10 bps with a $5 million commitment. The Partner Store goes online now with partners like AlphaDroid, BlackRock, Cambria, CLS Investments, First Trust, LikeFolio, Longboard Asset Management, Morningstar Managed Portfolios, SEI Investments, and Swan Global Investments. Additional partners are expected to join in the coming months.

We align the world’s investments with each investor’s Risk Number®.
Despite all of our advances in technology, the world still invests  the vast majority of its financial assets using a combination of gut  instincts, hunches, emotionally-driven decisions and “what we learned in  college.”
As a result, when markets pull back, investors typically pull the  plug—locking in horrible losses, sitting out the recovery and waiting  until the market “feels safe” again to reinvest at the top, and repeat  the cycle.
Riskalyze is transforming the advisory industry by empowering  investment advisors to capture a quantitative measurement of client risk  tolerance, and use that data to win new clients, capture and meet  expectations and quantify suitability.
Our core technology is built on the academic framework that won the  Nobel Prize for Economics in 2002. Our customers used that technology to  build more than $2 billion in portfolios in 2012.

How is Riskalyze available?
Riskalyze provides its technology to licensed investment advisors in  the United States, who use it to capture risk tolerance and quantify  suitability for their clients.
We have yet to announce availability of any of our products in markets outside of the United States.

How do I learn more about Riskalyze?

If you're an investment advisor, there’s no time like now to turn risk into your best friend.

We align the world’s investments with each investor’s Risk Number®.
Despite all of our advances in technology, the world still invests  the vast majority of its financial assets using a combination of gut  instincts, hunches, emotionally-driven decisions and “what we learned in  college.”
As a result, when markets pull back, investors typically pull the  plug—locking in horrible losses, sitting out the recovery and waiting  until the market “feels safe” again to reinvest at the top, and repeat  the cycle.
Riskalyze is transforming the advisory industry by empowering  investment advisors to capture a quantitative measurement of client risk  tolerance, and use that data to win new clients, capture and meet  expectations and quantify suitability.
Our core technology is built on the academic framework that won the  Nobel Prize for Economics in 2002. Our customers used that technology to  build more than $2 billion in portfolios in 2012.

How is Riskalyze available?
Riskalyze provides its technology to licensed investment advisors in  the United States, who use it to capture risk tolerance and quantify  suitability for their clients.
We have yet to announce availability of any of our products in markets outside of the United States.

How do I learn more about Riskalyze?

If you're an investment advisor, there’s no time like now to turn risk into your best friend.

We are always looking for new talent to help us revolutionize the risk industry.

                Dennis McCoy | Sacramento Business Journal            








 



Riskalyze Inc. announced this week it raised $2.1 million in new capital to expand its business domestically and internationally.
The new money comes just a week after the company tripled its space and moved into new larger offices in Auburn.

Dennis McCoy | Sacramento Business Journal










 


The 2011 startup company developed a simple test for investors to find their own risk investment risk tolerance. The test produces a single number, which is the user's risk tolerance.




Riskalyze works with wealth advisers, retirement investment advisers, stock brokers, independent broker-dealers and others in the investment industry to tailor a client's investment strategy with that client's risk tolerance.
The company also has developed automated product called Compliance Cloud that allows investment advisers to quickly audit all of their accounts for potential regulatory risk so they can find problems before regulators do. Those problems could be issues such as long periods of inactivity, high-risk investments, high concentrations and inappropriately high-risk investments.
The company has been growing and is currently seeking five employees in Auburn. It also has openings for at least two employees in its office in Atlanta. The Auburn openings include sales, support, engineering and programming.
Earlier this month the company moved from 3,900 square feet at 900 High St. to 11,000 square feet at 373 Elm Ave. in the Elm Plaza office building.
With the new money Riskalyze will "have the resources we need to maintain the market-leading position that our invention of the risk number has given us among financial advisors across the country," said Aaron Klein, CEO and founder.




 


The investment came from a variety of people, some local and some not, said Klein, who was in 2014 one of the Sacramento Business Journal's 40 Under 40 business professionals in the region.

Mark Anderson covers agriculture, banking and finance, restaurants and hospitality for the Sacramento Business Journal.

Client Risk Numbers 
Eliminate the stereotypes that have made risk tolerance useless. Use leading scientific theory to objectively pinpoint an investor’s Risk Number®.


Portfolio Analysis 
Our powerful portfolio analytics engine calculates the Risk Number® of each portfolio to match it with investor risk preference. 


Retirement Maps 
Don’t wonder if a client’s risk preference will allow them to achieve their goals—calculate their probability and build a map to success. 


Stress Testing 
Stress test portfolios for a variety of stock and bond market scenarios—one click to revisit an interest rate jump or the 2008 market crash. 


Meetings 
Effortlessly launch a secure meeting with your client, whether they're across the room or across the world. 


Check-ins 
Build a strong foundation to support the advisor’s message between client reviews and give advisors an early warning signal when client psychology is deteriorating. 


Client Dashboard 
Give your clients a Risk Number-centric view into their wealth with our client dashboard. Let your clients update their Risk Number, check their balances and progress to goal, and if their accounts are on Autopilot, they can even update their goals and request changes to how they're invested. 


Retirement Plans 
Finally, it's easy for you to use the Risk Number® to match hundreds or thousands of 401K, 457, 403B or Simple IRA plan participants with just a few clicks. Build a relationship with participants by matching them to the right set of elections, and gain new clients for life.


Account Opening 
Doing paperwork isn't where advisors deliver value to their clients, but it's a chore that every advisor has to do. Speed it up and make it simpler with automated form filling for great custodians like TD Ameritrade and TCA (more custodian partners to come).


Asset Sync 
Seamlessly sync in outside assets from thousands of institutions so you can show prospects they're invested wrong, work your client's 401K into the equation, or keep a holistic view of a large client's distributed wealth. Just send a request to the investor's inbox or slide your keyboard across the desk — it's that simple.


Data Sharing 
Make it easy for all of the advisors and staff in your firm to share clients and portfolios, while maintaining the firm's ownership of its critical data and history of client engagement, even when advisors leave. 


Custom Security Permissions 
Riskalyze follows the best industry standard security practices and protects against unauthorized access to or unauthorized alteration, disclosure or destruction of data. 


Custom Contract 
Give us a call to see how enterprises can custom tailor the above technology to implement the Risk Alignment platform that fits best. 855-RISKALYZE.






Riskalyze Pro
Pinpoint your client’s Risk Number® and build a portfolio to match it.

BUILDING YOUR WEALTH MANAGEMENT STRATEGY USING RISKALYZE
Riskalyze is cutting edge technology that identifies your acceptable levels of risk and reward with unparalleled accuracy. Using this tool, we ensure that your portfolio aligns with your wealth management goals and expectations.
Together we can take the guesswork out of your financial future.
What is Riskalyze? 






Riskalyze-Client-Facing-Video-YT



With Riskalyze We Can:

Capture Your Risk Number
The first step is to answer a 5-minute questionnaire that covers topics such as portfolio size, top financial goals, and what you’re willing to risk for potential gains. Then we’ll pinpoint your exact Risk Number to guide our decision-making process.
Align Your Portfolio
After pinpointing your Risk Number, we’ll craft a portfolio that aligns with your personal preferences and priorities, allowing you to feel comfortable with your expected outcomes. The resulting proposed portfolio will include projections for the potential gains and losses we should expect over time.
Meet Your Retirement Goals
We will also review your progress toward your financial goals by building a Retirement Map.
When we are finished, you’ll fully understand what we can do to increase the probability of success.
