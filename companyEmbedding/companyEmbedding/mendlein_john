News for Medical Independent Sales Representatives and Medical Distributors: Dr. John Mendlein Joins aTyr Pharma as Executive Chairman

 News Release - May 25, 2010Dr. John Mendlein Joins aTyr Pharma as Executive Chairman

Serial Entrepreneur to Drive aTyr's Pipeline of High Impact Medicines from a New Class of Naturally Occurring Human Proteins (Resectins)SAN DIEGO, May 25 -- (Healthcare Sales & Marketing Network)  -- aTyr announced today that John Mendlein, Ph. D., has joined their Board of Directors as Executive Chairman. The translation of aTyr's newly found class of proteins, resectins, into medicines of the future will benefit from Dr. Mendlein's experience in biologics, partnerships, and product strategy. Resectins may serve as potential replacement protein therapeutics or as targets for antagonists relevant to inflammation, blood disorders, and metabolic disease. These naturally occurring human proteins possess novel biological activities distinct from currently known pharmaceutical targets and products.










"aTyr has recently uncovered novel proteins and pathways important to human physiology and disease. Dr. Mendlein's experience in translating game changing scientific discoveries into novel therapeutics will help us reach our goal � to build a successful, entrepreneurial enterprise from resectin based medicines offering breakthroughs in patient care" says Jeff Watkins, CEO of aTyr Pharma. Expanding on Dr. Mendlein's role, Watkins adds:  "John has an accomplished track record in biologics and building biotechs from a strong, novel scientific foundation. On multiple occasions he parlayed a company's science into meaningful partnerships and product opportunities while navigating the realities of running a biotech business."Professor Paul Schimmel of The Scripps Research Institute and co-founder of aTyr Pharma adds, "Dr. Mendlein is the kind of visionary leader who recognizes how new biologies can open doors to whole new classes of therapeutics and targets. His passion for delivering new medicines to patients and his experience in making this happen helps actualize the potential of the new biology being elucidated with aminoacyl tRNA synthetase resectins."Dr. Mendlein added, "The genomics efforts missed an important class of extracellular signaling proteins, resectins, which where hiding in the genes of aminoacyl tRNA synthetases, one of the most ancient and biochemically best understood enzyme families in biology. Thanks to aTyr and Dr. Schimmel a new fundamental biology related to intra- and inter-tissue extracellular communication in human physiology hereto unrecognized in medicine is rising up from these ancient, intracellular enzymes. Drug hunting doesn't get any more exciting than new therapeutic intervention points across multiple diseases."Currently Chairman of Fate Therapeutics and Alevium Pharmaceuticals, Dr. Mendlein has extensive experience shepherding small molecules and biologics from discovery to humans and in building strong, entrepreneurial teams. Previously he was CEO of Adnexus Therapeutics, the leader in the development of a new class of targeted biologics (acquired by Bristol Myers Squibb, BMY). He has served in a variety of senior executive and board roles at both Aurora Biosciences (acquired by Vertex, VRTX) and Affinium Pharmaceuticals; and was a scientist at Smith Kline and French. He has been co-inventor or author of more than 40 issued patents and publications. In various board and executive roles he has been involved with biotech transactions totally over $3.5B in deal value. He received his Ph. D. from the University of California, Los Angeles and his J.D. from the University of California, Hastings.  About aTyr PharmaaTyr Pharma engages in the generation of innovative therapeutics based on a new class of naturally occurring human proteins. These proteins, called resectins, modulate extracellular signaling pathways in a variety of biological processes. Resectins, previously overlooked by genomic efforts due to their hidden intra-protein location in ancient aminoacyl tRNA synthetase genes, have recently been discovered by aTyr, which is leading to connections in human physiology and pathophysiology ranging from inflammation to metabolic disease to peripheral neuropathy to blood disorders. Resectin biology, distinct from currently known pathways and pharmaceutical targets, may represent breakthrough opportunities for novel therapeutic interventions. Tmax, aTyr's first program, is a preclinical replacement protein candidate with a novel thrombopoietic activity for the treatment of thrombocytopenia. aTyr Pharma has established a dominant intellectual property estate surrounding resectin based compositions and therapeutic applications.The privately held biotech was founded by Dr. Paul Schimmel, a leading aminoacyl tRNA synthetase scientist and biotechnology entrepreneur who also founded Alkermes (ALKS), Cubist (CBST), and Alnylam (ALNY). aTyr Pharma is backed by leading life sciences investors Alta Partners, Cardinal Partners, and Polaris Ventures.

            John Mendlein, Biotech Exec With Surfer Look, Follows Winding Path as “Parallel Entrepreneur”

 in science. Mendlein enrolled at the University of Miami—“the Harvard of the Everglades,” he jokes—with a vague notion he’d study marine biology. That morphed into a general interest in chemistry and biology, then narrowed, like it does for many in biology, to specific questions about how ions are transported in the body.
This interest eventually led Mendlein to the lab of George Sachs at UCLA. As a graduate student, he did work trying to figure out the mechanism of action for a drug called omeprazole. “Naïve” about business in those days, Mendlein didn’t try to capitalize on the research. The product for heartburn, marketed by AstraZeneca as Prilosec, went on to become one of the best-selling drugs ever.
Mendlein finished his Ph.D. in biophysics at UCLA and went to work on conventional small-molecule pills at SmithKline & French (now known as GlaxoSmithKline) in the Philadelphia area. Wanderlust kicked in within two years, and he “went sailing for a while.”
Apparently while riding the waves, he figured out that what he really wanted was to go to law school. He enrolled at UC Berkeley.
That was a shrewd move, though he says he didn’t know it at the time. He was a scientist who also had a law degree, and he was located in Silicon Valley when biotech was taking off in the 1990s. He got a job with the Cooley law firm, doing patent work, licensing deals, and some corporate law. Amgen, which was booming in those days, was a major client. And the Valley was teeming with other Amgen and Genentech wannabes. Mendlein got to know them and the “absolute madness” of taking on the high-risk business of drug development. It made him restless once again.
Two people Mendlein knew from his past stints at SmithKline and UCLA ultimately lured him into biotech. He joined San Diego-based Aurora Biosciences, the company co-founded by UCSD chemist Roger Tsien in 1996, with the vague title of “chief knowledge officer.” He crafted financings and partnerships to advance the company’s science. He raves about the experience he got there. “If you were an able bodied person, people gave you a lot of freedom to get things done,” Mendlein says.
John Mendlein
Aurora was acquired by Cambridge, MA-based Vertex Pharmaceuticals for almost $600 million in 2001. It was time to do something new. Mendlein moved to Toronto for his first chance to be a CEO, at Affinium Pharmaceuticals, an antibiotic developer born in the genomics bubble. It didn’t live up to the lofty promise or investor valuations, and Mendlein resigned in 2005. Two of the VCs in the group that had backed Affinium—Jean-Francois Formela of Atlas and Noubar Afeyan of Flagship—then recruited him to be CEO of Adnexus Therapeutics.
Adnexus had a platform technology that it thought could someday rival monoclonal antibodies. Along with other members of the management team—Katrine Bosley, John Edwards and Eric Furfine—Mendlein developed a strategy that made sure Adnexus didn’t try to do too many things at once. Instead of licensing the technology widely, the company concentrated on drug candidates that could demonstrate the potential of the platform, and do so in a way that would be perceived as valuable outside the company.
Adnexus hit the jackpot with its sale to Bristol. Most of the time that means a guy like Mendlein gets rich and walks away for the next green pasture. Flagship’s Afeyan says he was impressed by what came next. Mendlein stayed at the company for six months, working on small details to make sure that each individual’s contribution to the success of Adnexus was personally recognized, and that he or she fit into the larger company’s culture.
“John did it in a way that took a lot of attention away from him and distributed it widely.” Afeyan says. “A lot of people spend time on culture because they think good will come from it, but to do so after you exit, and purely for the benefit of the people who are staying behind, is a whole other level of attention.”
Bosley, now CEO of Waltham, MA-based Avila Therapeutics, says Mendlein has   … Next Page »

John if you are tracking this, please get in touch with me @ 650.924.5004; an interesting issue in Redwood City involving sailors and land use, would love to talk to you. Great job on all your success, I am not surprised. Editor, BTW it was UC-Hastings not Berkeley. John, hope it’s OK that I make that correction ;-) Ali
