Or at least it is the best book for someone like me - former dinghy sailor and new-ish bluewater skipper. The book is packed with information and a fantastic reference on seamanship. Delivery from Overstock was faster than expected - a couple of days! - and the price was better compared to any other bookseller I checked. I am very happy with this purchase. Knife Throwing: A Practical Guide Wonderful Book, Practical steps to learn about how to throw a knife. The different types of knives to use and a nice history of knife throwing.Great ReadThis is a great book for someone who is new to the sport, a veteran of the sport or someone who just wants a good read. Very entertaining and even has some photos. I read this book in two days, it was that fun to read. Melicious (the author's derby name) does a great job of giving information about the sport and at the same time sharing funny stories about her journey into derby.Good readThis is a great accounting of the woman who walked the Appalachian Trail.  Her life story will keep you interested through the entire book.  Grandma Gatewood is definitely an amazing woman.Great Book; Great PriceI highly recommend this book to sports fans, and non-sports fans alike. What a great inspirational story, from a well-respected sports legend. You can't beat the price, the shipping, the service. Go for it!Timeless wisdomI purchased this book for the breadth and depth of living outside.  It measures up quite nicely.  While much has changed technologically,  attention to details and a fun read are found within.  Reminding all that the book was published in 1913.  excellent referenceLove this book, able to get in and out of places easily, and know where to go. sport addicted boyfriendI bought this book as a supplementary gift for my sports addicted boyfriend.  It is a big solid book, filled with what seems to be great information, photos and a dvd.  What I didn't realize was that his most hated team is on the cover....how was I supposed to know that mattered?  I'm not sure to this day if he has even cracked it open! But still, it's a good gift book.Sponsored LinksWhat's This?GeneralBaseballFootballBasketballMartial ArtsSoccerBrandsPrecision SeriesSimon Labels, Ltd.KaisercraftHumminbirdSeries NameAmazing AthletesWhere to HikeNFL Up Close100 Things...

What is your life worth?excellent referenceLove this book, able to get in and out of places easily, and know where to go. GHjxjdu quip all hmm pita :-\ boxy bed osu b-day could upPaperbackGave to friend who said that he really enjoyed the readKnife Throwing: A Practical Guide Wonderful Book, Practical steps to learn about how to throw a knife. The different types of knives to use and a nice history of knife throwing.Timeless wisdomI purchased this book for the breadth and depth of living outside.  It measures up quite nicely.  While much has changed technologically,  attention to details and a fun read are found within.  Reminding all that the book was published in 1913.  If you love pool.....then you should have this book; great instructional manual.MehHoped for a better story, but book was okay, if one is not really familiar with outback living.Great book, fast deliveryThis is the best book for sailors! Or at least it is the best book for someone like me - former dinghy sailor and new-ish bluewater skipper. The book is packed with information and a fantastic reference on seamanship. Delivery from Overstock was faster than expected - a couple of days! - and the price was better compared to any other bookseller I checked. I am very happy with this purchase.

Artist's Description

We lived in northeastern Oregon for several years, and we did a lot of our shopping in Boise, Idaho. We were on our way to Boise one day, and my wife (Lynne Wright on FAA) needed to stop in Ontario Oregon to get some stuff from an art supply store. While she was doing her thing, I saw this across the street and couldn't resist. We had no idea what it had been, but when we showed this to one of her uncles, he said he knew exactly where it was and what it had been. It seems that he had been in Ontario some time in WWII, and stayed here, at the Moore Hotel. How in the world he recognized this from   50 years before, and in this kind of condition has always been a question for us. 



About Lynne and Don Wright



Lynne and Don Wright

Hi Everybody...

We are Lynne and Don Wright, and we live in the bustling city of Luray Kansas, population under 200. Big city we are not!

Lynne is a painter in oils and watercolors, and having been born and raised on the west coast of the USA, she loves painting seascapes, as well as the local scenery around home, which is also beautiful, but in another way.

Don is a photographer, and is more than willing to photograph anything in front of  him. That being said, his true love is capturing things old. Barns, sheds, houses, machinery, etc. If he wants a portrait of an old  person, he turns the camera on himself.

Thanks for stopping by and checking out our work. It is very much appreciated.

God bless,

Lynne and Don

I’m committed to helping you get the appropriate level of protection and make it easy to do business with Allstate.AwardsHonor Ring-20 yearsRequest An Appointment with Don WrightWant to request an appointment for a call or visit?

But there are some standard coverages included in most homeowners policies, such as protection for your dwelling and personal property for certain natural disasters and personal liabilities. It's important to know exactly what is and isn't covered by your policy and to understand your coverage limits. If you'd like to talk through your current policy or get coverage tailored to life in TX, I'd be happy to help.Learn More What Does Auto Liability Insurance Cover?You know you need liability car insurance, but what is it exactly? Liability insurance may help cover damages to another person resulting from an accident you cause, such as damage to their property or costs associated with their resulting injuries if you are found at fault. While liability is a basic type of auto insurance coverage, you'll still have some decisions to make, including setting property damage and bodily injury coverage limits. I'm here to help you choose the coverage that fits your needs while also meeting TX's minimum requirements.Learn More What Is Renters Insurance?Renting a home can be great, particularly if you don't have to worry about regular maintenance and upkeep. But you, and your stuff, are still at risk — from things such as a fire, theft or a guest getting injured. Having renters insurance in place can help protect you and your belongings. Whether it's helping you replace stolen items, paying for damage that you caused to a neighbor's window or paying for a hotel if you can't live in your home because of a covered loss, renters insurance may help when the unexpected happens.Learn More What Is A Beneficiary?I know that choosing to buy life insurance can be an emotional decision. No one wants to think about leaving their loved ones behind. And selecting beneficiaries, who will receive the benefits from the policy, can be a very hard choice - especially if you have multiple people or groups you'd like to provide for. Your life insurance beneficiary may be your spouse, your children of even your alma mater. Start here for some helpful information on selecting or changing your beneficiary.Learn More Is Your Office Rental Covered?Renting an office for your business makes sense - you have the space you need without the costs or maintenance of owning the building. But relying on the landlord's insurance to cover your business if a fire or break-in should occur is not a savvy decision. The landlord's policy typically covers the building but not your company's equipment or the business if there is an accident in the office. Whether it's making sure your computers would be replaced or recouping potential losses after a disaster, let's talk about insuring your business before you sign that lease.Learn More Safety Vs. StyleThe choice between stylish riding gear and truly protective gear should be easy - whatever makes it more likely you'll walk away from an accident safely. Thankfully there is a lot of gear that is both safe and stylish these days. And while I certainly hope you're never in an accident, choosing your protective wear wisely can make a big different if you are. From helmet guidelines to leather jackets to armor, here are some helpful tips on choosing the right gear for your ride.Learn More Insuring Your SnowmobileIf the thought of winter has you pulling out your snow pants and planning weekend adventures, you're probably anxious to get out there on your snowmobile. To you, winter doesn't mean shoveling snow and slippery commutes — it's the excitement of snowy trails and enjoying the beautiful views of the season. Before you get your snowmobile ready to ride and pull your gear out of the back closet for the season, here are a few things to consider about insuring your snowmobile.Learn More Fire Damage To Your CondoLiving in a condominium has its perks, especially if the condo board manages upkeep of the building. But you're still at risk when things go wrong in common areas or neighboring units, especially when it comes to a fire. The damage can be hard enough to deal with, but you could also be left wondering whose insurance will cover the costs of repairs and replacing your belongings. While you hopefully never experience a fire in or near your condo, it is important to be familiar with not only your condo insurance's fire coverage but also with the association's coverage.Learn More Show moreShow lessInsurance Products & ServicesInsurance is unlike any other product out there - you pay for it and hope you never have to use it. And that makes paying more than you need to that much more uncomfortable.With a policy from Allstate, you can help keep your insurance costs low with the wide variety of discounts we offer. Keep in mind, not all discounts are available in every state. The best way to get all that you qualify for is to get an insurance quote specific to Houston.You can get a rough "ballpark" insurance quote from many companies online, but talking with an agent allows you to ask questions and get a quote for coverage that matters most to you. As an Allstate agent, I can prepare a quote that details the coverage, deductibles (your portion of a loss) and cost (premium) of your insurance policy.Insurance products and services offered at my Allstate agency include:Auto InsuranceCar InsuranceFlood InsuranceInsuranceLife InsuranceMotorcycle InsuranceHome InsuranceInsurance QuoteInsurance AgencyBusiness InsuranceContactPhone(713) 465-3200(713) 465-3200Fax(713) 465-5477(713) 465-5477Email:donwright@allstate.comdonwright@allstate.comAddress:1500 Brittmoore RdSte 301Houston, TX 77043Get DirectionsAreas Served:Proud to serve the areas of Houston TX, Jersey Village TX, Spring Valley TX.
