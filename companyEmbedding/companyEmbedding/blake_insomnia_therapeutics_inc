Forward-Looking Statements
Certain statements, other than purely historical information, including
estimates, projections, statements relating to our business plans, objectives,
and expected operating results, and the assumptions upon which those statements
are based, are "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of the Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of
1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These
forward-looking statements generally are identified by the words "believes,"
"project," "expects," "anticipates," "estimates," "intends," "strategy," "plan,"
"may," "will," "would," "will be," "will continue," "will likely result," and
similar expressions. We intend such forward-looking statements to be covered by
the safe-harbor provisions for forward-looking statements contained in the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, and are including this
statement for purposes of complying with those safe-harbor provisions.
Forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and assumptions
that are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to
differ materially from the forward-looking statements. Our ability to predict
results or the actual effect of future plans or strategies is inherently
uncertain. Factors which could have a material adverse effect on our operations
and future prospects on a consolidated basis include, but are not limited to:
changes in economic conditions, legislative/regulatory changes, availability of
capital, interest rates, competition, and generally accepted accounting
principles. These risks and uncertainties should also be considered in
evaluating forward-looking statements and undue reliance should not be placed on
such statements. We undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise. Further information concerning our business, including
additional factors that could materially affect our financial results, is
included herein and in our other filings with the SEC.
Company Overview
We are a New York-based pharmaceutical company devoted to improving nighttime
and daytime quality of life for people with insomnia. We have developed Zleepax,
which is the first sleep aid with beta blockers as the major active agent.
First generation beta blockers inhibited natural melatonin secretion and had a
negative impact on sleep. Recent publications have shown that certain
third-generation beta blockers actually improve quality of sleep for patients
with mild hypertension. These third-generation beta blockers has been widely
used to treat hypertension since the early 1990s, is well tolerated in chronic
use, has an attractive side-effect profile, and should thus perform excellently
applied as a sleep enhancer. Our patent application cover the use of beta
blockers-alone or in combination with other anti-insomnia drugs-for the
treatment of stress-related insomnia.
During the current reporting period, we have assembled a team to conduct
clinical trials of our Zleepax formula. We have entered into a joint venture
with Sajo Consulting LLC for development and commercialization efforts
associated with our drug. Canadian clinical trials are planned for Q3 2017
pending approval of a New Drug Submission by the Health Products and Food Branch
of Health Canada.
We estimate that we will need $700,000 in financing to conduct our first
clinical trial and $300,000 in operating costs. We estimate that we will need
$2,500,000 in financing to conduct our clinical trial phase 2. The process is
expected take one year to complete. We do not anticipate generating any revenues
until our Zleepax formula is approved by relevant Regulatory authority (such as
FDA for USA) and we have successfully brought the drug to market. If we are
unable to generate financing to cover our clinical trials, overhead and costs to
commercialize our products, we may not continue as a going concern
Our fiscal year end is August 31. Our principal offices are located at 244, 5th
Avenue, Suite A-154 New York, N.Y. 10001. Our phone number is +1 (646) 453-4912.
Results of Operation for Three and Nine Months Ended May 31, 2017 and 2016
Revenues
We generated no revenue for the three and nine months ended May 31, 2017 and
2016. We do not anticipate earnings revenues until we are able to obtain
government approval on and sell our drug products.

Operating Expenses



Operating expenses increased to $41,506 for the three months ended May 31, 2017
from $4,775 for the three months ended May 31, 2016. Our operating expenses for
the three months ended May 31, 2017 consisted of administrative expenses of
$38,930 and patent costs of $2,576. Our operating expenses for the three months
ended May 31, 2015 consisted of administrative expenses of $4,775.
Operating expenses increased to $84,726 for the nine months ended May 31, 2017
from $24,796 for the nine months ended May 31, 2016. Our operating expenses for
the nine months ended May 31, 2017 consisted of administrative expenses of
$82,150 and patent costs of $2,576. Our operating expenses for the nine months
ended May 31, 2016 consisted of administrative expenses of $24,796.
Our administrative expenses for the nine months ended May 31, 2017 consisted
mainly of filing and registration fees of $41,581, legal fees of $20,699,
accounting fees of $13,000, consulting fees of $4,400 and officer and
miscellaneous fees of $2,313.
We expect that our operating expenses will likely increase in future quarters as
clinical trials commence and we engage in other operations to bring our drug
products to market.



Interest Expenses



We had interest expenses of $3,173 for the three months ended May 31, 2017,
compared with interest expenses of $1,313 for the three months ended May 31,
2016. We had interest expenses of $8,427 for the nine months ended May 31, 2017,
compared with interest expenses of $3,521 for the nine months ended May 31,
2016.




Net Loss




Net loss for the three months ended May 31, 2017 was $44,679 compared to net
loss of $6,088 for the three months ended May 31, 2016. Net loss for the nine
months ended May 31, 2017 was $93,153 compared to net loss of $28,317 for the
nine months ended May 31, 2016.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
As of May 31, 2017, we had current assets of $28,000 consisting of cash. Our
total current liabilities as of May 31, 2017 were $203,094. We therefore had
negative working capital of $175,094 as of May 31, 2017.
Operating activities used $47,983 in cash for the nine months ended May 31,
2017, as compared with cash used of $23,297 for the same period ended 2016. Our
negative operating cash flow for the nine month ended May 31, 2017 was mainly
the result our net loss for the period, offset mainly by an increase in related
party accounts payable and an increase in accrued interest. Our negative
operating cash flow for the nine months ended May 31, 2016 was the result of our
net loss for the period, offset by an increase in accrued interest and accounts
payable.
Financing activities provided $72,000 for the nine months ended May 31, 2017, as
compared with cash provided of $15,000 for the same period ended 2016. Our
positive financing cash flow for the nine months ended May 31, 2017 was mainly
the result of proceeds from notes payable. Our positive financing cash flow for
the nine months ended May 31, 2016 was the result of proceeds from notes
payable.
On September 19, 2016, we issued a promissory note payable in the amount of
$42,000. The note is due on demand and bears interest at 10% per annum.
On March 17, 2017, we issued a promissory note payable in the amount of $10,000.
The note is due on demand and bears interest at 10% per annum.
On April 19, 2017, we issued a promissory note payable in the amount of $20,000.
The note is due on demand and bears interest at 10% per annum.
Based upon our current financial condition, we do not have sufficient cash to
operate our business at the current level for the next twelve months. We intend
to fund operations through increased sales and debt and/or equity financing
arrangements, which may be insufficient to fund expenditures or other cash
requirements. We plan to seek additional financing in a private equity offering
to secure funding for operations. There can be no assurance that we will be
successful in raising additional funding. If we are not able to secure
additional funding, the implementation of our business plan will be impaired.
There can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available to us
on acceptable terms or at all.

Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of May 31, 2017, there were no off balance sheet arrangements.



Critical Accounting Policies



In December 2001, the SEC requested that all registrants list their most
"critical accounting polices" in the Management Discussion and Analysis. The SEC
indicated that a "critical accounting policy" is one which is both important to
the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results, and requires
management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result
of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently
uncertain.
Our accounting policies are discussed in detail in the footnotes to our
financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year
ended August 31, 2016. We do not consider any of our accounting policies as
critical.




Going Concern




As of May 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $395,229. Our ability to
continue as a going concern is contingent upon the successful completion of
additional financing arrangements and our ability to achieve and maintain
profitable operations. While we are expanding our best efforts to achieve the
above plans, there is no assurance that any such activity will generate funds
that will be available for operations. These conditions raise substantial doubt
about our ability to continue as a going concern.
Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements
We do not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting pronouncements to
have a significant impact on our results of operation, financial position or
cash flow.© Edgar Online, source Glimpses

 NEW YORK, Jan. 17, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Blake Insomnia Therapeutics Inc. (OTC:BKIT) is preparing to launch a fundraising drive to complete Phase II clinical testing of its patent-pending ZLX-1 compound for treating stress-related insomnia. The company has compiled a shortlist of appropriate investors to approach for funding.  Since the ZLX-1 patent application covers multiple active ingredient combinations, Phase II clinical testing will determine which combination and dosage will deliver the most potent effect. Completing Phase II clinical testing will require approximately $5 million. After successful completion of Phase II, the company will seek an additional $10 million for Phase Phase III testing, the final step required to receive FDA approval. Phase III trials involve widespread testing of the compound for potential side effects. Blake Insomnia Therapeutics CEO Birger Jan Olsen says: "We are proceeding according to plan and we are now ready to meet with potential financial partners to fund Phase II clinical testing. We remain optimistic that we will be able to complete the clinical phase quickly, so we can bring this promising therapy to market."  Blake Insomnia Therapeutics Inc.is a New York-based pharmaceutical company devoted to improving night-time and daytime quality of life for people with insomnia. The company's patent-pending ZLX-1 compound has demonstrated efficacy without producing side effects identified as the No. 1 problem with current sleep medication. The ZLX-1 compound is marketed under the brand name, Zleepax™. Please visit www.blakeinsomnia.com to learn more about the company, management and the ZLX-1 compound.

Blake Insomnia Therapeutics Enters Joint Development with Sajo Consulting LLC
Published on February 13, 2017









Blake Insomnia Therapeutics Inc and Sajo Consulting LLC have entered into a Letter of Intent to provide joint development and commercialization of Zleepax, in combination with formulations to produce a series of oral drug products to aid in the treatment of insomnia. This venture looks to develop a product to treat transient insomnia through the mechanism of Blake’s proprietary formula.
Zleepax is for treatment of insomnia and will be the first new drug investment made by Blake. The pivotal Phase II clinical trial is planned for the second quarter of 2017 and pending the regulatory submission of the New Drug Application in Canada. With a successful filing and NDA approval, the product is expected to be launched in the United States in 2022 with international filings to follow.
This collaboration with Sajo signifies Blake’s strategic move into the new drug development field with focus on applying improvements to non-benzodiazepine drugs in the treatment of insomnia. The joint development will capitalize on the reputation Sajo Consulting has developed as a consultant in the medical and pharmaceutical industries. Blake and Sajo will jointly develop strong molecular pipelines for pairing with Zleepax in its product bases. Blake will be the exclusive provider of Zleepax and will further work with Sajo to develop additional new Zleepax products to capitalize on the insomnia markets.
Blake CEO Birger Jan Olsen says in a release: “We are excited about the agreement with Sajo as they have the required expertise and knowledge to carry out Phase 2 clinical trial and we are looking forward working together”.
Blake is a New York-based pharmaceutical company devoted to improving nighttime and daytime quality of life for people with insomnia. The patent-pending ZLX-1 compound is marketed under the brand name, Zleepax.

	NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	(A Development Stage Company)




	February 28, 2017




	 








	1. NATURE OF OPERATIONS






	 


	Blake Insomnia Therapeutics is a Nevada company that is currently developing and testing its patent-pending compound, Zleepax (ZLX-1). Zleepax is a sleep medication currently in testing phase. The Company is making plans to commence clinical trials and studies for eventual FDA approval and is not generating revenues.


	 








	2. GOING CONCERN CONSIDERATION






	 


	These financial statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern, which contemplates, among other things, the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company has incurred a cumulative net loss of $349,331 since its inception and requires capital for its contemplated operation and marketing activities to take place. The Company's ability to raise additional capital through the future issuances of common stock is unknown. The obtainment of additional financing, the successful development of the Company's contemplated plan of operations, and its transition, ultimately, to the attainment of profitable operations are necessary for the Company to continue operations. The ability to successfully resolve these factors raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.


	 


	The Company has active negotiation ongoing between the lenders and its major shareholders that likely will result in providing sufficient quantize and cash to secure going concern for the Company.


	 


	Future issuances of the Company's equity or debt securities will be required in order for the Company to continue to finance its operations and continue as a going concern. The Company's present revenues are insufficient to meet operating expenses. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of these aforementioned uncertainties.


	 








	3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES






	 



	Basis of Presentation



	 


	The financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America and are presented in US dollars. The Company’s year-end is August 31.


	 



	Cash and Cash Equivalents



	 


	The Company considers all highly liquid investments with original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.


	 



	Use of Estimates and Assumptions



	 


	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.


	 






	 




	F-4







	 






	Table of Contents






	  



	Revenue Recognition



	 


	The Company applies paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned less estimated future doubtful accounts. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met:


	 







	 



	(i)


	persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,





	 



	(ii)


	the services have been rendered and all required milestones achieved,





	 



	(iii)


	the sales price is fixed or determinable, and





	 



	(iv)


	collectability is reasonably assured.




	 



	Foreign Currency Translation



	 


	The financial statements are presented in United States dollars. In accordance with ASC 830, “Foreign Currency Matters”, foreign denominated monetary assets and liabilities are translated into their United States dollar equivalents using foreign exchange rates which prevailed at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at average rates of exchange during the year. Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in results of operations.


	 



	Stock-Based Compensation



	 


	The Company accounts for stock-based compensation using the fair value method following the guidance set forth in section 718-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosure about Stock-Based Compensation. This section requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant-date fair value of the award (with limited exceptions). That cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award- the requisite service period (usually the vesting period). No compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service.


	 



	Development Stage Company



	 


	The Company complies with Financial Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 915 and Securities and Exchange Commission Act Guide 7 for its characterization of the Company as development stage enterprise.


	 



	Fair Value for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities



	 


	The Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Paragraph 820-10-35-37”) to measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs. The three levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph 820-10-35-37 are described below:


	 







	Level 1




	Quoted market prices available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date.








	 






	Level 2




	Pricing inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level 1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date.








	 






	Level 3




	Pricing inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by market data.





	 


	The carrying amounts of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities, such as cash, approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments.


	 


	The Company does not have any assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring or a non-recurring basis, consequently, the Company did not have any fair value adjustments for assets and liabilities measured at fair value at February 28, 2017, nor gains or losses are reported in the statement of operations that are attributable to the change in unrealized gains or losses relating to those assets and liabilities still held at the reporting date for the period ended February 28, 2017.

	Income Taxes



	 


	The Company follows the accrual method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying values and their respective income tax basis (temporary differences). The effect on the deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. At February 28, 2017 a full deferred tax asset valuation allowance has been provided and no deferred tax asset has been recorded.


	 



	Basic and Diluted Net Income (Loss) per Share



	 


	The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, "Earnings per Share" which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period including stock options, using the treasury stock method, and convertible preferred stock, using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential common shares if their effect is anti-dilutive.


	 



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements

	 


	 


	In June 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-10, Development Stage Entities (Topic 915) Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements . ASU 2014-10 eliminates the distinction of a development stage entity and certain related disclosure requirements., including the elimination of inception-to-date information on the statements of operations, cash flows and shareholders’ equity. The amendments in ASU 2014-10 will be effective prospectively for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2014 and interim periods within those annual periods, however early adoption is permitted for financial statements not yet issued. The Company adopted ASU 2014-10 since the quarter ended February 28, 2017, thereby no longer presenting or disclosing any information required by Topic 915.


	 


	The Company has reviewed all recently issued, but not yet effective, and does not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on its financial condition or the results of its operations.


	 







	4. DEVELOPMENT STAGE COMPANY





	 


	The Company is in the development stage as of February 28, 2017 and to date has had no significant operations. Recovery of the Company’s assets is dependent on future events, the outcome of which is indeterminable. In addition, successful completion of the Company’s development program and its transition, ultimately, to attaining profitable operations is dependent upon obtaining adequate financing to fulfill its development activities and achieving a level of sales adequate to support the Company’s cost structure.

	ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS




	 



	The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report and those in our 10k for year ended August 31, 2016. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including but not limited to, those described under “Risk Factors” included in Part II, Item IA of this report.



	 




	Background Overview




	 


	The Company is currently developing its business plan for an insomnia medication known as Zleepax.


	 


	As of April 14, 2017, the authorized common stock of the Company consisted of 100,000,000 shares of Common Stock, of which 31,597,572 shares were outstanding. Each share of Common Stock is entitled to one vote with respect to all matters to be acted on by the stockholders.


	 




	Future Business




	 


	Since our inception on August 11, 2012 to February 28, 2017, we had not generated any revenues and we incurred a loss of $23,599 for the three months ended. These losses were mostly related to the costs associated with administrative expenses. To this point, our only business activity has been the formation of our corporate entity, creation and development of our business model, and analyzing the viability of our business. In the last three months, we have had very little activity. It is the intent of our officer and shareholders to change the Company’s business plan. We intend to sell additional shares in a private offering or other offering and are starting to increase our efforts in looking for additional capital to obtain FDA approval and review of our flagship product. The product requires both Phase II and Phase III clinical trials and will need an infusion of capital of at least $5 million if not more. If sufficient funds cannot be raised, none of the Company’s plans may be implemented. There can be no assurance that the actual expenses incurred will not materially exceed our estimates or that cash flows from listing fees will be adequate to maintain our business. As a result, our independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in the independent auditors’ report to the financial statements included in the most recent 10k of the Company.


	 




	Special Risk Factor




	 




	Investors should be aware that our key principal operates out of Denmark.




	 


	Although the Company maintains an address in New York City and is formed in the state of Nevada, the Company primarily operates out of Denmark. Our CEO is a citizen of Denmark and currently resides there.


	 




	Recent Developments




	 






	As discussed in the Company’s 8-k filed on April 16, 2017, the Company recently entered into a number of agreements with the intent of furthering the Company’s objectives of procuring FDA approval for the flagship product, Zleepax. In April, 2017, the Company entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with Sajo Consulting in order to provide joint development and commercialization of Zleepax® in combination with formulations to provide a series of oral drug products to aid in the treatment of insomnia. The Joint Venture looks first to develop a product to treat transient insomnia through the mechanism of its proprietary formula.


	 


	In this agreement, Sajo is entitled to appointment two members to the Board of Directors of the Company. In anticipation of this appointment, the Company has updated its bylaws and developed a Board of Directors “Code of Ethics.”

	Results of Operations for the Quarter ending February 28, 2017





	 



	Assets



	 


	Currently, we have $9,781 in cash which is our only asset.


	 



	Operating Expense



	 


	Total operating expenses for the three months ended February 28, 2017 were $20,861 compared to expenses of $11,628 for the three months ended February 29, 2016. Total operating expenses for the six months ended February 28, 2017 were $42,001 compare to the six months ended February 29, 2016 of $20,020.


	 



	Net Loss



	 


	Net loss for the three months ended February 28, 2017 was $(23,599) compared to the for the three months ended February 29, 2016 of $(11,628). Net loss for the six months ended February 28, 2017 was $(47,255) compared to the net loss of $(21,946) for six months ended February 29, 2017.




	 



	Liquidity and Capital Resources



	 


	At February 28, 2017, we had $9,781 in cash.


	 



	Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates



	 


	Our critical accounting policies are disclosed in our S-1 Registration Statement which was deemed effective in June 2013. During the three months ended February 28, 2017 there have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies.


	 



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	Recent accounting pronouncements are disclosed in our S-1 Registration Statement, deemed effective with the Securities and Exchange Commission on June 10, 2013. During the three months ended February 28, 2017 there have been no new accounting pronouncements which are expected to significantly impact our consolidated financial statements.


	 


	The Company has $9,781 in cash. Currently, the Company’s CEO is searching for financing. The Company is unsure if it will embark on a private offering, a public offering, or search for capital from other sources such as venture capital or qualified investors. The Company’s business plan requires extensive FDA approvals and trials. We do not have the capital to embark on such a venture at this time.


	 


	We currently only have $9,781. Therefore, the cash currently available to us will not enable us to develop the business to the state in which it will optimally be able to generate revenues. If we are to generate revenues prior to needing any additional funding, we will immediately reinvest such revenues into further development our business and deployment of our business plan. We believe that the cash we have available will sustain us for approximately three (3) more months so long as we continuing operating in the manner that we are currently operating.

	Since our incorporation, we have raised capital through private sales of our common equity. As of April 14, 2017 we have issued 31,597,572 shares of our common stock to various shareholders, in exchange for cash and services. Specifically, Morten Albrechtsen was issued shares in exchange for cash and Wexotc ApS (a company controlled by Morten Albrecthsen) was issued 1,500,000 for services as a non-executive advisor to the Company.

	ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES






	 



	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures



	 


	Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures Based upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures, our principal executive and financial officer has concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were not effective. The Company’s principal executive and financial officer has determined that there are material weaknesses in our disclosure controls and procedures. The material weaknesses in our disclosure control procedures are as follows:


	 







	 



	1.


	Lack of formal policies and procedures necessary to adequately review significant accounting transactions. The Company utilizes a third party independent contractor for the preparation of its financial statements. Although the financial statements and footnotes are reviewed by our management, we do not have a formal policy to review significant accounting transactions and the accounting treatment of such transactions. The third party independent contractor is not involved in the day to day operations of the Company and may not be provided information from management on a timely basis to allow for adequate reporting/consideration of certain transactions.





	 




	 




	 






	 



	2.


	Audit Committee and Financial Expert. The Company does not have a formal audit committee with a financial expert, and thus the Company lacks the board oversight role within the financial reporting process.




	  


	We intend to initiate measures to remediate the identified material weaknesses including, but not necessarily limited to, the following:


	 







	·



	Establishing a formal review process of significant accounting transactions that includes participation of the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer and the Company’s corporate legal counsel.




	 



	Changes in Internal Controls over Financial Reporting



	 


	We have not yet made any changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.

	Item 1.01 Entry into Material Definitive Agreement.



	 


	The Company recently entered into a number of agreements with the intent of furthering the Company’s objectives of procuring FDA approval for the flagship product, Zleepax. In April, 2017, the Company entered into a Joint Venture Agreement with Sajo Consulting (“Sajo”) in order to provide joint development and commercialization of Zleepax® in combination with formulations to provide a series of oral drug products to aid in the treatment of insomnia. The Joint Venture looks first to develop a product to treat transient insomnia through the mechanism of its proprietary formula. Blake Insomnia Therapeutics, Inc. intends to submit a FOIA Confidential Treatment Request to the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Rule 24b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requesting that it be permitted to redact Exhibit A of the Joint Venture Agreement. The omitted materials will be included in the request for confidential treatment.


	 


	In this agreement, Sajo is entitled to appointment two members to the Board of Directors of the Company. In anticipation of this appointment, the Company has updated its bylaws and developed a Board of Directors “Code of Ethics.” Each Director will receive 15,000 shares per months as long as the Director continues to fulfill his duties and provide the service set forth in the agreement. The shares issued as compensation shall be restricted for six (6) months after issuance. Blake will cooperate in the lifting of restrictions on the shares once eligible for resale under SEC Rule 144 or other applicable exemption.


	 


	In March 2017, the Company also entered into a Clinical Study and Data Purchase Agreement with Sajo Consulting. Sajo will conduct and sponsor certain clinical studies related to the Company’s proprietary product, Zleepax, and such clinical studies will generate data that Company intends on. The agreement is exclusive to the Company. Upon reaching certain milestones, the Company will make payments to Sajo for progress and approval from the start date of the trial (“Trial Date”) and completion. Payments are subject to funding of which there is no guarantee.




	 

	 








	Item 5.03 Amendment or Change to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws.



	 




	The Chairman of the Board of Directors, majority shareholder, and CEO, Birger Jan Olsen, elected to adopt more comprehensive bylaws for the Company in anticipation of the further development of the Company and additional members of the Board of Directors. These new bylaws, adopted on April 16, 2017, address issues such as board members, elections, meetings, voting rights, and proxy. The bylaws supersede and replace any earlier bylaws.





	 





	Item 5.05 Amendment or Change to Code of Ethics.



	 




	In anticipation of appointing new Board Members to the Board of Directors pursuant to its Joint Venture agreement with Sajo Consulting, the Company elected to adopt a Code of Ethics for its board members. The Code of Ethics addresses conflicts of interest, corporate opportunities, confidentially, as well as other matters. All new and existing board members will be expected to enter into an agreement which will include a clause that each board member will adhere to the Code of Ethics.

	ARTICLE I CORPORATE OFFICES




	 


	1.1 Offices


	 


	In addition to the corporation’s registered office set forth in the Certificate of Incorporation, the Board of Directors may at any time establish other offices at any place or places where the corporation is qualified to do business.


	 




	ARTICLE II MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS




	 


	2.1 Place Of Meetings


	 


	Meetings of stockholders shall be held at any place, within or outside the state of Nevada, designated by the Board of Directors. In the absence of any such designation, stockholders’ meetings shall be held at the registered office of the corporation.


	 


	2.2 Annual Meeting


	 


	The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held on such date, time and place, either within or without the state of Nevada, as may be designated by resolution of the Board of Directors each year. At the meeting, directors shall be elected and any other proper business may be transacted.


	 


	2.3 Special Meeting


	 


	A special meeting of the stockholders may be called at any time by the Board of Directors, the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer, the president or by one or more stockholders holding shares in the aggregate entitled to cast not less than 10% of the votes at that meeting.


	 


	If a special meeting is called by any person or persons other than the Board of Directors, the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer or the president, the request shall be in writing, specifying the time of such meeting and the general nature of the business proposed to be transacted, and shall be delivered personally or sent by registered mail or by email, fax, telegraphic or other facsimile or electronic transmission to the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer, the president or the secretary of the corporation. No business may be transacted at such special meeting otherwise than specified in such notice. The officer receiving the request shall cause notice to be promptly given to the stockholders entitled to vote, in accordance with the provisions of Sections 2.4 and 2.5 of this Article II, that a meeting will be held at the time requested by the person or persons calling the meeting, not less than 35 nor more than 60 days after the receipt of the request. If the notice is not given within 20 days after the receipt of the request, the person or persons requesting the meeting may give the notice. Nothing contained in this paragraph of this Section 2.3 shall be construed as limiting, fixing, or affecting the time when a meeting of stockholders called by action of the Board of Directors may be held.


	 




	 




	4







	 




	 




	 


	2.4 Notice Of Stockholders’ Meetings


	 


	All notices of meetings with stockholders shall be in writing and shall be sent or otherwise given in accordance with Section 2.5 of these bylaws not less than 10 calendar days nor more than 60 calendar days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote at such meeting. The notice shall specify the place (if any), date and hour of the meeting, and in the case of a special meeting, the purpose or purposes for which the meeting is called.


	 


	2.5 Manner Of Giving Notice; Affidavit Of Notice


	 


	Written notice of any meeting of stockholders, if mailed, is given when deposited in the United States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on the records of the corporation. If emailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when sent to the stockholder at his or her email address as it appears on the records. Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to stockholders, any notice to stockholders may be given by electronic mail or other electronic transmission, in the manner provided in Section 78.350 to 78.375 of the Nevada Revised Statutes. An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation that the notice has been given shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.


	 


	2.6 Quorum


	 


	The holders of a majority of the shares of stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote there at, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of the stockholders for the transaction of business except as otherwise provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation. If, however, such quorum is not present or represented at any meeting of the stockholders, then either (a) the chairman of the meeting or (b) holders of a majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote who are present, in person or by proxy, shall have power to adjourn the meeting to another place (if any), date or time.


	 


	2.7 Adjourned Meeting; Notice


	 


	When a meeting is adjourned to another place (if any), date or time, unless these bylaws otherwise require, notice need not be given of the adjourned meeting if the time and place (if any), thereof and the means of remote communications (if any) by which stockholders and proxyholders may be deemed to be present and vote at such adjourned meeting, are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the adjourned meeting the corporation may transact any business that might have been transacted at the original meeting. If the adjournment is for more than 30 days, or if after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting, notice of the place (if any), date and time of the adjourned meeting and the means of remote communications (if any) by which stockholders and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at the meeting.


	 




	 




	5







	 




	 




	 


	2.8 Organization; Conduct of Business


	 


	Such person as the Board of Directors may have designated or, in the absence of such a person, the chief executive officer, or in his or her absence, the president or, in his or her absence, such person as may be chosen by the holders of a majority of the shares entitled to vote who are present, in person or by proxy, shall call to order any meeting of the stockholders and act as chairman of the meeting. In the absence of the secretary of the corporation, the secretary of the meeting shall be such person as the chairman of the meeting appoints.


	 


	The chairman of any meeting of stockholders shall determine the order of business and the procedure at the meeting, including the manner of voting and the conduct of business. The date and time of opening and closing of the polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote at the meeting shall be announced at the meeting.


	 


	2.9 Voting


	 


	The stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.12 of these bylaws, subject to the provisions of Sections 78.350 and 78.352 of the Nevada Revised Statutes (relating to voting rights of fiduciaries, pledgors and joint owners of stock and to voting trusts and other voting agreements).


	 


	Except as may be otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, each stockholder shall be entitled to one vote for each share of capital stock held by such stockholder. All elections shall be determined by a plurality of the votes cast, and except as otherwise required by law, all other matters shall be determined by a majority of the votes cast affirmatively or negatively.


	 


	2.10 Waiver Of Notice


	 


	Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the Nevada Revised Statutes or of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, or waiver by electronic mail or other electronic transmission by such person, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the stockholders need be specified in any written waiver of notice, or any waiver of notice by electronic transmission, unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.


	 


	2.11 Stockholder Action By Written Consent Without A Meeting


	 


	Unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, any action required to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of the corporation, or any action that may be taken at any annual or special meeting of such stockholders, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice, and without a vote if a consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, is (a) signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted, and (b) delivered to the corporation in accordance with Section 78.355 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.


	 




	 




	6







	 




	 




	 


	Every written consent shall bear the date of signature of each stockholder who signs the consent and no written consent shall be effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within 60 days of the date the earliest dated consent is delivered to the corporation, a written consent or consents signed by a sufficient number of holders to take action are delivered to the corporation in the manner prescribed in this Section. A telegram, cablegram, electronic mail or other electronic transmission consenting to an action to be taken and transmitted by a stockholder or proxyholder, or by a person or persons authorized to act for a stockholder or proxyholder, shall be deemed to be written, signed and dated for purposes of this Section to the extent permitted by law. Any such consent shall be delivered in accordance with Section 78.355 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

If the action which is consented to is such as would have required the filing of a certificate under any section of the Nevada Revised Statutes if such action had been voted on by stockholders at a meeting thereof, then the certificate filed under such section shall state, in lieu of any statement required by such section concerning any vote of stockholders, that written notice and written consent have been given as provided in Section 78.310 – 375 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.

	In order that the corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, or entitled to express consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, or entitled to receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change, conversion or exchange of stock or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board of Directors may fix, in advance, a record date, which shall not be more than 60 nor less than 10 days before the date of such meeting, nor more than 60 days prior to any other action.


	 


	If the Board of Directors does not so fix a record date:


	 


	(a) The record date for determining stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.


	 


	(b) The record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the Board of Directors is necessary, shall be the day on which the first written consent (including consent by electronic mail or other electronic transmission as permitted by law) is delivered to the corporation.

	(c) The record date for determining stockholders for any other purpose shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board of Directors adopts the resolution relating thereto.


	 


	(d) A determination of stockholders of record entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to any adjournment of the meeting, if such adjournment is for 30 days or less; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the adjourned meeting.


	 


	2.13 Proxies


	 


	Each stockholder entitled to vote at a meeting of stockholders or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a meeting may authorize another person or persons to act for such stockholder by an instrument in writing or by an electronic transmission permitted by law filed with the secretary of the corporation, but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period. A proxy shall be deemed signed if the stockholder’s name is placed on the proxy (whether by manual signature, typewriting, facsimile, electronic or telegraphic transmission or otherwise) by the stockholder or the stockholder’s attorney-in-fact. The revocability of a proxy that states on its face that it is irrevocable shall be governed by the provisions of Section 78.355 of the Nevada Revised Statutes.


	 




	ARTICLE III DIRECTORS




	 


	3.1 Powers


	 


	Subject to the provisions of the Nevada Revised Statutes and any limitations in the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws relating to action required to be approved by the stockholders or by the outstanding shares, the business and affairs of the corporation shall be managed and all corporate powers shall be exercised by or under the direction of the Board of Directors.


	 


	3.2 Number Of Directors


	 


	Upon the adoption of these bylaws, the number of directors constituting the entire Board of Directors shall be one. Thereafter, this number may be changed by a resolution of the Board of Directors or of the stockholders, subject to Section 3.4 of these bylaws. No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director before such director’s term of office expires.


	 


	3.3 Election, Qualification And Term Of Office Of Directors


	 


	Except as provided in Section 3.4 of these bylaws, and unless otherwise provided in the certificate of incorporation, directors shall be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders to hold office until the next annual meeting. Directors need not be stockholders unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, wherein other qualifications for directors may be prescribed. Each director, including a director elected to fill a vacancy, shall hold office until his or her successor is elected and qualified or until his or her earlier resignation or removal.


	 


	Unless otherwise specified in the certificate of incorporation, elections of directors need not be by written ballot.

	3.4 Resignation And Vacancies


	 


	Any director may resign at any time upon written notice to the attention of the Secretary of the corporation. Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 78.130 of the Nevada Revised Statutes, any vacancy, including newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number of directors or amendment of the certificate of incorporation, and vacancies created by removal or resignation of a director, may be filled by a majority of the directors then in office (including any directors that have tendered a resignation effective at a future date), though less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director, and the directors so chosen shall hold office until the next annual election and until their successors are duly elected and shall qualify, unless sooner displaced; provided, however, that where such vacancy occurs among the directors elected by the holders of a class or series of stock, the holders of shares of such class or series may override the Board of Directors’ action to fill such vacancy by (i) voting for their own designee to fill such vacancy at a meeting of the Corporation’s stockholders or (ii) written consent, if the consenting stockholders hold a sufficient number of shares to elect their designee at a meeting of the stockholders.


	 


	If at any time, by reason of death or resignation or other cause, the corporation should have no directors in office, then any officer or any stockholder or an executor, administrator, trustee or guardian of a stockholder, or other fiduciary entrusted with like responsibility for the person or estate of a stockholder, may call a special meeting of stockholders in accordance with the provisions of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, or may apply to the applicable Nevada court for a decree summarily ordering an election as provided in Nevada Revised Statutes.


	 


	If, at the time of filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office constitute less than a majority of the whole board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase), then the court may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least 10% of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to vote for such directors, summarily order an election to be held to fill any such vacancies or newly created directorships, or to replace the directors chosen by the directors then in office as aforesaid, which election shall be governed by the provisions of Nevada Revised Statutes as far as applicable.


	 


	3.5 Place Of Meetings; Meetings By Telephone


	 


	The Board of Directors of the corporation may hold meetings, both regular and special, either within or outside the state of Nevada.

	Special meetings of the Board of Directors for any purpose or purposes may be called at any time by the chairman of the board, the chief executive officer, the president, the secretary or any two directors.


	 


	Notice of the time and place of special meetings shall be delivered personally or by telephone to each director or sent by first-class mail, facsimile, electronic transmission, or telegram, charges prepaid, addressed to each director at that director’s address as it is shown on the records of the corporation. If the notice is mailed, it shall be deposited in the United States mail at least 4 days before the time of the holding of the meeting. If the notice is delivered personally or by facsimile, electronic transmission, telephone or telegram, it shall be delivered at least 24 hours before the time of the holding of the meeting. Any oral notice given personally or by telephone may be communicated either to the director or to a person at the office of the director who the person giving the notice has reason to believe will promptly communicate it to the director. The notice need not specify the purpose of the meeting. The notice need not specify the place of the meeting, if the meeting is to be held at the principal executive office of the corporation. Unless otherwise indicated in the notice thereof, any and all business may be transacted at a special meeting.


	 


	3.8 Quorum


	 


	At all meetings of the Board of Directors, a majority of the total number of duly elected directors then in office (but in no case less than 1/3 of the total number of authorized directors) shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business and the act of a majority of the directors present at any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board of Directors, except as may be otherwise specifically provided by statute or by the certificate of incorporation. If a quorum is not present at any meeting of the Board of Directors, then the directors present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time, without notice other than announcement at the meeting, until a quorum is present.


	 


	A meeting at which a quorum is initially present may continue to transact business notwithstanding the withdrawal of directors, if any action taken is approved by at least a majority of the required quorum for that meeting.


	 


	3.9 Waiver Of Notice


	 


	Whenever notice is required to be given under any provision of the Nevada Revised Statutes or of the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws, a written waiver thereof, signed by the person entitled to notice, or waiver by electronic mail or other electronic transmission by such person, whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to notice. Attendance of a person at a meeting shall constitute a waiver of notice of such meeting, except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or convened. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the directors, or members of a committee of directors, need be specified in any written waiver of notice unless so required by the certificate of incorporation or these bylaws.

Such filing shall be in paper form if the minutes are maintained in paper form and shall be in electronic form if the minutes are maintained in electronic form.

The loan, guaranty or other assistance may be with or without interest and may be unsecured, or secured in such manner as the Board of Directors shall approve, including, without limitation, a pledge of shares of stock of the corporation. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to deny, limit or restrict the powers of guaranty or warranty of the corporation at common law or under any statute.


	 


	3.13 Removal Of Directors


	 


	Unless otherwise restricted by statute, by the certificate of incorporation or by these bylaws, any director or the entire Board of Directors may be removed, with or without cause, by, and only by, the affirmative vote of the holders of the shares of the class or series of stock entitled to elect such director or directors, given either at a special meeting of such stockholders duly called for that purpose or pursuant to a written consent of stockholders, and any vacancy thereby created may be filled by the holders of that class or series of stock represented at the meeting or pursuant to written consent; provided, however, that if the stockholders of the corporation are entitled to cumulative voting, if less than the entire Board of Directors is to be removed, no director may be removed without cause if the votes cast against his removal would be sufficient to elect him if then cumulatively voted at an election of the entire Board of Directors.


	 


	No reduction of the authorized number of directors shall have the effect of removing any director prior to the expiration of such director’s term of office.

	Expenses incurred in defending any action or proceeding for which indemnification is required pursuant to Section 6.1 or for which indemnification is permitted pursuant to Section 6.2 following authorization thereof by the Board of Directors shall be paid by the corporation in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of the indemnified party to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no further right to appeal that the indemnified party is not entitled to be indemnified as authorized in this Article VI.


	 


	6.4 Indemnity Not Exclusive


	 


	The indemnification provided by this Article VI shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification may be entitled under any Bylaw, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office, to the extent that such additional rights to indemnification are authorized in the certificate of incorporation

	7.1 Maintenance And Inspection Of Records


	 


	The corporation shall, either at its principal executive offices or at such place or places as designated by the Board of Directors, keep a record of its stockholders listing their names and addresses and the number and class of shares held by each stockholder, a copy of these bylaws as amended to date, accounting books, and other records.


	 




	 




	17







	 




	 




	 


	Any stockholder of record, in person or by attorney or other agent, shall, upon written demand under oath stating the purpose thereof, have the right during the usual hours for business to inspect for any proper purpose the corporation’s stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its other books and records and to make copies or extracts therefrom. A proper purpose shall mean a purpose reasonably related to such person’s interest as a stockholder. In every instance where an attorney or other agent is the person who seeks the right to inspection, the demand under oath shall be accompanied by a power of attorney or such other writing that authorizes the attorney or other agent to so act on behalf of the stockholder. The demand under oath shall be directed to the corporation at its registered office in Nevada or at its principal place of business.


	 


	A complete list of stockholders entitled to vote at any meeting of stockholders, arranged in alphabetical order for each class of stock and showing the address of each such stockholder and the number of shares registered in each such stockholder’s name, shall be open to the examination of any such stockholder for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting in the manner provided by law. The stock list shall also be open to the examination of any stockholder during the whole time of the meeting as provided by law. This list shall presumptively determine the identity of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting and the number of shares held by each of them.


	 


	7.2 Inspection By Directors


	 


	Any director shall have the right to examine the corporation’s stock ledger, a list of its stockholders, and its other books and records for a purpose reasonably related to his or her position as a director. The appropriate district court of Nevada is hereby vested with the exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a director is entitled to the inspection sought. The Court may summarily order the corporation to permit the director to inspect any and all books and records, the stock ledger, and the stock list and to make copies or extracts therefrom. The Court may, in its discretion, prescribe any limitations or conditions with reference to the inspection, or award such other and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.


	 




	ARTICLE VIII GENERAL MATTERS




	 


	8.1 Checks


	 


	From time to time, the Board of Directors shall determine by resolution which person or persons may sign or endorse all checks, drafts, other orders for payment of money, notes or other evidences of indebtedness that are issued in the name of or payable to the corporation, and only the persons so authorized shall sign or endorse those instruments.


	 


	8.2 Execution Of Corporate Contracts And Instruments


	 


	The Board of Directors, except as otherwise provided in these bylaws, may authorize any officer or officers, or agent or agents, to enter into any contract or execute any instrument in the name of and on behalf of the corporation; such authority may be general or confined to specific instances.

	The shares of the corporation may be certificated or uncertificated, as provided under Nevada law, and shall be entered in the books of the corporation and recorded as they are issued. Any or all of the signatures on any certificate may be a facsimile or electronic signature. In case any officer, transfer agent or registrar who has signed or whose facsimile or electronic signature has been placed upon a certificate has ceased to be such officer, transfer agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, it may be issued by the corporation with the same effect as if he or she were such officer, transfer agent or registrar at the date of issue.


	 


	Within a reasonable time after the issuance or transfer of uncertificated stock and upon the request of a stockholder, the corporation shall send to the record owner thereof a written notice that shall set forth the name of the corporation, that the corporation is organized under the laws of Nevada, the name of the stockholder, the number and class (and the designation of the series, if any) of the shares, and any restrictions on the transfer or registration of such shares of stock imposed by the corporation’s certificate of incorporation, these bylaws, any agreement among stockholders or any agreement between stockholders and the corporation.

Upon the face or back of each stock certificate (if any) issued to represent any such partly paid shares, or upon the books and records of the corporation in the case of uncertificated partly paid shares, the total amount of the consideration to be paid therefor and the amount paid thereon shall be stated. Upon the declaration of any dividend on fully paid shares, the corporation shall declare a dividend upon partly paid shares of the same class, but only upon the basis of the percentage of the consideration actually paid thereon.


	 


	8.4 Special Designation On Certificates and Notices of Issuance


	 


	(a) If the corporation is authorized to issue more than one class of stock or more than one series of any class, then the powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights shall be set forth in full or summarized on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock or the notice of issuance to the record owner of uncertificated stock; provided, however, that, except as otherwise provided in the Nevada Revised Statutes, in lieu of the foregoing requirements there may be set forth on the face or back of the certificate that the corporation shall issue to represent such class or series of stock or the notice of issuance to the record owner of uncertificated stock, or the purchase agreement for such stock a statement that the corporation will furnish without charge to each stockholder who so requests the powers, the designations, the preferences, and the relative, participating, optional or other special rights of each class of stock or series thereof and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions of such preferences and/or rights.

	8.6 Construction; Definitions

	8.11 Stockholders of Record


	 


	(a) The corporation shall be entitled to recognize the exclusive right of a person recorded on its books as the owner of shares to receive dividends and to vote as such owner, shall be entitled to hold liable for calls and assessments the person recorded on its books as the owner of shares, and shall not be bound to recognize any equitable or other claim to or interest in such share or shares on the part of another person, whether or not it shall have express or other notice thereof, except as otherwise provided by the laws of Nevada.


	 


	8.12 Facsimile or Electronic Signature


	 


	In addition to the provisions for use of facsimile or electronic signatures elsewhere specifically authorized in these bylaws, facsimile or electronic signatures of any stockholder, director or officer of the corporation may be used whenever and as authorized by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof.


	 




	ARTICLE IX AMENDMENTS




	 


	The Bylaws of the corporation may be adopted, amended or repealed by the stockholders entitled to vote; provided, however, that the corporation may, in its certificate of incorporation, confer the power to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws upon the directors. The fact that such power has been so conferred upon the directors shall not divest the stockholders of the power, nor limit their power to adopt, amend or repeal Bylaws.

The parties shall cooperate, each at its own expense, in such filing, registration or notification, including, without limitation, submitting any such confidential treatment request, and shall execute all documents reasonably required in connection therewith.

	EXHIBIT 14.1



	 




	Blake Insomnia Therapeutics, Inc.






	Code of Business Conduct and Ethics






	For Directors




	 


	1. Introduction.


	 


	This Code of Ethics for Directors has been adopted by the Board of Directors of Blake Insomnia Therapeutics to promote honest and ethical conduct and compliance with applicable laws, rules, regulations and standards. The Board recognizes that no code of conduct and ethics can replace the thoughtful behavior of an ethical Director. Such a code, however, can focus attention on areas of ethical risk, provide guidance to help recognize and deal with ethical issues, and help to foster a culture of honesty and accountability


	 


	Any waiver of the Code may be made only by the Board of Directors or a Committee of the Board, and must be disclosed promptly to shareholders.


	 


	2. Principles and Practices.


	 


	In performing his or her duties, a Director of Blake Insomnia Therapeutics, Inc. should abide by the following principles:


	 







	 



	a.


	Conflicts of Interest. Directors should conduct themselves in an honest and ethical manner and avoid any actual or apparent conflict of interest. A conflict of interest occurs when a Director’s private interest interferes in any way with the interests of the Company, and/or makes it difficult to perform his or her duty objectively and effectively.





	 




	 




	 






	 



	b.


	Corporate Opportunities. Directors should not (a) take for themselves personally opportunities that are discovered through the use of Company property, information or position; (b) use Company property, information, or position for personal gain; or (c) compete with the Company. Directors owe a duty to the Company to advance its legitimate interests when the opportunity to do so arises.





	 




	 




	 






	 



	c.


	Confidentiality. Directors should maintain the confidentiality of information entrusted to them by the Company or its customers, except when disclosure is authorized or legally mandated. Confidential information includes all non-public information that might be of use to competitors, or harmful to the Company or its customers, if disclosed.





	 




	 




	 






	 



	d.


	Fair Dealing. Directors should endeavor to deal fairly with the Company’s various constituents. No Director should take unfair advantage of anyone through manipulation, concealment, abuse of privileged information, misrepresentation of material facts, or any other unfair dealing practice.




	 




	 




	1







	 




	 




	 









	 




	 




	 






	 



	e.


	Protection and Proper use of Company Assets. Directors should protect the Company’s assets and ensure their efficient use. All Company assets should be used for legitimate business purposes.





	 




	 




	 






	 



	f.


	Compliance with Laws, Rules and Regulations (including Insider Trading Laws). Directors should proactively promote compliance with laws, rules and regulations, including insider trading laws. Insider trading is both unethical and illegal.





	 




	 




	 






	 



	g.


	Encouraging the Reporting of any Illegal or Unethical Behavior. Directors should proactively promote ethical behavior. Directors should ensure that the Company encourages employees to talk to supervisors, managers or other appropriate personnel when in doubt about the best course of action in a particular situation. Directors should ensure that the Company has an effective means for employees to report violations of laws, rules, regulations or the Company’s Code of Ethics for Management Personnel, including Senior Financial Officers or its Standards of Conduct. Directors should ensure that the Company does not allow retaliation for reports made in good faith and that this is policy communicated to the employee.





	 




	 




	 






	 



	h.


	Annual Certification. Directors will annually sign a confirmation that they have read and will comply with this Code.

Blake Insomnia Therapeutics (BKIT) To Deliver A Revolutionary Sleeping Aid With Fewer Side Effects


Insomnia is a serious problem in the United States where nearly 60 million people are affected by the disorder. An estimated 40% of the general population experiences some type of insomnia or sleeplessness at one time or another in their lives. Chronic insomnia affects 10% of all people who suffer from a sleeping disorder. 
The team at Blake Insomnia Therapeutics, Inc. is attempting to reduce insomnia in patients with a patent-pending compound called Zleepax (ZLX-1). The treatment has demonstrated a high level of efficacy without the traditional side effects associated with current sleep medications.
A New Way Of Addressing Insomnia
Insomnia is believed to be caused because of stress placed on the body. Divorce, financial troubles, and other situations in life can lead to a sleeping disorder. Researchers at Blake Insomnia Therapeutics examined currently available pharmaceutical drugs and noticed a troubling pattern — they all utilize hypnotics to "force" people to sleep by depressing the central nervous system.
Zleepax takes a different approach by diminishing the physical symptoms of stress that keep people awake at night.
This new revolutionary drug is the first sleep aid to utilize beta blockers as a major active ingredient. The drug uses third-generation beta blockers which have been shown to improve sleep quality in patients with mild hypertension.
No more residual daytime sedation. Because the product is built upon a foundation of beta blockers, side effects are drastically reduced. Patients are expected to have a better night's sleep without drowsiness the following day.
A Stress-Related Solution.  Zleepax was formulated specifically to fend off insomnia caused by stress-related situations. As previously stated, this occurs by offering a product that targets the symptoms of stress that keep people awake at night.
A Third-Generation Beta Blocker. The beta blocker Nebivolol has been shown to have no known effect on the nocturnal release of melatonin in recent studies and was shown to improve quality of sleep for patients with mild hypertension. During studies in the 1990s, Nebivolol was shown to treat hypertension and was well tolerated in chronic use with very few side effects.
Zleepax’s patent applications cover the use of beta blockers such as Nebivolol either alone or in combination with other anti-insomnia drugs.
A Go-To Market Strategy Through Strategic Partnership
On March 2, 2017, Blake Insomnia Therapeutics and Sajo Consulting LLC announced a team of experts chosen to conduct clinical trials for the Zleepax formula.
Canadian clinical trials are planned for Q3 2017 pending approval of a New Drug Submission by the Health Products and Food Branch of Health Canada.
If clinical trials are successful, the company will go to market with a drug that features fewer and possibly none of the traditional side effects often associated with current sleep aids.
A Leader With Industry Expertise
Founder and CEO Birger Jan Olsen has spent over 30 years primarily working in the pharmaceutical and medical devices sectors. Among his accomplishments was the founding of neuromarketing company Mindmetic and ProjektGruppen, a successful pharma-focused marketing agency.
As an investor, Jan Olsen is responsible for Blake’s patent-pending ZLX-1 sleep medicine compound, along with a patented method for automatically interpreting brain activity, a compliance-boosting dosing device for osteoporosis patients, acquired by Roche Pharmaceuticals, and the widely used Globase automated marketing tool, acquired by AdPepper.
Birger's focus on startup culture and early-stage processes have been at the core of Blake's growth. The company is now transitioning from an early stage firm into a globally recognized brand.
Fundraising And The Clinical Process
In January 2017, CEO Jan Olsen announced plans to raise the money needed to complete clinical trials for the company's Zleepax (ZLX-1) formula. 
Phase II financing is focused on determining the combination and dosage that will deliver the most potent effect for clients. The phase II process will cost approximately $5 million.
Phase III funding will begin after a successful previous round and will cost $10 million. Once completed, the company can request full FDA approval for Zleepax. 
The company has promised to bring the product to market quickly once clinical trials are completed.
Helping lead the clinical process is Clinical Trial Sponsor Ajit Johal and Research Coordinator Anastasia Frank.
Mr. Johal is the clinical services coordinator at Wilson Pharmacy in Port Coquitlam and is a clinical instructor at UBC’s Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences. His experience includes years of expertise as a lead clinical pharmacist for a number of outreach programs including the Integrated Medication Management Program and the Coast Mental Health Medication Program.
Ms. Frank's received her Master of Public Health from the University of British Columbia and a BA with Honors in Geography from McGill University. Her main focus has been on expanding the links between urban planning and public health. She has worked both in and outside the lab on various health-related projects.
Canadian clinical trials are planned for Q3 2017 pending approval of a New Drug Submission by the Health Products and Food Branch of Health Canada.
Capturing A Global Market With Tremendous Growth
The global sleep aid market was valued at $61,798.0 million in 2015 with an expected CAGR of 6.3% during 2016-2022.
Insomnia sleep disorder products captured one of the largest shares of the global sleeping aids market with a 30.1% share, only surpassed by the mattress and pillow segment which combines for a 42.3% market share.
A study from Reportbuyer revealed increasing demand for sleeping aids is due to a growing aging population, the main driver of global sleeping aids.
Blake hopes to add a new solution to a market dominated by traditional sleep medications, pillows, mattresses, and sleep apnea devices.
Government Support As Sleep Disorders Increase
Blake Insomnia Therapeutics may be entering the market just at the right time. As sleeping disorders have continued to grow among an aging population, government officials have placed a greater emphasis on spreading awareness about the importance of proper sleep schedules and the use of sleep aid products that can greatly benefit citizens and reduce hospital expenditures.
Government programs have been aimed at raising awareness about the side effects of current sleep aid medications, a problem that Zleepax may be able to solve by delivering a powerful medication without the traditional side effects found with other drugs, side effects that often include headache, dry mouth, dizziness, constipation, and stomach ache among other symptoms.

Top 5 Sleep Supplements of :Which Brands Think You're Stupid?



If You’re Looking for a Better sleep Support Supplement, Look No Further!




Posted on
 by Paul Grudnitsky | SleepSupportSupplements.com





See how we make our pick: According to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 35% of adults in America aren’t getting enough sleep, and sleeping less than seven hours a night is associated with serious health consequences: obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and frequent mental stress.
 
Needless to say, sleep is vital to your overall health and mental health, so any interruptions in your normal sleep schedule should be taken seriously.
 
« Skip To Our Top Reviewed Sleep Remedy »
 
“What Causes Sleep Disorders?”
 
The most common sleep disorder is insomnia, which is when you’re unable to fall asleep or remain asleep, and it’s usually the main reason people look for sleep remedies. Unfortunately, this sleep disorder is extremely common and about 50% of American adults experience it at some point in their lives.
 
There are a variety of causes, but some of the most common are:
 
Stress, Anxiety, and Depression: these are two of the most common causes of chronic insomnia. Stress, anger, worry, anxiousness, and negative thoughts can have a dramatic effect on sleep quality.
 
Stimulants: Excessive use of caffeine, such as energy drinks and coffee, is one of the most common causes of intermittent and transient insomnia. This is insomnia that occurs periodically or only for a few nights at a time.
 
Medications: Some medications can interfere with sleep, such as antidepressants, ADHD medication, corticosteroids, thyroid hormone, high blood pressure medication, some contraceptives, pain relievers that contain caffeine, diuretics, and diet pills.
 
Allergies and Respiratory Problems: Colds, sinus infections, and upper respiratory problems can make it hard to breathe at night which can cause sleeping difficulties.
 
Nocturia: Frequent urination and constantly getting up in the middle of the night to use the restroom causes sleep disturbances.
 
Chronic Pain: A variety of conditions that cause chronic pain can also disrupt sleep, such as: arthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, inflammatory bowel disease, headaches, lower back pain.
 
“How are Sleep Disorders Treated”  
 
The most common problem people have is falling asleep and staying asleep. For serious sleep disorders, a doctor may advise a prescription drug to be taken nightly.
 
Selective Gamma-aminobutyric acid medications (Ambien, Lunesta, Sonata): These prescription medications target the GABA receptors in the brain. GABA is the neurotransmitter that reduces alertness and promotes relaxation.
 
Unfortunately, this medication is known to cause side effects like hallucinations, memory disturbances, and  “black-outs” wherein people report sleepwalking, sleep-eating, and even sleep-driving.
 
Benzodiazepines (Xanax, Valium, Restoril, Halcion, Ativan): Typically prescribed for anxiety, these prescription drugs activate the GABA receptors in the brain and cause sedation and relaxation. They are considered extremely addictive with very difficult withdrawal symptoms, and can cause a similar “black-out” effect with users.
 
Antihistamines (Benadryl, Advil PM, Dramamine, Unisom, Zzzquil, etc.): These over-the-counter antihistamines are a common alternative for people who don’t want to take prescription drugs. The most common side effects of antihistamines are dryness, constipation, upset stomach, and feeling groggy the next day.
 
​WARNING
​Recently, these common antihistamine sleep aids have been associated with an increased risk of dementia and various forms of MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment).1 These sleep aids all have several things in common:•  They’re unnatural, pharmaceutical drugs•  They’re expensive•  They all come with serious side-effects
So the real question is:
 
“Are There Any NATURAL Sleep Remedies that Actually Work?”
 
With any condition, there will inevitably be a line of natural remedies created to help alleviate symptoms and build a path towards remission and health. Judging by the number of customers these companies have year after year, the volume of verified testimonials, and the support some of their ingredients have from the medical community, they must be doing something right.
 
These natural remedies are often used in order to avoid the cost, inconvenience, and side effects of prescription drugs and invasive treatments. Among so many choices, we have to ask:
 
“How Do You Separate The Good Products From The Junk?”
 
We have a passion for natural health and many of us have suffered from insomnia and sleep issues ourselves. That’s why we went out and compared some of the top natural neuropathy remedies to see which ones really worked and which ones we can throw in the garbage.
 
Here’s What We Looked for in a Product:
 
With years of experience, our research team dove into stacks of medical journals and consumer reports and studied exactly how certain vitamins and herbs can promote relaxation and deep, restful sleep. We narrowed the list to 4 ESSENTIAL ingredients that no effective sleep remedy would be without:
 
​Melatonin▼  Click To Read  ▼This is a ‘no-brianer’ for any sleep formula. Melatonin is the hormone made by your pineal gland that controls your sleep and wake cycles. Light affects melatonin production, and your body will naturally release more melatonin at night, which is why indoor lighting, TVs, and your cell-phone’s brightness can disrupt sleep. Melatonin causes drowsiness, lowers body temperature, and puts the body into sleep mode.Magnesium▼  Click To Read  ▼This is one of the most vital minerals when it comes to relaxation, sleep, and mental health. A magnesium deficiency can cause anxiety, sleep disorders, irritability, and abnormal heart rhythms. The relaxing, sleep-boosting properties of magnesium are well known. One study shows that magnesium improved subjective measures of insomnia, sleep efficiency, sleep time and sleep onset. Theanine▼  Click To Read  ▼This amino acid promotes a sense of calm and has many observable anti-anxiety properties, and this happens quickly, usually within 20minutes. By reducing anxiety and stress, theanine helps ‘quiet’ the mind before sleep. Studies note that theanine improved overall sleep quality.2 5 Essential Herbs▼  Click To Read  ▼Valerian Root: Valerian Root helps increase the amount of the neurotransmitter GABA in the brain, which brings about relaxation and calm. Drugs like Xanax and Valium increase GABA synthetically, but Valerian is all natural and safe. In one study, 44% reported perfect sleep and 89% reported improved sleep with Valerian Root.3 Passionflower: Passionflower is actually listed as a tranquilizing herb in Germany and its calming, sleep inducing effects have been known for a long time. It has a similar effect on anxiousness, too, so in combination with Valerian Root, it’s a perfect way to slip into deep, restful sleep. Several studies show it’s an effective remedy against anxiety.4,5 Lemon Balm: Lemon Balm is well studied. It encourages deeper and more restful sleep, as shown in a German sleep study. Additionally, it’s an excellent antioxidant for the liver, a brain booster that helps improve memory, and mood booster as well!6,7 Hops: It’s not just for beer. Studies show that those who drank non-alcoholic beer with hops actually had improved sleep quality and reduced levels of anxiety. Hops have a lot in common with Valerian Root as far as its relaxing, calm-promoting effects, which makes the two a perfect combination.8,9 Chamomile: Chamomile is a sleep remedy as old as time. It’s most commonly consumed in the form of tea, and its health benefits are incredible: it’s an anti-inflammatory, helps with digestive issues, helps with skin irritation, helps get rid of sore throat, and of course, is an excellent sleep remedy.10 Liquid Delivery Method▼  Click To Read  ▼We gave a heavy favoritism to liquid extracts, and it wasn’t for no good reason. Studies show the body uses 98% of the liquid extract compared to only about 39-53% of a capsule or tablet, meaning the remainder of those ingredients and the money spent on them are just flushed down the toilet. Furthermore, capsules have to travel through the stomach and liver before their ingredients are even available to the body, while 87% of the liquid extract is absorbed in the first 20-30 seconds.11,12
 
What We Looked For In A Brand:
 
​Strength of Money-Back Guarantee: A money-back guarantee shows the manufacturer is so confident in the product that they’re willing to put their money where their mouth is. There’s simply no reason to trust a product that doesn’t offer a money-back-guarantee. 24 Hour Customer Support: A 24-hour customer-support service shows a manufacturer’s commitment to their customers, because 24-hour support isn’t cheap. With any remedy, you’re likely to have questions, and those questions can arise at any time of the day or night; 24-hour customer service offers a peace-of-mind knowing the answers are only a phone call away.
 
What We Discovered:  
 
There are tons and tons of sleep formulas out there, and unfortunately, most seem to be merely copy-cats of other sleep formulas, as if they’re all buying the same product from one pill manufacturer and slapping on a different label and price.
 
However, some formulas did attempt to separate themselves from their competition. And for us, there was a clear winner:

Our Review: We put NoctuRest in our number one spot as the best natural sleep remedy on the market. It’s one of the newest sleep formulas we’ve seen, and being late to the game is clearly an advantage.
 
First, the liquid formula set this formula apart from the competition. In our test, NoctuRest was much, much faster acting than its competitors. We noticed the sleep-inducing effects of NoctuRest in mere minutes (sometimes less than a minute), which is ideal when you want to get to sleep quickly. With pills and capsules it’s difficult to time, we didn’t notice pill and capsule effects for up to thirty minutes or more.
 
The liquid formula was also very convenient. You don’t need to get up for a glass of water, and swallow some clumsy pills, all you need to do is pinch the dropper and drink the formula. Easy.
 
Next, the formula has a wide variety of natural herbal extracts which combined to create an incredibly calm and relaxing drift into sleep. Most of the formulas only contained two or three of our recommended herbs, but NoctuRest did their homework and included all of them. It’s truly a testament to their dedication to not just produce a product that sells, but one that works as effectively as they claim.
 
Here’s where most formulas fail: they stick to herbs or nutrients (vitamins and minerals), but don’t combine the two. Again, NoctuRest excels by combining essential nutrients like Magnesium with high quality herbs, and despite the rather earthy flavor, it’s mixed quite well.
 
Lastly, NoctuRest is Made in the United States in an FDA Registered facility (rather than China like most of the supplement industry), with a 100% money-back guarantee and 24-hour customer service, NoctuRest worked hard to earn our vote of confidence and our #1 spot.
 
1. Liquid Delivery: Yes
 
2. Recommended Nutrients: 3 of 3
 
2. Recommended Herbs: 5 of 5
 
4. Money-Back Guarantee: Yes
 
5. 24-Hour Customer Support: Yes
 
NoctuRest does NOT contain 5-HTP. This ingredient that’s commonly placed in sleep formulas doesn’t work well for everyone. It boosts serotonin in the brain, and some people actually find it makes them irritable, angry, causes teeth-grinding, and nightmares. Not to mention 5-HTP is downright dangerous to combine with anti-depressants and can cause serotonin syndrome.
 
Ingredients: Magnesium, Theanine, Melatonin, Valerian, Passionflower, Lemon Balm, Hops, Chamomile.

Unfortunately, this medication is known to cause side effects like hallucinations, memory disturbances, and  “black-outs” wherein people report sleepwalking, sleep-eating, and even sleep-driving.
 
Benzodiazepines (Xanax, Valium, Restoril, Halcion, Ativan): Typically prescribed for anxiety, these prescription drugs activate the GABA receptors in the brain and cause sedation and relaxation. They are considered extremely addictive with very difficult withdrawal symptoms, and can cause a similar “black-out” effect with users.
 
Antihistamines (Benadryl, Advil PM, Dramamine, Unisom, Zzzquil, etc.): These over-the-counter antihistamines are a common alternative for people who don’t want to take prescription drugs. The most common side effects of antihistamines are dryness, constipation, upset stomach, and feeling groggy the next day.
 
​WARNING
​Recently, these common antihistamine sleep aids have been associated with an increased risk of dementia and various forms of MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment).1 These sleep aids all have several things in common:•  They’re unnatural, pharmaceutical drugs•  They’re expensive•  They all come with serious side-effects
So the real question is:
 
“Are There Any NATURAL Sleep Remedies that Actually Work?”
 
With any condition, there will inevitably be a line of natural remedies created to help alleviate symptoms and build a path towards remission and health. Judging by the number of customers these companies have year after year, the volume of verified testimonials, and the support some of their ingredients have from the medical community, they must be doing something right.
 
These natural remedies are often used in order to avoid the cost, inconvenience, and side effects of prescription drugs and invasive treatments. Among so many choices, we have to ask:
 
“How Do You Separate The Good Products From The Junk?”
 
We have a passion for natural health and many of us have suffered from insomnia and sleep issues ourselves. That’s why we went out and compared some of the top natural neuropathy remedies to see which ones really worked and which ones we can throw in the garbage.
 
Here’s What We Looked for in a Product:
 
With years of experience, our research team dove into stacks of medical journals and consumer reports and studied exactly how certain vitamins and herbs can promote relaxation and deep, restful sleep. We narrowed the list to 4 ESSENTIAL ingredients that no effective sleep remedy would be without:
 
​Melatonin▼  Click To Read  ▼This is a ‘no-brianer’ for any sleep formula. Melatonin is the hormone made by your pineal gland that controls your sleep and wake cycles. Light affects melatonin production, and your body will naturally release more melatonin at night, which is why indoor lighting, TVs, and your cell-phone’s brightness can disrupt sleep. Melatonin causes drowsiness, lowers body temperature, and puts the body into sleep mode.Magnesium▼  Click To Read  ▼This is one of the most vital minerals when it comes to relaxation, sleep, and mental health. A magnesium deficiency can cause anxiety, sleep disorders, irritability, and abnormal heart rhythms. The relaxing, sleep-boosting properties of magnesium are well known. One study shows that magnesium improved subjective measures of insomnia, sleep efficiency, sleep time and sleep onset. Theanine▼  Click To Read  ▼This amino acid promotes a sense of calm and has many observable anti-anxiety properties, and this happens quickly, usually within 20minutes. By reducing anxiety and stress, theanine helps ‘quiet’ the mind before sleep. Studies note that theanine improved overall sleep quality.2 5 Essential Herbs▼  Click To Read  ▼Valerian Root: Valerian Root helps increase the amount of the neurotransmitter GABA in the brain, which brings about relaxation and calm. Drugs like Xanax and Valium increase GABA synthetically, but Valerian is all natural and safe. In one study, 44% reported perfect sleep and 89% reported improved sleep with Valerian Root.3 Passionflower: Passionflower is actually listed as a tranquilizing herb in Germany and its calming, sleep inducing effects have been known for a long time. It has a similar effect on anxiousness, too, so in combination with Valerian Root, it’s a perfect way to slip into deep, restful sleep. Several studies show it’s an effective remedy against anxiety.4,5 Lemon Balm: Lemon Balm is well studied. It encourages deeper and more restful sleep, as shown in a German sleep study. Additionally, it’s an excellent antioxidant for the liver, a brain booster that helps improve memory, and mood booster as well!6,7 Hops: It’s not just for beer. Studies show that those who drank non-alcoholic beer with hops actually had improved sleep quality and reduced levels of anxiety. Hops have a lot in common with Valerian Root as far as its relaxing, calm-promoting effects, which makes the two a perfect combination.8,9 Chamomile: Chamomile is a sleep remedy as old as time. It’s most commonly consumed in the form of tea, and its health benefits are incredible: it’s an anti-inflammatory, helps with digestive issues, helps with skin irritation, helps get rid of sore throat, and of course, is an excellent sleep remedy.10 Liquid Delivery Method▼  Click To Read  ▼We gave a heavy favoritism to liquid extracts, and it wasn’t for no good reason. Studies show the body uses 98% of the liquid extract compared to only about 39-53% of a capsule or tablet, meaning the remainder of those ingredients and the money spent on them are just flushed down the toilet. Furthermore, capsules have to travel through the stomach and liver before their ingredients are even available to the body, while 87% of the liquid extract is absorbed in the first 20-30 seconds.11,12
 
What We Looked For In A Brand:
 
​Strength of Money-Back Guarantee: A money-back guarantee shows the manufacturer is so confident in the product that they’re willing to put their money where their mouth is. There’s simply no reason to trust a product that doesn’t offer a money-back-guarantee. 24 Hour Customer Support: A 24-hour customer-support service shows a manufacturer’s commitment to their customers, because 24-hour support isn’t cheap. With any remedy, you’re likely to have questions, and those questions can arise at any time of the day or night; 24-hour customer service offers a peace-of-mind knowing the answers are only a phone call away.
 
What We Discovered:  
 
There are tons and tons of sleep formulas out there, and unfortunately, most seem to be merely copy-cats of other sleep formulas, as if they’re all buying the same product from one pill manufacturer and slapping on a different label and price.
 
However, some formulas did attempt to separate themselves from their competition. And for us, there was a clear winner:

Top 5 Sleep Supplements of :Which Brands Think You're Stupid?



If You’re Looking for a Better sleep Support Supplement, Look No Further!

See how we make our pick: According to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 35% of adults in America aren’t getting enough sleep, and sleeping less than seven hours a night is associated with serious health consequences: obesity, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and frequent mental stress.
 
Needless to say, sleep is vital to your overall health and mental health, so any interruptions in your normal sleep schedule should be taken seriously.
 
« Skip To Our Top Reviewed Sleep Remedy »
 
“What Causes Sleep Disorders?”
 
The most common sleep disorder is insomnia, which is when you’re unable to fall asleep or remain asleep, and it’s usually the main reason people look for sleep remedies. Unfortunately, this sleep disorder is extremely common and about 50% of American adults experience it at some point in their lives.
 
There are a variety of causes, but some of the most common are:
 
Stress, Anxiety, and Depression: these are two of the most common causes of chronic insomnia. Stress, anger, worry, anxiousness, and negative thoughts can have a dramatic effect on sleep quality.
 
Stimulants: Excessive use of caffeine, such as energy drinks and coffee, is one of the most common causes of intermittent and transient insomnia. This is insomnia that occurs periodically or only for a few nights at a time.
 
Medications: Some medications can interfere with sleep, such as antidepressants, ADHD medication, corticosteroids, thyroid hormone, high blood pressure medication, some contraceptives, pain relievers that contain caffeine, diuretics, and diet pills.
 
Allergies and Respiratory Problems: Colds, sinus infections, and upper respiratory problems can make it hard to breathe at night which can cause sleeping difficulties.
 
Nocturia: Frequent urination and constantly getting up in the middle of the night to use the restroom causes sleep disturbances.
 
Chronic Pain: A variety of conditions that cause chronic pain can also disrupt sleep, such as: arthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, inflammatory bowel disease, headaches, lower back pain.
 
“How are Sleep Disorders Treated”  
 
The most common problem people have is falling asleep and staying asleep. For serious sleep disorders, a doctor may advise a prescription drug to be taken nightly.
 
Selective Gamma-aminobutyric acid medications (Ambien, Lunesta, Sonata): These prescription medications target the GABA receptors in the brain. GABA is the neurotransmitter that reduces alertness and promotes relaxation.
 
Unfortunately, this medication is known to cause side effects like hallucinations, memory disturbances, and  “black-outs” wherein people report sleepwalking, sleep-eating, and even sleep-driving.
 
Benzodiazepines (Xanax, Valium, Restoril, Halcion, Ativan): Typically prescribed for anxiety, these prescription drugs activate the GABA receptors in the brain and cause sedation and relaxation. They are considered extremely addictive with very difficult withdrawal symptoms, and can cause a similar “black-out” effect with users.

The most common side effects of antihistamines are dryness, constipation, upset stomach, and feeling groggy the next day.
