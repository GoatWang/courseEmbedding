About






 Targeting Cancer. Transforming Therapies.
Revolutionary science meets transformative cancer therapy
Seattle Genetics is the largest global oncology biotechnology company based in the Pacific Northwest. We are focused on developing and commercializing a new generation of targeted, empowered antibody-based therapies that have the potential to change the foundation of treatment for people with cancer.
Our industry-leading antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) technology combines the specificity of monoclonal antibodies, innovative linker systems, and the power of potent cell-killing agents to treat cancer. Using our proprietary technology, we are able to optimize each ADC to potentially improve outcomes for patients. ADCs are an integral part of the evolving cancer treatment paradigm with their specificity, stability and potency.

We have one marketed product, ADCETRIS® (brentuximab vedotin), which is the first in a new class of ADCs, commercially available in more than 65 countries worldwide for relapsed classical Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and relapsed systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma (sALCL). We also are advancing a strong pipeline of innovative therapies for blood cancers and solid tumors, including enfortumab vedotin (ASG-22ME) for urothelial cancer under our collaboration with Astellas, and SGN-LIV1A for triple-negative breast cancer. Our programs are designed to address significant unmet medical needs and to improve treatment outcomes for patients.
With multiple global product opportunities, significant research into advancing ADC technology and an emerging complementary immuno-oncology technology, we are positioned to transform cancer therapy.

Leadership











Clay B. Siegall, Ph.D.


          President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board        


In 1998, Clay co-founded Seattle Genetics. It was a time when cancer treatments were dominated by chemotherapies that didn’t differentiate between killing cancer cells and normal cells. His vision was to improve the lives of people with cancer by developing targeted therapies to treat major unmet needs.
A scientist by training, Clay built Seattle Genetics on a foundation of scientific innovation, rigorous research and drug development practices as well as a passion for helping patients. He has guided the company to its current leadership position in the field of antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) and in the 2011 FDA approval of our first ADC product, ADCETRIS® (brentuximab vedotin). Under a collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, ADCETRIS is now a global brand that is approved in more than 65 countries. Seattle Genetics is also advancing a diverse pipeline of proprietary ADCs for the treatment of cancer.
Under Clay’s leadership, Seattle Genetics has entered in to multiple strategic licenses for our ADC technology, including with Astellas, Genentech (Roche), AbbVie, GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer, that have generated more than $350 million to date. Across internal and collaborator programs, there are more than 20 ADCs in clinical development using our technology. Clay has also led Seattle Genetics’ capital-raising activities, securing more than $1.2 billion through public and private financings, including the company’s initial public offering in 2001.

Seattle Genetics is a biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing innovative, empowered monoclonal antibody-based therapies for the treatment of cancer. The company, headquartered in Bothell, Washington (a suburb of Seattle), is the industry leader in antibody-drug conjugates or ADCs, a technology designed to harness the targeting ability of monoclonal antibodies to deliver cell-killing agents directly to cancer cells. Antibody-drug Conjugates are intended to spare non-targeted cells and thus reduce many of the toxic effects of traditional chemotherapy, while potentially enhancing antitumor activity.
The companys' flagship product Adcetris (Brentuximab vedotin) [1] is commercially available for two indications in 50 countries, including the U.S., Canada, Japan and members of the European Union. The approval of Brentuximab vedotin makes it the first in a new class of ADCs.
To expand on the clinical opportunities of brentuximab vedotin, Seattle Genetics is conducting a broad clinical development program [2] to evaluate its therapeutic potential in earlier lines of its approved indications as well as in a range of other lymphoma and non-lymphoma settings. The company is jointly developing brentuximab vedotin in collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company. Under the terms of the collaboration, Seattle Genetics has full commercialization rights to brentuximab vedotin in the United States and Canada. Takeda has exclusive rights to commercialize the product candidate in all other countries.
In addition to brentuximab vedotin, Seattle Genetics' product pipeline includes SGN-CD19A, an Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting CD19, SGN-CD33A, an ADC targeting CD33, SGN-LIV1A, an ADC targeting LIV-1, SGN-CD70A, an ADC targeting CD70, as well as ASG-22ME and ASG-15ME, ADCs that they are co-developing with Agensys (an affiliate of Astellas), an early-stage privately held biotechnology company based in Los Angeles, focusing on the development of fully human monoclonal antibodies to treat solid tumor cancers in a variety of cancer targets.

Collaboration Agreements[edit]
Seattle Genetics has collaboration agreements with Takeda Oncology Company (formerly Millennium) to develop and commercialize brentuximab vedotin. The company also has collaboration agreements for their ADC technology with a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including, AbbVie, Bayer Celldex Therapeutics, Inc., Daiichi Sankyo, Genentech, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, Inc. and PSMA Development Company LLC as well as ADC co-development agreements with Agensys, Inc., an affiliate of Astellas Pharma and Oxford BioTherapeutics Ltd.[3]
Technology[edit]
MMAE-based[edit]
Seattle Genetics' proprietary Monomethyl auristatin E or MMAE-based antibody-drug conjugate technology, employed in brentuximab vedotin, empowers monoclonal antibodies to treat cancer. Brentuximab vedotin, for example, links the chimeric anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody (cAC10) via a protease-cleavable linker to MMAE. This ADC employs a linker system that is designed to be stable in the bloodstream but to release MMAE upon internalization into CD30-expressing tumor cells. This approach is intended to spare non-targeted (healthy) cells and thus reduce many of the toxic effects of traditional chemotherapy while potentially enhancing antitumor activity. (See also vedotins)
PBD based[edit]
Seattle Genetics is also evaluating another ADC technology using a highly potent cytotoxic agent called a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer that kills cells by a different mechanism than auristatins (monomethyl auristatin E or monomethyl auristatin F). Pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer is currently employed in SGN-CD33A and SGN-CD70A. It is stably linked to an antibody with Seattle Genetics' site-specific engineered cysteines, resulting in uniform drug-loading of two PBD dimers per antibody.

Seattle Genetics is a biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing innovative, empowered monoclonal antibody-based therapies for the treatment of cancer. The company, headquartered in Bothell, Washington (a suburb of Seattle), is the industry leader in antibody-drug conjugates or ADCs, a technology designed to harness the targeting ability of monoclonal antibodies to deliver cell-killing agents directly to cancer cells. Antibody-drug Conjugates are intended to spare non-targeted cells and thus reduce many of the toxic effects of traditional chemotherapy, while potentially enhancing antitumor activity.
The companys' flagship product Adcetris (Brentuximab vedotin) [1] is commercially available for two indications in 50 countries, including the U.S., Canada, Japan and members of the European Union. The approval of Brentuximab vedotin makes it the first in a new class of ADCs.
To expand on the clinical opportunities of brentuximab vedotin, Seattle Genetics is conducting a broad clinical development program [2] to evaluate its therapeutic potential in earlier lines of its approved indications as well as in a range of other lymphoma and non-lymphoma settings. The company is jointly developing brentuximab vedotin in collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company. Under the terms of the collaboration, Seattle Genetics has full commercialization rights to brentuximab vedotin in the United States and Canada. Takeda has exclusive rights to commercialize the product candidate in all other countries.
In addition to brentuximab vedotin, Seattle Genetics' product pipeline includes SGN-CD19A, an Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting CD19, SGN-CD33A, an ADC targeting CD33, SGN-LIV1A, an ADC targeting LIV-1, SGN-CD70A, an ADC targeting CD70, as well as ASG-22ME and ASG-15ME, ADCs that they are co-developing with Agensys (an affiliate of Astellas), an early-stage privately held biotechnology company based in Los Angeles, focusing on the development of fully human monoclonal antibodies to treat solid tumor cancers in a variety of cancer targets.

Collaboration Agreements[edit]
Seattle Genetics has collaboration agreements with Takeda Oncology Company (formerly Millennium) to develop and commercialize brentuximab vedotin. The company also has collaboration agreements for their ADC technology with a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including, AbbVie, Bayer Celldex Therapeutics, Inc., Daiichi Sankyo, Genentech, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, Inc. and PSMA Development Company LLC as well as ADC co-development agreements with Agensys, Inc., an affiliate of Astellas Pharma and Oxford BioTherapeutics Ltd.[3]
Technology[edit]
MMAE-based[edit]
Seattle Genetics' proprietary Monomethyl auristatin E or MMAE-based antibody-drug conjugate technology, employed in brentuximab vedotin, empowers monoclonal antibodies to treat cancer. Brentuximab vedotin, for example, links the chimeric anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody (cAC10) via a protease-cleavable linker to MMAE. This ADC employs a linker system that is designed to be stable in the bloodstream but to release MMAE upon internalization into CD30-expressing tumor cells. This approach is intended to spare non-targeted (healthy) cells and thus reduce many of the toxic effects of traditional chemotherapy while potentially enhancing antitumor activity. (See also vedotins)
PBD based[edit]
Seattle Genetics is also evaluating another ADC technology using a highly potent cytotoxic agent called a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer that kills cells by a different mechanism than auristatins (monomethyl auristatin E or monomethyl auristatin F). Pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer is currently employed in SGN-CD33A and SGN-CD70A. It is stably linked to an antibody with Seattle Genetics' site-specific engineered cysteines, resulting in uniform drug-loading of two PBD dimers per antibody.

Seattle Genetics is a biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing innovative, empowered monoclonal antibody-based therapies for the treatment of cancer. The company, headquartered in Bothell, Washington (a suburb of Seattle), is the industry leader in antibody-drug conjugates or ADCs, a technology designed to harness the targeting ability of monoclonal antibodies to deliver cell-killing agents directly to cancer cells. Antibody-drug Conjugates are intended to spare non-targeted cells and thus reduce many of the toxic effects of traditional chemotherapy, while potentially enhancing antitumor activity.
The companys' flagship product Adcetris (Brentuximab vedotin) [1] is commercially available for two indications in 50 countries, including the U.S., Canada, Japan and members of the European Union. The approval of Brentuximab vedotin makes it the first in a new class of ADCs.
To expand on the clinical opportunities of brentuximab vedotin, Seattle Genetics is conducting a broad clinical development program [2] to evaluate its therapeutic potential in earlier lines of its approved indications as well as in a range of other lymphoma and non-lymphoma settings. The company is jointly developing brentuximab vedotin in collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company. Under the terms of the collaboration, Seattle Genetics has full commercialization rights to brentuximab vedotin in the United States and Canada. Takeda has exclusive rights to commercialize the product candidate in all other countries.
In addition to brentuximab vedotin, Seattle Genetics' product pipeline includes SGN-CD19A, an Antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting CD19, SGN-CD33A, an ADC targeting CD33, SGN-LIV1A, an ADC targeting LIV-1, SGN-CD70A, an ADC targeting CD70, as well as ASG-22ME and ASG-15ME, ADCs that they are co-developing with Agensys (an affiliate of Astellas), an early-stage privately held biotechnology company based in Los Angeles, focusing on the development of fully human monoclonal antibodies to treat solid tumor cancers in a variety of cancer targets.

Collaboration Agreements[edit]
Seattle Genetics has collaboration agreements with Takeda Oncology Company (formerly Millennium) to develop and commercialize brentuximab vedotin. The company also has collaboration agreements for their ADC technology with a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including, AbbVie, Bayer Celldex Therapeutics, Inc., Daiichi Sankyo, Genentech, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, Inc. and PSMA Development Company LLC as well as ADC co-development agreements with Agensys, Inc., an affiliate of Astellas Pharma and Oxford BioTherapeutics Ltd.[3]
Technology[edit]
MMAE-based[edit]
Seattle Genetics' proprietary Monomethyl auristatin E or MMAE-based antibody-drug conjugate technology, employed in brentuximab vedotin, empowers monoclonal antibodies to treat cancer. Brentuximab vedotin, for example, links the chimeric anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody (cAC10) via a protease-cleavable linker to MMAE. This ADC employs a linker system that is designed to be stable in the bloodstream but to release MMAE upon internalization into CD30-expressing tumor cells. This approach is intended to spare non-targeted (healthy) cells and thus reduce many of the toxic effects of traditional chemotherapy while potentially enhancing antitumor activity. (See also vedotins)
PBD based[edit]
Seattle Genetics is also evaluating another ADC technology using a highly potent cytotoxic agent called a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer that kills cells by a different mechanism than auristatins (monomethyl auristatin E or monomethyl auristatin F). Pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer is currently employed in SGN-CD33A and SGN-CD70A. It is stably linked to an antibody with Seattle Genetics' site-specific engineered cysteines, resulting in uniform drug-loading of two PBD dimers per antibody.
Company history[edit]

The company also has collaboration agreements for their ADC technology with a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including, AbbVie, Bayer Celldex Therapeutics, Inc., Daiichi Sankyo, Genentech, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline, Pfizer, Inc. and PSMA Development Company LLC as well as ADC co-development agreements with Agensys, Inc., an affiliate of Astellas Pharma and Oxford BioTherapeutics Ltd.[3]
Technology[edit]
MMAE-based[edit]
Seattle Genetics' proprietary Monomethyl auristatin E or MMAE-based antibody-drug conjugate technology, employed in brentuximab vedotin, empowers monoclonal antibodies to treat cancer. Brentuximab vedotin, for example, links the chimeric anti-CD30 monoclonal antibody (cAC10) via a protease-cleavable linker to MMAE. This ADC employs a linker system that is designed to be stable in the bloodstream but to release MMAE upon internalization into CD30-expressing tumor cells. This approach is intended to spare non-targeted (healthy) cells and thus reduce many of the toxic effects of traditional chemotherapy while potentially enhancing antitumor activity. (See also vedotins)
PBD based[edit]
Seattle Genetics is also evaluating another ADC technology using a highly potent cytotoxic agent called a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer that kills cells by a different mechanism than auristatins (monomethyl auristatin E or monomethyl auristatin F). Pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) dimer is currently employed in SGN-CD33A and SGN-CD70A. It is stably linked to an antibody with Seattle Genetics' site-specific engineered cysteines, resulting in uniform drug-loading of two PBD dimers per antibody.
Company history[edit]
Early years[edit]
Seattle Genetics was founded in 1997 and is headquartered in Bothell, Washington, a suburb of Seattle. The company completed an initial public offering in March 2001, and is traded on the Nasdaq Stock Market under the symbol SGEN. To date, the company has more than 650 employees throughout the United States.

	Item 1.01.




	Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.







	Transactions with Immunomedics, Inc.




	On February 10, 2017, Seattle Genetics, Inc. (the Company) entered into parallel transactions with Immunomedics, Inc.
	(Immunomedics) comprising (i) a development and license agreement (the Development and License Agreement) pursuant to which Immunomedics grants, subject to the terms and conditions of the Development and License
	Agreement, the Company exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture, commercialize, and otherwise exploit

	IMMU-132

	and second generation antibody-drug conjugates targeting

	Trop-2

	for all human therapeutic uses in any and all indications, (ii) a stock purchase agreement (the Stock Purchase Agreement) pursuant to which the Company purchased 3 million shares
	of common stock of Immunomedics (the Purchased Shares) for an aggregate purchase price of $14.7 million, and (iii) a registration rights agreement (the Registration Rights Agreement) pursuant to which Immunomedics
	has agreed to file a registration statement in respect of the Purchased Shares and the Warrant Shares (as defined below, and together with the Purchased Shares, the Shares). On February 16, 2017, Immunomedics and Broadridge
	Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc., as warrant agent, entered into a warrant agreement (the Warrant Agreement), pursuant to which Immunomedics issued a warrant to the Company granting it the right to purchase up to 8,655,804 additional
	shares of Immunomedics common stock at an initial exercise price of $4.90 per share.




	Development and License Agreement





	Financial

	. Under and subject to the terms of the Development and License Agreement, the Company agreed to pay to Immunomedics an

	up-front

	payment of $250 million following closing of the Development and License Agreement (such closing, the License Closing). In addition, the Company agreed to pay development-, regulatory- and
	sales-dependent milestone payments to Immunomedics across multiple indications and geographic regions of up to a total maximum of approximately $1.7 billion. Immunomedics would also be eligible to receive royalties on worldwide annual net sales
	of licensed products at tiered royalty rate percentages beginning in the teens and rising to twenty percent, subject to customary reductions, during the royalty term specified in the Development and License Agreement. The Company will bear the
	future costs of worldwide development and commercialization of licensed products, subject to specified exceptions.



	Diligence


	and


	Additional


	Terms

	. Under the Development and License Agreement, the Company agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop

	IMMU-132.

	Following regulatory approval (and pricing
	and reimbursement approvals, as applicable) of any licensed product in any of the major market countries specified in the Development and License Agreement, the Company agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize such licensed
	product in each major market country where it has been approved. Under the Development and License Agreement, Immunomedics will have the right to exercise a

	co-promotion

	option to provide up to 50% of the
	sales efforts for the commercialization of

	IMMU-132

	in the United States, subject to certain parameters set forth in the Development and License Agreement.



	Termination

	. The Company may terminate the Development and License Agreement for convenience upon at least two hundred seventy
	(270) days prior written notice to Immunomedics. Either the Company or Immunomedics may terminate the Development and License Agreement if the other party is in material breach of the Development and License Agreement and fails to cure such
	breach within specified cure periods. Upon a termination of the Development and License Agreement by the Company for convenience or by Immunomedics for the Companys material breach of the Development and License Agreement, all licenses granted
	by Immunomedics to the Company terminate (other than specified exceptions), and all payment obligations that accrued prior to the date of such termination survive the termination, among other effects of termination. The Development and License
	Agreement also provides the Company the right to terminate specified portions of the Development and License Agreement in the event of certain fundamental breaches by Immunomedics that are not cured in accordance with specified cure periods and
	procedures.


	In addition, until 11:59 p.m. New York City time on February 19, 2017, Immunomedics has the right to continue
	discussions with a small number of parties that previously expressed interest in licensing

	IMMU-132.

	If a third party provides Immunomedics with a financially superior licensing offer, the Company has the
	right to match any such offer, and if it decides not to match, Immunomedics has the right to accept the superior offer and terminate the Development and License Agreement upon payment of a termination fee to the Company.



	Closing

	. The License Closing is subject to customary closing conditions, including the expiration of the applicable waiting period
	under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 in the United States, and there being no court or administrative orders blocking the License Closing. On February 13, 2017, the Company was named a

	co-defendant

	in a lawsuit (the venBio Lawsuit) filed by venBio Select Advisors LLC (venBio) against the members of the board of directors of Immunomedics. The venBio Lawsuit was
	filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware under the caption

	venBio


	v.


	Goldenberg


	et.


	al.

	and alleges that the members of the Immunomedics board breached their fiduciary duties toward their
	stockholders by hastily licensing

	IMMU-132

	to the Company. The Company is alleged to have aided and abetted the breach of fiduciary duties. Among other things, venBio seeks to enjoin Immunomedics and the
	Company from closing the

	IMMU-132

	licensing agreement. The Company cannot predict the timing or outcome of the venBio Lawsuit or the impact it may have on the Development and License Agreement or the License
	Closing.




	Stock Purchase Agreement




	Concurrently with the entry into the Development and License Agreement, on February 10, 2017, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase
	Agreement with Immunomedics pursuant to which Immunomedics issued, and the Company purchased, the Purchased Shares, which represent 2.75% of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Immunomedics (the Common
	Stock) after such issuance, for an aggregate purchase price of $14.7 million.




	Warrant Agreement




	On February 16, 2017, Immunomedics and Broadridge Corporate Issuer Solutions, Inc., as warrant agent, entered into the Warrant Agreement
	pursuant to which Immunomedics issued to, and in favor of, the Company, a warrant (the Warrant) on customary terms, pursuant to which the Company has the right, until February 10, 2020 (the Expiration Date), to purchase
	up to 8,655,804 additional shares (the Warrant Shares) of Common Stock at an initial exercise price of $4.90 per share (in each case, subject to customary anti-dilution and other adjustments in accordance with the terms of the Warrant),
	which, together with the Purchased Shares, represent 9.9% of the outstanding Common Stock on a post-exercise basis.


	Upon the occurrence
	of certain transactions prior to the Expiration Date directly or indirectly constituting a merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of Immunomedics assets, purchase offer, tender offer, exchange offer, reclassification or
	reorganization or recapitalization of the Common Stock, compulsory exchange of Common Stock or sale to another person of more than 50% of the Common Stock (each, a Fundamental Transaction), then, upon any subsequent exercise of any
	warrant under the Warrant Agreement, the Company (so long as it owns any warrant under the Warrant Agreement) will have the right to receive, for each Warrant Share that would have been issuable upon such exercise immediately prior to the occurrence
	of such Fundamental Transaction, at its option, the number of shares of Common Stock or other equity securities of the successor or acquiring corporation of Immunomedics, if it is the surviving corporation, and any additional consideration
	receivable as a result of such Fundamental Transaction by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock for which such warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction.


	The Company is not entitled, by virtue of holding the Warrant, to vote, to consent, to receive dividends, to consent or to receive notice as a
	stockholder with respect to any meeting of stockholders for the election of Immunomedics directors or any other matter, or to exercise any rights whatsoever as a stockholder of Immunomedics unless, until and only to the extent the Company
	becomes a holder of record of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Warrant.


	The issuances of the Purchased Shares and the
	Warrant Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act, and neither the Purchased Shares nor the Warrant Shares may be offered or sold in the United States absent registration under or exemption from the Securities Act and any applicable
	state securities laws.




	Registration Rights Agreement




	Concurrently with the entry into the Development and License Agreement and the Stock Purchase Agreement, on February 10, 2017 (the
	Equity Closing Date), the Company entered into a Registration Rights Agreement with Immunomedics pursuant to which Immunomedics has agreed to file a registration statement in respect of the Shares. Under the terms of the Registration
	Rights Agreement, Immunomedics is required to file a registration statement with respect to the Shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC) within 120 days after the Equity Closing Date and to cause such registration
	statement to be declared effective by the SEC within 180 days after the Equity Closing Date. Immunomedics has also agreed to other customary obligations regarding registration of the Shares, including matters relating to indemnification, maintenance
	of the registration statement and payment of certain expenses.


	The foregoing summary of the material terms of the Development and License
	Agreement, the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Warrant Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement does not purport to be complete and is subject to, and qualified in its entirety by references to the full texts of the Development and License
	Agreement, the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Warrant Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement. The Company expects to file the License and Development Agreement, the Stock Purchase Agreement, the Warrant Agreement and the Registration Rights
	Agreement with its Quarterly Report on Form

	10-Q

	for the fiscal period ended March 31, 2017, or if filed earlier, with a subsequent Current Report on Form

	8-K

	that
	the Company files in connection with the License Closing, requesting confidential treatment for certain portions of the Development and License Agreement.




	 









	Item 8.01.




	Other Events.





	On February 10, 2017, the Company issued a press release announcing
	its transactions with Immunomedics, including the Companys entry into the Development and License Agreement, the Stock Purchase Agreement and the Registration Rights Agreement. A copy of the press release is filed as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and is
	incorporated herein by reference.




	Forward-Looking Statements




	Certain of the statements made in this report are forward looking, such as those, among others, relating to the Companys expectations
	regarding, among other things, references to the anticipated License Closing, development, regulatory and sales milestone payments in connection with the Development and License Agreement, the exercise of the Warrant into Warrant Shares, and other
	statements that are not historical facts. Actual results or developments may differ materially from those projected or implied in these forward-looking statements. Factors that may cause such a difference include, among others, the risk and
	uncertainties associated with obtaining satisfaction of the conditions to the License Closing, including with respect to the HSR Act and the lack of court or administrative orders or other obstacles or requirements blocking or delaying the License
	Closing, including in connection with the venBio Lawsuit; the possibility that competing offers by third parties for the licensing of

	IMMU-132

	will be made; risks associated with licensing transactions, such
	as the risks that

	IMMU-132

	will not be integrated into the Companys pipeline successfully or will not perform in clinical testing as expected, in which case the Company may not recover its investment in

	IMMU-132;

	risks related to future opportunities and plans for the Company and

	IMMU-132,

	including uncertainty of the expected future regulatory filings and future development
	of

	IMMU-132;

	the possibility that if the Company does not complete the License Closing or does not achieve the perceived benefits of the transactions contemplated by the Development and License Agreement as
	rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial analysts or investors, the market price of the Companys common stock could decline; the difficulty and uncertainty of pharmaceutical product development; the inherent uncertainty associated
	with the regulatory approval process, including the risk that regulatory approval of

	IMMU-132

	in the U.S. or elsewhere may not be obtained in a timely manner or at all. More information about the risks and
	uncertainties faced by the Company is contained in the section captioned Risk factors in the Companys Quarterly Report on Form

	10-Q

	for the quarter ended September 30, 2016, filed with
	the SEC. Except as required by law, the Company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.

	February 10, 2017 06:49 AM Eastern Standard Time


	BOTHELL,
	Wash.(

	BUSINESS WIRE

	)

	Seattle Genetics, Inc.

	(Nasdaq: SGEN), a global biotechnology company, today announced a development and license agreement with

	Immunomedics, Inc.

	(Nasdaq: IMMU) under which Seattle Genetics would
	receive exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize sacituzumab govitecan

	(IMMU-132).

	Sacituzumab govitecan is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeted to

	TROP-2,

	which is expressed in several solid tumors including cancers of the breast, lung and bladder. Sacituzumab govitecan is in a phase 1/2 trial for patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), as well as
	multiple other solid tumors. It received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of patients with TNBC who have failed prior therapies for metastatic disease. Data from the phase 1/2 trial
	are intended to serve as the basis for a planned Biologics License Application (BLA) submission under the FDAs accelerated approval regulations.


	This agreement would add a promising late-stage ADC to our pipeline as we continue making progress towards our goal of becoming a global, multi-product
	oncology company. Sacituzumab govitecan would complement our existing pipeline by providing a potential near-term opportunity to commercialize a second drug in the United States, expand our international capabilities in Europe and elsewhere and
	extend our efforts in solid tumors, said Clay Siegall, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Seattle Genetics. In addition, we believe our expertise in ADCs, including demonstrated success in clinical development, regulatory,
	manufacturing and commercialization, ideally positions Seattle Genetics to advance this program globally. We look forward to working with Immunomedics to advance this program for patients in need, including those with triple negative breast cancer
	and other solid tumors.


	Cynthia L. Sullivan, President and Chief Executive Officer of Immunomedics, said, After a long and robust process, we
	concluded that licensing our lead asset, sacituzumab govitecan, to Seattle Genetics, the leading ADC company, would give us the best opportunity to advance this product on behalf of advanced stage cancer patients. Sacituzumab govitecan has the
	potential to drive significant value for patients with multiple types of cancer who are in need of new therapy options, and we look forward to continuing its development with Seattle Genetics.


	Upon closing of the transactions contemplated by the development and license agreement, Immunomedics would receive an upfront payment of $250 million. In
	addition, Seattle Genetics would pay development, regulatory and sales-dependent milestone payments across multiple indications and geographic regions of up to a total maximum of approximately $1.7 billion, as well as tiered double-digit
	royalties. The closing of the transactions contemplated by the development and license agreement is subject to customary conditions, including the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act
	of 1976, as amended. In addition, for a limited period of time, Immunomedics has the right to continue discussions with a small number of parties that previously expressed interest in licensing sacituzumab govitecan. If a third party provides
	Immunomedics with a financially superior licensing offer, Seattle Genetics has the right to match any such offer, and if it decides not to match, Immunomedics has the right to accept the superior offer and terminate the proposed development and
	license agreement upon payment of a termination fee to Seattle Genetics.


	Concurrent with the transaction, Seattle Genetics is purchasing approximately
	$15 million of common stock, representing a 2.8 percent stake in Immunomedics. Seattle Genetics has also been granted the right to purchase an additional 8,655,804 shares of common stock at a price of $4.90 per share for a defined period.
	The equity purchase and rights are not subject to closing of the development and license agreement.


	Seattle Genetics 2017 financial guidance
	provided on and as of February 9, 2017 does not take into account the impact of the transactions contemplated by the development and license agreement or the equity investment in Immunomedics. Seattle Genetics plans to update its 2017 financial
	guidance after the closing of the transactions contemplated by the development and license agreement.



	About Sacituzumab Govitecan



	Sacituzumab govitecan is an ADC composed of an

	anti-TROP-2

	antibody linked to

	SN-38,

	the active metabolite of irinotecan.

	TROP-2

	is a cell-surface receptor that is expressed on several tumors, including cancers of the breast, colon, lung and
	bladder.






	In data reported from a phase 1/2 trial, in 85 evaluable patients with metastatic TNBC, sacituzumab govitecan
	showed an objective response rate of 29 percent and a median duration of response of 10.8 months. For all 89 patients in the


	intent-to-treat


	population, the
	estimated median overall survival was 18.8 months. Sacituzumab govitecan was generally well-tolerated. The most common adverse events were nausea, neutropenia, diarrhea, anemia, vomiting and fatigue.


	In 2016, sacituzumab govitecan received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA for the treatment of patients with TNBC who have failed prior therapies
	for metastatic disease. The regulatory agency has also granted the ADC Fast Track designation for patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) or

	non-small-cell

	lung cancer (NSCLC). In addition, sacituzumab
	govitecan has been designated an orphan drug by the FDA for the treatment of patients with SCLC or pancreatic cancer and by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of patients with pancreatic cancer.

	management will host a conference call and webcast to discuss the transaction today at 5:30 a.m. Pacific Time (PT); 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time (ET). The live event will be available from the Seattle Genetics website at

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Forward-Looking Statements  The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Forward-looking statements are based on our management's beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management. All statements other than statements of historical facts are "forward-looking statements" for purposes of these provisions, including those relating to future events or our future financial performance and financial guidance. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as "may," "might," "will," "should," "expect," "plan," "anticipate," "project," "believe," "estimate," "predict," "potential," "intend" or "continue," the negative of terms like these or other comparable terminology, and other words or terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. These statements are only predictions. All forward-looking statements included in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q are based on information available to us on the date hereof, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements except as required by law. Any or all of our forward-looking statements in this document may turn out to be incorrect. Actual events or results may differ materially. Our forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors. We discuss many of these risks, uncertainties and other factors in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q in greater detail under the heading "Item 1A-Risk Factors." We caution investors that our business and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties.  Overview  Seattle Genetics is a biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of targeted therapies for the treatment of cancer. Our marketed product ADCETRIS(R), or brentuximab vedotin, is now approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and the European Commission for three indications, encompassing several settings for the treatment of relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma and relapsed systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma, or sALCL. ADCETRIS is commercially available in 66 countries around the world, including in the United States, Canada, members of the European Union and Japan. We are collaborating with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda, to develop and commercialize ADCETRIS on a global basis. Under this collaboration, Seattle Genetics retains commercial rights for ADCETRIS in the United States and its territories and in Canada, and Takeda has commercial rights in the rest of the world.  Beyond our current labeled indications, we and Takeda have a broad development strategy for ADCETRIS evaluating its therapeutic potential in earlier lines of therapy for patients with Hodgkin lymphoma or mature T-cell lymphoma, or MTCL, also known as peripheral T-Cell lymphoma, or PTCL, including sALCL, and in other CD30-expressing malignancies. We and Takeda are currently conducting three phase 3 clinical trials of ADCETRIS: ALCANZA, ECHELON-1 and ECHELON-2. All of these trials are being conducted under Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, agreements with the FDA and pursuant to scientific advice from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA. An SPA is an agreement with the FDA regarding the design of the clinical trial, including size and clinical endpoints, to support an efficacy claim in a new drug application or a Biologics License Application, or BLA, submission to the FDA if the trial achieves its primary endpoints. We plan to submit a supplemental Biologics License Application, or sBLA, to the FDA in mid-2017 to seek approval for a new indication in CD30-expressing relapsed CTCL. We have also completed enrollment of 1,334 patients in our ECHELON-1 trial and expect to report data in 2017. In November 2016, we completed enrollment of 452 patients in our ECHELON-2 trial, and expect to report data in 2018.  We are also advancing the development of SGN-CD33A, or vadastuximab talirine. A phase 3 clinical trial, called the CASCADE trial, was initiated in the second quarter of 2016 based on data from our phase 1 clinical trial for patients with acute myeloid leukemia, or AML. The CASCADE trial is evaluating SGN-CD33A in combination with hypomethylating agents, or HMAs, in previously untreated older patients with AML who are not candidates for intensive induction chemotherapy. In addition, we plan to initiate a randomized phase 2 trial during 2017 evaluating SGN-CD33A in combination with standard of care chemotherapy in frontline, younger AML patients. On March 6, 2017, we announced that the FDA had lifted the clinical hold announced on December 27, 2016 on phase 1 trials of SGN-CD33A in AML.  In addition, in collaboration with Astellas Pharma, Inc., or Astellas, we are developing ASG-22ME, or enfortumab vedotin. Based on recent discussions with the FDA, in the second half of 2017, we and Astellas plan to initiate a pivotal phase 2 clinical trial for metastatic urothelial cancer patients who have been previously treated with a checkpoint inhibitor therapy.  Our clinical-stage pipeline also includes six other antibody-drug conjugate, or ADC, programs consisting of SGN-LIV1A, SGN-CD19A, or denintuzumab mafodotin, SGN-CD19B, SGN-CD123A, SGN-CD352A, and ASG-15ME, as well as two immuno-oncology agents, SEA-CD40, which is based on our sugar-engineered antibody, or SEA, technology, and SGN-2FF, which is a novel small molecule. In addition, we have multiple preclinical and research-stage programs that employ our proprietary technologies, including SGN-CD48A.  Table of Contents  We announced on February 10, 2017 that we had entered into a development and license agreement, or the Immunomedics License, with Immunomedics, Inc., or Immunomedics, pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Immunomedics License, we would receive exclusive worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize sacituzumab govitecan, or IMMU-132. IMMU-132 is an ADC targeted to TROP-2, which is expressed in several solid tumors, and is in a pivotal phase 1/2 trial for patients with triple negative breast cancer, or TNBC, and is being investigated in other solid tumors. IMMU-132 received Breakthrough Therapy Designation, or BTD, from the FDA for the treatment of patients with TNBC who have failed prior therapies for metastatic disease. In the event that the transaction closes, under the terms of the Immunomedics License, we would pay Immunomedics an upfront payment of $250 million. In addition, Immunomedics would also be eligible to receive development, regulatory and sales-dependent milestone payments across multiple indications and geographical regions of up to a total maximum of approximately $1.7 billion, as well as royalties which would be based on a percentage of annual net sales of the licensed products, if any, beginning in the teens and rising to twenty percent based on sales volume. In addition, on February 10, 2017, we also entered into an agreement, or the Stock Purchase Agreement, to purchase 3,000,000 shares of common stock of Immunomedics at an aggregate purchase price of $14.7 million, and on February 16, 2017, Immunomedics issued us a warrant to purchase up to 8,655,804 additional shares of common stock of Immunomedics at an exercise price of $4.90 per share which is exercisable until February 10, 2020. On February 13, 2017, we were named a co-defendant in a lawsuit filed by venBio Select Advisors LLC, or venBio, in the Delaware Chancery Court, or the Court, against the members of the board of directors of Immunomedics pursuant to which, among other things, venBio sought to enjoin the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License. On March 9, 2017, the Court issued a temporary restraining order enjoining taking any action in furtherance of the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License. The temporary restraining order will remain in place pending a trial on the merits currently scheduled for June 19, 2017. We cannot predict the outcome of this legal proceeding or the impact it may have on the Immunomedics License or the Stock Purchase Agreement, or the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License. However, it is possible that, in connection with the venBio lawsuit, the Immunomedics License or the Stock Purchase Agreement could be terminated, rescinded or reformed in a way that is disadvantageous to us, including a potential increase in the transaction consideration payable to Immunomedics under the Immunomedics License, or that otherwise adversely affects the anticipated benefits to us of the Immunomedics License. In any event, we may be unable to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License, whether as a result of the venBio lawsuit or otherwise, in which case we will not realize any of the benefits of the licensing of IMMU-132.  We have collaborations for our ADC technology with a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, including AbbVie Biotechnology Ltd., or AbbVie; Bayer Pharma AG, or Bayer; Celldex Therapeutics, Inc., or Celldex; Genentech, Inc., a member of the Roche Group, or Genentech; GlaxoSmithKline LLC, or GSK; Pfizer, Inc., or Pfizer; and PSMA Development Company LLC, a subsidiary of Progenics Pharmaceuticals Inc., or Progenics. In addition, we have entered into a 50/50 co-developmentagreement with Agensys, Inc., an affiliate of Astellas, for the development of ADCs, including ASG-22ME. We also have an option for an ADC co-development agreement with Genmab A/S, or Genmab, and a collaboration with Unum Therapeutics, Inc., or Unum, to develop and commercialize novel antibody-coupled T-cell receptor, or ACTR, therapies incorporating our antibodies for the treatment of cancer.  Our ongoing research, development and commercial activities will require substantial amounts of capital and may not ultimately be successful. Over the next several years, we expect that we will incur substantial expenses, primarily as a result of activities related to the commercialization of ADCETRIS, and the continued development of ADCETRIS and SGN-CD33A. Our other product candidates are in relatively early stages of development; SGN-CD33A, and our other product candidates will require significant further development, financial resources and personnel to pursue and obtain regulatory approval and develop into commercially viable products, if at all. In addition, SGN-CD33A is our only product candidate in late stage clinical development and if we are unable to advance the development of SGN-CD33A, or if we fail to produce positive results in the CASCADE trial, the commercialization prospects for SGN-CD33A, as well as our business and financial prospects, would be materially adversely affected. Our commitment of resources to the continuing development, regulatory and commercialization activities for ADCETRIS, the research, continued development and manufacturing of our product candidates, and the transactions contemplated by the Immunomedics License, if consummated, would likely require us to raise substantial amounts of additional capital and our operating expenses would fluctuate as a result of such activities. In addition, we may incur significant milestone payment obligations to certain of our licensors as our product candidates progress through clinical trials towards potential commercialization.  We recognize revenue from ADCETRIS product sales in the United States and Canada. Our future ADCETRIS product sales are difficult to accurately predict from period to period. In this regard, our product sales have varied, and may continue to vary, significantly from period to period and may be affected by a variety of factors. Such factors include the incidence rate of new patients in ADCETRIS' approved indications, customer ordering patterns, the overall level of demand for ADCETRIS, the duration of therapy for patients receiving ADCETRIS, and the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for ADCETRIS is available from government and other third-party payers. Obtaining and maintaining appropriate coverage and reimbursement for ADCETRIS is increasingly challenging due to, among other things, the attention being paid to healthcare cost containment and other austerity measures in the U.S. and worldwide, as well as increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to pharmaceutical drug pricing practices. We anticipate that healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and an additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for ADCETRIS. We also anticipate that Congress, state legislatures, and third-party payors may continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems and may in the future propose and adopt legislation or policy changes or implementations effecting additional fundamental changes in the healthcare delivery system,  Table of Contents  any of which could negatively affect our revenue or sales of ADCETRIS (or any future approved products). We also believe that the level of our current ADCETRIS sales in the United States has been attributable to the incidence flow of patients eligible for treatment with ADCETRIS, which can vary significantly from period to period. Moreover, we believe that the incidence rate in ADCETRIS' approved indications is relatively low, particularly when compared to many other oncology indications. For these and other reasons, we expect that our ability to accelerate ADCETRIS sales growth, if at all, will depend primarily on our ability to continue to expand ADCETRIS' labeled indications of use, particularly with respect to the frontline Hodgkin lymphoma and frontline MTCL indications. Our efforts to continue to expand ADCETRIS' labeled indications of use will continue to require additional time and investment in clinical trials to complete and may not be successful. Our ability to successfully commercialize ADCETRIS and to continue to expand its labeled indications of use are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those discussed in Part II, Item 1A of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. In particular, negative or inconclusive results in our ECHELON-1 and ECHELON-2 trials would negatively impact, or preclude altogether, our ability to obtain regulatory approval in the frontline Hodgkin lymphoma and frontline MTCL indications, respectively, either of which could limit our sales of, and the commercial potential of, ADCETRIS. In addition, although we reported in August 2016 that the ALCANZA trial evaluating ADCETRIS in patients with relapsed CTCL met its primary endpoint demonstrating a statistically significant improvement in the rate of objective response lasting at least four months and we plan to submit an sBLA to the FDA to seek approval for a new indication in CD30-expressing relapsed CTCL, there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept our planned sBLA for filing or that we will ultimately obtain approval of our planned sBLA in a timely manner or at all. Our failure to obtain regulatory approval and commercialize ADCETRIS in the ALCANZA treatment setting would also limit our sales of, and the commercial potential of, ADCETRIS. We also expect that amounts earned from our collaboration agreements, including royalties, will continue to be an important source of our revenues and cash flows. These revenues will be impacted by future development funding and the achievement of development, clinical and commercial success by our collaborators under our existing collaboration and license agreements, including our ADCETRIS collaboration with Takeda, as well as by entering into potential new collaboration and license agreements. Our results of operations may vary substantially from year to year and from quarter to quarter and, as a result, we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and should not be relied upon as being indicative of our future performance.  Financial summary  For the three months ended March 31, 2017, total revenues decreased to $109.1 million, compared to $111.2 million for the same period in 2016. This decrease was driven primarily by royalty revenues, which included a one-time $20.0 million milestone payment in 2016, offset by an increase in ADCETRIS net product sales. Net product sales of ADCETRIS were $70.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to $58.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, total costs and expenses increased to $168.4 million, compared to $132.2 million for the same period in 2016. This primarily reflects increased investment in ASG-22ME and SGN-CD33A, as well as investment in our growing pipeline of pre-clinical and clinical-stage programs. As of March 31, 2017, we had $536.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and short- and long-term investments, and $603.4 million in total stockholders' equity.  Table of Contents  Results of operations  Three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016  Net product sales  We sell ADCETRIS in the U.S. and Canada. Our net product sales were as follows ($ in thousands):   Three months ended March 31, 2017 2016 % Change Net product sales $ 70,321 $ 58,648 20 %  The increase in net product sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017 over the comparable period in 2016 primarily resulted from an increase in sales volume in the 2017 period, and to a lesser extent, from the effect of price increases instituted since the 2016 period. The increase in sales volume in 2017 was primarily driven by increased use of ADCETRIS across multiple lines of therapy in Hodgkin lymphoma and for the treatment of other CD30-expressing malignancies.  We expect continued growth in ADCETRIS sales in 2017 as compared to 2016. Our ability to accelerate the rate of ADCETRIS sales growth in future periods, if at all, will be primarily dependent on our ability to continue to expand ADCETRIS' labeled indications of use. Our efforts to expand ADCETRIS' labeled indications of use will continue to require additional time and investment in clinical trials to complete and may not be successful.  We sell ADCETRIS through a limited number of pharmaceutical distributors. Customers order ADCETRIS through these distributors and we typically ship product directly to the customer. We record product sales when title and risk of loss pass, which generally occurs upon delivery of the product to the customer. Product sales are recorded net of estimated government-mandated rebates and chargebacks, distribution fees, estimated product returns and other deductions. These are generally referred to as gross-to-net deductions. Accruals are established for these deductions and actual amounts incurred are offset against applicable accruals. We reflect these accruals as either a reduction in the related account receivable from the distributor, or as an accrued liability depending on the nature of the sales deduction. Sales deductions are based on our estimates that consider payer mix in target markets and our experience to date. These estimates involve a substantial degree of judgment.  Government-mandated rebates and chargebacks: We have entered into a Medicaid Drug Rebate Agreement with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. This agreement provides for a rebate to participating states based on covered purchases of ADCETRIS. Medicaid rebates are invoiced to us by the various state Medicaid programs. We estimate Medicaid rebates based on a variety of factors, including our experience to date. We also have completed our Federal Supply Schedule, or FSS, agreement under which certain U.S. government purchasers receive a discount on eligible purchases of ADCETRIS. We have entered into a Pharmaceutical Pricing Agreement with the Secretary of Health and Human Services which enables certain entities that qualify for government pricing under the Public Health Services Act, or PHS, to receive discounts on their qualified purchases of ADCETRIS. Under these agreements, distributors process a chargeback to us for the difference between wholesale acquisition cost and the applicable discounted price. As a result of our direct-ship distribution model, we can identify the entities purchasing ADCETRIS and this information enables us to estimate expected chargebacks for FSS and PHS purchases based on each entity's eligibility for the FSS and PHS programs. We also review actual rebate and chargeback information to further refine these estimates.  Distribution fees, product returns and other deductions: Our distributors charge a volume-based fee for distribution services that they perform for us. We allow for the return of product that is within 30 days of its expiration date or that is damaged. We estimate product returns based on our experience to date. In addition, we consider our direct-ship distribution model, our belief that product is not typically held in the distribution channel, and the expected rapid use of the product by healthcare providers. We provide financial assistance to qualifying patients that are underinsured or cannot cover the cost of commercial coinsurance amounts through SeaGen Secure. SeaGen Secure is available to patients in the U.S. and its territories who meet various financial and treatment need criteria. Estimated contributions for commercial coinsurance under SeaGen Secure are deducted from gross sales and are based on an analysis of expected plan utilization. These estimates are adjusted as necessary to reflect our actual experience.  Table of Contents  Gross-to-netdeductions, net of related payments and credits, are summarized as follows (in thousands):   Distribution fees, Rebates and product returns chargebacks and other Total Balance as of December 31, 2016 $ 9,500 $ 3,198 $ 12,698 Provision related to current period sales 22,389 1,759 24,148 Adjustment for prior period sales (146 ) (92 ) (238 ) Payments/credits for current period sales (17,203 ) (406 ) (17,609 ) Payments/credits for prior period sales (6,258 ) (1,217 ) (7,475 ) Balance as of March 31, 2017 $ 8,282 $ 3,242 $ 11,524  Mandatory government discounts are the most significant component of our total gross to net deductions and the discount percentage has been increasing. These discount percentages increased during the three months ended March 31, 2017 over the comparable period in 2016 as a result of price increases we instituted that exceeded the rate of inflation, and to a lesser extent, as a result of an increase in sales eligible for government mandated rebates or chargebacks. Generally, the change in government prices is limited to the rate of inflation. We expect future gross-to-net deductions to fluctuate based on the volume of purchases eligible for government mandated discounts and rebates, as well as changes in the discount percentage which is impacted by potential future price increases, the rate of inflation, and other factors.  We implemented a price increase at the beginning of 2017. As a result of this price increase and a continued increase in the percentage of our gross sales that are eligible for government mandated rebates and chargebacks, we expect gross-to-net deductions to increase in 2017. In recent months there has been extensive discussion in the United States about expanding government discount programs, including allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices, and pressure on pharmaceutical drug pricing is expected to increase. If government discounted programs are expanded or discounts increased as a result of changes in regulations in the United States, our gross to net deductions will increase and our net sales will be negatively impacted.  Collaboration and license agreement revenues  Our proprietary ADC technologies are the basis of our ADC collaborations that we have entered into in the ordinary course of business with a number of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. Under these ADC collaboration agreements, we grant our collaborators research and commercial licenses to our technology and typically provide technology transfer services, technical advice, supplies and services for a period of time.  If there are continuing performance obligations, we use a time-based proportional performance model to recognize revenue over our performance period for the related agreement. Collaboration and license agreements are evaluated to determine whether the multiple elements and associated deliverables can be considered separate units of accounting. To date, the pre-commercial deliverables under our collaboration and license agreements have not qualified as separate units of accounting. The assessment of multiple element arrangements requires judgment in order to determine the appropriate point in time, or period of time, that revenue should be recognized. We believe that the development period in each agreement is a reasonable estimate of the performance obligation period of such agreement. Accordingly, all amounts received or due, including any upfront payments, maintenance fees, development and regulatory milestone payments and reimbursement payments, are recognized as revenue over the performance obligation periods of each agreement. These performance obligation periods typically range from one to three years. The agreements with Takeda and Genentech have performance obligation periods of ten and seventeen years, respectively. All of the remaining performance obligation periods for our active collaborations are currently expected to be completed in three years or less. When no performance obligations are required of us, or following the completion of the performance obligation period, such amounts are recognized as revenue when collectibility is reasonably assured. Generally, all amounts received or due other than sales-based milestones and royalties are classified as collaboration and license agreement revenues as they are earned. Sales-based milestones and royalties are recognized as royalty revenue as they are reported to us.  Our collaboration and license agreements include contractual milestones. Generally, the milestone events contained in our collaboration and license agreements coincide with the progression of the collaborators' product candidates from development to regulatory approval and then to commercialization.  Table of Contents  Development milestones in our collaborations may include the following types of events:   Designation of a product candidate or initiation of pre-clinical studies. Our collaborators must undertake significant pre-clinicalresearch and studies to make a determination of the suitability of a product candidate and the time from those studies or designation to initiation of a clinical trial may take several years.   Initiation of a phase 1 clinical trial. Generally, phase 1 clinical trials . . .  May 01, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

Seattle Genetics's stock tumbles 12% premarket after discontinuing trial of leukemia treatment

Seattle Genetics suspends trial of leukemia treatment after data showed higher rate of death
Seattle Genetics Inc.  said Monday that it is discontinuing the Phase 3 clinical trial of its acute myeloid leukemia treatment, SGN-CD33A, after data indicated a higher rate of deaths, including fatal infections. The company said it will suspend patient enrollment and treatment, and will closely review the data and consult with the Food and Drug Administration to determine future plans. "This is a disappointing and unexpected result for the CASCADE trial. Patient safety is our highest priority, and we will closely review the data and evaluate next steps," said Chief Executive Clay Siegall. The stock, which is still inactive in premarket trade, has rallied 22% year to date through Friday, while the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  has climbed 10% and the S&P 500  has gained 8.7%.

Seattle Genetics's stock tumbles 12% premarket after discontinuing trial of leukemia treatment

Seattle Genetics suspends trial of leukemia treatment after data showed higher rate of death
Seattle Genetics Inc.  said Monday that it is discontinuing the Phase 3 clinical trial of its acute myeloid leukemia treatment, SGN-CD33A, after data indicated a higher rate of deaths, including fatal infections. The company said it will suspend patient enrollment and treatment, and will closely review the data and consult with the Food and Drug Administration to determine future plans. "This is a disappointing and unexpected result for the CASCADE trial. Patient safety is our highest priority, and we will closely review the data and evaluate next steps," said Chief Executive Clay Siegall. The stock, which is still inactive in premarket trade, has rallied 22% year to date through Friday, while the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF  has climbed 10% and the S&P 500  has gained 8.7%.
