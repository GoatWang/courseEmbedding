History[edit]
The company was founded in 1949 in Dundee, New York, by Cornell University business student Arthur S. Wolcott. In the 1950s, Seneca contracted with Minute Maid to co-pack the first frozen grape juice in the nation. Apple processing, specialty syrups, and maraschino cherries were added to the product line. The development of private label, bulk, industrial and co–pack segments also took place during this time. Fruit processing remained the primary focus for the next several decades.
During the 1960s, the company expanded with new plants and products, including the nation's first frozen apple juice concentrate, under the Seneca brand. The corporate name was changed from Seneca Grape Juice Company to Seneca Foods Corporation. During this time frame, the Prosser, Washington plant was opened for the production of applesauce and fruit juices, and the company added brokers and expanded distribution. Seneca stock began trading in the over-the-counter market, and Vitamin C enriched apple juice was introduced – a first in the industry.
The company grew in the 1970s through acquisitions of companies in the food distribution, canned vegetable, glass, paint and textile businesses. Through one of these acquisitions, Julius G. Kayser joined Seneca and played a key role in the company's growth until his death in 1988. The corporate name was changed to S.S. Pierce Company, and production of metal cans began.
During the 1980s, the corporate name changed back to Seneca Foods Corporation, and the company consolidated most of its non-food operations and focused on its fruit and vegetable lines. The company produced the first natural frozen grape juice and expanded the juice line into white grape, cranberry, and cranberry blends. The company entered the private label retail and food service vegetable business in the Midwest, and began producing IQF frozen vegetables for the food service and industrial markets.
In the 1990s, through further acquisitions and internal growth, Seneca became the world's largest processor of canned vegetables. The company acquired six plants from Pillsbury and entered into an alliance with them to manufacture products under the Green Giant label. At the end of the decade, the company sold its juice and applesauce operations and raised capital with a shareholder rights offering. It expanded to global markets, and purchased an apple chip business. Seneca Flight Operations also became the fixed based operator at the Penn Yan, New York, Airport, and a hangar complex was constructed.

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1949 in Dundee, New York, by Cornell University business student Arthur S. Wolcott. In the 1950s, Seneca contracted with Minute Maid to co-pack the first frozen grape juice in the nation. Apple processing, specialty syrups, and maraschino cherries were added to the product line. The development of private label, bulk, industrial and co–pack segments also took place during this time. Fruit processing remained the primary focus for the next several decades.
During the 1960s, the company expanded with new plants and products, including the nation's first frozen apple juice concentrate, under the Seneca brand. The corporate name was changed from Seneca Grape Juice Company to Seneca Foods Corporation. During this time frame, the Prosser, Washington plant was opened for the production of applesauce and fruit juices, and the company added brokers and expanded distribution. Seneca stock began trading in the over-the-counter market, and Vitamin C enriched apple juice was introduced – a first in the industry.
The company grew in the 1970s through acquisitions of companies in the food distribution, canned vegetable, glass, paint and textile businesses. Through one of these acquisitions, Julius G. Kayser joined Seneca and played a key role in the company's growth until his death in 1988. The corporate name was changed to S.S. Pierce Company, and production of metal cans began.
During the 1980s, the corporate name changed back to Seneca Foods Corporation, and the company consolidated most of its non-food operations and focused on its fruit and vegetable lines. The company produced the first natural frozen grape juice and expanded the juice line into white grape, cranberry, and cranberry blends. The company entered the private label retail and food service vegetable business in the Midwest, and began producing IQF frozen vegetables for the food service and industrial markets.
In the 1990s, through further acquisitions and internal growth, Seneca became the world's largest processor of canned vegetables. The company acquired six plants from Pillsbury and entered into an alliance with them to manufacture products under the Green Giant label. At the end of the decade, the company sold its juice and applesauce operations and raised capital with a shareholder rights offering. It expanded to global markets, and purchased an apple chip business. Seneca Flight Operations also became the fixed based operator at the Penn Yan, New York, Airport, and a hangar complex was constructed.

Seneca Foods Corporation Reports Unaudited Consolidated Earnings Results for the Fourth Quarter and Full Year Ended March 31, 2017
May 25 17
Seneca Foods Corporation reported unaudited consolidated earnings results for the fourth quarter and full year ended March 31, 2017. For the quarter, the company reported, net sales of $266,115,000, operating income of $2,432,000, earnings before income taxes of negative $453,000, earnings attributable to common stock of negative $1,641,000, compared to net sales of $303,702,000, operating income of $22,108,000, earnings before income taxes of $19,920,000, earnings attributable to common stock of $13,712,000, for the same period a year ago. Diluted loss per share was $0.17 against diluted earnings per share was $1.38 a year ago. 



For the year, the company reported, net sales of $1,245,681,000, operating income of $29,121,000, earnings before income taxes of $20,027,000, earnings attributable to common stock of $12,475,000, compared to net sales of $1,275,360,000, operating income of $88,549,000, earnings before income taxes of $80,457,000, earnings attributable to common stock of $53,891,000, for the same period a year ago.

The decrease in sales attributed to unfavorable sales mix and lower selling price variance of $86.9 million partially offset by favorable sales volume variance of $57.2 million. A significant portion of the net earnings comparative decline was attributable to a non-recurring gain of $24.3 million in the prior year.


Seneca Foods Corporation Reports Unaudited Earning Results for the Third Quarter and Nine Months Ended December 31, 2016
Jan 25 17
Seneca Foods Corporation reported unaudited earnings results for the third quarter and nine months ended December 31, 2016.

Net sales for the third quarter ended December 31, 2016 decreased from the third quarter ended December 26, 2015 by 14.5%, or $62.5 million to $369.7 million. The decrease is attributable to a sales volume decrease of $48.5 million and an unfavorable sales mix and lower selling prices of $14.0 million.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Seneca Foods Corporation 
Seneca Foods Corporation is a company known for producing and distributing low cost food products. The company is headquartered in New York, USA.
History
Seneca Foods Co. was started by Arthur Wolcott in 1949. A year after its foundation, Seneca Foods made a contract with the company Minute Maid in order to become a co-packer of its frozen juices within the country. Soon after, Seneca began bulk and industrial co-packing, as well as private label goods production. In the succeeding years, the company focused on fruit processing.
The 1960s was an eventful decade for the company. Seneca continued to grow and expand with the addition of several new products and processing facilities. It was also in this decade that the company’s name became Seneca Foods Corporation. Seneca Foods also introduced the Seneca® brand when it launched its frozen apple juice concentrate. The company opened its Prosser, Washington facility which was created for the purpose of producing applesauce and fruit juices. Seneca®’s first advertisement of frozen juice concentrates was also shown on national television in the same decade. The company’s apple juice, which was enriched with vitamin C, was introduced to the market.
During the 1970s, Seneca Foods was able to complete a number of acquisitions, contributing largely to its rapid diversification and growth. The company was able to acquire businesses from industries like food distribution, glass, textile, canned vegetables and paints. During this decade, the name of Seneca Foods’ was changed to S.S. Pierce Co. when it started to produce metal cans.
In the 1980s, the company’s name was switched again to Seneca Foods Corp. Afterwards, it combined a majority of its non-food businesses and decided to focus on fruit line and vegetables. In the same decade, the company expanded its product line by adding its cranberry blends, white grape and cranberry juices.
The 1990s was a decade of continued acquisitions for the company, and Seneca Foods became largest canned vegetables processing company in the world.
Currently, Seneca Foods is still a leader in the industry of processed vegetables and fruits. Among the company’s products are bottled juice, snack chips, canned produce and frozen fruit products.
