How the BuildZoom Score works

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Texas:













Does Mc Kee Chris D carry a valid contracting license?



Only certain types of specialty contractors (e.g. HVAC, electrical) need to be licensed in Texas. There are no licensing requirements when it comes to hiring for a construction or major remodeling project.
Mc Kee Chris D currently holds license 125290 (Electrician, Me Master Electrician), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Texas?



The Texas Department of Licensing and Regulation (TDLR) regulates HVAC and electrical contractors. You should verify their license status on the TDLR Website before hiring. General contractors and home builders are not licensed so you should do additional research before hiring one.











Your liability risk when hiring Mc Kee Chris D



Although it isn't a regulatory requirement, you can ask your general contractor to provide evidence of workers' compensation and general liability insurance prior to hiring them. 











Financial recourse when hiring Mc Kee Chris D



The Texas Department of Licensing Regulation does not require general contractors to carry a surety bond nor is there a state recovery fund.











What else should I know before hiring Mc Kee Chris D



There is no financial or criminal background check performed on general contractors by the TDLR. The State's Department of Public Safety does maintain a publicly accessible database so you can run your own background check prior to hiring. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



The information on BuildZoom is made available as a public service and should not be considered advertising. We collect client feedback and verify contractors' permitted history with dozens of local building departments in Texas, which saves you time and helps minimize your risk when hiring. 











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



The Texas Attorney General's office recommends getting several bids before hiring a contractor. Do not automatically accept the lowest bid - an abnormally low bid may indicate the contractor made a mistake and is not including the same work quoted by their competitors. We've made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).

for any job, commercial or residential.

Christopher L. McKee
Attorney

Christopher McKee has focused on patent litigation, counseling and prosecution throughout his career. His concentration is in the mechanical and electrical/computer related arts.
Mr. McKee has extensive experience in handling litigation-related patent reexaminations, as well as new post-grant proceedings available under the America Invents Act. Since enactment of the AIA, his practice has been largely devoted to handling of inter partes review (IPR) proceedings before the USPTO’s Patent Trial and Appeal Board. He served as lead counsel on behalf of the patent owner in two of the earliest filed IPRs. One of those (IPR 2012-00041) was the first to conclude in denial of the IPR petition in its entirety. The other (IPR 2012-00042) was the first IPR to result in a final written decision upholding the bulk of the patent claims in the trial.
The AIA review proceedings and reexaminations he has handled have involved a variety of art areas, including electronic design automation (EDA), computer networking/digital data transmission and dynamic system control.
In addition, Mr. McKee has substantial experience in patent litigation and licensing matters, and he has prepared and successfully prosecuted scores of patent applications, in numerous technologies. These include EDA, integrated circuit fabrication, computer (hardware and software), telecommunications, medical device and machine tool technologies, and consumer appliances.
Mr. McKee began his career in intellectual property law with the USPTO, where he served as a patent examiner from 1984-86. There, he examined patent applications in a variety of arts, including metal founding and metal fusion bonding. Mr. McKee’s early experience as a patent examiner has given him a particular sensitivity to examiner concerns, enabling him to negotiate cases to allowance with great effectiveness.
Mr. McKee serves as an adjunct law professor at the Georgetown University Law Center, teaching a class on Intellectual Property Litigation, Pretrial Skills. He previously served as a faculty member for Patent Resources Group’s bi-annual patent bar review course, and as a steering committee member of the Bar Association of the District of Columbia’s Patent, Trademark and Copyright Section. Mr. McKee chaired the firm’s New Attorney Education program from 2003 – 2009, and remains active as a presenter in that program.
Mr. McKee earned his Bachelor of Science in Industrial Engineering from Iowa State University in 1983, and his Juris Doctor from the National Law Center of George Washington University in 1988. He is admitted to the bars of Virginia and the District of Columbia, and to practice before the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and the Supreme Court of the United States.
Mr. McKee practices in the Washington, D.C. office of Banner & Witcoff, Ltd.
