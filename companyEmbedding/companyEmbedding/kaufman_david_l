I researched surgeons for HOURS and DAYS. Anywhere from the Sacramento area, to San Francisco, all the way to Salt Lake City. I interviewed and met with several of them in fact. I landed on Dr. Kauffman in Folsom CA because he was so humble (well, as humble as any plastic surgeon can be haha).....and I LOVED the way his belly buttons turned out. I also loved that his used LMA anesthesia (on my review for more info on that). I woke up with no nausea whatsoever.

Another thing that I ABSOLUTELY loved, Loved loved loved is that I was never alone with him. Not in one meeting, initial consultation, follow up, etc....I was never alone in a room with him. He always had a female staff present. Probably for his sake and liability more than mine, but I so appreciated that extra step and caution. And it was probably prompted because his wife works there with him too and I'm sure she doesn't want anything going on privately lol. I mean, you've got a man seeing you naked and touching you....it's just a wise to have another person present. In my other consultations with other surgeons, that was not the case. So final outcome/work aside.....he has my respect for that alone.

I really would recommend my surgeon, and if fact already have to others who have already booked surgeries with him. It all went really great, and he has my respect, which I don't give out freely. I think he does fantastic work and I think he did fantastic work on me.

I interviewed 6 doctors before deciding to engage Dr. Kaufman. I am only one week out of a complete facelift/brow/eyes and am amazed at how well the entire process has gone. Very little trauma. I know there is still a lot of swelling but so far so good. What gave me the most confidence in Dr. Kaufman, other than his credentials, was his countenance and humility which was seen demonstrated by his entire staff. Excellent experience.

I found Dr. Kaufman from a referral from a friend.  He and his staff are awesome.  They listened to what I wanted and delivered exactly that.  I just wanted to have what I had before kids... I didn't want to be "that" mom.  I had my breast procedure in January and just completed my final follow up visit.  The entire experience was the best.   I chose silicone implants, below the muscle.  Thrilled!!!

I saw three board-certified plastic surgeons and chose Dr. Kaufman. He took his time to show me why he should be my surgeon. He showed me two albums filled with the results of just facelifts. He showed the differences of choosing or not choosing certain procedures.  The results are hard to argue with.

I met with Dr. Kaufman and his staff after seeing his results on another patient. I was impressed with the quality of his work. They were very good about answering all of my questions and were accomodating to my needs as I was traveling from 2 hours away for visits. I am so grateful to Dr. Kaufman and his staff, it truly was a positive, life changing experience for me.

Bypassing a Lift: When Breast Implants Should Do the Trick


            Worldwide, breast augmentation continues to be the most
popular cosmetic procedure for women of all ages, and finding the perfect look
for you is what makes the investment worthwhile. Some women choose to bring
their breasts to a more youthful position with a breast lift while others want
to grow a cup size or two by getting breast augmentation. Many others pair the
procedures to achieve the results they’re looking for, increasing breast size
and improving breast position at the same...
        



4 Little Places Liposuction Can Make a Big Difference


            Although some non-invasive body contouring procedures are
becoming more popular, liposuction still carries some advantages over CoolSculpting® and similar
nonsurgical alternatives. This is primarily because the effectiveness of lipo
is not limited to the stomach, hips and thighs but can produce beautiful, dramatic
results in smaller (and sometimes surprising) places elsewhere on the body.

When excess fat deposits settle under the chin, the dreaded

    About  

David Kaufman, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, Decision Sciences at the University of Michigan-Dearborn College of Business.
Professor Kaufman teaches courses in Decision Sciences.  His expertise lies in decision-making under conditions of uncertainty, optimization, and risk management.
Prior to joining the College of Business, Dr. Kaufman was a lecturer at the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor) where he taught courses in operations research, corporate finance, and financial engineering.  His previous teaching experience also includes a course in stochastic processes at Cornell University (Ithaca).
Dr. Kaufman’s previous industry experience includes product development for RiskMetrics Group, a financial risk management company with a client base that included 69 of the 100 largest investment managers, 42 of the 50 largest mutual fund companies, 41 of the 50 largest hedge funds, 17 of the top 30 OECD central banks, and the ten largest global investment banks.
Dr. Kaufman's research interests are in stochastic processes and decision models for systems where variability and uncertainty play an important role in design, analysis, and management.  His work often considers the optimization of sequential decisions modeled as Markov decision processes.  Applications include production and manufacturing, the dynamic control of queueing systems, and medical decision-making.
Professor Kaufman holds M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Industrial and Operations Engineering from the University of Michigan and a Bachelor of Arts degree in mathematics and physics from Bethel College (in Kansas).
