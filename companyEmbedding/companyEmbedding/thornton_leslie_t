Holding a top-secret clearance, Ms. Thornton was also her agency’s representative for the Continuity of Operations of Government program. 
Ms. Thornton is often a requested speaker on directorship, general counsel practice, diversity and cybersecurity issues, and has been widely published in newspapers and other outlets including the Boston Globe, Wall Street Journal, and Legal Times/National Law Journal.

Revolving Door
Although the influence powerhouses that line
	    Washington's K Street are just a few miles from the U.S. Capitol building, the
	    most direct path between the two doesn't necessarily involve public
	    transportation. Instead, it's through a door—a revolving door that shuffles
	    former federal employees into jobs as lobbyists, consultants and strategists
	    just as the door pulls former hired guns into government careers.

Dina PowellDeputy National Security Advisor
On March 15, President Trump elevated Dina Powell to be his deputy national security adviser, after she'd spent just over two months as assistant to the president and senior counselor for economic initiatives. This kind of promotion is old hat for Powell, who has ascended rapidly throughout her career in both policy and finance.Prior to her work in the Trump administration, Powell was at Goldman Sachs for nine years in various roles, including as president of the Goldman Sachs Foundation -- which, with assets of  more than $500 million, is one of the world's largest corporate charities. She is one of five Goldman alums in the administration, along with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn. However, unlike her colleagues Mnuchin and Cohn, Powell's appointment is a return engagement. 
 Show More Information About Our Featured Revolver

		        She previously worked out of 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., and her portfolio includes deep experience in GOP politics. As a fresh University of Texas graduate, Powell went to work in the office of Dick Armey (R-Texas) in 1995, his first year as House Majority Leader. She then became the director of congressional affairs at the Republican National Committee.In 2003, the Egyptian-born Arabic speaker took her first White House job, as assistant in the personnel office under President Bush, the youngest person ever to hold the job. Two years later, she moved to the State Department, as an assistant secretary for educational and cultural affairs. Now, Powell finds herself back in the White House with her most prominent and powerful position yet, dealing with issues of national security.Powell and Ivanka Trump are expected to work on women's economic issues together. She also sits on a number of boards, including those of the Council on Foreign Relations and the World Economic Forum, a gathering best known for its annual retreat in Davos, Switzerland.Updated March 30, 2017 by Ben Berliner

Influence & Lobbying
The primary goal of much of the money that flows through U.S. politics is this: Influence. 
	    Corporations and industry groups, labor unions, single-issue organizations - together, they 
	    spend billions of dollars each year to gain access to decision-makers in government, all in 
	    an attempt to influence their thinking.

Use these resources in OpenSecrets.org's Influence & Lobbying section, which are also 
    found at the left, to learn more about Washington's influence industry and its most powerful players. 
Interest Groups
Just about any interest group you can think of has a presence in Washington-and spends 
    money to maintain that presence. Here we've totaled all the campaign contributions over the
	years from more than 100 interest groups, so that you can see patterns that might 
    have affected policies with an impact on your life. We also track how much interest groups 
    have been spending on lobbying, which is the other side of the influence coin.
Lobbying
Professional advocates make big bucks to lobby members of Congress and government 
    officials on the issues their clients care about. But the money that industries, companies, 
    unions and issue groups spend on lobbying is often just a drop in the bucket compared to 
    what they can reap in return if their lobbyists are successful. Here you can see who 
    spends what on federal lobbying and where they focus their resources. 
Revolving Door
You've heard it before - it's not what you know, it's who you know. In our nation's capital, 
    success comes with a combination of knowledge and personal connections. This database tracks 
    thousands of individuals who've spun through Washington's "revolving door", employing professional 
    relationships and know-how accumulated through public service to advance the goals of their private 
    employers.
PACs
In a campaign finance system where all the money originates from individuals, political action 
	committees, or PACs, control the most "corporate" of money. Controlled by companies, trade 
	associations, unions, issue groups and even politicians (a subset called "leadership PACs"), these 
	committees pool contributions from individuals and distribute them to candidates, political parties 
	and other PACs. PACs can also spend money independently on political activities, including advertising 
	and other efforts to support or oppose candidates in an election.
Organizations
Influence in Washington is created from many ingredients. Here we give you at-a-glance profiles of the 
	political donations, outside spending and lobbying expenditures of more than 20,000 labor unions, corporations 
	and trade groups, as well as the number of lawmakers who have personally invested in them. More detailed 
	profiles are available for the 150 or so biggest all-time contributors since 1989.
527s
For the longest time, campaign ads were almost exclusively produced by candidates and political 
    parties, but in recent years outside issue groups have been getting in on the action. They often 
    operate as so-called 527 committees (taking their name from the relevant section of the IRS tax 
    code). Sometimes mysteriously named, these advocacy groups frequently have ties to labor, 
    big business and super-wealthy individuals. Unlike political committees, they can accept 
    unlimited contributions from just about anyone, and they deploy that money in various ways to 
    influence elections. Keep an eye on these shadowy groups here.

Leslie T. Thornton Named New Vice President And General Counsel Of WGL Holdings, Inc. And Washington Gas






Business Wire




Nov 17, 2011 5:15 PM EST













 


















































  WGL Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: WGL) is pleased to announce that it has hired Leslie Thornton as Vice President and General Counsel. She will be responsible for directing the legal work of the company and supervising the company's attorney staff and the office of the corporate secretary. Ms. Thornton will join the company on Nov. 28, 2011, as Counsel to the Chairman, before assuming her position as Vice President and General Counsel on Jan. 1, 2012.  “We are fortunate and proud to have Leslie joining our leadership team,” said WGL Holdings Chairman and CEO Terry D. McCallister. “She has built a tremendously diverse career as a civil and criminal litigator, a senior executive and a corporate director. Leslie is highly regarded in the legal community for her sound judgment, strategic thinking, leadership capability and collaborative style.”  Ms. Thornton served as Chief of Staff to the Secretary of Education and as a White House advisor during the Clinton administration. In her most recent position before joining WGL Holdings and Washington Gas, she was a partner at Dickstein Shapiro, LLP, conducting and managing sensitive internal corporate, federal government and state attorney general investigations. She also advised her clients in high-level matters before the Executive Branch and the White House. "Leslie will be missed by many at our Firm, to be sure,” said Dickstein Chairman Michael E Nannes. “However, we are excited for Leslie and the opportunity this presents for her to draw upon her broad experiences in the legal, public policy, strategy, and leadership arenas."  Ms. Thornton is a prominent member of the Washington community. A resident for more than 30 years, she serves on the board of a number of non-profit organizations, including the Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Washington. She has founded two organizations in support of the education of disadvantaged youth in the D.C. area. Ms. Thornton has authored numerous articles and is a frequent panelist on a variety of issues, including compliance and diversity. Since 2005, she has also served on the board of the Career Education Corporation as chair of the Compliance Committee and recently was elected Lead Independent Director by her board colleagues.

Senior Vice President
General Counsel and Corporate Secretary

 

 
 
 
 



Leslie T. Thornton is the Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of WGL Holdings, Inc. (“WGL”) and Washington Gas where she is responsible for developing, coordinating, and providing legal advice and counsel to WGL and all its subsidiaries on matters including, but not limited to, litigation, regulatory affairs, business transactions, employment and labor law, employee benefits, executive compensation, ethics, compliance, cyber-threats/cyber-security, mergers and acquisitions, and crisis management, among others.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.
