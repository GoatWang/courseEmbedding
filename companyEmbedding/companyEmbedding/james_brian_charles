Upcoming Public Hearings in Pending Cases

Hearing details (in alphabetical order by defendant name)
Overview
Under the law, victims of Federal crimes such as antitrust violations are entitled to certain rights. These rights include the right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding involving the crime; the right not to be excluded from any such public court proceeding unless the court determines that testimony by the victim would be materially altered if the victim heard other testimony at the proceeding; and the right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court involving release, plea, sentencing, or any parole proceeding.
This page lists named defendants (and products or industries involved) in pending cases prosecuted by the Antitrust Division for which public court proceedings are scheduled and for which the court has approved victim notification through this webpage.
Note: Hearing dates and times are subject to last-minute change. Although every effort has been made to provide current information, before attending a hearing you may wish to phone the court directly to confirm.

&nbspProductsKevin Murphy
Working on shoots and fashion shows, models go through a number of hair and makeup changes in the course of a day. Kevin found that as the day progressed the models’ hair became heavy, dull and lifeless, and there were no styling products on the market that fulfilled his needs as an editorial stylist… so, he created his own, and in answering his own needs as a stylist, he developed products that were easy to use and crossed over to consumers perfectly.

Born from the same philosophy as skincare, KEVIN.MURPHY products are weightlessly designed to deliver performance, strength and longevity.
When searching the world for our ingredients, KEVIN.MURPHY looked for companies that use micro cultivation, organic growing practices, or ecologically sound wild harvesting techniques to ensure the KEVIN.MURPHY range is of the very highest natural quality.
