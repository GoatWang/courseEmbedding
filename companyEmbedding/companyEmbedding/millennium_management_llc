What we do







We employ a global multi-strategy investment approach, opportunistically engaging in a broad array of trading and investing strategies across a wide group of diversified managers. 
Our specialized divisions have built and continually evolve our core infrastructure platform.  This enables our trading teams to independently pursue unique investment strategies within one centrally-driven risk and operational framework.  
Millennium has differentiated itself from other alternative investment management firms through our consistent ability to generate high quality returns for our investors.
Millennium’s unique framework has created what we believe to be a sustainable and scalable organization aligned in partnership with our investors.  Our dedication to our mission has defined Millennium as an industry leader over our 25-year history.





INVESTMENT APPROACH









Our mission is to deliver the alternative investment industry’s highest quality returns to our investors, and to maintain a commitment to our principles of integrity, discipline and excellence.

 







We empower our trading teams to independently focus on the specific opportunities and strategies in which they specialize, subject to our overall risk management, compliance, operational controls, and hedging of aggregate exposures where appropriate.
Our approach to the selection and oversight of trading teams is grounded in a philosophy of consistently seeking to generate incremental, positive returns against a limited amount of risk exposure (i.e., high Sharpe ratio), rather than outsized, but more volatile absolute returns.

 

We prefer trading teams that produce small gains on winning days and smaller losses on losing days. Our goal is to have more winning days than losing ones. We encourage our trading teams to pass on opportunities for outsized gains if they are accompanied by the risk of large losses.
In an effort to ensure that this philosophy is implemented in a consistent, disciplined manner, we calculate and set investment guidelines with each trading team.

 









INVESTMENT STRATEGIES









We follow an investment strategy that is broadly diversified, global in scope and opportunistic with respect to investments. Each trading team pursues specific opportunity sets within a disciplined risk management framework.

 







At any given time, we expect to have trading teams pursuing most of the following broad strategies:

       Relative Value Fundamental Equity
       Statistical Arbitrage / Quantitative Strategies
       Merger Arbitrage / Event Driven
       Fixed Income
       Commodities


 

Millennium emphasizes diversity in asset classes, industry sectors and geographic boundaries and invests in a variety of domestic and international equity and debt securities, currencies, futures, forwards, options and other instruments. 
Senior Management determines the concentration in, and allocation to our investment strategies. The Firm is positioned to selectively add to or reduce its allocation to particular investment strategies on short notice given the opportunity set prevailing from time to time.

 









INSTITUTIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE









We operate an institutional core infrastructure platform that enables our trading teams to pursue their strategies within a rigorous control environment designed to manage risk effectively. Our core infrastructure personnel operate by the Firms’ core values of integrity, discipline and excellence, and take pride in having developed an industry-leading, institutional platform.

 







Over the past 25 years, Millennium has invested significant resources in building our core infrastructure to maintain robust operational controls within a flexible, scalable and efficient framework. Each divisional head has significant industry experience and manages a best-in-class team.

We have more than 2,100 employees working across offices in the United States, Europe and Asia.Over the last 25 years, our mission has remained constant: to deliver the alternative investment industry’s highest quality returns to our investors, and to maintain a commitment to our principles of integrity, discipline and excellence.Millennium allocates capital across a diverse set of strategies involving a variety of predominantly liquid asset classes. The primary focus of our business is on generating high-quality returns by engaging and overseeing a large number of specialized trading teams, each of which pursues specific strategies. Our core infrastructure enables trading teams to pursue their independent strategies by delivering a flexible, scalable and efficient platform within a rigorous control environment.Read moreWe empower our trading teams to independently focus on the specific opportunities and strategies in which they specialize, subject to our overall risk management, compliance, operational controls, and hedging of aggregate exposures where appropriate.Our approach to the selection and oversight of trading teams is grounded in a philosophy of consistently seeking to generate incremental, positive returns against a limited amount of risk exposure (i.e., high Sharpe ratio), rather than outsized, but more volatile absolute returns.We prefer trading teams that produce small gains on winning days and smaller losses on losing days. Our goal is to have more winning days than losing ones. We encourage our trading teams to pass on opportunities for outsized gains if they are accompanied by the risk of large losses.In an effort to ensure that this philosophy is implemented in a consistent, disciplined manner, we calculate and set investment guidelines with each trading team.Read moreWe employ a global multi-strategy investment approach, opportunistically engaging in a broad array of trading and investing strategies across a wide group of diversified managers. Our specialized divisions have built and continually evolve our core infrastructure platform.  This enables our trading teams to independently pursue unique investment strategies within one centrally-driven risk and operational framework.  Millennium has differentiated itself from other alternative investment management firms through our consistent ability to generate high quality returns for our investors.Millennium’s unique framework has created what we believe to be a sustainable and scalable organization aligned in partnership with our investors.  Our dedication to our mission has defined Millennium as an industry leader over our 25-year history.Read moreOur Firm harnesses the entrepreneurial drive of our people, who are critical to the success of the organization.

Early life and education[edit]
Israel "Izzy" Englander was born in 1948 and was raised in a Jewish family in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn.[4] He was raised in a religious home and attended yeshiva.[4] His parents were immigrants from Poland who arrived in the United States in 1947 after being deported to a Soviet labor camp after the war, where Englander's two older sisters were born. His father’s entire family was killed during the Holocaust.[4]
Always interested in the stock market, Englander began trading stocks while in high school. During college, he interned at Oppenheimer & Co. (where his future brother-in-law, Jack Nash, would eventually become president and chairman) and at the New York Stock Exchange. In 1970, he graduated from New York University with a B.S. in finance. His first full-time job was with the Wall Street firm Kaufmann, Alsberg & Co. He later enrolled in New York University's MBA program in the evenings but never completed the degree.[1][4]
Investment career[edit]
Early business career[edit]
At Kaufmann Alsberg, Englander focused on trading convertible securities and options. When the American Stock Exchange began to list options, he purchased a seat on the exchange. In 1977, he formed a floor brokerage house, I.A. Englander & Co.[5] in which he still owns a passive interest.
In 1985, Englander and his partner John Mulheren Jr., started an investment firm called Jamie Securities Co. with a $75 million investment from the Belzberg family of Canada. Mulheren had previously worked as a trader for Ivan Boesky. Boesky was later convicted of insider trading, and agreed to testify against Mulheren in a plea deal to receive a lesser sentence.[4] In February 1988, Mulheren was arrested for carrying a loaded assault rifle.[6] Mulheren was convicted of orchestrating illegal stock trades for Boesky, but the ruling was later overturned. Jamie Securities was dissolved in 1988, due to the negative publicity in the aftermath of Mulheren's situation.[4] Englander was neither charged nor implicated in any way with Mulheren's activities.
Start of his fund[edit]
In 1989, Englander started Millennium Management, LLC with Ronald Shear - whom he knew from his time at the American Stock Exchange - with $35 million[7] in seed money (including $5 million from Englander himself and another $2 million from the Belzberg family). The firm got off to a rough start and Shear left in 1990.[4] Since then, Englander has grown Millennium into a $20-plus billion dollar (under management) enterprise by using investment strategies like statistical arbitrage (quantitative analysis); fundamental long-short pairing; merger arbitrage (taking advantage of price differentials between a buy-out target company's stock price and bid price) and convertible arbitrage (taking advantage of price differentials between a company's stock price and convertible bond or stock warrant price).[4] At any given time, Millennium holds thousands of investment positions and makes over 2 million trades on an average day.[7] At the end of 2013, Millennium had 1500 employees in more than 12 offices around the world.[7]
Personal life[edit]
Englander is married to Caryl (née Schechter) Englander. They have three children.[1][8]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
In 2006, the Englander Foundation, headed by Englander and his wife, donated $20 million to mostly Jewish organizations and schools.[4] Englander serves on the board of Weill Cornell Medical College[9] and the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty.[10]

Early life and education[edit]
Israel "Izzy" Englander was born in 1948 and was raised in a Jewish family in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn.[4] He was raised in a religious home and attended yeshiva.[4] His parents were immigrants from Poland who arrived in the United States in 1947 after being deported to a Soviet labor camp after the war, where Englander's two older sisters were born. His father’s entire family was killed during the Holocaust.[4]
Always interested in the stock market, Englander began trading stocks while in high school. During college, he interned at Oppenheimer & Co. (where his future brother-in-law, Jack Nash, would eventually become president and chairman) and at the New York Stock Exchange. In 1970, he graduated from New York University with a B.S. in finance. His first full-time job was with the Wall Street firm Kaufmann, Alsberg & Co. He later enrolled in New York University's MBA program in the evenings but never completed the degree.[1][4]
Investment career[edit]
Early business career[edit]
At Kaufmann Alsberg, Englander focused on trading convertible securities and options. When the American Stock Exchange began to list options, he purchased a seat on the exchange. In 1977, he formed a floor brokerage house, I.A. Englander & Co.[5] in which he still owns a passive interest.
In 1985, Englander and his partner John Mulheren Jr., started an investment firm called Jamie Securities Co. with a $75 million investment from the Belzberg family of Canada. Mulheren had previously worked as a trader for Ivan Boesky. Boesky was later convicted of insider trading, and agreed to testify against Mulheren in a plea deal to receive a lesser sentence.[4] In February 1988, Mulheren was arrested for carrying a loaded assault rifle.[6] Mulheren was convicted of orchestrating illegal stock trades for Boesky, but the ruling was later overturned. Jamie Securities was dissolved in 1988, due to the negative publicity in the aftermath of Mulheren's situation.[4] Englander was neither charged nor implicated in any way with Mulheren's activities.
Start of his fund[edit]
In 1989, Englander started Millennium Management, LLC with Ronald Shear - whom he knew from his time at the American Stock Exchange - with $35 million[7] in seed money (including $5 million from Englander himself and another $2 million from the Belzberg family). The firm got off to a rough start and Shear left in 1990.[4] Since then, Englander has grown Millennium into a $20-plus billion dollar (under management) enterprise by using investment strategies like statistical arbitrage (quantitative analysis); fundamental long-short pairing; merger arbitrage (taking advantage of price differentials between a buy-out target company's stock price and bid price) and convertible arbitrage (taking advantage of price differentials between a company's stock price and convertible bond or stock warrant price).[4] At any given time, Millennium holds thousands of investment positions and makes over 2 million trades on an average day.[7] At the end of 2013, Millennium had 1500 employees in more than 12 offices around the world.[7]
Personal life[edit]
Englander is married to Caryl (née Schechter) Englander. They have three children.[1][8]
Wealth and philanthropy[edit]
In 2006, the Englander Foundation, headed by Englander and his wife, donated $20 million to mostly Jewish organizations and schools.[4] Englander serves on the board of Weill Cornell Medical College[9] and the Metropolitan Council on Jewish Poverty.[10]

A smart product management hub for retailthat streamlines digital content and data sharing






 





















Our mission
 
We have made it our mission to provide brands and retailers simple and affordable tools that tackle many challenges in digital product management and distribution by:













Solving the practical challenge of organizing, sourcing, and sharing product content.









Giving brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed ecommerce data and analytics
















Take control of your products with Plytix
 









Our Story
 
The idea for Plytix evolved from our time at Google, when we were working with some of the biggest companies in the e-commerce space. At the time, technology allowed tracking user behaviour on individual websites, but we wanted to give brands and retailers access to a whole new level of detailed data, bringing them a better understanding of their products through 3rd party product analytics. 
 
Since then Plytix has evolved into an end-to-end product management eco-system where brands and retailers can organize, analyze, and share product content and performance in a user-friendly and efficient way without breaking the bank. 
 




























Our Team
 
We're a diverse, international team passionate about creating extraordinary client experiences and serious about revolutionizing e-commerce. We are growing rapidly and we're always on the look out for smart, driven people to join our team. 
 
Get a closer look on  LinkedIn and Instagram.
