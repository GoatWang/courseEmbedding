 About Us
Midwest Holding Inc. was founded as a Nebraska holding company by Rick and Travis Meyer in October 2003. Through their efforts, more than $11 million was raised from 4,400 residents of Nebraska for the purpose of building and developing not only a successful holding company, but also to charter a life insurance company to serve residents of the state. Subsequent offerings and acquisitions have brought the Company's shareholder base to more than 11,800.
In September, 2009, Midwest capitalized American Life & Security Corp., the first life insurance company organized in the state of Nebraska in more than 30 years. 
In June, 2010, American Life acquired Capital Reserve Life Insurance Company, for $1.9 million cash.  
In 2011, we acquired Old Reliance Life Insurance Company, an Arizona-domiciled life insurance for $1.6 million in cash and 150,000 shares of common stock.  We simultaneously merged American Life into Old Reliance and renamed the survivor "American Life & Security Corp."  This acquisition expanded the number of states we could market in from 3 to 14.
In July, 2014 we acquired all of the outstanding shares of Great Plains Financial Corp and Security Capital Corp in a share exchange.  We had previously acquired approximately 22% of Great Plains and 60% of Security Capital.  Great Plains was a South Dakota holding company that owned a South Dakota Life insurance company, Great Plains Life Assurance Company. Security Capital was dormant. 
In October, 2015, we acquired First Wyoming Capital Corporation in a share exchange.  We had caused this company to be formed and owned 22% prior to the merger.  FWCC owned a Wyoming Life insurer, First Wyoming Life Insurance Company. 
Also, In October 2015 Rick Meyer, our founder, retired.  Travis Meyer, our cofounder had resigned a year earlier to pursue outside business interests.  Following Mr. Meyer's retirement, Mark A. Oliver, our CEO, was named chairman.  Additionally, several new member were added to the Midwest Board.  
In 2016, we re-domesticated American Life and First Wyoming Life to Nebraska and will be merging First Wyoming Life and Great Plains Life into American Life to streamline operations.  Capital Reserve was sold to a third party in August 2016.
Midwest continues to aggressively pursue its long-term growth strategy of building a large, profitable financial services company. Management has added several key individuals to help guide the company towards the attainment of these objectives. Midwest intends to pursue mergers and acquisitions of other holding or life insurance companies as well as expand the writing of profitable life insurance policies in "Middle America". 
Management realizes that liquidity is key to all shareholders and has worked hard on a strategy to provide liquidity for those individuals who want to buy or sell shares of the Company's common stock.  Currently, the Company's stock is being traded on the OTCQB market.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.

BBB Accreditation





                BBB Accredited Since 03/04/2010
            

                BBB has determined that Midwest Holding, Inc. meets Standards of BBB Accreditation, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            

                BBB accreditation does not mean that the business's products or services have been evaluated or endorsed by BBB, or that BBB has made a determination as to the business's product quality or competency in performing services.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means

Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,

                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
