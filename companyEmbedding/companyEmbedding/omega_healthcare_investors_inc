Dividends


Omega’s dividends are paid quarterly, with historical and recently announced dividends shown in the table below.
In April 2017, Omega increased its quarterly common dividend by $0.01 to $0.63 per share. Omega has now increased its common dividend 19 consecutive quarters.
In 2Q 2015, we paid a dividend in two separate installments of $0.36 (for February and March) paid on April 7, and $0.18 (for April) paid on May 15. This two part payment of our 2Q dividend was a result of our acquisition of Aviv REIT via merger, which closed on April 1, 2015.

Stock Purchase Plan

We are pleased to offer our Dividend Reinvestment and Common Stock Purchase Plan (the “Plan"). Both existing stockholders and interested new investors can participate in the Plan. If you are interested in investing through the Plan or finding out more details, please read the Plan prospectus.
This is neither an offer to sell, nor a solicitation of an offer to buy, any security. Such offer may only be made by means of a prospectus. Please read the Plan prospectus carefully before making any investment.
The Plan includes the following key features:

New investors can make a direct initial investment in shares of our common stock with a minimum amount of $250.
Current stockholders can purchase additional shares of our common stock for amounts ranging from $50 to $10,000 per month. At the option of stockholders, investment purchases can be made at selected amounts electronically through automatic monthly deductions from personal bank accounts. We may permit optional cash investments in excess $10,000 per month, subject to our prior written consent.
Shares issued under the Plan will be newly issued shares and/or shares purchased in the open market or privately negotiated transactions. If we elect to sell newly issued shares, stockholders purchasing via dividend reinvestment may be entitled to a discount, which is currently set at 1%. The discount in effect at any given time, if any, can be obtained by calling us at (866) 996-6342. There is no discount for optional cash purchases.
Stockholders can deposit share certificates with Registrar and Transfer Company, our Plan administrator, for sale keeping at no additional cost.
Stockholders can sell shares credited to their Plan account daily through our Plan administrator.
Stockholders can authorize recurring monthly purchases through the automatic investment of their dividends.

Before making any investment decision with respect to the Plan and the purchase of our common stock, we urge you to fully review the Plan prospectus.
You can enroll in the Plan online at Computershare, or you can request to receive an Enrollment Form using the contact information below. Participation in the Plan is voluntary and you may withdraw from the Plan at any time by giving notice to Computershare in a manner specified in the Plan prospectus.
Any questions regarding the Plan should be directed to Computershare at:

HUNT VALLEY, Md. (AP) _ Omega Healthcare Investors Inc. (OHI) on Wednesday reported a key measure of profitability in its second quarter. The results beat Wall Street expectations.
The Hunt Valley, Maryland-based real estate investment trust said it had funds from operations of $179 million, or 87 cents per share, in the period.
The average estimate of four analysts surveyed by Zacks Investment Research was for funds from operations of 86 cents per share.
Funds from operations is a closely watched measure in the REIT industry. It takes net income and adds back items such as depreciation and amortization.
The company said it had net income of $65.3 million, or 33 cents per share.
The health care real estate investment trust posted revenue of $235.8 million in the period, also exceeding Street forecasts. Three analysts surveyed by Zacks expected $225.9 million.
Omega Healthcare Investors expects full-year funds from operations in the range of $3.42 to $3.44 per share.
The company's shares have climbed 7 percent since the beginning of the year. In the final minutes of trading on Wednesday, shares hit $33.45, a decrease of slightly more than 3 percent in the last 12 months.

Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
