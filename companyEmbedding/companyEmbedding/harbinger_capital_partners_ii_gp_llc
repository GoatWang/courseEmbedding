About Us
Our History


Our History
In 2001, Philip Falcone capitalized on the significant opportunities within the distressed marketplace and became the Chief Investment Officer of Harbinger Capital Partners upon its inception. Through conviction in his ability to identify value in credit/distressed, Mr. Falcone led an investment team focused on opportunities in credit. 
Over the next few years, as the distressed credit market subsided and the broader investment universe became more sophisticated, Harbinger adjusted its strategy accordingly and, as most investment firms focused upon distressed opportunities do, evolved into special situation and event strategies as well. With extensive experience in several different strategies, Harbinger was able to respond to market fluctuations over time with rigor, efficiency and built-in flexibility. As Harbinger reached a critical mass, it was able to engage proactively with companies in order to enhance value. 
Although Harbinger's expansion since its inception has been substantial, the underlying work ethic and conviction to succeed, the principles on which the company was started, continue to define Harbinger Capital Partners today.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

Overview[edit]
Harbinger is a highly diversified multi-strategy hedge fund.[3] It has bet against sub-prime mortgages in the United States and the United Kingdom, including HBOS.[1][4] It is also a major investor in LightSquared, a troubled wireless communications company that filed bankruptcy in 2012, formerly known as SkyTerra Communications Inc.[5] Harbinger's $3.05 billion restructuring plan gives 74 percent of LightSquared to Cerberus Capital Management LP, Fortress Investment Group LLC and JPMorgan Chase & Co., leaving Falcone with 12.5 percent of the company's equity.[6] In March 2015, a judge approved Harbinger Capital's restructuring plan of LightSquared, which pays off lender Charlie Ergen, putting LightSquared in the hands of investors.[7]
In November 2014, Falcone announced his resignation as chief executive and chairman from Harbinger Group HRG, whose second biggest shareholder is Harbinger Capital. Falcone was paid a lump-sum of $40.3 million upon his resignation.[8][9]
In March 2015, the lawsuit accusing Falcone and Harbinger Capital Partners of "misleading investors about the firm's stake in LightSquared Inc." was dismissed.[10]
The firm's hedge funds include the Harbinger Capital Partners Master Fund, the Credit Distressed BlueLine Fund, and Harbinger Capital Partners Special Situations Fund.[11]
According to press accounts the assets under management at Harbinger peaked at $26 Billion in 2008 and had declined to approximately $9 Billion as of 2010 due to sizeable investor redemptions with approximately 40% of that total (approximately $3.5 Billion) concentrated in investments related to building a high-speed wireless network in the United States.[12]
History[edit]
Harbinger was founded in 2001[13] by its Senior Managing Director Philip Falcone and Harbert Management Corporation, a Birmingham, Alabama-based investment company that provided much of the original funding. Harbinger had funds under management of $26.5 billion (£13.4 billion) as of the end of June 2008.[14][15] In 2009, Harbinger acquired the ownership of its funds from Harbert, although Harbert handled administrative functions for Harbinger for a short transitional period. Also in 2009, Harbinger acquired controlling stock of the Zapata Corporation from the Glazer family and changed its name to The Harbinger Group Inc. (NYSE: HRG).[16] The hedge fund is based in New York, New York.[13]
Harbinger has owned large stakes in The New York Times Company, Cleveland-Cliffs, and 28% stock ownership of satellite communications company Inmarsat. The company has also owned stakes in rival satellite operators SkyTerra and Terrestar, and British sugar producer Tate & Lyle.[15]
In 2008, Harbinger Capital was ranked 19th on the Wall Street Journal's "The Hedge Fund 100" list, pulling in 23.85 percent in three-year annualized returns.[17] In 2009, Harbinger Capital was ranked 12th on the Wall Street Journal's "Top 100 Hedge Funds" list, pulling in 30.48 percent in three-year annualized returns.[18]
Harbinger Capital, which owned Russell Hobbs, merged it with Spectrum Brands on June 16, 2010 for $661 million and now controls approximately 64% of the appliance maker, Spectrum.
Top equity holdings[edit]
As of 2015, the top equity holdings of the firm were in the shares of the following companies: Spectrum Brands Inc, Harbinger Group Inc, North American Energy Partners Inc, and EXCO Resources Inc.[2]
SEC settlement[edit]
In August 2013, the firm reached a settlement with the SEC agreeing to pay more than $18 million and admit wrongdoing. As part of the settlement, Harbinger Senior Managing Director Philip Falcone was also barred from the securities industry for at least five years but did not prohibit him from working as an officer or director of a public company.[19] Among the SEC's multiple allegations were that Falcone misused fund assets and diverted fund assets for personal use, that the fund engaged in redemption and other practices that favored certain investors over others and that fund attempted to conduct an improper short squeeze on the bonds of Canadian manufacturing firm, partially in retaliation against a competitor investment firm. Harbinger and Falcone largely admitted to these allegations in the settlement.[20]
July 4, 2014, the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission's Office of the Whistleblower issued a "Final Order" in matter number 2012 -81[21] ruling that rejected a claim made by an individual requesting a reward for assisting in the investigation. The SEC rejected the claim, asserting in the "Claimant did not provide information that led to the successful enforcement" and denying the application.[22]

Overview[edit]
Harbinger is a highly diversified multi-strategy hedge fund.[3] It has bet against sub-prime mortgages in the United States and the United Kingdom, including HBOS.[1][4] It is also a major investor in LightSquared, a troubled wireless communications company that filed bankruptcy in 2012, formerly known as SkyTerra Communications Inc.[5] Harbinger's $3.05 billion restructuring plan gives 74 percent of LightSquared to Cerberus Capital Management LP, Fortress Investment Group LLC and JPMorgan Chase & Co., leaving Falcone with 12.5 percent of the company's equity.[6] In March 2015, a judge approved Harbinger Capital's restructuring plan of LightSquared, which pays off lender Charlie Ergen, putting LightSquared in the hands of investors.[7]
In November 2014, Falcone announced his resignation as chief executive and chairman from Harbinger Group HRG, whose second biggest shareholder is Harbinger Capital. Falcone was paid a lump-sum of $40.3 million upon his resignation.[8][9]
In March 2015, the lawsuit accusing Falcone and Harbinger Capital Partners of "misleading investors about the firm's stake in LightSquared Inc." was dismissed.[10]
The firm's hedge funds include the Harbinger Capital Partners Master Fund, the Credit Distressed BlueLine Fund, and Harbinger Capital Partners Special Situations Fund.[11]
According to press accounts the assets under management at Harbinger peaked at $26 Billion in 2008 and had declined to approximately $9 Billion as of 2010 due to sizeable investor redemptions with approximately 40% of that total (approximately $3.5 Billion) concentrated in investments related to building a high-speed wireless network in the United States.[12]
History[edit]
Harbinger was founded in 2001[13] by its Senior Managing Director Philip Falcone and Harbert Management Corporation, a Birmingham, Alabama-based investment company that provided much of the original funding. Harbinger had funds under management of $26.5 billion (£13.4 billion) as of the end of June 2008.[14][15] In 2009, Harbinger acquired the ownership of its funds from Harbert, although Harbert handled administrative functions for Harbinger for a short transitional period. Also in 2009, Harbinger acquired controlling stock of the Zapata Corporation from the Glazer family and changed its name to The Harbinger Group Inc. (NYSE: HRG).[16] The hedge fund is based in New York, New York.[13]
Harbinger has owned large stakes in The New York Times Company, Cleveland-Cliffs, and 28% stock ownership of satellite communications company Inmarsat. The company has also owned stakes in rival satellite operators SkyTerra and Terrestar, and British sugar producer Tate & Lyle.[15]
In 2008, Harbinger Capital was ranked 19th on the Wall Street Journal's "The Hedge Fund 100" list, pulling in 23.85 percent in three-year annualized returns.[17] In 2009, Harbinger Capital was ranked 12th on the Wall Street Journal's "Top 100 Hedge Funds" list, pulling in 30.48 percent in three-year annualized returns.[18]
Harbinger Capital, which owned Russell Hobbs, merged it with Spectrum Brands on June 16, 2010 for $661 million and now controls approximately 64% of the appliance maker, Spectrum.
Top equity holdings[edit]
As of 2015, the top equity holdings of the firm were in the shares of the following companies: Spectrum Brands Inc, Harbinger Group Inc, North American Energy Partners Inc, and EXCO Resources Inc.[2]
SEC settlement[edit]
In August 2013, the firm reached a settlement with the SEC agreeing to pay more than $18 million and admit wrongdoing. As part of the settlement, Harbinger Senior Managing Director Philip Falcone was also barred from the securities industry for at least five years but did not prohibit him from working as an officer or director of a public company.[19] Among the SEC's multiple allegations were that Falcone misused fund assets and diverted fund assets for personal use, that the fund engaged in redemption and other practices that favored certain investors over others and that fund attempted to conduct an improper short squeeze on the bonds of Canadian manufacturing firm, partially in retaliation against a competitor investment firm. Harbinger and Falcone largely admitted to these allegations in the settlement.[20]
July 4, 2014, the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission's Office of the Whistleblower issued a "Final Order" in matter number 2012 -81[21] ruling that rejected a claim made by an individual requesting a reward for assisting in the investigation. The SEC rejected the claim, asserting in the "Claimant did not provide information that led to the successful enforcement" and denying the application.[22]

Overview[edit]
Harbinger is a highly diversified multi-strategy hedge fund.[3] It has bet against sub-prime mortgages in the United States and the United Kingdom, including HBOS.[1][4] It is also a major investor in LightSquared, a troubled wireless communications company that filed bankruptcy in 2012, formerly known as SkyTerra Communications Inc.[5] Harbinger's $3.05 billion restructuring plan gives 74 percent of LightSquared to Cerberus Capital Management LP, Fortress Investment Group LLC and JPMorgan Chase & Co., leaving Falcone with 12.5 percent of the company's equity.[6] In March 2015, a judge approved Harbinger Capital's restructuring plan of LightSquared, which pays off lender Charlie Ergen, putting LightSquared in the hands of investors.[7]
In November 2014, Falcone announced his resignation as chief executive and chairman from Harbinger Group HRG, whose second biggest shareholder is Harbinger Capital. Falcone was paid a lump-sum of $40.3 million upon his resignation.[8][9]
In March 2015, the lawsuit accusing Falcone and Harbinger Capital Partners of "misleading investors about the firm's stake in LightSquared Inc." was dismissed.[10]
The firm's hedge funds include the Harbinger Capital Partners Master Fund, the Credit Distressed BlueLine Fund, and Harbinger Capital Partners Special Situations Fund.[11]
According to press accounts the assets under management at Harbinger peaked at $26 Billion in 2008 and had declined to approximately $9 Billion as of 2010 due to sizeable investor redemptions with approximately 40% of that total (approximately $3.5 Billion) concentrated in investments related to building a high-speed wireless network in the United States.[12]
History[edit]
Harbinger was founded in 2001[13] by its Senior Managing Director Philip Falcone and Harbert Management Corporation, a Birmingham, Alabama-based investment company that provided much of the original funding. Harbinger had funds under management of $26.5 billion (£13.4 billion) as of the end of June 2008.[14][15] In 2009, Harbinger acquired the ownership of its funds from Harbert, although Harbert handled administrative functions for Harbinger for a short transitional period. Also in 2009, Harbinger acquired controlling stock of the Zapata Corporation from the Glazer family and changed its name to The Harbinger Group Inc. (NYSE: HRG).[16] The hedge fund is based in New York, New York.[13]
Harbinger has owned large stakes in The New York Times Company, Cleveland-Cliffs, and 28% stock ownership of satellite communications company Inmarsat. The company has also owned stakes in rival satellite operators SkyTerra and Terrestar, and British sugar producer Tate & Lyle.[15]
In 2008, Harbinger Capital was ranked 19th on the Wall Street Journal's "The Hedge Fund 100" list, pulling in 23.85 percent in three-year annualized returns.[17] In 2009, Harbinger Capital was ranked 12th on the Wall Street Journal's "Top 100 Hedge Funds" list, pulling in 30.48 percent in three-year annualized returns.[18]
Harbinger Capital, which owned Russell Hobbs, merged it with Spectrum Brands on June 16, 2010 for $661 million and now controls approximately 64% of the appliance maker, Spectrum.
Top equity holdings[edit]
As of 2015, the top equity holdings of the firm were in the shares of the following companies: Spectrum Brands Inc, Harbinger Group Inc, North American Energy Partners Inc, and EXCO Resources Inc.[2]
SEC settlement[edit]
In August 2013, the firm reached a settlement with the SEC agreeing to pay more than $18 million and admit wrongdoing. As part of the settlement, Harbinger Senior Managing Director Philip Falcone was also barred from the securities industry for at least five years but did not prohibit him from working as an officer or director of a public company.[19] Among the SEC's multiple allegations were that Falcone misused fund assets and diverted fund assets for personal use, that the fund engaged in redemption and other practices that favored certain investors over others and that fund attempted to conduct an improper short squeeze on the bonds of Canadian manufacturing firm, partially in retaliation against a competitor investment firm. Harbinger and Falcone largely admitted to these allegations in the settlement.[20]
July 4, 2014, the U.S. Security and Exchange Commission's Office of the Whistleblower issued a "Final Order" in matter number 2012 -81[21] ruling that rejected a claim made by an individual requesting a reward for assisting in the investigation. The SEC rejected the claim, asserting in the "Claimant did not provide information that led to the successful enforcement" and denying the application.[22]

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
