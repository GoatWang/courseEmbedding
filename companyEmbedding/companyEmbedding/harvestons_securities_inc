About SEC Rule 606
 
Under SEC Rule 606, broker-dealers
  that route orders on behalf of customers are required to prepare quarterly
  reports that disclose the following information:
 
ˇ          The percentage of total customer
  orders that were non-directed orders1, and the percentages of total
  non-directed orders1 that were market orders, limit orders, or other orders
ˇ          The identity of the venues to which
  a significant percentage of total non-directed orders were routed for
  execution
ˇ          The percentage of total non-directed
  orders routed to the venue, and the percentages of total non-directed market
  orders, non-directed limit orders, and non-directed other orders that were
  routed to the venue
ˇ          Terms of the material aspects of the
  broker-dealer's relationship with each venue identified above, including a
  description of any arrangement for payment for order flow and any
  profit-sharing relationship
 
The reports are to be made public
  for each calendar quarter and published no later than one month after the end
  of the quarter. Another piece of this rule requires annual public
  notification that the detail is available.
 
Pursuant to the rule, customers can
  request details, from their investment representative, on the identity of the
  venue to which the customer's orders were routed for execution in the six
  months prior to the request, whether the orders were directed, at the
  customer's request, to a specific venue for execution and the time of the
  executions, if any, that resulted from those orders. Customers also may
  request up to six months of this information in hard copy through a
  representative on all orders for a specific time period and/or on individual
  securities. The collection period for this information began on July 2, 2001.
 
The 
Securities Industry Association has provided information about
  order disclosure and this rule.
 
1 Any order that the customer has not specifically instructed to be routed
  to a particular venue for execution.

Investment Banking
 
Harvestons' public finance team has the expertise to address the unique circumstances that result
  from various markets and credit scenarios. Our efforts are aimed at
  completing understanding and appreciation of a client's unique characteristic
  in light of those circumstances.
 
No two issuers are alike. An issuer's health and the market-ability of
  its securities are determined by its financial flexibility and infrastructure
  needs as well as its demographic, geographic and business markets. These
  factors help us evaluate an issuer's ability to cope not only with short-term
  economic fluctuations but also long-term trends in particular environments.
