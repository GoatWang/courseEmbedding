Prolene mesh; Its uses and dangers
Thursday, August 4th, 2011

Prolene mesh is the product name for a permanent plastic mesh with many implantation applications in reconstructive surgery. Prolene mesh is used to fix large and small abdominal hernias, inguinal hernias, hernias of the diaphragm; it’s used to resuspend kidneys (nephropexy) rectums (rectopexy), uteri (aka uterus’ plural) (sacrohysteropexy), prolapsed vaginas after hysterectomy (sacrocolpopexy), chin augmentations (mentoplasty), chest wall repair in certain thoracic surgeries, (abdominal hernias (inguinal, umbilcal, ventral) and both male and female urethral sling operations for stress urinary incontinence, to name a few.
In 2008 the FDA posted a warning (FDA warning on use of mesh in prolapse and incontinence repairs) on the use of prolene mesh in reconstructive female pelvic surgery.  This warning came from the plethora of complaints registered with the FDA from patients with prolapse repaired with various formulations of a plastic mesh called Prolene.  The weft and warp of this mesh has been tweaked by the surgical supply corporations that develop and market “mesh kit” procedures to reconstructive pelvic surgeons worldwide in an effort to address these concerns and assure surgeons and patients that plastic mesh is safe for use in pelvic organ prolapse and urinary incontinence repairs.

FDA laboratory analyses finds Intercharm Inc.’s Slimforte Slimming Capsules to contain Sibutramine an appetite suppressant that has long since been removed from the market for safety reasons
Thursday, August 4th, 2011

Intercharm Inc., is recalling Slimforte Slimming Capsules, Slimforte Slimming Coffee, and Botanical Slimming Soft Gel. FDA laboratory analyses found the products to contain Sibutramine an appetite suppressant. Sibutramine is a controlled substance that was withdrawn from the market in October 2010 for safety reasons.
Products containing Sibutramine pose a threat to consumers because Sibutramine is known to substantially increase blood pressure and/or pulse rate in some patients and may present a significant risk for patients with a history of coronary artery disease, congestive heart failure, arrhythmias or stroke. These products may also interact in life threatening ways with other medications a consumer may be taking. Intercharm Inc. has not received any reports of adverse events related to this recall.
If you or anyone you know has taken any of the above products contact us at: 888 422-2882

Job Details
               The Western Golf Association was founded in 1899 by 11 Chicago-area golf clubs. Today, more than 500 member clubs in states throughout the nation support the WGA, sponsor of the Western Open on the PGA TOUR and the Chick Evans Caddie Scholarships. Headquarters for the WGA and the Evans Scholars Foundation are in Golf, Illinois, which is also home to the Glen View Club, host of the first Western Open and Western Amateur championships in 1899. In 1914, the Western Junior championship, the first such national competition in the history of American golf, was added to the WGA tournament schedule. The WGA continues to sponsor the tradition-steeped Western Open, Western Amateur and Western Junior championships. Since 1930 the WGA also has sponsored the nationally acclaimed Evans Scholars Foundation, which administers the nation's largest privately funded college scholarship program. The Foundation, established by famed Chicago amateur golfer Charles "Chick" Evans Jr., has provided college educations to more than 8,600 former caddies. The Evans Scholars Foundation is the sole beneficiary of the Western Open, held at Cog Hill Golf & Country Club in Lemont, Illinois, since 1991. The annual PGA TOUR event, which celebrated its 100th championship in 2003, has raised more than $33 million for the caddie scholarships in the past 73 years.

Job Details
               Green Manning & Bunch, Ltd. is committed to protecting the interests of our clients in the event of a significant business disruption. In accordance with FINRA rules, Green Manning & Bunch, Ltd. is providing the following overview of our Business Continuity Plan. If after a significant business disruption you cannot contact us through your normal channels, you should call us at 303.592.4800? or go to our website at gmbltd.com. If you cannot access us through either of those means, you should contact David Pass at our parent company, CoBiz Financial, at dpass@cobizfinancial.com for information on how to reach us. Our business continuity plan is designed to permit our firm to resume operations as quickly as possible, safeguard our employees and property, protect the firm's books and records, and assure our clients of a prompt return to normal service, given the scope and severity of the significant business disruption. It addresses data back up and recovery; all mission critical systems; financial and operational assessments; alternative communications with customers, employees, and regulators; alternate physical location of employees; critical supplier, contractor, bank and counter-party impact; and regulatory reporting. Significant business disruptions can vary in their scope, such as only our firm, a single building housing our firm, the business district where our firm is located, the city where we are located, or the whole region. Within each of these areas, the severity of the disruption can also vary from minimal to severe. In a disruption to only our firm or a building housing our firm, we will transfer our operations to an alternate local site as necessary and expect to recover and resume business within the same day. In a disruption affecting our business district, city or region, we will transfer our operations to alternate locations and resume operations as quickly as possible. In either situation, we plan to continue in business and notify you through our web site at www.gmbltd.com how to contact us.

Thank you so much for sharing on PH. The reasoning behind this is simple: in most organizations (maybe not your scrappiest startup), calendars run the show. You come to work when your calendar tells you to, you eat lunch (if you can) when your calendar allows it, etc. We think the first step is allowing you and your team to create artificial scarcity – if you have 40 hours you can schedule meetings for, you will use all 40 hours. We're rushing to get this functionality out for the public (currently in alpha for a few select teams). After that, we really want to see Bunch grow into your single tool to manage your time and your meetings as a team. 5Share·2 years agoTyler Hayes@thetylerhayes · Bebo@bud_caddell Can definitely relate (pretty sure 99% of us can ;). Tech isn't great, but Advertising was way worse as an industry with respect to my calendar. Hour-long meetings -____-

I'm always curious: is there a specific origin story behind this? 3Share·2 years agoBud Caddell@bud_caddell · Founder@thetylerhayes Yep. There is. When I was granted the almighty 'S' in 'SVP' at my old ad job I was given an admin to manage my calendar. These jobs always fall to over-qualified young women who are lied to by HR that these roles lead to better gigs. I suggested to our exec team that they spend 1 week managing their own calendars to see how broken we all were – this was not a popular idea.... I'm a big believer that technology doesn't necessarily have to just replace roles – it can allow humans to do the kind of work humans are suited best for, which is not just being a traffic cop for incoming meeting requests. 7Share·2 years agoWould you recommend Bunch to a friend?😡 NO🤔 MAYBE😍 YESHunterHTyler HayesMakersMBud CaddellDiscussionYou need to become a Contributor to join the discussion - Find out how.Bud CaddellMaker@bud_caddell · FounderTyler!

Link all your team's calendars and set rules: max # of meetings/week, max # of attendees/meeting, max time/meeting. Gain back control over calendaring gone rogue.

The more I think about it, the more I wonder why Google hasn't done this with Google Apps. Just seems like a no-brainer.

Plus it's made by @bud_caddell.

Electronic paper, or e-paper is making great technological advances, but what exactly is it and how does it work?
Electronic paper is also known as e-paper and is a technology designed to imitate the look and style of ordinary ink and paper. E-paper reflects light just as ordinary paper does, unlike the usual flat-panel display that is lit with a backlight to illuminate pixels.
Electronic paper was first developed in the 1970s by Nick Sheridon at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center. The first electronic paper, called Gyricon, consisted of polyethylene spheres between 20 and 100 micrometres across.
E-paper comprises two different parts: the first is electronic ink, sometimes referred to as the "frontplane"; and the second is the electronics required to generate the pattern of text and images on the e-ink page, called the "backplane".Several different technologies are involved in the production of e-paper, some use plastic substrate and electronics to make the display flexible, this makes it more comfortable to read that traditional displays and gives it a stable image, so you don't have to refresh it constantly. Though it's light and durable the color representation is still somewhat limited.There are several uses of electronic paper that can be seen or even purchased today. Here are some examples:Lucent's new E Ink device shows how the future of ePaper is coming. The technology uses electronic ink and combines thin, plastic, flexible transistors with polymer LEDs to create smart pixels. The process involved uses silicon rubber stamps to print minute computer circuits onto the surface. For display, E Ink uses electronic ink: a liquid plastic substance made up of millions of tiny capsules filled with light and dark dyes that change color when exposed to an electric charge. This device will be completely flexible like paper (without the easy tearing or crumpling) and can display changing text or image.The benefits to using electronic paper are quite impressive. Here are some of the benefits of using the technology:

The Federal government Trade Commission, the country's consumer protection company, has some tips to obtain the most for your cash.
Check around. A "sale" price isn't always the "best" price. Some merchants may give you a sale price on an item for a limited time; others may discount the purchase price on a single item everyday. Having an item's manufacturer, model number, and other identifying information can help you to get the best price for that you want.Read sale advertising carefully. Some may say "quantities limited," "no rainfall bank checks," or "unavailable whatsoever stores." Before you come out the door, call ahead to be sure the merchant has the item in stock. If you're searching for a favorite or hard-to-find item, ask the merchant if he'd be willing to carry that until you can reach the store.Devote some time and travel costs under consideration. If something is available for sale, but it's way anywhere, how much are you truly saving once you element in your time, your transportation, and parking?Search for price-matching plans. Some vendors will match, or beat even, a competitor's prices -- at least for a restricted time. Browse the merchant's pricing coverage. It may well not apply to all items.Go online. Have a look at websites that compare charges for items offered online. Some sites also may compare prices offered by stores locally. If you opt to buy online, keep shipping costs and delivery amount of time in mind.Calculate good deal offers that derive from buys of additional products. For instance, "buy one, get one free," "free gift idea with purchase," or "free shipping and delivery with lowest purchase" may appear enticing. Unless you want or need that, it isn't a deal.Ask about sales adjustments. In the event that you buy something at regular price and it continues on sales another week, is it possible to get a credit or refund for the reduced amount? What documentation how about?Enquire about refund and come back plans on the market items. Merchants frequently have different refund and return policies on the market items, clearance merchandise especially.
Gifting is one of the individual emotional accessories that stay static in the hearts of the recipients permanently. There are different events when you might need to send somebody a bunch or gift idea box in Vietnam. That's the reason services of a specialist florist are specially an integral part of any city on earth today, including Ho or Hanoi Chi Minh.

There are a few beneficial circumstances of choosing the Vietnam florist, but to have the best out of most florists for just about any gifting on any time here are some tips. Have a look at their blossom delivery style as normally online florist deliver blossoms in a way that the receiver gets them in the freshest form. Many ways is there by which they provided it like covered individual blossoms and filled with a moist gentle sponge within the base, in order that they reach you fresh and budded. And yet another way is straight way by which recipient has got the flowers in conventional bouquet.

Though it's light and durable the color rendering is still somewhat minimal.There are numerous uses of electric paper that can be seen or even purchased today. Here are some examples:Lucent's new At the Ink device shows how the future of ePaper is coming. The technology uses electronic ink and combines thin, plastic, adaptable transistors with polymer LEDs to generate smart pixels. Typically the process involved uses si rubber stamps to print out minute computer circuits on the surface. For show, E Ink uses electric ink: a liquid plastic-type substance made up of an incredible number of tiny capsules stuffed with light and darker dyes that change color when confronted with an electric charge. This device will be completely flexible like paper (without the easy tearing or crumpling) and can instruct changing text or image.The benefits to using electronic paper are quite impressive. Below are a few of the features of using the technology:
