John Lewis dumps its returns and end-of-line stock there, often at rock-bottom prices. It’s where 3,500 crates of brand new and ex-display mobile phones – all from the collapse of the Phones 4u chain – were sold off, with some handsets going for under £5. Cars seized by the DVLA and stolen goods recovered by the police – but where the owner can’t be traced – often end up there. Yet the John Pye Auctions website remains relatively unknown: is it a secret eBay where canny buyers can pick up real bargains, or the fag-end of retail, piled high with junk?
Seven years ago, when Guardian Money first featured John Pye, it was a single warehouse in Nottingham, handling bankrupt and liquidation stock – and you had to turn up in person and bid. But the recession, and technology, have been kind to the business. It is now Britain’s biggest firm of commercial auctioneers with 14 warehouses across the UK, including an 11-acre site in the West Midlands.




 

This is 'buyer beware' with bells on




 

Driving its growth has been the string of bankruptcies during the recession that have supplied its stock - and the fact that buyers no longer have to turn up in person, bidding instead over the internet at johnpye.co.uk.
Oddly, the website is sometimes busier in China than in Britain. In March, after Phones 4u went belly up and £10m of its stock was passing through John Pye, it got 400,000 visits from China and only 200,000 from the UK. Rather more grimly, goods that appeared to have been destined for Greece (“please note a European plug is attached”) went under the hammer last week in a warehouse in Derby.
But are they really bargains? We checked the final auction prices paid last week at John Pye’s west London branch for sealed, untouched iPad minis. The cheapest went for £192.96, saving £100 on the £299 price the same model sells for on Amazon. For some people that will be enough of a saving to warrant giving up any consumer rights – if you buy at auction, you can’t return the goods later. But oddly, we found that some of the iPads had been bid up to as much as £273 once VAT (20%) and the buyers premium (20%) were added, which makes little sense compared with buying at the Apple Store.
The site is not just electricals and phones – we found everything from parasols and plant pots to Paddington toys and paddling pools. Over the past year it has also started to sell luxury items – Rolex watches appear to be a speciality – and is planning to offload £8m in gemstones from one of the UK’s biggest private collections. If you are doing up a home, we found new sinks, taps, shower trays, ready-made curtains, sofas and chairs and kitchen appliances at a fraction of high street prices.

Some of the John Lewis goods appeared to be real bargains: a Naples bistro set with chairs and parasol went for £46.08 all in. The same set sells in the stores for £178. What we can’t tell you is why it was at auction – was it ex-display? Or, more worryingly, returned by a customer? Unfortunately, buyers over the internet won’t know, as we discovered when we purchased some John Lewis items– and were sorely disappointed (see below).
A remarkable number of Dyson vacuum cleaners are going through John Pye, following a retailer’s trade-in deal; the cheapest last week went for just £6. This week there were heaps of Sony Cybershot cameras (they sold for £8-£12), Logik portable DVD players (£25-£30), and rack after rack of Epson, Canon and HP inkjet printers, some of which went for just 40p each.
One thing we particularly noted was that, shortly after, remarkably similar items to those sold at John Pye turned up on Gumtree with sellers marketing them as “hardly used” or “unwanted gift”.
John Pye is like an online Ikea bargain corner or TK Maxx with all its attractions – and frustrations. Who cares about a barely noticeable scratch if it’s going for a fraction of the usual price? But what’s the point paying half price for an electrical item that doesn’t work, or a mattress so badly made no one can get a night’s sleep – and where the buyer effectively loses all their consumer rights to complain and return?
You only need to take a look at reviews of John Pye on Trustpilot.co.uk to see the frustrations that some customers have had – although the number of complaints is relatively trivial compared with the 1m auction lots John Pye has sold over the past four years. John Pye says it has many repeat buyers, which proves that it is hardly just selling junk.
Guardian Money visited its west London auction rooms on a public viewing day – and to our surprise we were almost the only people there. It is housed in a less than glamorous set of warehouses in Acton, and when we asked for directions at another warehouse nearby, no one had even heard of the company.
The layout is about as far away from a John Lewis store as you can get. Dozens of shiny new mobile phones and iPads, still in their packaging and all from Phones 4u, were laid out alongside other iPads and iPhones with screens so smashed it was difficult to make out anything.
Further along were bathroom products – sinks, taps, panels etc – that mostly appeared to be new and untouched. Other items had signs that they were refurbished, returned or ex-display. Weirdly, a black Bentley stood in the middle of the warehouse with a starting price of just £85 next to a binbag of old clothes.

Was the lack of other viewers a positive sign that the final auction price would be low? The warehouse rep told us only one in 10 bidders actually comes to the public viewing. Generally, they are people who have not bid at a John Pye auction before. The rest, he said, take their chances with the pictures online.
And you do take your chances. It is not like eBay – when you look online, each item comes with just one photograph, and virtually no information bar a one-line description. Next to that is a blunt warning: “All lots are sold as seen with no warranties or guarantees.” This is “buyer beware” with bells on.
Delivery is also an issue. John Pye does not deliver, but it can connect buyers with a courier service, which charges according to size. While a small and light item such as a phone might be worth buying, heavy goods only work if you can collect.
Not all the goods are aimed at the general public. Large amounts of liquidation stock are bagged up into lots that no member of the public would want. Last week you could buy seven boxes of “Best Teacher” ribbons (they fetched £10), box after box of “Best Teacher” mugs, and a pallet load of “High School Musical” napkins (£20). Evidently, the educational supplies market hasn’t been good for someone.
John Pye is rather like popping into Lidl every month or so – you head in for some carrots but somehow walk out with a sunbed cylinder pump and a shoe carousel – and you’re convinced you’ve landed a bargain.
There is a problem, though, for all those reading this article. It means more people know about the site, so prices are likely to rise as more bidders join. We don’t know whether to tell you to get your skates on – or that we have saved you from buying junk. Sorry.

Buyer beware!
We were a little giddy here in the Guardian Money office when we bid for a number of John Lewis-branded digital radios – normally selling for £49.99 or £55.99 in the store – on the John Pye site, and, to our delight, got them for just £4 each. They looked in near-mint condition. Maybe they had been returned by a fussy customer because of a minor scratch. What could possibly go wrong?
Unfortunately, almost everything. We bought eight (yes, we went a bit mad) for a total of £31.68. What, we wondered, were we going to do with them all? They arrived in the office a few days later but after carefully testing each one, we knew the answer: chuck most of them in the bin.
The first one just kept saying “insert iPod” and despite lots of button pressing, we couldn’t get it to do anything else. The second was so bashed up (open wires etc) we didn’t even try. The third looked perfect, and, promisingly, turned on normally. But we could not get any sound to come out. Interestingly, in each case the John Lewis label had been scratched out (it turns out that is something John Lewis demands. We can understand why). 
But then, hurrah! The fourth one we opened was in good nick and worked perfectly well. We had one bargain, at least. But sadly that was it – the other four radios either wouldn’t switch on, or lit up but no sound would come out.
Our £31.68 wasn’t entirely wasted – we do have at least one working radio – but our disappointment was intense. Our conclusion was that it’s simply not worth taking the risk of buying online, with no right of return, unless you know for sure that the item works.
Perhaps we would buy an item if it were in its unopened original packaging, such as the iPads we saw, and if we obtained a deep discount. But for anything else, we would only bid if we were able to visit the auction house and test them first.
We told John Pye our results. A spokesman says it does not test items before sale, and that customers should examine the goods before bidding – although that’s not much help to online bidders. “Our motto is view, bid, buy. But it’s unusual for so many not to be working. We would expect the majority to work. Did you put the aerial up?” Thanks for that, we did.

I have been using jp for 3 years now


                I have been using jp for 3 years now, I built a new bathroom at a fraction of shop prices, fitted out most of my kitchen, hob cooker sink taps fridge dishwasher, microwave, worktops ect, all top of the range samsung, Franke, hotpoint. A 3grand 3 piece suite for 300 garden furniture the list goes on, lights mirrors even wallpaper..........Follow the rules look be you buy e.g. if a fridge freezer looks perfect then it won't work the odd little dent it's fine fridge magnets.Avoid small electrical items you will be throwing money away unless you are an electrical genius.As for the staff only ever found them helpful , actually feel sorry for them its not their fault you bought rubbish.Best buys Furniture, Bathrooms, anything you can actually see is ok.Like they say it's easy as pye and to all the greedy people who think  they can buy £200 worth of drones for £20 why do you think they sell for £20.

RUBBISH RUBBISH AND MORE RUBBISH


                I have been using John Pyes for a few weeks and things are getting worse.Most of the items are either damaged,faulty or incomplete but they will not tell you that.On visiting their Derby site for a viewing day I was amazed at the amount of tat that was on display.Nearly everything was faulty,incomplete,well used etc and not worth bidding on.But some people must do as I was amazed at the final bids for some items that in the photos and description look as good as new but when you actually viewed them it was apparent what their condition truly was.I have lost count of the number of times I have seen and heard customers arguing with the staffas regards their purchase only to be told there is nothing they can do as they are sold as seen.Alright in the photos they look new and in great condition but that is not a true representation of their quality.BEWARE ALL THE ITEMS HAVE BEEN RETURNED TO A MAJOR HIGH STREET STORE UNDER WARRANTY AS THEY ARE FAULTY INCOMPLETE etc.Then John Pye resell the crap to you.Stickers noting the faults are removed,look for a rectangular piece missing on the packaging and that is where the fault reason would have been before Pyes removed it.Items are often listed as sealed but it is John Pyes sticking new tape on them to make them appear as if they were new and you will know no difference until you get home.In my experience 75-80% of their items are ABSOLUTELY USELESS.If you have money to waste then this is the site for you.

Rubbish absolute rubbish


                Bought several items only to find they were second hand, damaged with parts missing.Annoyed with myself for being drawn in to such unscrupulous business people.Ye it tells you in the small print that they may not be perfect but doesn't say they are f&@ed and unworkable.For a few quid more I have bought brand new with a guarantee.Will NEVER use this site again,complete fraudsters,Letter going to consumers rights to see how they get away with it.People work hard to buy things,not get ripped off by this site RANT OVER AND OUT

Even viewing doesn't really work.


                Having bought only Dish Washers for the past 6 months I believe its only getting worst, Im very lucky if 4 out of 10 work, I do actually stick with the same brand to use parts for the non working but my last purchase of 6 only one worked and thats after viewing, how can you ever know whats going on inside the product. If you can afford to lose your money then go ahead because clearly the bad reviews dont seem to put people off.

I have been using John Pyes from about 2009


                I have been using John Pyes from about 2009The staff are generally helpful despite being low paid.The stock varies from high quality to cheap and tacky.  That being said - checking before you buy is essential to avoid losses which are usually unrecoverable.My biggest gripe is that John Pyes are not transparent in their use of reserve prices so often times you are only bidding against the John Pye reserve price which is set to make them an handsome profit irrespective of whether the item is working or not!  Be afraid ...be very afraid!!!All bids are online.  in my experience and i have photographic evidence to substantiate, they operate a very rigid and quite high reserve price.  This may not be a problem if you are buying an item for your own consumption/use that you have physically rigorously checked for faults, however, if you are buying blind based upon the description or are buying to sell it will invariably be a disaster because the reserve price that Pyes use is minimum of 33% - 50% of the  RRP but remember you have to pay 44% on top of that!!! it really adds up.  Best case scenario Example.  RRP £100  you win the item for £40 the you must add £17.60 so you end up paying £57.60 for an iten  that you can probably purchase on ebay for about £70. How much do you think you would make for yourself if you tried to sell that said item on Ebay after postage and Ebay fees?.In conclusion.  if you are purchasing for yourself and trying to save a few pounds  - you can definitely do that at Pyes IF you check items before you bid on them BUT if you bid blind and are trying to buy to sell be very wary because a refund is like the proverbial rocking horse poo poo.

Great bargains on high street brands


                John Pye's offer a great variety of producs from house hold appliances to cars! They have viewing days to the public so you can see what you buy before you start bidding. The salerooms are always well laid out and staff on hand are friendly and helpful. ALWAYS view before you buy! There are some top bargains on high street brands but always check the items out first. I always recommend John Pye to friends and family.

Honesty is not your best policy


                I have used John Pye Auctions regularly both local and nationally, I have bought everything from Fridges, ovens, furniture even cars however what is really disappointing is the rubbish that is sold in the small electronic, electrical and  gadgets section.  I will now stop buying things there because they are seldom working or useable in any way.  To date I have wasted over £60's on this absolute rubbish.  You hide behind a disclaimer stating that the goods may not be useable but it would be better to state spares or repairs, just today I bought 9 items, desk top drums and money counting jars and none of them are usable and ended up in the rubbish bin.

Not bad sometimes for a bargain.


                Not bad sometimes for a bargain.I use John pye every week and as long as you go and view the product then you can see what your getting.There is a lot of broken and returns which I'd made to look good and new from the outside but is tat when opened so you have to be aware of this.I buy mostly bathroom stuff now and it's new.The main thing I don't agree with is all the added charges it's to much 44% on top is ridiculous. Buyers premium. And hammer price. Then v.a.t should be lower. All in all some things are value for money others are not.

Ecellent Service and Bargins to be had


                Only used John Pye Auctions a couple of times but have found the online auction process to be very easy and managed to get some bargin furniture. I would always advise going to the viewings as it is the only way you can be sure the item is what you want.

The best auction site in Britain Easy TO Purchase from but improvements needed


                The best auction site in Britain easy bidding technique,The two reccomendations I am suggesting is for Jewellery sales John Pye should have all their sites able to post light items to customers like Marchington,It certainly will discourage people from buying without like Marchington a Royal Mail postage option,Also you need a Proffessional like me to promote and improve the name and service that John Pye supply I.e many ordinary people have valuable items to sell but do not know how to do this and it needs to be simple and easy which it can be,And finally John Pye are an excellent company for what their business is but not a lot of people of ordinary background do not know them hence loss of potential cinders/Customers.

I have been dealing with this auction …


                I have been dealing with this auction house for almost a decade now and my only reproach is they have been getting better and better..I can almost say they pioneered buying online from auction houses in the U.K.Well done guys,keep it up.Champions are who they are not because they're the strongest but merely because they are ahead and they show the way.

Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1899 edition. Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper. Original Publisher: London : Hacon & Ricketts 64 pages.  Bookseller Inventory # 452161892

Current Research
                      Current activities are focused on improving the interaction of Forest Service researchers with their customers through web content that is rich, current, and discoverable. The intranet accountability tool Research Information Tracking System (RITS) empowers all areas of the agency's research operations to enter and update the latest information on research operations, expertise, and accomplishments for transfer when appropriate to public-facing web sites. Discovery tools like Treesearch and the R&D-wide SOLR search tool help customers find the solutions they need. Interagency collaborations like VIVO, STAR METRICS, PatentsView, and Science.gov build on industry best practices and demonstrate the connections from strategic objectives to scientific results and use.                    
                    
                                          Past Research
Most of my research has been conducted as an ecologist with the US Forest Service, working with economists to explore the social and ecologic interactions that shape our forests and the benefits they produce. Early work was on acid rain and air pollution effects on trees and stands, and an evaluation of the costs and benefits of research to control fusiform rust damage in southern pines. Wildfires in Florida in 1998 encouraged investigations into the economics of wildfires both in Florida and beyond. A long standing line of research has been in the regional dynamics and control of southern pine beetle.
Why This Research is Important
A key part of the Forest Service mission is to provide the science that managers need to promote the health and resilience of the Nation's forests and grasslands to benefit the American people. Transparency of objectives, operations, and accomplishments builds trust with taxpayers, collaborators, and future partners. Open access to the results of federally funded research means better informed decisions.
