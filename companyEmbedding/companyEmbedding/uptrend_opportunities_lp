Safety Is a Core Value





LP Teamwork and Respect






Employee Spotlight
Lorraine Daley
Plant Safety ManagerEast River, Nova Scotia

I like that we have a strong team and they’re dedicated to safety. I was recruited from another job and when they interviewed me I was hesitant to take the job until I met the team. Once I knew I had this huge support system I knew they were supportive of the safety culture.
“Lorraine is a dedicated member of the LP East River team. She is passionate about her work as the safety manager. Her interactions with employees helps them solve problems on the floor and have a better understanding of how to protect themselves and look out for their co-workers,” said Kyle Kennedy, Plant Manager at LP’s East River Mill.
       
   



Employee Spotlight
Harry Gordon
Production ReliefNewberry, Michigan

I am the person that actually fills in for the production supervisor. We also take care of the day crew and spend time filling in for all the other positions if someone is out. I work with a very supportive team. They inspire the best out of everyone.
"Harry works hard and is well liked by his peers,” said John Duflo, Plant Operations Superintendent at LP’s Newberry mill. “He’s very respectful and a great teammate."
       
   



Employee Spotlight

SupervisorJasper, TX Mill

I supervise our shipping department. I enjoy working with the people I work with and I like working in the area I work in. I’ve been in this department for 15 years. The people are good, safety-oriented people. We have a lot of goal-driven people, people with good ideas that motivate you in your job.
“Leonard does a great job ensuring that we keep our shipments on time and that they have very little error.  He is very dependable and does a great job managing his department,” said Joe Gernand, Production Superintendent at LP’s Jasper Mill.  “I really enjoy working with Leonard because I can trust him to take care of his fellow employees and to keep up with the shipping standards we have at LP.”

I love what I do. I love helping our customers and I’m very proud of the products we make. I have our LP SmartSide on my house that I bought from one of our distributors. If I had built my house I would’ve bought the I-joists we make. Red Bluff is small so when you find a good job you don’t change. And I found a good one.
"It’s so great to have a resource like Maria on our team. She has a lot of knowledge about our industry, our products, and our customers. And you can tell she cares about people, both inside and outside of LP,” said Alyssa Moore, EWP Customer Service Lead.

I keep track of the quality process in my area and make sure our customers get the product they ordered. We look for any defects before we package it, make sure it’s cut to the right lengths, etc. I like working here because LP cares about each individual person and looks out for their safety.
“Travis works very hard and is very dedicated. When he joined LP he was working in the packaging end and then quickly wanted more responsibility so he moved up and took a lead position. He’s a problem solver for the crew. He works well with his team, and is a very valuable employee,” said Danny Williams, Supervisor at LP’s Houlton Mill.

Propane prices on uptrend with improved fundamentals

January 9, 2017	By
		Mark Rachal and Dale Delay


       
    



Propane prices have been on a strong uptrend over the past year as fundamental conditions improve.

Mont Belvieu propane is currently trading at around 71 cents. At this point last year, Mont Belvieu was trading at 39 cents and trending lower. In fact, the year-low close came on Jan. 19 at 30.125 cents. Prices are 181 percent of last year’s price and 234 percent of last year’s low. Meanwhile, West Texas Intermediate crude is 149 percent of its January 2016 price and 205 percent of its $26.21 low set in February 2016.
The pricing data shows that propane prices have outgained crude over the past year. Last January, Mont Belvieu propane was trading at about 44 percent of West Texas Intermediate. Currently, Mont Belvieu is trading at around 55 percent.

Propane is now valued right at its five-year high relative to crude set in 2012. Propane was valued above its five-year average relative to crude for most of 2016 and even set some new five-year highs last year.
The higher gains in propane and resulting improvement in relative value to crude suggest changes in propane fundamentals are at play. Until recently, winter weather hasn’t been that much more supportive this year compared to last year. The key reason for the improvement in propane’s relative value is an increase in the ability to move propane production to markets.
New export facilities have eliminated the bottleneck that had suppressed propane values relative to crude in the past. Reports show a current export capacity of around 1.7 million barrels per day (bpd).
In December 2015, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) provided weekly estimates on propane exports of 720,000 bpd. In December 2016, the estimate was 944,000 bpd. For the week ending Dec. 23, EIA estimated 1.313 million bpd of exports – the highest weekly estimate ever. Even that rate is only 77 percent of the estimated export capacity.
Propane production continues to grow, but at a much slower pace than in previous years. At some point, increases in production will catch up to the new capacity, which could suppress prices again if additions in export capacity are not made.
But for now, the bottleneck is eliminated, allowing U.S. propane prices to fully reflect global demand. As long as spare export capacity exists, there will be increased risk to upside pricing pressure. There will also likely be less downward pressure on prices over the summer, which would mean the opportunity to buy supply in 2017 for as low as it was in 2016 is also at risk.
