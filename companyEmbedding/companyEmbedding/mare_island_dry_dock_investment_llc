Early Mare IslandDuring WW2Naval ShipyardRecent YearsToday 
In 1775, Spanish explorer Perez Ayala was the first European to land on what would become Mare Island - he named it Isla de la Plana. This area was part of Rancho Suscol, deeded to General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo in 1844. It became a waypoint for early settlers. In 1835, whilst traversing the Carquinez Strait, a crude ferry transporting men and livestock capsized in a squall. Among the livestock feared lost in the wreckage was the prized white mare of General Mariano Guadalupe Vallejo, the Mexican Commandante for Northern California. Several days later, General Vallejo's mare was found on the island, having swum ashore. Grateful for the fortunate turn of events, he renamed the island to Isla de la Yegua, Spanish for Mare Island, in her honor.
In 1850 United States Navy Commodore John Drake Sloat led a survey party in quest of a logical site for the nation's first Pacific naval installation. Sloat recommended the island across the Napa River from the settlement of Vallejo, as it was "free from ocean gales and from floods and freshets."
On November 6, 1850, two months after California was admitted to statehood, President Fillmore reserved Mare Island for government use. The Navy Department acted favorably on Commodore Sloat's recommendations and Mare Island was purchased for use as a naval shipyard in July 1852 at a cost of $83,410. On September 16, 1854, Mare Island became the first permanent U.S. naval installation on the west coast, with Commodore David Farragut, as Mare Island's first commander.


During World War II, 16 submarines, five submarine tenders, and 392 ships were built on Mare Island as well as over 4,000 damaged vessels repaired.  Mare Island was the largest naval repair facility in the world that employed over 48,000 people, 100,000 including sub-contractors.
20% of the work force were women, Marian the Machinist and Wendy the Welder.  300 buses went out in a radius of 75 miles, 6 times per day to pick up and drop off workers.  They came from every state of the union (save Vermont).
One shop worked 24/7 roasting coffee beans to send out on ships leaving Mare Island; another worked 24/7 making five gallon paint cans.
Mare Island provided housing for 13,000 in homes and another 5,000 in dormitories.  Over 42,000 meals were prepared every day in four cafeterias, eight booths and 15 electrically heated carts.  Nearly 80,000 flags per month were made in the flag loft.

For over a century, Mare Island was the Navy's Mare Island Naval Shipyard. The growing size and number of the country's naval fleet was making older facilities obsolete and led to increased building and refitting of shipyards nationally. In 1872, the U.S. Public Works Department commenced construction of a 508-foot (155 m) drydock on the island, setting it on a foundation of cut granite blocks. The work was completed in 1891. A second drydock was begun in 1899, a concrete structure 740 feet (230 m) long set on wooden piles; it was completed in 1910. By 1941 a third drydock had been completed and drydock number four was under construction. The ammunition depot and submarine repair base were modern, fireproof buildings. A million dollar, three-way vehicle causeway to Vallejo replaced a ferry service.
Before World War II, Mare Island had been in a continual state of up-building. By 1941, new projects included improvements to the central power plant, a new pattern storage building, a large foundry, machine shop, magazine building, paint shop, new administration building, and a huge storehouse. The yard was expected to be able to repair and paint six to eight large naval vessels at a time. Several finger piers had recently been built, as well as a new shipbuilding wharf, adding one 500-foot (150 m) and a 750-foot (230 m) berth. It employed 5593 workers at the beginning of 1939, and rapidly increased to 18,500 by May 1941, with a monthly payroll of $3,500,000. In 1941, the drafting department had expanded to three buildings accommodating over 400 naval architects, engineers and draftsmen. The hospital had 584 beds.[2]
In 1969, the Navy transferred its (Vietnam War) Brown Water Navy Riverine Training Forces from Coronado, California to Mare Island. Swift Boats (Patrol Craft Fast-PCF), and PBRs (Patrol Boat River) conducted boat operations throughout the currently named Napa-Sonoma Marshes State Wildlife Area, on the north and west portions of Mare Island. Mare Island Naval Base was deactivated during the 1995 cycle of US base closures, but the U.S. Navy Reserves still have access to the water portions of the State Wildlife Area for any riverine warfare training being conducted from their new base in Sacramento, California.

In 1993 Congress approved the findings of the Base Realignment and Closure report, leading to the closure of Mare Island Naval Shipyard.  The shipyard had long been the economic engine of the city of Vallejo, having reached an employment peak of 40,000 workers during World War II, and even employing 10,000 workers after scaling back in 1988. When Congress ordered the base closure, the shipyard employed 5,800 workers.
The vision of rebuilding Mare Island as a vital place where people lived and worked was a key goal in the base conversion planning process undertaken by the city of Vallejo in the early 1990s. After the base was recommended for closure in 1993, the City undertook an extensive community-based reuse planning process, which resulted in a Final Reuse Plan that was approved by the Vallejo City Council in 1994. The Final Reuse Plan laid out the general vision for the Island’s redevelopment. The Reuse Plan was the basis for the Mare Island Specific Plan, which was approved in 1999 and amended in 2005 and 2007. The Mare Island Specific Plan designated land uses and established development standards for identified reuse areas and provided an implementation program to guide all subsequent planning activities.
Preservation of many of Mare Island’s 661 structures and other cultural resources was an additional factor in the planning process. As the oldest shipyard and naval facility on the West Coast, the shipyard earned a National Historic Landmark designation by the federal government in 1975. In 1979 California listed the entire naval base as a State Historical Landmark. In 1999 the city of Vallejo added Mare Island to the National Register of Historic Districts with 42 individual city landmarks.
Finally, as with any restoration of an industrial, brownfield landscape, both city and government agencies required environmental reviews, toxic substance removal, and soil remediation.
In 1998, Vallejo contracted with Lennar Mare Island LLC (LMI) to develop 650 acres of the eastern portion of Mare Island into a multi-use community. LMI contracted the Sausalito-based SWA Group to provide a Master Development Plan for Vallejo, additional historical research and landscape architectural services.
The Specific Plan included a variety of land uses, including a university district, and industrial zone, historic core, and residential neighborhoods. In addition, 78% of the island was set aside for wildlife habitat and wetlands, parkland and open space, and dredge ponds.[5] In 2007, LMI finished construction on the residential neighborhoods. Farragut Village, with 277 homes, was the first completed neighborhood. Additional neighborhoods include Coral Sea and Kirkland Isle II. Mare Island's Specific Plan calls for a total of1,400 homes and condos, plus 7,000,000 square feet (650,000 m2) of commercial, retail, entertainment, and industrial space.
Mare Island's residents petitioned LMI and the City of Vallejo to eliminate the dredge ponds, whose role had been to collect silt, drainage, and storm water from the Napa River and the Bay, and instead restore that acreage to wetlands. The city and the developer agreed, and in January 2006, the land use plan was amended to add the Mare Island Shoreline Heritage Preserve. An advisory board was appointed by the city to restore the 215-acre (0.87 km2) site into publicly accessible parkland.


Mare Island Dry Dock, LLC took over operations of Dry Dock 2 and Dry Dock 3 in 2013 and has steadily increased shipyard activity, acquiring contracts with government agencies including the United States Coast Guard, United States Navy, Department of Commerce and Military Sealift Command.

		DIGEST

		Allegation that agency unreasonably evaluated protester’s proposal is denied where record reflects that proposal did not clearly provide information required by solicitation and that evaluation was otherwise reasonable and consistent with solicitation terms.


			DECISION


		Mare Island Dry Dock, LLC (MIDD), of Vallejo, California, protests the award of a contract to Vigor Marine, LLC, of Portland, Oregon, by the Department of the Army, Corps of Engineers, under request for proposals (RFP) No. W9127N-14-R-0029 for ship repair services. MIDD asserts that the agency’s evaluation of its proposal was unreasonable.

		We deny the protest.

		BACKGROUND

		The solicitation, issued on August 29, 2014, contemplated the award of a fixed-price, indefinite-delivery/indefinite-quantity contract with a 1-year period of performance. RFP at 3-7. Award was to be made to the offeror that submitted the lowest-priced, technically acceptable proposal. Id. at 230.

		The solicitation established the following non-price evaluation factors: capabilities; recent relevant experience; safety; environmental compliance; and past performance. RFP at 230. The capabilities factor included two subfactors: pier and wet berth; and drydock. Id. The solicitation provided that a proposal would be deemed acceptable only if it was evaluated as meeting all of the minimum requirements specified under the evaluation factors and subfactors. See id. Additionally, the solicitation cautioned that “[p]roposals must set forth full, accurate and complete information as required by this RFP,” and that the “[a]bsence of information will be deemed as if no support for that criterion was provided.” Id. at 217. The solicitation also cautioned that the agency intended to make award without holding discussions. Id. at 230.

		Under the pier and wet berth subfactor, the solicitation listed the following “[m]inimum requirements”:


			a. Low water level of 25 feet;

			b. 380 feet between fore and aft tie off kevels;

			c. 50’-0” x 16’-0” clear dock working area;

			d. Documented pounds per square foot load capability;

			e. 1200A, 480V AC, 3-phase, 60 cycle electrical service with GFCI and phase protection[.]


		RFP at 231. Hence, under section (d) above, the solicitation required that proposals include “[d]ocumented pounds per square foot load capability” for the proposed pier and wet berth.

		The agency received two proposals in response to the solicitation--one from MIDD, and one from Vigor. Contracting Officer’s Statement at 4. A technical evaluation board (TEB) convened and evaluated the proposals. As relevant here, the TEB found that MIDD’s proposal failed to include the “[d]ocumented pounds per square foot load capability” for MIDD’s proposed pier and wet berth. Agency Report (AR), Tab 4, MIDD Technical Proposal Evaluation, at 4-5, 7. Because, as stated above, this was a minimum requirement under the pier and wet berth subfactor, the TEB assigned a rating of unacceptable to MIDD’s proposal under that subfactor. Id. at 7.

		After reviewing the TEB’s findings, the contracting officer, who also served as the source selection authority in this procurement, directed the contracting specialist to submit a clarification request to MIDD regarding whether the firm’s proposal included information documenting the pounds per square foot load capability of MIDD’s proposed pier and wet berth.[1] Contracting Officer’s Statement at 6. Thereafter, the contracting specialist sent the following communication to MIDD:


			This e-mail is a request for clarification per FAR [Federal Acquisition Regulation] 15.306(a). This e‑mail does not constitute discussions per FAR 15.306(b).

			[T]he subject RFP, Sub-factor 1 (Pier and Wet Berth) requests for Offerors to document pounds per square foot load capability. After reading through and evaluating [MIDD’s] proposal, requested information could not be located for the wet berth pier. Please identify where in [the] proposal, the information can be found. Make reference to the applicable tab and/or appendix.


		AR, Tab 9, Agency/MIDD Correspondence, at 2 (emphasis in original).

		MIDD responded by providing a one-page “design memorandum” with the subject line “Berth bearing load capacity--Clarification of Appendix I quay wall plans and sections.” AR, Tab 9, Agency/MIDD Correspondence, at 3. The memorandum described the construction of MIDD’s pier and wet berth, including the extensive use of concrete. See id. The memorandum also provided the load capacity of MIDD’s proposed pier and wet berth, as extrapolated from the “average shear capacity for asphalt concrete.” Id. Although it generally referenced appendix I in the subject line, the memorandum did not identify any specific information in MIDD’s proposal providing the pounds per square foot load capability of the proposed pier and wet berth. See id.

		After reviewing MIDD’s submission, the contracting specialist informed the firm as follows: “Unfortunately, what has been presented was not in the proposal submitted by [MIDD]; therefore, I cannot accept it.” AR, Tab 9, Agency/MIDD Correspondence, at 4.

		Following these communications, a source selection evaluation board (SSEB) prepared a report for the contracting officer. AR, Tab 7, SSEB Report. The report established the total evaluated price for MIDD’s proposal as $6,309,383 and the total evaluated price for Vigor’s proposal as $6,406,900. Id. at 1. However, the report designated MIDD’s proposal as technically unacceptable based on the finding that it failed to meet the requirement for providing a pounds per square foot load capability under the pier and wet berth subfactor. Id. at 1, 7. Vigor’s proposal, on the other hand, was designated as technically acceptable. Id. at 1.

		The contracting officer reviewed the evaluation record and agreed with the SSEB’s determination that Vigor had submitted the lowest-priced, technically acceptable proposal. AR, Tab 8, Source Selection Decision Document, at 1, 8-9. Accordingly, the contracting officer selected Vigor for award. Id. at 9. After award was made, MIDD filed a protest with our Office.

		DISCUSSION

		MIDD asserts that the agency’s determination that its proposal was unacceptable under the pier and wet berth subfactor was unreasonable, arguing that the agency failed to properly review a drawing in appendix I to the proposal. See Protest at 3-7; Comments at 2-3. According to MIDD, if the agency had adequately reviewed this drawing, it would have determined that the proposal met or exceeded the solicitation’s requirements. See Protest at 3-7; Comments at 2-3. More particularly, MIDD argues that the drawing depicts the use of concrete in the firm’s pier and wet berth and that concrete “is commonly understood in the commercial sector as providing a minimum of 400 psf [pounds per square foot] load capabilities.” Protest at 5, 8; Comments at 2-3. Based on this, MIDD asserts that its proposal met or exceeded the solicitation’s requirement for “[d]ocumented pounds per square foot load capability” of the pier and wet berth. For the reasons discussed below, we disagree.

		It is an offeror’s responsibility to submit a well-written proposal, with adequately detailed information which clearly demonstrates compliance with the solicitation requirements and allows a meaningful review by the procuring agency. Int’l Med. Corps, B-403688, Dec. 6, 2010, 2010 CPD ¶ 292 at 7; CACI Techs., Inc., B‑296946, Oct. 27, 2005, 2005 CPD ¶ 198 at 5. A proposal that fails to conform to material terms of the solicitation may be considered unacceptable and not form the basis for an award. Gordon R. A. Fishman, B-257634.3, Nov. 9, 1995, 95-2 CPD ¶ 217 at 2.

		As stated above, the solicitation cautioned that “[p]roposals must set forth full, accurate and complete information as required by this RFP,” and that the “[a]bsence of information will be deemed as if no support for that criterion was provided.” RFP at 217. As also stated above, under the pier and wet berth subfactor, the solicitation expressly required that proposals include “[d]ocumented pounds per square foot load capability” of the proposed pier and wet berth. Id. at 231. The contracting officer explains that the solicitation included this requirement so the agency “could assess the contractor’s knowledge of the load capability of its chosen pier and wet berth.” Contracting Officer’s Statement at 5. The contracting officer further explains that

		this knowledge is particularly important to determine how to distribute the Agency’s equipment when unloading at the contractor’s pier. The Agency’s equipment is heavy and could be damaged if the pier fails because the weight of the equipment is not distributed properly in light of the load capability of the pier.

		Contracting Officer’s Statement at 5.

		It is not apparent from our review of the record that MIDD’s proposal presented the pounds per square foot load capability of the firm’s proposed pier and wet berth. Further, in its protest and comments on the agency report, MIDD does not cite any specific proposal content that expressly provides the pounds per square foot load capability of the proposed pier and wet berth. Rather, MIDD in essence argues that the agency should have inferred the pounds per square foot load capability for the proposed pier and wet berth because the drawing in appendix I depicted the use of concrete in the pier and wet berth. However, the solicitation explicitly called for offerors to provide the pounds per square foot load capacity. MIDD’s proposal failed to provide this information. We therefore find the challenged evaluation finding to be reasonable.

		MIDD also alleges that the agency improperly failed to consider the information provided in the firm’s response to the clarification request. Protest at 7-8; Comments at 4-6. Had the agency considered this information, MIDD argues, the firm’s proposal would have been deemed acceptable under the pier and wet berth subfactor. Protest at 7-8; Comments at 4-6. Alternatively, MIDD argues that the agency should have opened discussions with the firm. Protest at 8-9; Comments at 6-7. We see no merit in these claims.

		As discussed above, we find that the agency reasonably determined MIDD’s proposal to be technically unacceptable on the basis that it did not include documentation of the pounds per square foot load capability of the proposed pier and wet berth. Had the agency considered the information in MIDD’s clarification response and determined the proposal to be technically acceptable based on that information, the agency would have in effect opened discussions with MIDD. See FAR § 15.306(b)(2); Sletten Cos./Sletten Constr. Co., B‑402422, Apr. 21, 2010, 2010 CPD ¶ 97 at 7; Battelle Mem’l Inst., B-299533, May 14, 2007, 2007 CPD ¶ 94 at 4. However, there generally is no obligation for an agency to conduct discussions where, as here, the solicitation specifically instructs offerors that award may be made on the basis of initial proposals. FAR § 15.306(a)(3); Colmek Sys. Eng’g, B-291931.2, July 9, 2003, 2003 CPD ¶ 123 at 7. Further, an agency is not precluded from making award on the basis of initial proposals merely because an unacceptable lower-priced offer might be made acceptable through discussions. Integration Techs. Group, Inc., B-274288.5, June 13, 1997, 97-1 CPD ¶ 214 at 6. Moreover, a contracting officer has broad discretion in deciding whether to hold discussions, id., and an agency’s decision not to initiate discussions is a matter we generally will not review, Kiewit La. Co., B‑403736, Oct. 14, 2010, 2010 CPD ¶ 243 at 3. Based on the record here, we see nothing to call into question the agency’s decision not to engage in discussions.

		Finally, MIDD alleges, without substantive elaboration, that the award was improper because the agency purportedly “set Vigor Marine’s proposed approach as the only approach that could satisfy the Agency’s requirements.” Protest at 10; Comments at 8. Our Bid Protest Regulations require that a protest include a detailed statement of the legal and factual grounds for protest. 4 C.F.R. § 21.1(c)(4), (f) (2014). This requirement contemplates that protesters will provide, at a minimum, either allegations or evidence sufficient for our Office to reasonably conclude that a violation of procurement statute or regulation has occurred. See View One, Inc., B‑400346, July 30, 2008, 2008 CPD ¶ 142 at 3. Bare assertions that an award was improper, with neither evidence nor explanation of the protester’s theory regarding the alleged violation, are insufficient to satisfy this Office’s requirements. MIDD’s allegation fails to meet these threshold requirements, and we therefore will not further consider it.

		The protest is denied.

[1] The contracting officer states this action was taken to “eliminate the possibility that the evaluators overlooked this information in [MIDD’s] proposal.” Contracting Officer’s Statement at 6.

New ship repair company to replace existing firm at Mare Island








        The drydock caisson is slowly pushed by a tugboat to the mouth of Drydock #3 as the USS Kansas City is secured following its arrival at Mare Island Ship Yard in July. The business has requested and been granted an early end to its lease with Lennar Mare Island, with another business, Mare Island Dry Dock, taking its place.   (Mike Jory/Times-Herald)

Mare Island will trade one waterfront marine company for another, the area's developer announced Monday.Mare Island Shipyard LLC, the company that put two of the former naval shipyard's giant dry docks back into use at the beginning of 2011, has exercised its right to end its lease with developer Lennar Mare Island years early and is due to depart by Nov. 1, the developer's spokesman said."LMI (Lennar Mare Island) has made every effort to support and retain MISY (Mare Island Ship Yard) and we regret the new ownership group chose to end their lease early," Lennar Mare Island spokesman Jason Keadjian said Monday.The new company, called Mare Island Dry Dock, LLC, recently completed a lease for an undetermined time period for Dry Docks 2 and 3 and will occupy the same 16 acres and existing infrastructure as current tenant Mare Island Ship Yard has, Keadjian said. This company will focus immediately on ship repair work, officials say."We've got many things to do to be prepared and as they say in the Navy, 'hit the decks running,' " Mare Island Dry Docks Vice President Steven Park said by phone Monday. "We have been looking for a West Coast, and I do mean West Coast location. We've looked for the last nearly two years for a suitable location."The new company hopes to create as many as 100 jobs in its first year, and up to 300 in a five-year period, and repair and/or maintain up to 20 ships a year, according to a Lennar press release. Park added that it is "fundamental" to meet with and reach out to existing employees.Financial backing and management for the operation comes from Philadelphia-based investment group Dimeling, Schreiber & Park, which has a history of investing and managing large-scale shipyard operations in Boston, Philadelphia and New York, according to the release.Mare Island Ship Yard LLC, formerly Allied Defense Recycling, was still formulating a public response to the abrupt announcement Monday and declined to comment beforehand. The company first shared with Lennar its plans to leave in June, setting in motion a search for a replacement tenant, Keadjian said. The Times-Herald's recent inquiries to Mare Island Ship Yard into the company's health, prior to Lennar Mare Island's announcement, were dismissed as inaccurate rumors.The Mare Island company, which opened for business in February 2011, originally touted plans to seek out federal contracts with the U.S. Maritime Administration, or MARAD, to scrap "mothballed" ships from the nearby Suisun Bay Reserve Fleet, off Benicia's shores.The shipyard, however, was only able to dismantle two of those ships, the Solon Turman and the Lincoln -- those contracts awarded on a non-competitive basis. Once up against other ship dismantling companies, particularly those based in Texas, Mare Island Ship Yard was unable to secure further dismantling contracts.In fact, the ship scrapping dynamic altered significantly during Mare Island Ship Yard's first year -- from having the government pay for the recycling work to having companies competing to pay millions purchase the ships outright. Mare Island Ship Yard did, however, begin supplementing its federal hull-cleaning jobs with other smaller ship repair and dismantling work in recent years, ideas originally floated in the months prior to the shipyard's opening.Mare Island Dry Dock will neighbor historic Dry Dock 1 and Dry Dock 4, recently leased to Jerico Products/Lind Brothers as a company expansion.Contact staff writer Jessica A.
