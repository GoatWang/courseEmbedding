Powering the World
Energy is essential to our lives. We all rely on energy—to keep the lights on, to get to work, or to heat or cool our homes. As populations around the globe — particularly in developing nations — grow and become increasingly urbanized, the demand for energy is increasing.

                            Read More
                        









Building Infrastructure
Steelmaking coal is an essential ingredient in the production of steel. Also called metallurgical or coking coal, it is a necessary ingredient in producing steel for building infrastructure such as rail, bridges and schools improving the quality of life for people around the world. Steel and steelmaking coal are required for everything from clean energy projects like wind or solar power to transportation like rapid transit, buses and vehicles.

                            Read More
                        









Enabling Technology
Copper is an essential part of people’s lives. Today, copper is the material of choice for powering our modern world as a vital component in everything from power generation and hybrid vehicles to computers and smartphones.

                            Read More
                        









Saving Lives
Zinc protects steel by improving its durability. The primary uses of zinc are for galvanizing steel to protect against weather and corrosion, producing brass and bronze, and in die-casting to produce a wide range of metal products. When added to fertilizers, zinc can increase crop yields and crop quality. And, as an essential nutrient in human development and disease prevention, zinc saves lives.

Powering the World
Energy is essential to our lives. We all rely on energy—to keep the lights on, to get to work, or to heat or cool our homes. As populations around the globe — particularly in developing nations — grow and become increasingly urbanized, the demand for energy is increasing.

                            Read More
                        









Building Infrastructure
Steelmaking coal is an essential ingredient in the production of steel. Also called metallurgical or coking coal, it is a necessary ingredient in producing steel for building infrastructure such as rail, bridges and schools improving the quality of life for people around the world. Steel and steelmaking coal are required for everything from clean energy projects like wind or solar power to transportation like rapid transit, buses and vehicles.

                            Read More
                        









Enabling Technology
Copper is an essential part of people’s lives. Today, copper is the material of choice for powering our modern world as a vital component in everything from power generation and hybrid vehicles to computers and smartphones.

                            Read More
                        









Saving Lives
Zinc protects steel by improving its durability. The primary uses of zinc are for galvanizing steel to protect against weather and corrosion, producing brass and bronze, and in die-casting to produce a wide range of metal products. When added to fertilizers, zinc can increase crop yields and crop quality. And, as an essential nutrient in human development and disease prevention, zinc saves lives.

Powering the World
Energy is essential to our lives. We all rely on energy—to keep the lights on, to get to work, or to heat or cool our homes. As populations around the globe — particularly in developing nations — grow and become increasingly urbanized, the demand for energy is increasing.

                            Read More
                        









Building Infrastructure
Steelmaking coal is an essential ingredient in the production of steel. Also called metallurgical or coking coal, it is a necessary ingredient in producing steel for building infrastructure such as rail, bridges and schools improving the quality of life for people around the world. Steel and steelmaking coal are required for everything from clean energy projects like wind or solar power to transportation like rapid transit, buses and vehicles.

                            Read More
                        









Enabling Technology
Copper is an essential part of people’s lives. Today, copper is the material of choice for powering our modern world as a vital component in everything from power generation and hybrid vehicles to computers and smartphones.

                            Read More
                        









Saving Lives
Zinc protects steel by improving its durability. The primary uses of zinc are for galvanizing steel to protect against weather and corrosion, producing brass and bronze, and in die-casting to produce a wide range of metal products. When added to fertilizers, zinc can increase crop yields and crop quality. And, as an essential nutrient in human development and disease prevention, zinc saves lives.

History[edit]
Cominco started in 1906 as The Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company of Canada, formed by the amalgamation of several units controlled by the Canadian Pacific Railway. CM&S, or "Smelters" as it was often called by investors, changed its name to Cominco in 1966. Cominco's core Sullivan Mine in Kimberley, British Columbia which began production of lead, zinc, silver and tin in 1909, would operate for more than 90 years until its ore reserves exhausted in 2001.
Teck began as Teck-Hughes Gold Mines Limited in 1913, to develop a gold discovery by prospectors Sandy McIntyre and James Hughes at Kirkland Lake, Ontario.[5] The Teck-Hughes Mine would produce for 50 years until 1965. The Beaverdell Mine, purchased by Teck in 1969, went back even further to 1898, and produced silver until 1991.
The association between Teck and Cominco began in 1986, when Teck and two industry partners acquired a shareholding from CP Limited, and culminated with the merging of the two companies in July 2001.
On May 8, 2006, Teck Cominco offered to purchase Inco for $16 billion, but CVRD eventually purchased it for $17 billion.
On July 29, 2008 Teck Cominco announced an agreement with Fording Canadian Coal Trust, which owned a 60% stake in the Elk Valley Coal Partnership, to purchase 100% of its assets. Teck Cominco had been the minority owner of the Elk Valley Coal Partnership, with a 40% stake. The facilities are located near Fernie, British Columbia. The purchase was closed on October 30, 2008, with a final cost of $14-billion USD. Elk Valley Coal Corporation will be renamed Teck Coal Limited. The purchase resulted in Teck taking on $9.8-billion USD in debt; the company has suspended dividends, cut spending, and is selling some assets to save money.[6] On January 9, 2009, the company also announced a plan to cut 13% of their total workforce, amounting to 1,400 jobs, saving the company $85 million. Coal production targets were also lowered by 20% in response to declining worldwide demand for steel, in the midst of the global financial crisis.[7]

Beginning October 1, 2008, Teck Cominco began rebranding itself as Teck.[8] The legal name of the company was changed to Teck Resources Ltd. on 23 April 2009 after being approved by shareholders the previous day.[9]
In 2008, its $25 million donation to BC Children's Hospital Foundation earned its name attached to the Teck Acute Care Centre expected to complete construction in 2017.[10]
In July 2009, China Investment Corporation bought a 17% stake in Teck for C$1.74bn.[11]
In 2012, the Company announced record earning, record profit and record production, thus ending the year 2011 with $4.4 billion in cash. Besides expanding into Energy sector, the company was also executing two major projects in Chile and planning a $600 million restart of its Quintette Mine near Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia.[12]
Environmental record[edit]
In the past, Teck Cominco has been criticized and sued for violating environmental laws and standards. Teck Resources, however, has made "best in class" environmental and social performance a priority of late, and is getting recognized for its efforts; awards for safety, reclamation and sustainable development are all available for public scrutiny on their website, as is their sustainability report.[13]

The company's smelter in Trail, British Columbia was blamed in 2003 for heavily contaminating the Columbia River.[14] Legal action taken by American citizens living in settlements downriver progressed to the U.S. Supreme Court and was recently denied certiorari, solidifying the Appellate Court's holding that Teck is subject to U.S. jurisdiction even though it is a Canadian company.
A refinery belonging to Teck in Trail, British Columbia was the site of a lead spill into the Columbia River on May 28, 2008.[15]
The company's Red Dog mine operation in north-western Alaska has been ranked by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as one of the most polluting facilities in the United States based on output tonnage of toxic waste, largely (over 99%)in the form of blasted and moved, but otherwise unprocessed, waste rock from mining operations.[16][17] Residents living downstream from the mine launched a lawsuit against Teck Cominco, demanding that the Red Dog mine complies with its environmental obligations and that it pay fines for continuing to violate its water permit requirements. On November 30, 2007, the company released the final report of its six-year study, with the oversight of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, of risks of dust escaping from traffic along what is officially known as the DeLong Mountain Regional Transportation System Road. The final report incorporates formal comments and input from a wide range of government agencies and stakeholders, including local village residents. The risk assessment concludes it is safe to consume subsistence foods in all areas without restrictions.[18]
After a long running court case filed by Washington state’s Native American Colville Confederated Tribes over environmental damage from smelter effluents, Teck Resources confessed to polluting the upper reaches of the Columbia River for nearly a century.[19] According to reports, the Teck smelter in the city of Trail disposed of hazardous effluent in adjacent river systems between 1896 and 1995.[19]
The Colville Confederated Tribes filed a lawsuit against Teck Cominco in 2004 claiming the company had dumped 140,000 tons of slag directly into the river, polluting the surface water, ground water and sediment of the upper Columbia River and Lake Roosevelt with hazardous metals including arsenic, cadmium, mercury, lead, copper and zinc.[19]

The Colville Confederated Tribes filed a lawsuit against Teck Cominco in 2004 claiming the company had dumped 140,000 tons of slag directly into the river, polluting the surface water, ground water and sediment of the upper Columbia River and Lake Roosevelt with hazardous metals including arsenic, cadmium, mercury, lead, copper and zinc.[19]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

History[edit]
Cominco started in 1906 as The Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company of Canada, formed by the amalgamation of several units controlled by the Canadian Pacific Railway. CM&S, or "Smelters" as it was often called by investors, changed its name to Cominco in 1966. Cominco's core Sullivan Mine in Kimberley, British Columbia which began production of lead, zinc, silver and tin in 1909, would operate for more than 90 years until its ore reserves exhausted in 2001.
Teck began as Teck-Hughes Gold Mines Limited in 1913, to develop a gold discovery by prospectors Sandy McIntyre and James Hughes at Kirkland Lake, Ontario.[5] The Teck-Hughes Mine would produce for 50 years until 1965. The Beaverdell Mine, purchased by Teck in 1969, went back even further to 1898, and produced silver until 1991.
The association between Teck and Cominco began in 1986, when Teck and two industry partners acquired a shareholding from CP Limited, and culminated with the merging of the two companies in July 2001.
On May 8, 2006, Teck Cominco offered to purchase Inco for $16 billion, but CVRD eventually purchased it for $17 billion.
On July 29, 2008 Teck Cominco announced an agreement with Fording Canadian Coal Trust, which owned a 60% stake in the Elk Valley Coal Partnership, to purchase 100% of its assets. Teck Cominco had been the minority owner of the Elk Valley Coal Partnership, with a 40% stake. The facilities are located near Fernie, British Columbia. The purchase was closed on October 30, 2008, with a final cost of $14-billion USD. Elk Valley Coal Corporation will be renamed Teck Coal Limited. The purchase resulted in Teck taking on $9.8-billion USD in debt; the company has suspended dividends, cut spending, and is selling some assets to save money.[6] On January 9, 2009, the company also announced a plan to cut 13% of their total workforce, amounting to 1,400 jobs, saving the company $85 million. Coal production targets were also lowered by 20% in response to declining worldwide demand for steel, in the midst of the global financial crisis.[7]




Teck Cominco logo before 2008 rebranding.


Beginning October 1, 2008, Teck Cominco began rebranding itself as Teck.[8] The legal name of the company was changed to Teck Resources Ltd. on 23 April 2009 after being approved by shareholders the previous day.[9]
In 2008, its $25 million donation to BC Children's Hospital Foundation earned its name attached to the Teck Acute Care Centre expected to complete construction in 2017.[10]
In July 2009, China Investment Corporation bought a 17% stake in Teck for C$1.74bn.[11]
In 2012, the Company announced record earning, record profit and record production, thus ending the year 2011 with $4.4 billion in cash. Besides expanding into Energy sector, the company was also executing two major projects in Chile and planning a $600 million restart of its Quintette Mine near Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia.[12]
Environmental record[edit]
In the past, Teck Cominco has been criticized and sued for violating environmental laws and standards. Teck Resources, however, has made "best in class" environmental and social performance a priority of late, and is getting recognized for its efforts; awards for safety, reclamation and sustainable development are all available for public scrutiny on their website, as is their sustainability report.[13]

The company's smelter in Trail, British Columbia was blamed in 2003 for heavily contaminating the Columbia River.[14] Legal action taken by American citizens living in settlements downriver progressed to the U.S. Supreme Court and was recently denied certiorari, solidifying the Appellate Court's holding that Teck is subject to U.S. jurisdiction even though it is a Canadian company.
A refinery belonging to Teck in Trail, British Columbia was the site of a lead spill into the Columbia River on May 28, 2008.[15]
The company's Red Dog mine operation in north-western Alaska has been ranked by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency as one of the most polluting facilities in the United States based on output tonnage of toxic waste, largely (over 99%)in the form of blasted and moved, but otherwise unprocessed, waste rock from mining operations.[16][17] Residents living downstream from the mine launched a lawsuit against Teck Cominco, demanding that the Red Dog mine complies with its environmental obligations and that it pay fines for continuing to violate its water permit requirements. On November 30, 2007, the company released the final report of its six-year study, with the oversight of the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation, of risks of dust escaping from traffic along what is officially known as the DeLong Mountain Regional Transportation System Road. The final report incorporates formal comments and input from a wide range of government agencies and stakeholders, including local village residents. The risk assessment concludes it is safe to consume subsistence foods in all areas without restrictions.[18]
After a long running court case filed by Washington state’s Native American Colville Confederated Tribes over environmental damage from smelter effluents, Teck Resources confessed to polluting the upper reaches of the Columbia River for nearly a century.[19] According to reports, the Teck smelter in the city of Trail disposed of hazardous effluent in adjacent river systems between 1896 and 1995.[19]
The Colville Confederated Tribes filed a lawsuit against Teck Cominco in 2004 claiming the company had dumped 140,000 tons of slag directly into the river, polluting the surface water, ground water and sediment of the upper Columbia River and Lake Roosevelt with hazardous metals including arsenic, cadmium, mercury, lead, copper and zinc.[19]

Reclamation Example: Reclamation Research at Fording River and Greenhills



December 01, 2016





                        Share






















Fording River and Greenhills Elkford, British Columbia
Type: Steelmaking coal mine
Active: Fording River, 1972–today. Greenhills, 1983–today
Status: Progressive reclamation during mining; active reclamation research program
Our Fording River mine in the Elk Valley of southeastern B.C. is a pioneering site in mining reclamation research, having led research and development of best practices and improved techniques for decades.
Environment personnel at Fording River began to incorporate reclamation research in the early 1980s, conducting early studies on optimal approaches to slope preparation, site preparation, species selection, and the spacing and timing of revegetation. From this research we developed our operational best practices, which we have refined over the last 30 years. 
We still learn from the work being undertaken at Fording as we continue to conduct monitoring and research on the response of the vegetation to our treatments. We carry that new knowledge forward into our operational practice, to see improvements and to realize our goals of net positive impact for biodiversity. 
At our Greenhills mine, located adjacent to Fording River, we are conducting reclamation research at the Rosebowl, a 30-hectare site where leftover rock was piled during mining. This research is focused on better understanding what types of plant species are best for revegetation and what kind of soil treatments may help to retain moisture to support vegetation growth. 
For this research, we create mounds, similar to moguls on a ski hill, which provide shade and wind protection and help to increase moisture in the trenches between them—all things that promote vegetation. We plant a variety of species, from herbs to shrubs to conifers; each species is targeted towards the conditions found in individual portions of the mounded surfaces. Studying the areas prepared in this manner is helping us determine which native species are best suited to grow in which  specific conditions.

Reclamation Example: Rehabilitating Historic Sites



December 01, 2016





                        Share






















 Teck American implemented the closure plan with an unwavering commitment to health and public safety, as well as the preservation of significant wildlife habitat. - U.S. Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management
McCracken Mine Signal, Arizona
Type: Silver-lead-zinc mine
Active: Intermittently from 1870s – 1985
Status: Closure and reclamation work to improve safety and environment
In some cases, Teck’s commitment to responsible closure and reclamation can mean rehabilitating sites that we never actually mined. An example of this is the former McCracken Mine in Arizona. An historically significant silver mine in Arizona, the McCracken Mine was mined episodically between the 1870s and 1985. Though Teck acquired the title to the patented claims for McCracken, we never operated the mine.
Surveys of the site determined that safety risks posed by old openings to underground workings required extensive closure work. Teck undertook that work in 2008, securing nearly 50 mine openings to ensure safety. That closure included collaborating with wildlife experts to install specially-designed gates and other barriers that protected underground habitat for four different species of bats, while closing human access to the mine.
In 2015 and 2016, Teck undertook additional voluntary reclamation work in partnership with the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, removing approximately 20,000 cubic yards of historic tailings from adjacent public lands and placing them into an engineered repository on Teck property, further enhancing safety and environmental protection at the former mine. During the reclamation work, special care was taken to prevent harm to protected species including Sonoran Desert Tortoise and migratory birds.
Teck’s efforts to responsibly close and reclaim this historic site were recognized with the Bureau of Land Management’s “Fix a Shaft Today’ award and the Arizona State Mine Inspector’s Abandoned Mines Program Voluntary Action Award.

Reclamation Example:  From a Tailings Pond to a Trout Pond



December 01, 2016





                        Share






















The Trojan Pond reclamation site has become an excellent community resource for environmental education and outdoor recreation. Over the past several years, the Freshwater Fisheries Society of BC has delivered Learn to Fish programs for youth and their families, as well as participated in various other tremendously popular fishing events hosted by Highland Valley Copper.  - Mike Gass, Manager of Sport Fishing Development, Freshwater Fisheries Society of BC
Highland Valley Copper near Logan Lake, British Columbia
Type: Copper mine
Active: 1962–today
Status: Progressive reclamation of former mining areas during ongoing mining activity
Trojan Pond at our Highland Valley Copper Operations near Kamloops, B.C. was once a working tailings pond. Through the work of our environmental officers and aquatic biologists, it has been reclaimed into a naturally functioning, self-sustaining lake ecosystem, complete with healthy populations of fish. 
The process of transforming Trojan Pond into a functioning ecosystem began at the very bottom of the food chain. First, phosphorus and nitrogen were added to the pond to balance out the nutrients already present and get the base of the food chain started. Then, we introduced bacteria, which are a key component of ecosystems. Once the bacteria were established, we introduced algae to the mix. Algae help create a healthy habitat for fish by removing much of the metals present in the water. 
Zooplankton, tiny organisms that eat algae, are also introduced. Once a population of zooplankton was established, we began to introduce fish. 
Trojan Pond has now been self-sustaining for 20 years and serves an important role both in ongoing research on tailings pond reclamation techniques and as a recreational area for the community. Highland Valley Copper hosts multiple fishing derbies at Trojan Pond each year, with funds raised going to support charities in the region.

Reclamation Example: Making a Mine Pit into an Aquatic Habitat



December 01, 2016





                        Share






















Luscar mining area at Cardinal River Operations Hinton, Alberta
Type: Steelmaking coal mine
Active: 1969–2004
Status: Ongoing reclamation of former mining areas; end land use plan established
Comprehensive early reclamation planning has helped create a habitat for rainbow trout and bull trout to thrive out of a former mining pit at our Cardinal River steelmaking coal operations near Hinton, Alberta. 
Cardinal River Operations is one of Teck’s six steelmaking coal operations in western Canada. Located within the Luscar mine, this pit was actively mined from 1992 to 1999. As it was located in the drainage of Sphinx Creek, prior to mining a channel was made for Sphinx Creek to go around the active site. Once mining was complete, our goal for reclamation was to restore the flow of the creek and establish a fish habitat as good, or better, than before the mine. 
First, the Sphinx Lake pit lake system was constructed by replacing and reshaping the material removed during mining to backfill some of the pit, and then filling it with water. The next step was constructing an inlet and outlet channel for the lake, as well as habitat suitable for aquatic plants and other life. 
Next, Sphinx Creek was redirected into the newly constructed channel into the lake, serving as a spawning and rearing stream. 
We’ve watched over the years as Sphinx Lake has flourished, and today it meets all of the criteria for an ecologically healthy lake. The Sphinx Creek watershed now provides healthy habitat for a substantial population of both resident and migratory native rainbow trout, as well as bull trout—both of which are listed as Species of Special Concern by Alberta’s Endangered Species Conservation Committee. 
In 2007, our work to create Sphinx Lake was awarded the Major Reclamation Award by the Alberta Chamber of Resources.

First, the Sphinx Lake pit lake system was constructed by replacing and reshaping the material removed during mining to backfill some of the pit, and then filling it with water. The next step was constructing an inlet and outlet channel for the lake, as well as habitat suitable for aquatic plants and other life. 
Next, Sphinx Creek was redirected into the newly constructed channel into the lake, serving as a spawning and rearing stream. 
We’ve watched over the years as Sphinx Lake has flourished, and today it meets all of the criteria for an ecologically healthy lake. The Sphinx Creek watershed now provides healthy habitat for a substantial population of both resident and migratory native rainbow trout, as well as bull trout—both of which are listed as Species of Special Concern by Alberta’s Endangered Species Conservation Committee. 
In 2007, our work to create Sphinx Lake was awarded the Major Reclamation Award by the Alberta Chamber of Resources.

Reclamation Example: Saving Soil at Greenhills



December 01, 2016





                        Share






















Every area we mine, we do so knowing that in the  future, we’ll need to reclaim it back to a more natural state. Salvaging soils is an important part of that  long-term process. - Dan Charest, Environmental Officer, Greenhills Operations
Greenhills
Elkford, British Columbia
Type: Steelmaking coal mine
Active: 1983–today
Status: Progressive reclamation during mining; researching improved reclamation techniques
Our objective in conducting reclamation is to conserve and re-establish the biodiversity of a mine site, in order to replace much or most of the diversity of natural ecosystems that existed before mining and create a positive legacy for the environment and local communities.
An important technique we use is salvaging soil to assist in the re-vegetation of mined areas. A project undertaken at an area of our Greenhills operation in southeast British Columbia is an example of how we salvage soil for later use in reclamation. We salvaged soil over a large area to a depth of nearly 1 metre—including woody debris such as stumps—and stockpiled it for later use in reclamation activities. To maximize productivity, 16 pieces of soil-mulching equipment worked simultaneously, chewing up woody debris and mixing it all into the soil. 
Over the course of the project, we salvaged and saved approximately 1 million cubic metres of this earthy material—the equivalent of about 17 million large bags of soil from a home gardening store.
The soil is stockpiled outside the footprint of the active mine area and is now being used to cover the areas where mining activity has been completed via progressive reclamation, which will occur from now until 2035.
This project demonstrates how we can work to improve reclamation techniques such as soil salvaging, and the importance of the measures we take early in the mining process to help ensure we can fully reclaim mined areas in the future.

Reclamation Example: Saving Soil at Greenhills



December 01, 2016





                        Share






















Every area we mine, we do so knowing that in the  future, we’ll need to reclaim it back to a more natural state. Salvaging soils is an important part of that  long-term process. - Dan Charest, Environmental Officer, Greenhills Operations
Greenhills
Elkford, British Columbia
Type: Steelmaking coal mine
Active: 1983–today
Status: Progressive reclamation during mining; researching improved reclamation techniques
Our objective in conducting reclamation is to conserve and re-establish the biodiversity of a mine site, in order to replace much or most of the diversity of natural ecosystems that existed before mining and create a positive legacy for the environment and local communities.
An important technique we use is salvaging soil to assist in the re-vegetation of mined areas. A project undertaken at an area of our Greenhills operation in southeast British Columbia is an example of how we salvage soil for later use in reclamation. We salvaged soil over a large area to a depth of nearly 1 metre—including woody debris such as stumps—and stockpiled it for later use in reclamation activities. To maximize productivity, 16 pieces of soil-mulching equipment worked simultaneously, chewing up woody debris and mixing it all into the soil. 
Over the course of the project, we salvaged and saved approximately 1 million cubic metres of this earthy material—the equivalent of about 17 million large bags of soil from a home gardening store.
The soil is stockpiled outside the footprint of the active mine area and is now being used to cover the areas where mining activity has been completed via progressive reclamation, which will occur from now until 2035.
This project demonstrates how we can work to improve reclamation techniques such as soil salvaging, and the importance of the measures we take early in the mining process to help ensure we can fully reclaim mined areas in the future.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
