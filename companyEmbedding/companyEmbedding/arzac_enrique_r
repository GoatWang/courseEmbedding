Description

                    Praise for Valuation for Mergers, Buyouts, and Restructuring  "Enrique Arzac has provided an excellent analytical framework for the LBO business."--William T. Comfort, Chairman, Citigroup Venture Capital  "Enrique Arzac has created a masterpiece--his work combines the theoretical with the practical. He has created an invaluable reference guide that is thoughtful, complete and very user friendly. He provides insight into the theory behind core valuation, LBO's, and options pricing, which creates the foundation for mergers, buyouts and restructuring. In addition to the theoretical, he provides practical insight into deal structuring and deal dynamics. His work should be standard material for all incoming associates."--James P. McVeigh, Managing Director, Corporate & Investment Banking, Banc of America Securities  "This first-rate book of applied financial theory provides the tools for financial institutions and capital market participants seeking a methodology for comparing, contrasting, and evaluating investment opportunities and options.
By inc orporating over 30 years of research, teaching, and practical experience, Professor Arzac has created a text that us not only timely, but timeless in its usefulness to anyone interested in learning the applications of financial theory for the best and most useful allocation of the scarcest economic resource in the world--capital."--William W. Priest, Co-Managing Partner, Steinberg, Priest and Sloane Capital Management and Former Chairman and CEO of Credit Suisse Asset Management  "There are two important aspects in graduate business education. The first is acquiring a thorough understanding of the theories of modern finance and the second is acquiring an appreciation for how these theories can be applied to important decisions. Enrique Arzac has taken on this task and made it a successful venture for readers of this book. Unlike other texts on valuation, he explains the reasons for the process and sequence that he recommends rather than just providing the ingredients and the recipe without explanation. This is a welcome addition to the literature in applied corporate finance."--Joel M. Stern, Managing Partner, Stern, Stewart & Co.show more

 Enrique Arzac, an internationally recognized authority on the subject, provides an up-to-date, comprehensive synthesis of current valuation theory and practice, including free cash flow valuation, financing and valuation of leveraged buyouts, real option analysis for entry and exit decisions, contract design to resolve disagreements about value, and the valuation of special offer structures.

Back cover copy

                            Praise for Valuation for Mergers, Buyouts, and Restructuring "Enrique Arzac has provided an excellent analytical framework for the LBO business."--William T. Comfort, Chairman, Citigroup Venture Capital

 "Enrique Arzac has created a masterpiece--his work combines the theoretical with the practical. He has created an invaluable reference guide that is thoughtful, complete and very user friendly. He provides insight into the theory behind core valuation, LBO's, and options pricing, which creates the foundation for mergers, buyouts and restructuring. In addition to the theoretical, he provides practical insight into deal structuring and deal dynamics. His work should be standard material for all incoming associates."--James P. McVeigh, Managing Director, Corporate & Investment Banking, Banc of America Securities

 "This first-rate book of applied financial theory provides the tools for financial institutions and capital market participants seeking a methodology for comparing, contrasting, and evaluating investment opportunities and options. By incorporating over 30 years of research, teaching, and practical experience, Professor Arzac has created a text that us not only timely, but timeless in its usefulness to anyone interested in learning the applications of financial theory for the best and most useful allocation of the scarcest economic resource in the world--capital."--William W. Priest, Co-Managing Partner, Steinberg, Priest and Sloane Capital Management and Former Chairman and CEO of Credit Suisse Asset Management

 "There are two important aspects in graduate business education. The first is acquiring a thorough understanding of the theories of modern finance and the second is acquiring an appreciation for how these theories can be applied to important decisions. Enrique Arzac has taken on this task and made it a successful venture for readers of this book. Unlike other texts on valuation, he explains the reasons for the process and sequence that he recommends rather than just providing the ingredients and the recipe without explanation. This is a welcome addition to the literature in applied corporate finance."--Joel M. Stern, Managing Partner, Stern, Stewart & Co.show more

Valuation: Mergers, Buyouts and Restructuring, 2nd Edition

Enrique R. Arzac 
November 2007, ©2008


















For Instructors


For Students




Description
In this up-to-date synthesis of current valuation theory and
practice, Enrique Arzac applies the latest academic thinking to
mergers, buyouts, and restructuring, and blends it with his own
practical approach to valuation developed over years of consulting.

Throughout the text, Arzac provides illustrative examples and
answers many of the valuation problems commonly encountered in
professional practice. The result is a valuable toolkit of
valuation procedures and analysis methods.
