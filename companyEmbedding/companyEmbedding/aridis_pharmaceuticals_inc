It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.
"It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer." Tweet
Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.

HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

















HELPING DIABETES PATIENTS THRIVE

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We cannot take progress for granted

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

The biggest threat to global health today is antibiotic resistance. Aridis’ solution is to leverage the natural human immune system in the form of monoclonal antibodies to fight infections. This novel approach is also referred to as anti-infective immunotherapy.

Our mAb therapies are complemented by a breakthrough discovery platform called MabIgX that allows for  discovery of rare, protective antibody producing B-cells and the rapid transition to clinical testing.    



AR-301 (SalvecinTM) is a fully human monoclonal IgG1 antibody specifically targeting S. aureus alpha-toxin. Upon binding to its target antigen AR-301 represses functional toxin pore formation leading to protection of susceptible cells of the infected host from alpha-toxin dependent destruction. Its mode of action is independent of the antibiotic resistance profile of S. aureus, hence AR-301 is active against infections caused by both antibiotic resistant (MRSA) and antibiotic sensitive (MSSA) strains. Intravenous administration of AR-301 mAb to mice with acute pneumonia caused by S. aureus resulted in reduced bacterial loads and significantly improved survival rates. Aridis reported positive results from an international Phase 1/2a human clinical trial evaluating AR-301 in hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP) and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP) patients. VABP patients treated with antibiotics plus AR-301 at all dose levels spent a shorter time under mechanical ventilation as compared to antibiotics plus placebo. Eradication of S. aureus was also consistently higher in the group receiving AR-301 at all dose levels. The Company will move forward with plans for late-stage clinical studies of AR-301 in 2017.

A critical mediator of pathogenicity associated with S. aureus bacterial infection is a toxin protein called ‘alpha-toxin’. S. aureus alphatoxin attacks and destroys human host cells, including the critical human immune cells that are mobilized to fight the invading pathogen.  AR-301 (SalvecinTM) is a fully human monoclonal IgG1 antibody specifically targeting S. aureus alpha-toxin. Upon binding AR-301 represses functional toxin pore formation leading to protection of host cells from alpha-toxin dependent destruction.  Its mode of action is independent of the antibiotic resistance profile of S. aureus, hence it is active against infections caused by both MRSA and MSSA. When testing the therapeutic activity of AR-301 in preclinical animal studies of localized and systemic infection, administration of the monoclonal antibody resulted in reduced bacterial loads and significantly improved the survival rates of infected animals. 

AR-301 is being developed as an adjunctive therapy to standard of care antibiotics in hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP) and ventilator- associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP) patients. A double-blinded, placebo controlled Phase 1/2a clinical trial was conducted in the US and four European countries evaluating AR-301 in S. aureus HABP & VABP pneumonia patients.  The study met its primary endpoint of safety, and found that VABP patients treated with antibiotics plus AR-301 at all dose levels spent a shorter time under mechanical ventilation as compared to antibiotics plus placebo. Additionally, eradication of S. aureus was also consistently higher in the group receiving AR-301 at all dose levels. Aridis will move forward with plans for late-stage clinical studies of AR-301 in 2017.

Pathogenicity of the bacterial target AR-301: S. aureus. S. aureus is a leading cause of bloodstream, skin, soft tissue and lower respiratory tract infections worldwide, with both hospital-acquired infections and community-acquired infections increasing steadily in recent years. Additionally, treatment of these infections has become more challenging due to the emergence of multi-drug resistant strains. In many developed countries around the world, including the U.S., UK and Japan, resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics in MRSA strains is a major problem in hospitals and other healthcare settings. Notably, the incidence rate of all invasive MRSA infections, including those outside of hospitals, is high compared with other bacterial pathogens, with up to 50% of these infections resulting in death. 

In spite of preventive measures and various antibiotic treatment options, there is a clear medical need for alternative anti-infective therapies to treat hospital-acquired S. aureus infections. This high unmet medical need is further supported by the observation that resistant S. aureus strains were identified for every antibiotic after its introduction into clinical practice. In this context, the use of human monoclonal antibodies (mAb) for passive immunotherapy against S. aureus infections represents one new approach to combat the disturbing rise in antibiotic resistance.

Preliminary clinical trial of AR-101 (AerumabTM) anti-P. aeruginosa (Pa) IgM mAb in pneumonia patients provided important proof-of-concept evidence that anti-Pa mAbs can be safe and effective as an adjunctive therapy to antibiotics and additionally imparts the impetus to refine and improve on this therapeutic concept. We are developing the next generation anti-Pa mAb called AerucinTM that is best-in-class in terms of reactivity, engulfment and killing of different Pa strains. Aerucin is a fully human monoclonal IgG1 antibody that binds to alginate, a widely distributed cell surface polysaccharide on Pa, and enhances complement deposition, leading to improved immune recognition and phagocytic destruction of Pa by the immune system. Compared to all other anti-pseudomonas mAbs that we have tested, Aerucin exhibits the broadest recognition to diverse, unrelated P. aeruginosa clinical isolates. There is extensive data demonstrating Aerucin's effectiveness in phagocytic killing of a wide range of both mucoid and non-mucoid clinical isolates of Pa, including current antibiotic resistant strains from pneumonia and cystic fibrosis patients. Aerucin also protects mice from lethal challenges with a variety of Pa strains in an acute pneumonia model, and protects against eye infections in a keratitis model, and sepsis in a systemic infection model. These studies support the therapeutic and prophylactic uses of Aerucin against a broad range of Pa infections.



Aerucin Mechanism of Action:


While AR-101 is being developed to treat patients with an infection of P. aeruginosa serotype O11, AerucinTM has the potential to treat a broader range of P. aeruginosa infections mainly because its epitope, alginate, is expressed more broadly than LPS serotype O11. Aerucin is different from AR-101 in antibody subtype (IgG as compared to IgM), in eptitope (alginate as compared to LPS serotype O11), in pharmacokinetics and plasma half-life (three to four weeks as compared to three to four days) and in mechanism of action.

Lazar H, Horn MP, Zuercher AW, et al.Pharmacokinetics and safety profile of the human anti-Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype O11 immunoglobulin M monoclonal antibody KBPA-101 in healthy volunteers.Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2009 Aug;53(8):3442-6.This was a dose escalation study, in which four single intravenous doses: 0.1, 0.4, 1.2, and 4.0 mg/kg body weight of Panobacumab (AR-101) were administered to healthy subjects. The maximum concentrations of Panobacumab in plasma correlated with the dose levels, and its mean elimination half-life ranged between 70 and 95 hours. No antibodies against Panobacumab (immunogenicity) were detected. Panobacumab was well tolerated and no serious adverse events were observed.
Lu Q, Rouby JJ, Laterre PF, et al.Pharmacokinetics and safety of panobacumab: specific adjunctive immunotherapy in critical patients with nosocomial Pseudomonas aeruginosa O11 pneumonia.J Antimicrob Chemother. 2011 May;66(5):1110-6.This was the first study in patients with pneumonia. In this pilot clinical trial the main objectives were to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and potential efficacy of three doses of 1.2 mg/kg Panobacumab given every 72 h in patients with hospital-acquired P. aeruginosa (serotype O11) pneumonia. In the 13 patients that received the three doses, the average elimination half-life was of 102.3 hrs (SD: 47.8 hours) and the study drug was also found in some lower respiratory tract samples. Panobacumab was well tolerated. No antibodies against Panobacumab were detected. Despite of the severity of the patients and the expected mortality (32%) as per the APACHE II score, all patients that received three doses survived within the 30 days study period. In each of these 13 cases, pneumonia was cured, on average 9 days after treatment was started, and only two subjects suffered a recurrence of their pneumonia.
Q. Lu, A. Dugard, P. Eggimann, et al.Pseudomonas aeruginosa Serotypes in Nosocomial Pneumonia (NP): Prevalence, Patient Characteristics and Clinical Outcome.Very little is known regarding the prevalence of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotypes in hospital-acquired pneumonia as well as whether the serotype plays a role or not in the severity and final outcome of such infection. Clinical and laboratory data from 129 patients, with hospital-acquired pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa were analyzed within a period of 30 days from time of diagnosis of pneumonia. The most frequent serotypes were O6, O11, O10, S2 and O1 and most of the patients were male and older than 50 years. Comparison of the predicted and actual mortality showed that for serotype O1 the actual mortality was higher than predicted (40% vs. 35%), whereas for O11 mortality was as predicted (21% vs 22%) and in the S2 group no patient died (predicted 20%). Mean time to death was 10.9 days, with the longest for O10 infections (15 days) and the shortest for infections with O6 strains (9.2 days). Up to 66% of the patients achieved a clinical resolution, and 5% recurred.
Q. Lu, A. Dugard, P. Eggimann, et al.Panobacumab Adjunctive Immuno-Therapy for Pseudomonas aeruginosa Hospital-Acquired Pneumonia versus a Cohort GroupThe natural history and outcome of hospital-acquired pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa serotype O11 in patients treated with standard antimicrobial therapy, was compared with patients who received Panobacumab in addition to antibiotics. Both groups had the same inclusion and exclusion criteria and the same trial period observation of 30 days. The expected mortality calculated with APACHE II score was of 31% in the group treated with Panobacumab plus antibiotics and of 22% in the group treated only with antibiotics. All patients who received three doses of Panobacumab survived, but 21% died when only antibiotics were administered. All 13 patients that received the three doses of Panobacumab achieved clinical resolution of the pneumonia within the 30 days observational period, although two patients recurred. In the group treated with antibiotics alone, pneumonia was clinically cured in 57% of the cases, recurred in 7% and was not cured in 34% . The clinical resolution of the pneumonia occurred markedly earlier in patients treated with Panobacumab plus antibiotics than in patients treated only with standard antibiotic therapy.

Cystic Fibrosis



Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder caused by mutations in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein. This leads to numerous medical problems, including abnormal airway secretions, mucus accumulation and opportunistic bacterial infections. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most significant pathogen, with >80% of CF patients becoming chronically infected with P. aeruginosa by 18 years of life. Antibiotic treatment has led to selection of resistant strains, which are less responsive to drug treatments and exacerbate disease progression.

Despite antibiotic treatment, almost all CF patients ultimately succumb to respiratory failure due to chronic P. aeruginosa infection and airway inflammation.

Aridis' Panaecin™ is a promising therapeutic option for controlling chronic lung infections with unique benefits compared to current standard of care antibiotics: 


Broad activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including difficult-to-treat P. aeruginosa, S. aureus and Burkholderia cepaciaEffective against drug-resistant bacterial biofilmsAugments the natural immune response mediated by lactoferrin and transferrin.

Aridis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Presents Positive Phase 2a Safety and Efficacy Data of Salvecin™ (AR-301) in Patients with Severe Pneumonia Caused by Staphylococcus aureus
Jun 5 17
Aridis Pharmaceuticals Inc. presented top-line results of its Phase 2a trial of Salvecin™ (AR-301), its human monoclonal antibody used as an adjunct therapy for severe pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus, at the ASM Microbe congress held, June 1 - 5, 2017, in New Orleans. This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, first-in-human trial designed to assess the safety, pharmacokinetic characteristics, and efficacy of ascending doses of Salvecin™ (AR-301) as an adjunct therapy for severe pneumonia caused by S. aureus. In total, 48 patients were enrolled among 13 intensive care units (ICUs) in Belgium, France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Patients in this study were diagnosed with severe hospital-acquired pneumonia (HABP) caused by S. aureus, the majority being mechanically ventilated. They were assigned at random to standard-of-care antibiotics plus either Salvecin™ or placebo. Patients who received Salvecin™ experienced no related serious adverse events at any dose level tested, and no difference in adverse effects was observed among the groups. Ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP) patients treated with antibiotics plus Salvecin™ at all dose levels spent a shorter time under mechanical ventilation as compared to antibiotics plus placebo. Eradication of S. aureus was also consistently higher in the group receiving Salvecin™ at all dose levels.

Aridis Pharmaceuticals Reports Positive Clinical Data from Phase 1/2a Study of Human Monoclonal Antibody AR-301 for Treating Pneumonia
Jan 5 17
Aridis Pharmaceuticals Inc. announced positive clinical results from its Phase 1/2a study of AR-301, its fully human monoclonal antibody against Staphylococcus aureus alpha-toxin being evaluated as an adjunctive therapy in combination with standard of care antibiotics for hospital-acquired pneumonia and ventilator-associated pneumonia ("HAP" and "VAP"). The double-blind, placebo-controlled study met its primary endpoint of safety. Aridis will move forward with plans for late-stage clinical studies of AR-301 in 2017. AR-301 (or Salvecin) is a fully human monoclonal IgG1 antibody that specifically targets S. aureus alpha-toxin and protects host cells from destruction. It was discovered by applying Aridis' MabIgX® technology to screen human B-cells of convalescent pneumonia patients. S. aureus is a gram-positive bacterium and is among the leading causative agents of bacterial pneumonia in intensive care units (ICU) and other hospital-acquired infections. S. aureus is also a common pathogen in other infections including the skin and soft tissues infection, post-surgery infection, endocarditis, bacteremia, sepsis, and toxic shock syndrome. AR-301's mode of action is independent of the antibiotic resistance profile of S. aureus, hence it is active against drug-resistant strains, including MRSA (methicillin-resistant S. aureus). In animal studies, AR-301 reduced bacterial load and significantly improved survival following localized and systemic S. aureus infections.

Aridis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Presents Positive Phase 2a Safety and Efficacy Data of Salvecin™ (AR-301) in Patients with Severe Pneumonia Caused by Staphylococcus aureus During the 2017 ASM Microbe Congress






Jun 5, 2017, 10:15am EDT














SAN JOSE, Calif., June 05, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Aridis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company applying proprietary technologies to produce novel anti-infectives and immunotherapies for infectious diseases, presented top-line results of its Phase 2a trial of Salvecin™ (AR-301), its human monoclonal antibody used as an adjunct therapy for severe pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus aureus, at the ASM Microbe congress held, June 1 – 5, 2017, in New Orleans.
This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, first-in-human trial designed to assess the safety, pharmacokinetic characteristics, and efficacy of ascending doses of Salvecin™ (AR-301) as an adjunct therapy for severe pneumonia caused by S. aureus. In total, 48 patients were enrolled among 13 intensive care units (ICUs) in Belgium, France, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Patients in this study were diagnosed with severe hospital-acquired pneumonia (HABP) caused by S. aureus, the majority being mechanically ventilated. They were assigned at random to standard-of-care antibiotics plus either Salvecin™ or placebo. Patients who received Salvecin™ experienced no related serious adverse events at any dose level tested, and no difference in adverse effects was observed among the groups. Ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP) patients treated with antibiotics plus Salvecin™ at all dose levels spent a shorter time under mechanical ventilation as compared to antibiotics plus placebo. Eradication of S. aureus was also consistently higher in the group receiving Salvecin™ at all dose levels.
"Hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP) due to S. aureus affects more than 500,000 patients a year in the U.S., Europe, and Japan," stated Vu Truong, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Aridis. "In addition to finding Salvecin safe and tolerable, encouraging efficacy indicators were observed. We believe our approach will help significantly improve the clinical course of patients with HABP. Advancing this new, antibody-based immunotherapy towards late-stage clinical studies in the coming months is a priority for Aridis, especially in these times of emerging multi-drug resistant S. aureus. This innovative and potentially break-through treatment may represent a much-needed therapeutic advance for patients hospitalized in an ICU with S. aureus pneumonia."

Aridis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company applying proprietary technologies to produce novel therapies for infectious diseases, announced today the closing of private placements totaling $6.75 million.






SAN JOSE, Calif. (PRWEB)
September 18, 2014
 Aridis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company applying proprietary technologies to produce novel therapies for infectious diseases, announced today the closing of private placements totaling $6.75 million. 
In addition to numerous high-net worth individuals, investors included Dr. Nikolaus F. Rentschler, chief executive officer and owner of Rentschler Biotechnologie GmbH, a leading contract manufacturing organization for the development and production of biopharmaceuticals, and an independent not-for-profit cystic fibrosis research laboratory. “I’m absolutely convinced about the success of Aridis because of their excellent range of lifesaving product candidates in a variety of indications, smooth project handling and well-performing management,” stated Dr. Rentschler.
A portion of the proceeds from the financings will be used for completion of the Company’s ongoing Phase 2a clinical trial in Europe for AR-301, an anti-Staphylococcus aureus human monoclonal antibody, for the treatment of acute pneumonia. 
This is the first private fundraising conducted by Aridis, which has been funded to date with more than $38 million in grants from a number of leading institutions, including the National Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense and the Department of Health & Human Services.
“We are pleased to announce the successful completion of this financing, and welcome the support of our new investors as well as the additional validation inherent in the participation by an internationally known company such as Rentschler Biotechnologie,” stated Dr. Vu Truong, chief executive officer of Aridis. “The additional capital complements our existing funding, strengthens our balance sheet, and will enable us to advance clinical development of our lead drug candidate AR-301 and broader pipeline.”

We have long been driven to explore. To discover. To push our human limits. Two hundred years ago, we headed west. Today, we orbit Jupiter.
But for as far as we’ve gone, there is nothing so “out there” as what’s “in here” – inside our human bodies. The billions of cells that make us who we are and their systems, functions and mysteries that researchers are uncovering to defeat disease and save, improve and extend life.
Welcome to the future of medicine.
Welcome to a new world where immunotherapy unleashes your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. Welcome to medicines that are made using the body’s own living cells, not chemical compounds. Welcome to genomics and personalized medicine, which can be used to tailor treatments most unique to you and most devastating to your disease. 
This is an age of promise – fueled by the will to climb the many mountains ahead to defeat disease and explore the space within the frontier of the body.
Every day, we will go there. To find the unfindable. Solve the unsolvable. Cure the incurable.
140,000 researchers strong and relentless. Together, we go boldly.

It used to be science fiction. Harnessing your body’s own immune system to fight cancer. But what was once the fruit of a wild imagination is today a reality.
Rather than killing cancer cells directly with traditional approaches like radiation or chemotherapy, immunotherapy harnesses the immune system’s power to eliminate the cancer or slow its growth and ability to spread. Research shows immunotherapy is improving outcomes and survival rates for some patients, including kidney and lung cancer. In fact, research from the American Association for Cancer Research shows that for advanced-melanoma patients, survival rates are improving thanks in part to these new treatment options.

Biopharmaceutical researchers are urgently working to gain new insights into the complex interactions between patients’ immune systems and the cancer cells growing in their bodies with the goal of markedly improving outcomes in more tumor types.
With 836 medicines and vaccines in development for cancer, 80 percent of which have the potential to be first-in-class treatments, millions of Americans living with cancer have hope for a brighter future.
Welcome to the new era of medicine.
For all of us.

Diabetes is a serious condition that effects more than 30 million Americans. While complications of the disease can be dire, there is hope. Biopharmaceutical researchers are helping patients manage the condition today and envision a bright outlook for future treatments.
Diabetes: the patient perspective
Diabetes is a general term for a chronic condition where there is too much glucose (sugar) in the blood. Normally, the pancreas makes insulin to help convert glucose into energy. With diabetes, the body either does not make enough insulin (type 1 diabetes) or does not use it properly (type 2 diabetes), leading to high blood glucose levels. Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to serious health complications, such as heart attack, lower-limb amputation, vision impairment and blindness.
Endocrinologist Dr. William "Bill" Chin has experience treating endocrine disorders, including diabetes. As chief medical officer at PhRMA, he works to ensure that patient voices are heard, drawing on his dual experience as a physician and as the parent of a child with diabetes. When Dr. Chin's son, Danny, was 15, he began experiencing telltale symptoms like excessive thirst. Dr. Chin diagnosed his son himself with type 1 diabetes.
He says, "I don’t think any parent is ever prepared to learn that one of our kids has developed a disease, particularly one that will be chronic. In many ways it’s forever, but the good news is we have great therapies that actually will allow a patient with diabetes to live a full and completely normal life if it’s well managed."
The changing landscape of diabetes treatment
The medications that Danny relies on have come a long way in the last ten years. A decade ago, a number of insulin options were available to patients, as well as oral and injected medications. Successful management of diabetes required constant and diligent monitoring of glucose levels. To control their glucose, patients needed multiple daily injections and/or multiple oral medicines.
In recent years, researchers have focused on making treatments much easier for patients, from fewer pills to less frequent injections. Careful monitoring and treatment are still needed, but current medicines in development offer a promising future.
There are 171 medicines currently in development for type 1 and type 2 diabetes and diabetes-related conditions. A new wave of treatments is offering patients better or more sustained control over their glucose levels. Other medicines in the pipeline may address diabetes-related complications that affect the kidneys, blood vessels and eyes. All of the medicines are in clinical trials or awaiting review by the FDA.
While these advances have improved patient quality of life and increased lifespans for type 1 diabetes, ongoing research remains critical. In fact, diabetes was the seventh leading cause of death in the United States in 2013.
Dr. Chin says, "Collaboration is incredibly important in the understanding and development of new treatments for diabetes ... we are continually seeking to advance our understanding of the disease. This can only be achieved by having academic scientists and physician scientists working closely with scientists in the biopharmaceutical industry."

We are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases. But we must not take this progress for granted.  To ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop life-saving treatments and cures.
In order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients, our country must:
1)    Make medicines more affordable by rewarding value
 Today, America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines. Prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment, or agreements may lower co-pays if patients achieve better health outcomes. While these partnerships will vary, they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system.
Yet, outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements.  Government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines. Rather, we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for Americans.
2)    Ensure patients get the best deal on medicines
America’s Biopharmaceutical Companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). Those rebates are growing every year and now exceed $100 billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers.
But we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings, and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price, even when their insurers get a rebate. In fact, patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine.  That’s wrong. Health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive. This could lower out-of-pocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year.
3)    Make new breakthroughs accessible, and promote competition
We need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines. It simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over 10 years and over one billion dollars, on average.  Outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more. To get medicines approved faster, while ensuring safety, we need to modernize the FDA with new technologies and expertise to keep up with 21st century science. Modernizing the FDA will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines, which will bring medicines to patients faster, and enhance competition in the market.
We also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  This will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection. 
At the same time, we must avoid policies that deter risk-taking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients. Learn more about our plan to build a sustainable, science-based health care system that harnesses today’s hopes to discover tomorrow’s cures here.

The biggest threat to global health today is antibiotic resistance. Aridis’ solution is to leverage the natural human immune system in the form of monoclonal antibodies to fight infections. This novel approach is also referred to as anti-infective immunotherapy.

Our mAb therapies are complemented by a breakthrough discovery platform called MabIgX that allows for  discovery of rare, protective antibody producing B-cells and the rapid transition to clinical testing.    



AR-301 (SalvecinTM) is a fully human monoclonal IgG1 antibody specifically targeting S. aureus alpha-toxin. Upon binding to its target antigen AR-301 represses functional toxin pore formation leading to protection of susceptible cells of the infected host from alpha-toxin dependent destruction. Its mode of action is independent of the antibiotic resistance profile of S. aureus, hence AR-301 is active against infections caused by both antibiotic resistant (MRSA) and antibiotic sensitive (MSSA) strains. Intravenous administration of AR-301 mAb to mice with acute pneumonia caused by S. aureus resulted in reduced bacterial loads and significantly improved survival rates. Aridis reported positive results from an international Phase 1/2a human clinical trial evaluating AR-301 in hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HABP) and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP) patients. VABP patients treated with antibiotics plus AR-301 at all dose levels spent a shorter time under mechanical ventilation as compared to antibiotics plus placebo. Eradication of S. aureus was also consistently higher in the group receiving AR-301 at all dose levels. The Company will move forward with plans for late-stage clinical studies of AR-301 in 2017.
