FDA Soon to Prohibit Certain Omega-3 Fatty Acid Health Claims 
Companies marketing their Omega-3 products as a "high source" of DHA/EPA will likely have to modify their promotional messaging. Beacause the FDA has not yet established a reference of nutrient levels for DHA/EPA, it is recommended that marketers use percentage statements or qualified health claims for their Omega-3 products instead.

More studies linking Vitamin D consumption and and reduced blood pressure are needed before marketers can safely make those claims.

La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company |   LJPC-501

























































 

 


 






LJPC-501You are here: Home / Product Pipeline / LJPC-501LJPC-501
LJPC-501 is La Jolla’s proprietary formulation of synthetic human angiotensin II. Angiotensin II, the major bioactive component of the renin-angiotensin system, serves as one of the body’s central regulators of blood pressure. LJPC‑501 is the first synthetic human angiotensin II product candidate to be tested in a Phase 3 study.

ATHOS-3 Study
The ATHOS‑3 study ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28215131 ) was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 clinical study of LJPC-501 in patients with catecholamine resistant hypotension. A total of 344 patients were randomized across nine countries, 321 of whom received study treatment and are included in the primary analysis. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive either LJPC‑501 or placebo on a background of standard‑of‑care vasopressors selected by the investigators. Randomized patients received their assigned treatment via continuous intravenous infusion.




The study was conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment (SPA) agreed to with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2015. The SPA stipulates that a study of this size and design could provide sufficient safety and efficacy signals and an adequate evaluation of the risk/benefit to the patients to support FDA review and consideration for marketing approval.

Mode of Action
Angiotensin II (ANGII), the major bioactive component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS System), serves as one of the body’s central regulators of blood pressure. The RAAS system along with the arginine-vasopressin system and the sympathetic nervous system make up the three major counter-regulatory systems the human body utilizes to manage blood pressure. ANGII is a naturally occurring peptide hormone that regulates blood pressure through activation of the ANGII type 1 receptor (AT1R). Through the AT1R, ANGII induces peripheral vasoconstriction, increases sodium and water retention, aldosterone release, and vasopressin release leading to increase in blood pressure.
ANGII has been shown to raise blood pressure in animal models of hypotension. Additionally, a randomized placebo-controlled clinical pilot study in patients with CRH demonstrated catecholamine sparing providing proof of concept that ANGII may be a therapeutic target for improvement in MAP.

Catecholamine Resistant Hypotension
Catecholamine resistant hypotension (CRH) is a life-threatening syndrome in patients with distributive shock (dangerously low blood pressure with adequate cardiac function) who cannot achieve target mean arterial pressure (MAP) despite adequate fluid resuscitation and treatment with currently available vasopressors (catecholamines and/or vasopressin). There are approximately 500,000 distributive shock cases in the United States per year, an estimated 200,000 of which develop CRH. More than 50% of CRH patients die within 30 days.

 http://www.ljpc.com/  http://finance.yahoo.com/q/h?s=LJPC   La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company, a biopharmaceutical company, engages in the research and development of pharmaceutical products in the United States. Its principal product in development is Riquent, which is designed to treat lupus renal disease by preventing or delaying renal flares. Lupus is an antibody-mediated disease caused by abnormal B cell production of antibodies that attack healthy tissues. Riquent is in Phase III clinical trial. The company also develops small molecules for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, and acute and chronic inflammatory disorders. La Jolla Pharmaceutical Company was founded in 1989 and is based in San Diego, California.   Riquent  Riquent (abetimus sodium) is a synthetic oligonucleotide conjugate composed of 4 identical strands of dsDNA (20BP in length) that are linked through a triethyleneglycol-based platform. It binds anti-dsDNA Ab and the complex is cleared via the immune system, thus ridding the body of one of the primary pathogenic antibody associated with lupus. Lupus nephritis is a serious and potentially fatal orphan disease treated primarily by nephrologists and rheumatologists. Currently, there are no products specifically approved to treat lupus renal disease. La Jolla Pharmaceutical is investigating Riquent for the treatment of lupus renal disease by preventing or delaying renal flares, a leading cause of sickness and death in lupus patients, and improving proteinuria. Proteinuria is an indicator of abnormal renal function. Riquent has been well tolerated in all 14 clinical trials, with no overall difference in the adverse event profiles for Riquent-treated patients compared with placebo-treated patients. Riquent specifically reduces circulating levels of anti-dsDNA antibodies and is also designed to specifically suppress the B cells that make these antibodies. Decreases in these antibodies are believed to be associated with a decreased risk of renal flare. Although clinical benefit has not yet been proven, Riquent treatment has significantly reduced these antibody levels in all clinical trials in which they were measured.      CHARTS      3 Month Chart
