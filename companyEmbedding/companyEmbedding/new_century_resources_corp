(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements.  The purpose of this discussion is to provide an understanding of the consolidated financial results and condition of New Century Resources Corporation and to also describe the plans for future growth and expansion.  Forward-Looking Statements  This Management's Discussion and Analysis and other parts of this report contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, as well as current expectations and assumptions. From time to time, we may publish forward-looking statements, including those that are contained in this report, relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance, business prospects, acquisition strategies, technological developments, new products, research and development activities and similar matters. The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements. In order to comply with the terms of the safe harbor, we note that a variety of factors could cause our actual results and experience to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in our forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations, performance, development and results of our business include, but are not limited to, our ability to maintain sufficient working capital, adverse changes in the economy, the ability to attract and maintain key personnel, our ability to implement our business plan. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements, including those set forth elsewhere in this report. We assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements.  PLAN OF OPERATION  Although we were organized to engage in oil and gas exploration, we currently are a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. Our principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term earnings. We will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business.  We may consider a business which has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or service, or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need substantial additional capital, but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares, while avoiding, among other things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering.  We do not currently engage in any business activities that provide cash flow. The costs of investigating and analyzing business combinations for the next 12 months and beyond such time will be paid with money in our treasury, if any, or with additional money contributed by our stockholders, or another source.  During the next 12 months, we anticipate incurring costs related to filing of Exchange Act reports and costs relating to consummating an acquisition. We believe we will be able to meet these costs through use of funds in our treasury and additional amounts, as necessary, to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other investors.  We have not had any preliminary contact or discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a business combination with us. Any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth, including entities without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks.  Our management anticipates that it will likely be able to effect only one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing, and the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our management's plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization. This lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us, because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another.  We anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex.  In light of our competitive disadvantages, our strategy for successfully identifying and completing business combinations when we are competing with entities that possess great financial, technical and managerial capabilities is as follows.  POTENTIAL TARGET COMPANIES  A business entity, if any, which may be interested in a business combination with the Company may include the following:  � a company for which a primary purpose of becoming public is the use of its securities for the acquisition of assets or businesses;  � a foreign company which may wish an initial entry into the United States securities market;  � a special situation company, such as a company seeking a public market to satisfy redemption requirements under a qualified Employee Stock Option Plan;  It is possible that a potential business opportunity may not be beneficial or desirable for our shareholders. A potential target may not be able to find an underwriter because the business opportunity is too risky, the target does not have significant operations, the target has limited history of operations or many other reasons. As a part of due diligence investigation of any potential target, the Company will assess the desirability of any identified target with regard to the risks it may present.  A business combination with a target company will normally involve the transfer to the target company of the majority of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company, and the substitution by the target company of its own management and board of directors. No assurances can be given that the Company will be able to enter into a business combination, as to the terms of a business combination, or as to the nature of the target company.  The Company is seeking to acquire assets or shares of an entity actively engaged in business which generates revenues. The Company has no particular acquisitions in mind and has not entered into any negotiations regarding such acquisition. The Company's officers and directors have not engaged in any substantive contact or discussions with any representative of any other company regarding the possibility of an acquisition or merger between the Company and such other company as of the date of this registration statement.  The Company does not anticipate engaging any professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions but will rely upon the Company's business contacts and relationships in seeking a suitable acquisition.  As part of our investigation of business opportunities, the Company's management may meet personally with management and key personnel of the firm sponsoring the business opportunity. The Company may visit and inspect material facilities, obtain independent analysis or verification of certain information provided, check references of management and key personnel, and conduct other reasonable measures.  We will generally ask to be provided with written materials regarding the business opportunity. These materials may include the following:  � descriptions of product, service and company history; management resumes;  � available projections with related assumptions upon which they are based;  � evidence of existing patents, trademarks or service marks or rights thereto;  � a description of transactions between the prospective entity and its affiliates;  � a financial plan of operation and estimated capital requirements;  We believe an acquisition or merger with the Company may be an appealing avenue for a private company seeking to enter the public company sector because the Company intends to apply for a trading symbol and quotation on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board and/or OTC Markets. Any private company can file their own registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in order to become a public company. Once a registration statement is declared effective, the registrant must then provide certain information through a market maker for application for a trading symbol. Both the registration statement process and application for a trading symbol can be lengthy and expensive. Often, a private company will opt to merge with or be acquired by a company that is already public and has a trading symbol in order to reduce the time and expense required to go public on their own.  Any private company that enters a merger or acquisition transaction with the Company must provide all the information required by the Securities and Exchange Commission in a Form 10 registration statement, including audited financial statements, which will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in a Form 8-K Current Report within four days of closing the transaction. The private company will incur significant expense in providing the required information.  If the Company enters into a transaction with a private company, it will likely first liquidate the assets and pay off the liabilities so the private company will not receive any benefit of assets currently held by the Company.  The Company will not seek shareholder approval for any merger, acquisition or similar reorganization. Shareholder approval for this type of business opportunity is not required under Nevada law nor is it required by the Company's Articles of Incorporation. Shareholder approval will be required if the transaction requires a name change, change in capital structure of the Company, stock splits or any other action that requires shareholder approval under Nevada law or our Articles of Incorporation. In the event shareholder approval is required for actions other than a business opportunity, the Company will prepare, file with the SEC and mail to shareholders the appropriate information statement or proxy statement, if required.  We believe the sum required to consummate our acquisition or reverse merger is not determinable until the Company knows the terms of the transaction. The amount of cash the Company had on hand as of December 31, 2016 is $0. Such acquisition or reverse merger may be costly. We currently have very limited resources with which to complete the acquisition or reverse merger and no cash. If we are able raise any capital, all of our cash may be exhausted prior to or in the process of trying to complete the acquisition or reverse merger.  OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS  We have no significant off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.  LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES  It is the intent of our management and stockholders to provide sufficient working capital necessary to support and preserve the integrity of our Company as a corporate entity. However, there is no legal obligation for either the majority Shareholder or our key officers to provide additional future funding. If our management and/or key officers ceases to provide us the needed financing and we fail to identify any alternative sources of funding, there will be substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a "going concern".  We have no current plans, proposals, arrangements or understandings with respect to the sale or issuance of additional securities. As a result, there can be no assurance that sufficient funds will be available to us to enable us to pay the expenses related to such activities.

  Note
1 - Organization and Operations

 

New
Century Resources Corporation

 

New
Century Resources Corporation (the Company), was incorporated under
the laws of the State of Utah in July of 1979 as WEM Petroleum,
Inc. From inception through 1981, the Company conducted operations
in the oil and gas industry. Pursuant to an option granted the
Company in August of 1979, the Company exercised its right to drill
exploratory wells on 640 acres in Cache County, Utah. Although
various wells were drilled and completed, the Company did not
realize any revenues from these oil and gas operations. In 1984,
the Company attempted to refocus its business efforts into the
mining industry by entering into an option to lease property and
mining equipment in Montana. It ceased any significant business
operations in the latter part of the 1980's when it failed to
exercise the option, due to lack of funding. In 1988, the Company
made an effort to commence conducting business again by expanding
its business purpose to include the marketing and development of
high-tech products. The Company's Board was also authorized to seek
out suitable candidates for acquisition or merger. In addition, the
Company authorized a reverse split of its issued and outstanding
shares one (1) share for ten (10) shares, although the same was
never affected. The Company ceased doing business until late
1993.

 

In October
1993, the Corporation changed its name to New Century Resources
Corporation, acquiring 100% of the outstanding stock of G.C. Gulf
Western Trading Limited (G.C.) in exchange for 7,200,000 shares of
stock, which gave the stockholders of G.C. control of the
Corporation by which it has conducted its operations. This
acquisition was accounted for as a reverse merger or
recapitalization of G.C.  No goodwill or other write-up to
fair market value of the assets of G.C. occurred at the time of the
merger. In 1994, the company was re-domiciled in the state of
Nevada. The Nevada entity became the surviving corporation and the
Utah Corporation was dissolved on February 14, 1994. As a result of
the merger/change of domicile, the Articles of Incorporation of the
Nevada entity became the Articles of the Company.

 

The
Company divested itself of its 100% owned subsidiary G.C. on
December 12, 2000, thereby eliminating the Trekkopje mining claims,
a capitalized cost of $10,533,252, the related liabilities
amounting to $8,500,000 from its acquisition, the note payable to
its principal stockholder, which aggregated, came to a total of
$1,046,640, and any claims to accrued interest. This divestiture
was the unanimous decision of the board of directors, which was
based in part, upon the Corporation's inability to raise the
necessary capital to fund the exploration and development of the
Trekkopje Uranium reserves. In addition, a feasibility study
conducted by Dr. Brian Hambleton played crucial role in their
decision making process, concluding that, due to the current
Uranium market, exploitation of the Uranium reserves on the
property would not be financially viable, and did not foresee any
immediate or mid-term prospects in world market conditions and
pricing which would lead to a pricing level justifiable of the
exploitation of the Uranium reserves.

 

The
Company has no commitments, understandings, or agreements with
regard to any proposed business operations or opportunities. It is
the intention of Management to actively solicit interested third
parties who may be interested in acquiring a controlling interest
in what is essentially a "shell" corporation. Such transactions are
commonly referred to as "reverse mergers", whereby the Company
would acquire all the issued and outstanding shares of a private
entity in exchange for a controlling interest in the public
company. No assurance can be given that Management of the Company
will be successful in attracting a suitable candidate for this type
of transaction or some other type of business combination; or what
time frame might be involved in consummating any such
transaction.

 

Note 2 -
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

 

Basis of
presentation

 

The
accompanying financial statements and related notes have been
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP").

 

Reclassification

 

Certain
amounts in the prior period financial statements have been
reclassified to conform to the current period
presentation.  Specifically, those presentations under
reporting requirements as a development stage company. These
reclassifications had no effect on reported losses.

Table of Contents

 

Use of
Estimates and Assumptions

 

The
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements as well as the reported amount of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period.

 

The
Company's significant estimates and assumptions include the fair
value of financial instruments; inventory valuation and
obsolescence; revenue recognized or recognizable; sales returns and
allowances; income tax rate, income tax provision and valuation
allowance of deferred tax assets; and the assumption that the
Company will be a going concern.  Those significant
accounting estimates or assumptions bear the risk of change due to
the fact that there are uncertainties attached to those estimates
or assumptions, and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult
to measure or value.

 

Management
bases its estimates on historical experience and on various
assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that
are not readily apparent from other sources.

 

Management
regularly reviews its estimates utilizing currently available
information, changes in facts and circumstances, historical
experience and reasonable assumptions. After such reviews, and if
deemed appropriate, those estimates are adjusted
accordingly.

 

Actual
results could differ from those estimates.

 

Fair Value
of Financial Instruments

 

The
Company follows paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of its
financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB
Accounting Standards Codification ("Paragraph 820-10-35-37") to
measure the fair value of its financial instruments. Paragraph
820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and expands
disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency
and comparability in fair value measurements and related
disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value
hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used
to measure fair value into three (3) broad levels.  The
fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices
(unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.  The
three (3) levels of fair value hierarchy defined by Paragraph
820-10-35-37 are described below:

 





 



 



 





Level
1



 



Quoted
market prices available in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities as of the reporting date.





 



 



 





Level
2



 



Pricing
inputs other than quoted prices in active markets included in Level
1, which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the
reporting date.





 



 



 





Level
3



 



Pricing
inputs that are generally observable inputs and not corroborated by
market data.




 

Financial
assets are considered Level 3 when their fair values are determined
using pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar
techniques and at least one significant model assumption or input
is unobservable.

 

The fair
value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices
(unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.  If the
inputs used to measure the financial assets and liabilities fall
within more than one level described above, the categorization is
based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair
value measurement of the instrument.

 

The
carrying amounts of a Company's financial assets and liabilities,
such as cash, prepaid expenses and accounts payable, approximate
their fair values because of the short maturity of these
instruments.

Table of Contents

 

Transactions
involving related parties cannot be presumed to be carried out on
an arm's-length basis, as the requisite conditions of competitive,
free-market dealings may not exist. Representations about
transactions with related parties, if made, shall not imply that
the related party transactions were consummated on terms equivalent
to those that prevail in arm's-length transactions unless such
representations can be substantiated.

 

Fiscal
Year-End

 

The
Company elected December 31 as its fiscal year-end date.

 

Cash
Equivalents

 

The
Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of
three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash
equivalents.

 

Related
Parties

 

The
Company follows subtopic 850-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification for the identification of related parties and
disclosure of related party transactions.

 

Pursuant
to Section 850-10-20 the related parties include
a.) affiliates of the Company; b.) entities for which
investments in their equity securities would be required, absent
the election of the fair value option under the Fair Value Option
Subsection of Section 825–10–15, to be accounted for by
the equity method by the investing entity; c.) trusts for the
benefit of employees, such as pension and profit-sharing trusts
that are managed by or under the trusteeship of management; d.)
 principal owners of the Company; e.) management of the
Company; f.) other parties with which the Company may deal if
one party controls or can significantly influence the management or
operating policies of the other to an extent that one of the
transacting parties might be prevented from fully pursuing its own
separate interests; and g.) other parties that can
significantly influence the management or operating policies of the
transacting parties or that have an ownership interest in one of
the transacting parties and can significantly influence the other
to an extent that one or more of the transacting parties might be
prevented from fully pursuing its own separate
interests.

 

The
financial statements shall include disclosures of material related
party transactions, other than compensation arrangements, expense
allowances, and other similar items in the ordinary course of
business. However, disclosure of transactions that are eliminated
in the preparation of or combined financial statements is not
required in those statements. The disclosures shall
include:  a.) the nature of the relationship(s)
involved ; b.) a description of the transactions, including
transactions to which no amounts or nominal amounts were ascribed,
for each of the periods for which income statements are presented,
and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding of
the effects of the transactions on the financial statements;
c.) the dollar amounts of transactions for each of the periods
for which income statements are presented and the effects of any
change in the method of establishing the terms from that used in
the preceding period; and d.) amounts due from or to related
parties as of the date of each balance sheet presented and, if not
otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement.

 

Commitment
and Contingencies

 

The
Company follows subtopic 450-20 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification to report accounting for contingencies. Certain
conditions may exist as of the date the  financial
statements are issued, which may result in a loss to the Company
but which will only be resolved when one or more future events
occur or fail to occur.  The Company assesses such
contingent liabilities, and such assessment inherently involves an
exercise of judgment.  In assessing loss contingencies
related to legal proceedings that are pending against the Company
or unasserted claims that may result in such proceedings, the
Company evaluates the perceived merits of any legal proceedings or
unasserted claims as well as the perceived merits of the amount of
relief sought or expected to be sought therein.

 

If the
assessment of a contingency indicates that it is probable that a
material loss has been incurred and the amount of the liability can
be estimated, then the estimated liability would be accrued in the
Company's financial statements.  If the assessment
indicates that a potential material loss contingency is not
probable but is reasonably possible, or is probable but cannot be
estimated, then the nature of the contingent liability, and an
estimate of the range of possible losses, if determinable and
material, would be disclosed.

Table of Contents

 

Loss
contingencies considered remote are generally not disclosed unless
they involve guarantees, in which case the guarantees would be
disclosed.  Management does not believe, based upon
information available at this time that these matters will have a
material adverse effect on the Company's financial position,
results of operations or cash flows. However, there is no assurance
that such matters will not materially and adversely affect the
Company's business, financial position, and results of operations
or cash flows.

 

Revenue
Recognition

 

The
Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification for revenue recognition.  The
Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and
earned.  The Company considers revenue realized or
realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met:
(i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product
has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the
customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv)
collectability is reasonably assured. The Company has not generated
revenues in the years presented.

 

Net Income
(Loss) per Common Share

 

Net income
(loss) per common share is computed pursuant to section 260-10-45
of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification.  Basic net
income (loss) per common share is computed by dividing net income
(loss) by the weighted average number of shares of common stock
outstanding during the period.  Diluted net income (loss)
per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock and potentially
dilutive outstanding shares of common stock during the period to
reflect the potential dilution that could occur from common shares
issuable through contingent share arrangements, stock options and
warrants.

 

As of
September 30, 2016, there are potential share equivalents based on
conversion options associated with our convertible promissory notes
(approximately 23,755,340 potential shares), however, due to net
operating losses sustained, anti-dilution issues are not
applicable.

 

Cash Flows
Reporting

 

The
Company adopted paragraph 230-10-45-24 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification for cash flows reporting, classifies cash
receipts and payments according to whether they stem from
operating, investing, or financing activities and provides
definitions of each category, and uses the indirect or
reconciliation method ("Indirect method") as defined by paragraph
230-10-45-25 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification to
report net cash flow from operating activities by adjusting net
income to reconcile it to net cash flow from operating activities
by removing the effects of (a) all deferrals of past operating cash
receipts and payments and all accruals of expected future operating
cash receipts and payments and (b) all items that are included in
net income that do not affect operating cash receipts and
payments.  The Company reports the reporting currency
equivalent of foreign currency cash flows, using the current
exchange rate at the time of the cash flows and the effect of
exchange rate changes on cash held in foreign currencies is
reported as a separate item in the reconciliation of beginning and
ending balances of cash and cash equivalents and separately
provides information about investing and financing activities not
resulting in cash receipts or payments in the period pursuant to
paragraph 830-230-45-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards
Codification.

 

Subsequent
Events

 

The
Company follows the guidance in Section 855-10-50 of the FASB
Accounting Standards Codification for the disclosure of subsequent
events. The Company will evaluate subsequent events through the
date when the financial statements were
issued.  Pursuant to ASU 2010-09 of the FASB Accounting
Standards Codification, the Company as an SEC filer considers its
financial statements issued when they are widely distributed to
users, such as filing them on EDGAR.

 

Recently
Issued Accounting Pronouncements

 

We have
reviewed the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ("ASU")
accounting pronouncements and interpretations thereof that have
effectiveness dates during the periods reported and in future
periods. The Company has carefully considered the new
pronouncements that alter previous generally accepted accounting
principles and does not believe that any new or modified principles
will have a material impact on the corporation's reported financial
position or operations in the near term. The applicability of any
standard is subject to the formal review of our financial
management and certain standards are under
consideration.

under this presumption is commonly referred to as the going concern
basis of accounting. If and when an entity's liquidation becomes
imminent, financial statements should be prepared under the
liquidation basis of accounting in accordance with Subtopic
205-30,  Presentation of Financial
Statements—Liquidation Basis of Accounting . Even when an
entity's liquidation is not imminent, there may be conditions or
events that raise substantial doubt about the entity's ability to

statements should continue to be prepared under the going concern
basis of accounting, but the amendments in this Update should be

Ask away.  We have answers.



Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.

The LegalZoom 3-step process was developed by attorneys from some of the most prestigious law firms in America. There are no complex instructions to follow and nothing to download or print. Simply answer a few questions and get started on
              setting up your corporation.

Here's how it works:

Complete the Incorporation Questionnaire
						Complete our simple questionnaire. With LegalZoom, you can choose to form a new corporation or incorporate an existing business. You can also select provisions to help you guard against personal liability.
We Create and File Your Incorporation Papers
						We create and file the Articles of Incorporation (or, in some states, the "Certificate of Formation" or "Certificate of Incorporation") with the Secretary of State (or in some states, the "Department of State" or "Corporation Commission"). We even create company-specific bylaws and organizational minutes.
Final Wrap-Up
						When we receive your filed Articles of Incorporation back from the state, we send them to you along with the rest of your formation documents, as well as easy instructions regarding next steps.

Common questions

What's the difference between a C corporation and an S corporation?
The IRS allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a "C corporation" or an "S corporation." Income from C corporations are subject to double taxation; that is, the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporation.S corporations have only one level of taxation. The shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation, but an S corporation does not pay taxes on its net income. While the S corporation is popular among small business owners, C corporations have greater tax planning flexibility.


How does a corporation protect my personal assets?
If a business operates as a corporation, the business owners, called shareholders, are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation. That's because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners. If a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity, then anyone seeking to collect a debt from, or enforce a claim against, a corporation, would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves. They would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation.


Why do many people choose to form their corporation in Delaware?
Delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations. However, the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public. Delaware's laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders, and Delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes. These benefits don't mean much to smaller corporations. Keep in mind that if a corporation forms in Delaware and does business in another state, the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork, and pay any taxes and/or fees required to do business in that state. Given those factors, many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business.


What is an EIN?
An employer identification number (EIN), also known as a federal tax identification number, is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes. It's like a Social Security number, but for a business. In general, most businesses need an EIN. The only reason a business would not get an EIN is if it has only one owner, elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes, and does not want to open a separate business bank account. In this case, the owner would use their Social Security number as the business identifier. However, there are disadvantages to this approach, namely the risk of liability.


How are LLCs taxed?
Unlike a corporation, LLCs have some flexibility in how they're taxed. Depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects, the LLC can be taxed as either a corporation, partnership or as part of the owner's personal tax return (called a "disregarded entity"). By default, an LLC with two or more members are taxed as a partnership, unless they file an IRS Form 8832 to elect to be treated as a corporation. If the LLC has only one owner, it will be taxed as a sole proprietor, unless the owner files Form 8832. It's not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed. You have up to 12 months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision.


What is a registered agent?
A registered agent (sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent) is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business. States require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity. While you can be your own registered agent, there are disadvantages. You have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record. If you miss a filing deadline, you risk being fined or shut down. Our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents, sort through junk mail and keep your information private.


Is a corporation right for me?
It depends on many factors. Get help deciding by answering a few questions here.
