5.0 out of 5 starsRobert Kennedy: His LifeByRhona A. Blackwell-Readyon October 6, 2014Robert Kennedy: His Life was an excellent book to read.  I enjoyed it more than Robert F. Kennedy and His Times because Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.'s was very biases toward Robert Kennedy.  That is find because he did tell interesting stories that I did enjoy.  This one was different in that it shows "warts and all" which is what you really want in reading someone's life!  I found that he had dyslexia and it explained why he told his father in a letter that he was working very hard in school.  Dyslexia is nothing to be ashamed of...I have a child with it and when you find out what is going on with your child and how to help them can make all the difference in your child succeeding.  That is not a problem he had because his father was there to give him whatever he needed.  He felt because he was the "third" son, he definitely had something to prove to his father.Robert Kennedy was NOT afraid of anything and if he was you would never know because he stepped up whenever and wherever it was needed.  He was tough but very tender to his children.  He took time with them and explained as his own parents had that they were very fortunate and it was important for them to "give back."  As a senator he went to Alabama or Mississippi and saw this child with a distended belly "because he was hunger," and told them that was not their case.  I remember seeing that because their was a camera man their and he caressed the child's face.  That was "real" and everyone knew it.The one thing will we never know is how much good he could have done the country.  How would the world now be if Robert Kennedy had not been murdered?  It was a sad time and time when that happened and I know I will never forget him and what he stood for.  Reading this is a must if you want to know Robert Kennedy!

Top critical reviewSee all 15 critical reviews› 3.0 out of 5 starsand far superior to many RFK biographies--Thomas acted recklessly in utilizing information ...Bydonna morelon June 3, 2017Here's an FYI to potential literary consumers: Thomas utilized three fabricated storylines in "RFK: A Life".  In the October 8, 2014 ColumbiaJournalism Review (available on-line), Thomas stated he will remove the fabrications from future editions on his book.  But the fabrications remain in the current edition.  The fabrications originated with the late author C. David Heymann, whose literary fraud had been exposed on multiple occasions prior to publication of Thomas's book. One fabrication details RFK venturing out on narcotic raids with drug enforcement officers and RFK witnessing a drug dealer molesting a toddler and agents throwing the culprit from a tenement window. One is in reference to information Heymann fabricated and attributed to the late Peter Lawford, and one is an anecdote Heymann fabricated and attributed to the late Kennedy confidant Lem Billings about RFK and a prostitute. (Larry Tye used the same fabricated Billings storyline in the first edition of his RFK book, but the storyline was removed for the recently released paperback edition.) Given the fact Heymann had been publicly exposed as a fabricator on several occasions prior to the release of Thomas's book--and although I believe Thomas's book is in many aspects very well researched, well written, and far superior to many RFK biographies--Thomas acted recklessly in utilizing information from a renown fabricator.

    See all 84 reviews4.0 out of 5 starsOutstanding RFK BiographyByGary W. Mitchellon August 20, 2009Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseEvan Thomas is a pleasure to read. His book is quite well written. It holds your interest, captivates the moment the country was going through in the 1960's quite accurately. It is definitely required reading for any student of American history.Ever sensing that RFK privately must have had reservations about the adequacy of the Warren Report, this book, for the first time describes RFK's efforts to help unravel of what some have called the crime of the century. In addition to the tragedy of the loss of RFK as a national figure, we also lost probably the last opportunity to learn more about the truth of why JFK was killed, and by whom.The book is also very good at retelling the events that marked the JFK presidency, from the civil rights challenge to the missile crisis. If you read closely, you can get an accurate depiction of RFK's behavior that prompted many to consider him a ruthless force, loose in the Federal Government, accountable to no one other than his brother, the President.Who knows when enough facts and documents may become public knowledge that help illuminate this period of history, but, in the meanwhile, this book hits closest to the mark of learning some of the deep secrets of the day.0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starsA Fresh Look at RFKBySFon November 27, 2013Format: Kindle Edition|Verified PurchaseBobby is the great enigma of the Kennedy clan. Was he ruthless or compassionate?  If he was a liberal, how could he approve covert assassinations and wire taps?  And yet, he prompted almost cult-like adoration and seemed on a trajectory to reclaim his fallen brother's mantle when he was shot and killed in the tumult of 1968  The early Schlesinger biography of RFK was largely sympathetic and flattering.  But here Evan Thomas takes a harder, colder look at this most fascinating of Kennedys.  As much as possible, Thomas brings Bobby to life and explores his unique relationship with his brother, his searing hatred of LBJ, his immense flaws and his deep convictions. It is a wonderful portrait and a great look back at an extraordinary era in American history.  While I am admittedly a Kennedy fan,  I highly recommend this book.0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.5.0 out of 5 starscompassionByMichael Achesonon September 9, 2012Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseA tortuous book, but this is journalism at it's finest. The characters -- JFK, RFK, J. Edgar Hoover, Castro, Jackie, Ethel and all the Kennedy clan -- and the times, the 50's and 60's, make this a ride that at times you will want to get off, but will be unable to. At the end one is still left wondering who this guy is, but you can't help but like him. This book effected me like nothing I have read in recent times. There are so many what-ifs through the lives of JFK and RFK that at the end you just dangle, and think, and ponder, like the picture of Bobby that graces the cover. A wonderful read, some great and terrible people you will inhabit, and best of all it will make you think.0Comment|

There was a problem loading comments right now. Please try again later.4.0 out of 5 starsHe was sick of what was wrong AND what was rightByGlen Carsonon June 1, 2011Format: Paperback|Verified PurchaseNot a quick read, but one that you continuously think about and want to get back into anytime you can. I started this book two weeks before attending my son's graduation from the University of Virginia's School of Law. Turns out, that commencement marked the 60th anniversary of Bobby Kennedy's graduation from the school. The commencement speaker, US Attorney General Eric Holder, spoke eloquently and at length about the graduates' fellow alum, RFK, and it appeared to me he had read this very book. In any case, I highly recommend it as a biography of an American hero, and, as a history of mid 20th century America.0Comment|
