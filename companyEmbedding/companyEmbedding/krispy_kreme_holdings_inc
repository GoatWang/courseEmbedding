The secretive billionaire Reimann family of Germany continued its US shopping spree on Wednesday, agreeing to pay $7.5 billion for the 2,036-store Panera Bread chain.
The family’s JAB Holdings will add the St. Louis chain to its growing stable of brands, including Krispy Kreme, Jimmy Choo, Coty and Bally.
It also pushes the family deeper into the US coffee business as it also owns Keurig Green Mountain, Peet’s Coffee & Tea, Caribou Coffee, Timothy’s World Coffee and, under its JDE umbrella, the Gevalia, Douwe Egberts and Pilão brands.
JAB will pay $315 in cash per Panera share, representing a 20 percent premium to the stock’s closing price on March 31 — before news of a possible deal swelled the company’s shares.
Because of its recent buying spree, the Reimann family is now one of the world’s biggest players in the coffee game.
On the retail front, JAB’s brands are quite varied. Panera appeals to health-conscious consumers while Krispy Kreme, not so much.
Panera sales have increased 10 percent over the past two years, just ahead of the 8 percent growth in the number of stores. Profits have fallen over the same period.
With the Panera deal, JAB will assume roughly $340 million of net debt, the family’s investment vehicle and Panera said in a statement.

      Public Company Information:          




NYSE:KKD 






WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Inc. (NYSE: KKD) (the “Company”) today reported 
      financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, ended May 1, 
      2016.
    

Recent Developments


      As previously announced, on May 8, 2016, the Company entered into an 
      Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Cotton 
      Parent, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Cotton”), Cotton Merger Sub Inc., 
      a North Carolina corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Cotton 
      (“Merger Sub”), and JAB Holdings B.V., a private limited liability 
      company incorporated under the laws of the Netherlands (“JAB”). Cotton 
      and Merger Sub are affiliates of JAB which will acquire the Company for 
      $21.00 per share in cash pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement 
      and subject to satisfaction or waiver of the conditions included therein 
      (the “Merger”). The Company’s Board of Directors unanimously approved 
      the Merger Agreement, the Merger, and the other transactions 
      contemplated by the Merger Agreement and unanimously resolved to 
      recommend that the Company’s shareholders vote to approve the Merger 
      Agreement.
    

      The transaction is not subject to a financing condition and is expected 
      to close in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, subject to customary 
      closing conditions, including receipt of regulatory and shareholder 
      approvals. The Merger is subject to a vote of the Company’s 
      shareholders. In connection with the proposed Merger, the Company has 
      filed a preliminary proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange 
      Commission (the “SEC”) for a special meeting of the Company’s 
      shareholders at which the shareholders will be asked to vote on whether 
      to approve the Merger. Upon completion of review, if any, of the 
      preliminary proxy statement by the staff of the SEC, a definitive proxy 
      statement will be filed and mailed with a form of proxy to the 
      shareholders of the Company. The Company’s Board of Directors has 
      postponed the Company’s 2016 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, originally 
      scheduled for June 14, 2016. At a later date, the Company will provide 
      information related to a rescheduled meeting, if applicable.
    

First Quarter Fiscal 2017 Highlights Compared to the Year-Ago Period:



        Revenues increased 3.0% to $136.5 million from $132.5 million.
      

        Domestic systemwide same store sales rose 0.7%, including a 0.7% 
        decrease at Company Stores and 1.6% increase at domestic franchise 
        stores; constant currency international franchise same store sales 
        declined 7.3%.
      

        Systemwide store count rose 13.0% from the first quarter of last year 
        to 1,133 shops worldwide.
      

        Operating income was $15.9 million compared to $17.3 million, 
        including $0.5 million in impairment and lease termination costs and 
        $1.6 million in employee termination benefits and Merger related costs 
        in the current year period.
      

        Net income was $9.4 million ($0.14 per share) compared to $10.7 
        million ($0.16 per share) in the first quarter last year.
      

        Adjusted earnings per share rose to $0.25 per share from $0.24 in the 
        first quarter last year.
      

        Cash provided by operating activities was $19.5 million compared to 
        $17.1 million in the first quarter last year.
      

        The Company repurchased 2.4 million shares of its common stock for a 
        total cost of $39.6 million under the authorization approved by the 
        Board of Directors and pursuant to a pre-arranged stock trading plan 
        in accordance with guidelines specified under Rule 10b5-1 of the 
        Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Company’s policies regarding 
        stock transactions. The settlement of such purchases was $34.2 million 
        during the quarter.
      


Results for the Quarter Ended May 1, 2016


Consolidated Results


      In addition to the results included in the highlights above, direct 
      operating expenses for the first quarter of fiscal 2017 increased to 
      $108.0 million from $103.8 million in the comparable period last year 
      and, as a percentage of total revenues, increased to 79.1% from 78.3%. 
      Direct operating expenses include $1.1 million related to employee 
      termination benefits.
    

      General and administrative expenses were $7.5 million in the first 
      quarter compared to $7.6 million in the same period a year ago. General 
      and administrative expenses in the first quarter of fiscal 2017 include 
      $0.1 million in employee termination benefits and $0.5 million in Merger 
      related costs.
    

      Impairment charges and lease termination costs of $0.5 million in the 
      first quarter of the current year principally relate to the 
      refranchising of certain shop locations which was completed during the 
      second quarter of fiscal 2017.
    

Segment Results


      Revenues at Company Stores increased 3.6% to $94.0 million in the 
      quarter, driven by a 4.7% increase in on-premises sales, which included 
      a 1.8% increase in store operating weeks and 0.7% decrease in same store 
      sales. Sales within the consumer packaged goods category, which 
      represents just under half of the Company Stores segment revenues, 
      increased 2.3% compared to the prior year. Company Stores segment 
      operating income decreased from $7.4 million to $6.0 million in the 
      quarter as a result of the Company Stores contribution margin decreasing 
      from 18.5% to 17.1% and $0.4 million in employee termination benefits. 
      The decrease in contribution margin was primarily due to higher shop 
      labor partially offset by lower commodity costs.
    

      Domestic Franchise revenues increased 11.5% to $4.1 million primarily 
      reflecting higher royalties. Total sales by domestic franchisees rose 
      6.7%, and same store sales at domestic franchise shops increased 1.6%. 
      The Domestic Franchise segment generated operating income of $2.5 
      million compared to $2.1 million in the same period last year, and 
      included $0.2 million in employee termination benefits.
    

      International Franchise revenues increased 1.9% to $6.9 million from 
      $6.7 million last year principally due to higher royalties and franchise 
      fees. Unfavorable foreign exchange rates adversely affected royalty 
      revenues and segment operating income by approximately $300,000. Sales 
      by International Franchise stores declined 1.9%, largely due to 
      unfavorable foreign exchange rate impacts. Excluding the effects of 
      changes in foreign exchange rates, International Franchise stores sales 
      rose 2.8%. Constant currency same store sales at International Franchise 
      stores declined 7.3%. International Franchise segment operating income 
      decreased to $4.6 million compared to $4.9 million in the quarter last 
      year primarily due to the negative impact of foreign exchange rates and 
      $0.3 million in employee termination benefits.
    

      KK Supply Chain revenues (including sales to Company stores) rose 0.8% 
      to $64.0 million and external KK Supply Chain revenues rose 0.6% to 
      $31.5 million. KK Supply Chain generated operating income of $12.0 
      million compared to $10.9 million last year, primarily due to higher 
      volumes and lower operating costs partially offset by $0.2 million in 
      employee termination benefits.
    

Full Year Outlook and Conference Call


      Due to the proposed Merger, the Company will not be updating its outlook 
      for fiscal 2017 and will not be holding a conference call to discuss its 
      first quarter fiscal 2017 results.

      circumstances that could give rise to the termination of the Merger 
      Agreement; the inability to complete the transactions contemplated by 
      the Merger Agreement due to the failure to obtain the required 
      shareholder approvals; the inability to satisfy the other conditions 
      specified in the Merger Agreement, including, without limitation, the 
      receipt of necessary governmental or regulatory approvals required to 
      complete the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement; the risk 
      that the proposed transactions disrupt current plans and operations, 
      increase operating costs and the potential difficulties in customer loss 
      and employee retention, the outcome of any legal proceedings that may be 
      instituted against the Company, and the possibility that the Company may 
      be adversely affected by other economic, business, and/or competitive 
      factors. These and other risks and uncertainties, which are described in 
      more detail in the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K and 
      other reports and statements filed with the United States Securities and 
      Exchange Commission, are difficult to predict, involve uncertainties 
      that may materially affect actual results and may be beyond the 
      Company’s control, and could cause actual results, performance or 
      achievements to be materially different from those expressed or implied 
      by any of these forward-looking statements. New factors emerge from time 
      to time, and it is not possible for management to predict all such 
      factors or to assess the impact of each such factor on the Company. Any 
      forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which such 
      statement is made, and the Company does not undertake any obligation to 
      update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances 
      after the date on which such statement is made.

KRISPY KREME DOUGHNUTS, INC.


NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION


(Unaudited)


      Management evaluates the Company’s results of operations using, among 
      other measures, adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share, 
      which reflect the provision for income taxes only to the extent such 
      taxes are currently payable in cash. In addition, management excludes 
      from adjusted net income charges and credits that are unusual and 
      infrequently occurring. Management believes adjusted net income and 
      adjusted earnings per share are useful performance measures because they 
      more closely measure the cash flows generated by the Company’s 
      operations and the trends in those cash flows than do GAAP net income 
      and earnings per share, and because they exclude the effects of 
      transactions that are not indicative of the Company’s ongoing results of 
      operations. Adjusted net income and adjusted earnings per share are 
      non-GAAP measures.
    

      As of January 31, 2016, the Company had net deferred income tax assets 
      of approximately $75 million, of which approximately $26 million related 
      to federal and state net operating loss carryovers. The Company’s 
      federal net operating loss carryovers totaled approximately $124 million.
    

      The Company has reported cumulative pretax income of over $220 million 
      since the beginning of fiscal 2010, and the Company also has generated 
      significant taxable income during this period. However, because of the 
      Company’s utilization of its federal and state net operating loss 
      carryovers and other deferred tax assets, the Company’s cash payments 
      for income taxes have been relatively insignificant during this period. 
      As a result, the provision for income tax expense has substantially 
      exceeded cash payments for income taxes. Until such time as the 
      Company’s net operating loss carryovers are exhausted or expire, GAAP 
      income tax expense is expected to continue to substantially exceed the 
      amount of cash income taxes payable by the Company.
    

      In the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company recorded $1.2 million 
      in employee termination benefits and $0.5 million related to the 
      previously announced Merger. Costs of this magnitude and nature are 
      excluded from adjusted net income because including them is not 
      representative of the ongoing performance of the Company’s remaining 
      assets.
    

      The following non-GAAP financial information and related reconciliation 
      of adjusted net income to GAAP net income are provided to assist the 
      reader in understanding the effects of the above facts and transactions 
      on the Company’s results of operations. In addition, the non-GAAP 
      financial information is intended to illustrate the material difference 
      between the Company’s income tax expense and income taxes currently 
      payable, as well as, reflect the ongoing performance of the business. 
      These non-GAAP performance measures are consistent with other 
      measurements made by management in the operation of the business that do 
      not consider certain employee termination benefits, Merger costs and 
      income taxes except to the extent to which those taxes currently are 
      payable, for example, in capital allocation decisions and incentive 
      compensation measurements that are made on a pretax basis.

      (1) Systemwide sales, a non-GAAP financial measure, include sales by 
      both Company and franchise Krispy Kreme stores but exclude sales 
      among Company and franchise stores. The Company believes systemwide 
      sales data are useful in assessing consumer demand for the Company’s 
      products, the overall success of the Krispy Kreme brand and, 
      ultimately, the performance of the Company. All of the Company’s royalty 
      revenues are computed as percentages of sales made by the Company’s 
      domestic and international franchisees, and substantially all of KK 
      Supply Chain’s external sales of doughnut mixes and other ingredients 
      ultimately are determined by demand for the Company’s products at 
      franchise stores. Accordingly, sales by the Company’s franchisees have a 
      direct effect on the Company’s royalty and KK Supply Chain revenues, and 
      therefore on the Company’s profitability. The Company’s consolidated 
      financial statements appearing elsewhere herein include sales by Company 
      stores, sales to franchisees by the KK Supply Chain segment, and 
      royalties and fees received from franchise stores based on their sales, 
      but exclude sales by franchise stores to their customers.
    

      (2) Computed on a pro forma basis assuming the average rate of exchange 
      between the U.S. dollar and each of the foreign currencies in which the 
      Company’s international franchisees conduct business had been the same 
      in the comparable prior year period.
    

      (3) Company Stores contribution represents Company Stores revenues less 
      costs of food, beverage and packaging; labor and benefit costs; vehicle 
      costs; occupancy and other store related costs and excludes depreciation 
      and amortization expense; marketing expenses and segment general and 
      administration expenses. Company Stores contribution is a non-GAAP 
      financial measure and the Company believes this is a useful measure to 
      assess and evaluate the performance of its Company Stores segment.
    

      (4) The change in “same store sales” represents the aggregate retail 
      sales (excluding fundraising sales) during the current year period for 
      all stores which had been open for 18 or more months during the current 
      year period divided by the aggregate retail sales of such stores for the 
      comparable weeks in the preceding year period. Once a store has been 
      open for at least 18 consecutive months, its sales are included in the 
      computation of same stores sales for all subsequent periods. In the 
      event a store is closed temporarily (for example, for remodeling) and 
      has no sales during one or more weeks, such store’s sales for the 
      comparable weeks during the earlier or subsequent period are excluded 
      from the same store sales computation.
    

      (5) Company Stores consumer packaged goods - wholesale sales “average 
      weekly number of doors” represents the average number of customer 
      locations to which product deliveries to grocers/mass merchants and 
      convenience stores are made during a week by Company Stores and “average 
      weekly sales per door” represents the average weekly sales to each such 
      location by Company Stores.

        Krispy Kreme's owner plans to buy Panera Bread for $7.5 billion

The privately held owner of Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc. is expanding its breakfast reach by offering to buy Panera Bread Co. for $7.5 billion.JAB Holdings Inc. said it would pay $315 per share for Panera, representing a 20 percent premium over Panera’s all-time share price high and a 30 percent premium from its March 31 closing price.The deal including taking over $340 million in Panera debt. The deal is expected to close in the third quarter.JAB is buying a company with $5 billion in sales in 2016.“We are pleased to join with JAB, a private investor with an equally long-term perspective, as well as a deep commitment to our strategic plan,” Ron Shaich, Panera’s founder, chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.The deal requires approval of Panera shareholders. Shaich has agreed to vote his 15.5 percent ownership stake in favor of the deal.By comparison, JAB affiliate JAB Beech paid $1.35 billion for Krispy Kreme on July 27. That deal was worth $21 a share, representing a 25 percent premium over its share price of $16.86 when the deal was announced May 9.As of Dec. 27, Panera had 2,036 restaurants in 46 states and in Ontario, Canada, operating under the brand of Panera Bread, Saint Louis Bread Co. and Paradise Bakery & Café.That includes four in Greensboro, two in Winston-Salem and one each in Boone, Burlington, Clemmons, Kernersville and High Point."By any measure, Panera has been one of the most successful restaurant companies in history,” Shaich said.Shaich said in Panera’ 25 years as a publicly traded company, it has been the best performing restaurant stock of the past twenty years – up over 8,000 percent.“Today's transaction is a direct reflection of those efforts, and delivers substantial additional value for our shareholders,” Shaich said.“The themes we have bet on – digital, wellness, loyalty, omni-channel, new formats for growth – are shaping the restaurant industry today.”Olivier Goudet, a JAB partner and chief executive, said the strong Panera financial performance and management team led JAB to make its offer.“We strongly support Panera's vision for the future, strategic initiatives, culture of innovation, and balanced company vs. franchise store mix,” Goudet said.“We are excited to invest in and work together with the company's management team and franchisees to continue to lead the industry."
JAB said it will follow the same format with Panera as it did with Krispy Kreme, converting them into a private company, retaining local management, headquarters and workforce.However, much of Krispy Kreme’s management team prior to the sale, including chief executive Tony Thompson, have left the company. Most apparently left with lucrative golden-parachute compensation packages.JAB Holding also has a controlling interest in Keurig Green Mountain, Peet’s Coffee & Tea, Caribou Coffee Co., Jacobs Douwe Egberts, Espresso House in Scandinavia, and Einstein Noah Restaurant Group Inc.Nick Setyan, an analyst with Wedbush Securities Inc., said that when Krispy Kreme was taken private that “it has been increasingly clear from recent management articulations of their strategy that they are investing in a long-term transformation of the business.”“Usually, it is easier to focus on the long term as a private company.”John Stanton, a professor of food marketing at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia, said "I'm not sure what direction this will go.""The main issue is whether JAB will allow Panera to stay on the strategy that has made it successful. Businesses frequently buy great brands and then merge them into the company's model, losing the essence of the brand."The other coffee businesses and Krispy Kreme might benefit from the Panera supply chain knowledge," Stanton said. "But Panera and Krispy may not be on the same strategic plane. This might be a case of just letting the separate businesses continue as is."

Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Inc. turned into a private company after JAB Beech, Inc. acquired it in July 2016.

KANSAS CITY — Acquisitions have two leading donut makers taking different paths. Hostess Brands, Inc., after being acquired by Gores Holdings, Inc., became a publicly traded company. Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, Inc. turned into a private company after JAB Beech, Inc. acquired it.
U.S. retail sales of donuts reached $1,971,202,966, for the 52 weeks ended Nov. 27, 2016, which was up 3.4% from the previous 52 weeks, according to Information Resources, Inc., a Chicago-based market research firm.
Hostess Brands, behind its Donettes brand, leaped into the No. 1 vendor spot. Company sales rose more than 11% to $357,369,229, accounting for 18.1% of the market share. Second-place Grupo Bimbo saw sales dip 1.3% to $349,807,603, accounting for 17.8% of the market share.




Hostess Brands, behind its Donettes brand, holds the No. 1 vendor spot.

Donut sales for Hostess still failed to reach a pre-bankruptcy mark of $470,377,700 for the 52 weeks ended Dec. 2, 2012, which captured a 29% market share. That year Hostess liquidated because of bankruptcy, and Donettes came off retail shelves. HB Holdings, L.L.C., an affiliate of private equity groups Apollo Global Management L.L.C. and Metropoulos & Co., then bought the Hostess and Dolly Madison snack cake business in 2013.
Company sales bounced back for donuts and more items, drawing the attention of Gores Holdings, Inc. The publicly traded affiliate of Gores Group completed its acquisition of Hostess Brands L.L.C. on Nov. 4 of this year. Gores Holdings was renamed Hostess Brands, Inc. Stock trades on the NASDAQ under the symbol TWNK. Stock was trading at $12.95 per share on Dec. 23, 2016, which compared with a close of $11.48 per share on Nov. 4, 2016.
Along with the $375 million of Gores Holdings’ shareholder equity, additional investors comprising C. Dean Metropoulos and Gores affiliates participated in a $350 million private placement. C. Dean Metropoulos and family will continue to hold about a 42% combined stake in the company.
“We are excited to introduce Hostess as a public company, and I am extremely proud of the job our team has done in repositioning and growing Hostess during the past four years,” said Mr. Metropoulos, executive chairman of Hostess. “I believe the company has strong growth potential and can think of no one better to partner with in this next journey than Alec Gores and the Gores team, who have a well-earned reputation for not only identifying, but adding value to the businesses with which they affiliate.”





Following Hostess and Bimbo in U.S. retail sales of donuts were McKee Foods Corp., Collegedale, Tenn., up 1.3% to $273,739,370 in the 52 weeks ended Nov. 27, 2016; Krispy Kreme, up 6% to $252,166,704; and Flowers Foods, Inc., down nearly 5% to $156,782,931.
Flowers Foods, Inc. in April unveiled new packaging and a new slogan “Make life sweeter!” for its Mrs. Freshley’s brand. The logo features a color scheme of red, white and gold tones to complement a large font.
In food service, Krispy Kreme Doughnuts had 1,133 stores worldwide when the first quarter ended May 1, 2016, which compared with 1,003 at the end of the previous year’s first quarter. Krispy Kreme stopped trading on the New York Stock Exchange after JAB Beech, Inc., an indirect controlled subsidiary of JAB Holding Co., completed its acquisition of the company on July 27, 2016. The portfolio for JAB Holding Co. includes coffee companies Keurig Green Mountain and Jacobs Douwe Egberts. The transaction had a total equity value of about $1.35 billion.





“JAB’s experience and industry knowledge make them the ideal partner to help grow the iconic Krispy Kreme brand throughout the world,” said Tony Thompson, chief executive officer of Krispy Kreme, when the deal was first announced May 9, 2016. “We remain focused on our long-term strategy and continuing to offer our premium, high-quality donuts and sweet treats to consumers around the world.”
Krispy Kreme Doughnuts continued to focus on limited-time offerings in 2016, featuring the Zombie donut, the Pumpkin donut and the Spider Web donut in October; and the Melted Snowman donut and the Santa Belly donut in December. Also in December, the company introduced a Nutty Cocoa Ring donut that is dipped in Nutella hazelnut spread, topped with crunchy hazelnut pieces and drizzled with chocolate icing.




Dunkin' Brands is expanding its footprint.

Dunkin’ Brands Group, Inc., Canton, Mass., named David Hoffman president of Dunkin’ Donuts U.S. and Canada, effective Oct. 3, 2016. He spent 22 years with McDonald’s Corp., most recently as president of high growth markets, which includes China, South Korea, Russia and several other European markets. He replaced Paul Twohig, who retired. Internationally, Dunkin’ Brands had a target of opening about 200 net new restaurants in 2016 across its two brands, Dunkin’ Donuts and Baskin-Robbins.

JAB Holding has been buying well-known consumer brands. Its latest purchase is Krispy Kreme.



A German billionaire family has been on a breakfast buying binge. The newest item on its plate: doughnuts.The board of Krispy Kreme, best known for its warm glazed doughnuts, agreed to the company’s acquisition by JAB Holding Company and a minority investor, BDT Capital Partners, for $1.35 billion, it announced on Monday. JAB is the investment arm of the Reimann family, the heirs to the German consumer goods conglomerate Joh. A. Benckiser.Its subsidiary, JAB Beech, plans to add the company’s doughnuts to its other quick-serve American breakfast staples, including several coffee chains and a bagel company. In recent years, JAB has acquired the parent company of Einstein Brothers Bagels, as well as Peet’s Coffee & Tea, Stumptown Coffee Roasters and Caribou Coffee. In December, JAB acquired Keurig Green Mountain for $13.9 billion, its biggest bet yet in building its coffee empire.Krispy Kreme, founded almost 80 years ago, is most famous for its glazed doughnut, but it also sells a wide assortment of other flavors such as lemon-filled and sour cream. More recently, the company has made coffee a priority with new offerings and promotions.

Coffee also happens to be the key ingredient in JAB’s other recent acquisitions. JAB’s portfolio makes it the “near-ideal candidate” to control Krispy Kreme, Will Slabaugh, an analyst at Stephens, said in a research note on Monday. JAB would be able to improve Krispy Kreme’s operations, add food and beverage options, and help it expand nationally and internationally, he said. Continue reading the main story

Breakfast has become more lucrative for fast-food restaurants in recent years. All-day breakfast at McDonald’s contributed to a 35 percent increase in its first-quarter profit. Other chains, such as Wendy’s and Taco Bell, have also focused more intently on the first meal of the day.The attention created more competition for customers in the morning hours, a time when Krispy Kreme already had fierce competition from Starbucks, Dunkin’ Donuts and Tim Hortons.JAB plans to acquire Krispy Kreme for $21 a share in cash, a premium of more than 25 percent from Friday’s closing price. Krispy Kreme has almost no debt. Its shares jumped in Monday trading to just a few cents shy of the buyout offer price.BDT Capital Partners, the investment firm led by Byron D. Trott, the former vice chairman of investment banking at Goldman Sachs, is investing alongside JAB and will hold a minority stake.As part of the agreement, Krispy Kreme will remain independently operated from its headquarters in Winston-Salem, N.C., and will no longer trade on the public markets. The transaction, which needs shareholder approval, is expected to close in the third quarter.JAB also has stakes in the cosmetics maker Coty and the shoe designer Jimmy Choo.Wells Fargo provided financial advice to Krispy Kreme, while Barclays and BDT & Company advised JAB. Simpson Thacher & Bartlett and Womble Carlyle Sandridge & Rice were the legal advisers to Krispy Kreme, and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom worked with JAB.
