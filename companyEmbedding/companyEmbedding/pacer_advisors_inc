*Source: FactSet. ETF Implied liquidity is a representation of how many shares can potentially be traded daily in an ETF as portrayed by the creation unit. This is defined as the smallest value of the IDTS (Implied Daily Tradable Shares) for each holding in the creation unit. Applies only to funds in 100% equity exposure.
**Calculation of Premium/Discount of Market Closing Price (or bid/ask midpoint) vs. NAV

NAV (net asset value) is the value of one share of the Fund calculated daily. The NAV return is based on the NAV of the Fund. It may not reflect the actual return for the investor.

Market Price is the price investors can buy and sell ETF shares for in the stock market and is used to calculate market return. It is based on the price at the BATS exchange market close. This is when NAV is determined for most ETFs. If shares trade at another time, the return may differ. Market and NAV returns assume that dividends and capital gain distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at Market Price and NAV, respectively.
