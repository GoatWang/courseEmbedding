     This Agreement and the performance hereunder shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas (excluding any
conflicts of laws provisions) which shall be the exclusive applicable law.

XXI. SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES
     ----------------------

     A.  NGC and Consultant hereby consent to the resolution by arbitration of
all disputes, issues, claims or controversies arising out of or in connection
with this Agreement, that NGC may have against Consultant, or that Consultant
may have against NGC, or against its officers, directors, employees or agents
acting in their capacity as such. Each party's promise to resolve all such
claims, issues, or disputes by arbitration in accordance with this Agreement
rather than through the courts, is consideration for the other party's like
promise. It is further agreed that the decision of an arbitrator on any issue,
dispute, claim or controversy submitted for arbitration, shall be final and
binding upon the NGC and Consultant and that judgment may be entered on the
award of the arbitrator in any court having proper jurisdiction.

     B.  Except as otherwise provided herein or by mutual agreement of the
parties, any arbitration shall be administered in accordance with the
then-current Model Arbitration Procedures of the American Arbitration
Association (AAA) before an arbitrator who is licensed to practice law in the
state in which the arbitration is convened. The arbitration shall be held in
Dallas, Texas or at any other location mutually agreed upon by the parties.

     C.  The parties shall attempt to agree upon the arbitrator. If the parties
cannot agree on the arbitrator, the AAA shall then provide the names of nine (9)
arbitrators experienced in business employment matters along with their resumes
and fee schedules. Each party may strike all names on the list it deems
unacceptable. If more than one common name remains on the list of all parties,
the parties shall strike names alternately until only one remains. The party who
did

                                       8



not initiate the claim shall strike first. If no common name remains on the
lists of the parties, the AAA shall furnish an additional list until an
arbitrator is selected.

     D. The arbitrator shall interpret this Agreement, and any applicable NGC
policy or rules and regulations, any applicable substantive law (and the law of
remedies, if applicable) of the state of Texas, or applicable federal law. In
reaching his or her decision, the arbitrator shall have no authority to change
or modify any lawful NGC policy, rule or regulation, or this Agreement. The
arbitrator, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have
exclusive and broad authority to resolve any dispute relating to the
interpretation, applicability, enforceability or formation of this Agreement,
including, but not limited to, any claim that all or any part of this Agreement
is voidable.

XXII.   NOTICE
        ------

        Any notice to be given hereunder shall be in writing, mailed by
certified or registered mail with return receipt requested addressed to NGC:

expenses. Consultant must certify on each invoice that the charges for the
period covered by it do not include any charges for assignments not authorized
by the Agreement. A suggested certification is as follows:

     "The undersigned certifies that the payment requested herein is
     correct and just, and that payment has not been received. The
     undersigned certifies that this invoice does not include any
     charges for services not authorized by the Agreement and,
     specifically, that no services have been performed involving the
     influence or attempt to influence any Federal agency officer




          or employee, any Member of Congress, officer or employee of
          Congress, or employee of a Member of Congress, in connection
          with any Federal action as defined in the Byrd Amendment
          (including the awarding, extension, continuation, renewal,
          amendment, or modification of any Federal contract); and that
          no services have been performed regarding advice, information,
          direction or assistance to NGC for a Federal contract."

Unless your services are fully described and accurately recorded in this
fashion, your fees will not be paid by NGC. You are not authorized to engage in
any activity covered by the Byrd Amendment (31 U.S.C. Section 1352), but if you
do so you must clearly identify it as such in your activity report, and the
activity you describe shall be treated as a material representation of fact upon
which NGC shall rely in preparing any certifications and/or disclosures required
by the Byrd Amendment, 31 USC Section 1352. Any and all liability arising from
an erroneous representation shall be borne solely by you.

The Amazon.com Textbooks Store




	
Are you tired of paying a small fortune for your textbooks every year? Wouldn’t you rather buy cheap college textbooks and have more money to buy that great pair of skinny jeans, eat out more often instead of heating up a frozen pizza, or just have a little more spending money? When you come to Amazon.com, you can save money by buying cheap new and used textbooks and by renting textbooks for college. You can also trade your used textbooks for an Amazon Gift Card, whether you bought your books from us or not. By being a smart shopper and saving money on textbooks at Amazon.com, you’ll have more cash for the things in life that can’t be learned from a textbook.

The Amazon Textbooks Store allows you to shop online and buy all your textbooks without ever leaving the comfort of your couch. We offer a variety of new, used, rental, and eTextbooks. Don’t worry about selection, we’ve got your textbook needs covered for any subject from biology, chemistry, and nursing to accounting, arts, and engineering. Once you’re finished with your textbooks you can trade them in at Amazon.com and get up to 80% of their value in an Amazon Gift Card.   

Shop the Amazon Textbooks Store and save up to 90% on textbook rentals, up to 90% on used textbooks, and up to 50% on new textbooks. You can also enjoy Free Two-Day Shipping on millions of items, including cheap college textbooks, when you join Prime Student. Get your textbooks delivered to your door and save both time and money by shopping at Amazon.com. So go ahead and treat yourself to that designer purse or new video game, you can since you’ve saved so much on your textbooks.

eTextbook Studying Features
Learn about eTextbook features that help you study smarter, not harder.












We know there are things you would rather be doing than studying, so we built X-Ray for Textbooks to help you save time. With X-Ray for Textbooks, get everything you need with a single tap, including definitions, related pages in your eTextbook, and even relevant content from other sources like Wikipedia and YouTube. X-Ray for Textbooks is available on Fire tablets and the free Kindle Reading App for iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac on select eTextbooks. To access X-Ray for Textbooks, bring up the control bar within an eTextbook by tapping at the top or bottom of your screen.  You can find the X-Ray for Textbooks button at the top of the control screen.

Just carrying around a yellow highlighter? How about pink, blue, orange, and yellow? Multi-color highlights are available on Fire tablets, iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. Tap a word and hold–the digital highlighting tool will pop up and you can adjust the highlighted text and highlight color. You can categorize and save all your highlights in Notebook and even turn them into flashcards with the click of a button; go to Notebook and click on the Flashcards button to create flashcards from your highlights. We store all your highlights at kindle.amazon.com so you can reference them even after you return the eTextbook.














Studying for exams? Notebook for eTextbooks displays all of your notes, colored highlights, saved images and bookmarks in one place. With Notebook you can mark and filter your most important concepts to study when it's test time–you can even export them to email and Evernote on Fire tablets. It's like a digital scrapbook for your studies. Notebook is available on Fire HD tablets and the free Kindle Reading App for iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. On iOS and Android devices, tap the top or bottom of the screen from within the eTextbook to bring up the controls to access Notebook. On PC/Mac, the Notebook icon is on the left side of the Kindle Reading app.














Just finished a chapter and need to review key terms and definitions? Flashcards allow you to quickly brush up on all the terms, concepts, and definitions in each chapter with a simple, easy to use interface. Flashcards are available on iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac from within the eTextbook. Click on the flashcards icon to make your own flashcards. Or, you can auto-generate Flashcards from your notes and highlights and X-Ray terms if your eTextbook includes X-Ray for eTextbooks.














Have a tablet and a laptop? With eTextbooks, you can read your content on all your devices with the free Kindle Reading App. eTextbooks are currently supported on Fire tablets, iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. eTextbooks give you access to your content however you want, whenever you need it. Kindle's Whispersync technology also synchronizes the furthest page you read, your bookmarks, and annotations across your devices so you can pick up where you left off.














You can save money and space in your bag with eTextbooks. Read across your devices and save time studying the concepts you need to learn with interactive features such as Keyword Search and X-Ray for Textbooks. Quickly create and manage your notes and highlights and access them anytime in the Amazon cloud.














Carry less around campus this semester. Take your entire library with you wherever you go, without having to lug around all of your physical textbooks. You can also access all of your eTextbooks, notes, and bookmarks wherever you go, whether it's on your Fire tablet, iPad, iPhone, Android device, PC, or Mac with the free Kindle Reading App.














With the swipe of a finger, quickly and efficiently navigate through pages and chapters of eTextbooks. Swift navigation is available on Android and iOS tablets. Tap the top or bottom of your tablet screen from inside the eTextbook to access swift navigation. On iPads, you have the option of swiping through all the pages from a grid like the one shown above.
