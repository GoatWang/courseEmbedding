We have developed several different product lines based on the DCVax technology, to address multiple different cancers and different patient situations. There are two main components to each DCVax product: the immune cells (dendritic cells) and the cancer biomarkers (antigens).
All of our DCVax product lines are made from the patient’s own dendritic cells. The dendritic cells are freshly isolated, and newly matured and activated. We believe that the existing dendritic cells in a cancer patient have already been compromised by the cancer, and we believe that is the reason other vaccines aimed at the existing dendritic cells in patients have largely failed. However, the patient’s body continues to produce new precursors of dendritic cells, and these precursors (called “monocytes”) circulate in the patient’s blood stream. For all DCVax products, these precursors are obtained through a blood draw, and then (through our proprietary manufacturing processes), the precursors are matured into a fresh, uncompromised batch of new dendritic cells.
The biomarker targets (“antigens”) component of the DCVax product, which is combined with the fresh, personalized dendritic cells, varies among the DCVax product lines.
DCVax-L
DCVax-L — is made with cancer antigens from tumor lysate (a protein extract from processed tumor cells) from the patient’s own tumor tissue. As such, DCVax-L incorporates the full set of tumor antigens, making it difficult for tumors to find ways around it (“escape variants”), as described above. This is the DCVax product that has been used in our GBM brain cancer and ovarian cancer clinical trials, and is currently in our Phase III trial. DCVax-L is expected to be used for any solid tumor cancers in situations in which the patient has their tumor surgically removed as part of standard of care.
DCVax-Direct
DCVax-Direct — is designed for situations in which the tumors are inoperable — where it is not feasible or not desirable for patients to have their tumors surgically removed. This includes situations in which patients have multiple metastases, or for other reasons cannot have their tumors removed. Like DCVax-L, DCVax-Direct also incorporates the full set of tumor antigens — but it does so in situ in the tumor(s) in the patient’s body rather than at the manufacturing facility. With DCVax Direct, the fresh, new dendritic cells are partially matured in a special (patent-protected) way so as to be ready to pick up antigens directly from tumor tissue in the patient’s body, and also communicate the information about those antigens to other agents of the immune system, such as T cells. The partially matured dendritic cells are then injected directly into the patient’s tumor(s). There, the dendritic cells pick up the antigens in situ rather than picking up the antigens from lysate in a lab dish at the manufacturing facility, as is done with DCVax-L. After that, the dendritic cells in DCVax-Direct function similarly as in DCVax-L to mobilize the rest of the immune system.
DCVax-Prostate
DCVax-Prostate — is designed specifically for late stage, hormone independent prostate cancer. Such cancer involves the spread of micro-metastases beyond the prostate tissue. In most patients, there is no focal tumor which can be surgically removed and used to make lysate, or into which dendritic cells can be directly injected. Instead, the cancer cells are diffuse. We have developed a DCVax product line using a particular proprietary antigen — PSMA (Prostate Specific Membrane Antigen) — which is found on essentially all late stage (hormone independent) prostate cancer. The PSMA is produced through recombinant manufacturing methods, and is then combined with the fresh, personalized dendritic cells to make DCVax-Prostate.
Simplicity of DCVax Products for Physicians and Patients
All of the DCVax product lines are designed to be very simple for both physicians and patients, to fit within existing medical practices and procedures, and to be deliverable in virtually any clinic or doctor’s office. A number of complex, sophisticated and proprietary technologies are required for the production and frozen storage of DCVax, but these technologies are mostly deployed at the manufacturing facility and do not entail any effort or involvement by physicians or patients.
Front-end simplicity
For all DCVax product lines, the precursors (monocytes) for the fresh, new dendritic cells are obtained through a leukapheresis blood draw. This blood draw can be done not only at the hospital or cancer center where the patient is being treated, but at any blood center such as the Red Cross.
For DCVax-L, the collection of the patient’s tumor tissue, which is to be used to make lysate and provide the antigen component of the vaccine, involves a simple kit. The kit consists of a box with a vial which has a grinder top and is pre-loaded with a proprietary mix of enzymes. Such kits can be kept on hand like any inventory item at medical centers. In the operating room, after the tumor has been surgically removed, instead of disposing of the tissue in the medical waste, the nurse or technician chops the tissue coarsely and drops it into the vial, puts the vial back into the box, and hands the box to a courier pick-up service such as FedEx’s or UPS’ life science division, or a specialized courier such as World Courier or Quick Stat.
For DCVax-Direct and DCVax-Prostate, there is no tumor tissue collection involved.
Back-end simplicity
For all DCVax-L products, administration to the patient involves a simple intra-dermal injection under the skin. All DCVax-L products are stored frozen in single doses. Such doses are tiny, and require less than 5 minutes to thaw. DCVax must remain frozen throughout the distribution and delivery process, until the time of administration to the patient, and cannot be handled at room temperature before that. Hospitals, pharmacies and physicians may need to adopt new requirements for handling, distribution and delivery of DCVax.
There are no handling steps at the point of care except thawing the frozen DCVax product to room temperature and then loading it into a standard syringe (the same type of syringe used for insulin shots). There are also no intravenous infusions. DCVax-L and DCVax-Prostate are administered through a simple intra-dermal injection under the skin, similar to a flu shot, and are just a few drops in size. With the absence of handling steps at the point of care, and the simple intra-dermal injection, these DCVax products can be delivered to patients in virtually any clinic or doctor’s office.
The simplicity for patients also lies in the fact that DCVax is non-toxic. Patients do not have to take a second set of drugs to manage side effects of DCVax.

Business model[edit]
Northwest relies upon the contract manufacturing organization Cognate Bioservices for services supporting manufacture of product for clinical trials. The relationship with Cognate is long term, having begun before 2007 and slated to extend through the first quarter of 2016.[1]:15 Due to cash flow issues common to development-stage companies, Northwest compensates Cognate through a combination of cash and stock payments.[1]:16 Further, Cognate has provided Northwest with at least one short-term loan, provided and paid in mid-2013.[1]:16 As of 2014[update], Northwest is undergoing an increase in activities as a result of expanding clinical trials, which has led to increasing reliance on Cognate for services, and subsequent renegotiation of the agreement with Cognate.[1][3]

Technology[edit]
The DCVax technology upon which NWBO's therapies rely involves injecting cancer patients with dendritic cells, which contain high levels of the same antigens found in tumor cells. The immune system, alerted by these antigens, attacks the cancer as well as the injected cells.
Dendritic cells[edit]
Northwest Biotherapeutics currently has three different cancer treatments in various levels of clinical trial. One thing in common to all three products is the use of dendritic cells, one of many types of white blood cells. The basic principle behind the DCVax line of products is that if one injects or creates a large enough number of dendritic cells carrying mutant proteins matching a cancer, these dendritic cells will excite enough T-cells and B-cells to overwhelm the cancer's many defenses.[citation needed]
DCVax-L[edit]
DCVax-L is a solid-tumor cancer therapy currently in phase III clinical testing in the US, Canada, Germany, and the UK, for newly diagnosed GBM, a common and aggressive form of brain cancer.[4] In Germany, it is being tested on all "gliomas" not just newly diagnosed GBM.[citation needed]
In this variation of the DCVax line, the tumor is removed through surgery, and some of the tumor presented to the aforementioned dendritic cells for the scavenging of tumor proteins. These dendritic cells, laden with tumor protein antigens, are then injected under the skin near lymph nodes. The dendritic cells then travel to the local lymph node where the dendritic cells present the proteins to the T and B Cells as previously described.[citation needed]
These dendritic cells are grown in the lab starting from stem cells extracted from the patient's blood.[citation needed] Only a sugar cube sized sample of the tumor is needed for subsequent presentation to the dendritic cells. The tumor sample is first broken down into constituent proteins using a caustic process known as lysing. (Thus the L in the name DCVax-L.) After the resulting "tumor lysate" is presented to the dendritic cells, they are ready for injection under the skin near the selected lymph node(s). Note that there are roughly 500 different lymph nodes in the body. Most are peripheral, some are internal.
DCVax-Direct[edit]
DCVax-Direct is the latest addition to the DCVax line, and is currently in phase 1 trials in the US.[citation needed] With DCVax-Direct, there is no removal of the tumor, making DCVax-Direct ideal for inoperable tumors, if proven effective. For that reason, DCVax-Direct is currently in Phase 1 testing on patients with inoperable tumors for a very large range of cancer types.
In the DCVax-Direct procedure, the dendritic cells are developed as in the DCVax-L process, prior to antigen exposure / "pulsing". In Direct however, the subsequent exposure to tumor antigens does not occur in vitro, but rather in vivo. The prepared dendritic cells, along with adjuncts, are injected directly into one or more tumors.
At least two adjuncts are added to the dendritic cells. One adjunct excites a general aspect of the body’s immune response, while another excites a more tumor specific response.[citation needed] This mixture is then injected into the patient's tumor. There, the dendritic cells are expected to scavenge tumor proteins, and then find their way to the local lymph node for presentation of the tumor protein antigens to T-Cells and B-Cells. The activated T-Cells and B-Cells then travel to the tumor and kill tumor cells. Ruptured tumor cells would release more mutant proteins that are picked up by dendritic cells and other immune cells, and carried to the lymph nodes to excite still more B and T-Cells. This cycle repeats, spiraling upward and then leveling off at a high but safe level. Or, at least that is what is expected to be seen in the ongoing phase 1 trial, which finished enrollment in July, 2014.
DCVax-L + DCVax-Direct, if effective, could combine to address virtually all forms of solid tumor cancers, operable and inoperable. One exception might be prostate cancer.[why?]
DCVax-Prostate[edit]
Northwest completed phase II clinicals for DCVax-Prostate some time ago, and received permission from the FDA to move forward with a phase III.[citation needed] The phase III trial is expected to be quite large, and Northwest has been seeking partnering to take on that endeavor.

The DCVax-Prostate process is similar to DCVax-L, but rather than using the patient's tumor as the protein source, Northwest utilizes a synthetic protein that was determined to be a very common mutated protein located on prostate cancer cells.[citation needed] This method is very different, and is expected to be far more effective than the current approved immunotherapy for prostate.[citation needed]
Dendreon uses PAP, while NWBO uses PSMA. According to representatives at NWBO Dendreon’s target antigen (PAP) is not expressed on all prostrate cancers. They have to screen their patients to see the expression of their target. NWBO’s target antigen (PSMA) is expressed on all prostrate cancers. Additionally, with Dendreon’s target, the level of expression goes down as the cancer progresses. The level of expression on NWBO’s target goes up as the cancer progresses.[5]
Another difference in the target antigens is NWBO’s target is bound to the membrane of the tumor cell. “If the DCVax® hits our target,” explains Linda Powers, “it hits the cell for sure. Dendreon’s target is secreted by the cell, so while the target is close by, it is not necessarily bound to the cell in every instance. Antibodies can come along and glom onto to the target and not hit the cell itself, which means accuracy is an issue."[5]
Production efficiency[edit]
The high cost of production for first generation dendritic cell therapies is often used as evidence that DCVax-Prostate and the other DCVax therapies will not be economically viable. These arguments consistently ignore the fact that Northwest Biotherapeutics has developed and regularly utilizes methods to freeze dendritic cells for transport and storage. This gives NWBO an enormous production cost advantage over these older therapies and over current would-be competitors, in part because it allows centralized processing of the patient samples at one enormous facility. Further, as mentioned, Northwest has developed and patented automated mfg processes that further reduce cost. The manufacturing processes are similar for all three of Northwest’s therapies. For each of the three, the production process is identical regardless of the patient, and even regardless of the solid tumor cancer type. Combined with centralized automatic mfg, this greatly simplifies large scale production, potentially allowing cost efficiency to reach levels unexpected for a product that is not a pill.[5]
Products[edit]
DCVax-L is now in Phase 3 trials in USA & Europe. It was awarded orphan drug status.
DCVax-Direct is a therapy to treat inoperable solid tumors in Phase 1 trials in the US.
DCVax-Prostate finished Phase 2 trials and has been approved for Phase 3 trials in the US.

Another difference in the target antigens is NWBO’s target is bound to the membrane of the tumor cell. “If the DCVax® hits our target,” explains Linda Powers, “it hits the cell for sure. Dendreon’s target is secreted by the cell, so while the target is close by, it is not necessarily bound to the cell in every instance. Antibodies can come along and glom onto to the target and not hit the cell itself, which means accuracy is an issue."[5]
Production efficiency[edit]
The high cost of production for first generation dendritic cell therapies is often used as evidence that DCVax-Prostate and the other DCVax therapies will not be economically viable. These arguments consistently ignore the fact that Northwest Biotherapeutics has developed and regularly utilizes methods to freeze dendritic cells for transport and storage. This gives NWBO an enormous production cost advantage over these older therapies and over current would-be competitors, in part because it allows centralized processing of the patient samples at one enormous facility. Further, as mentioned, Northwest has developed and patented automated mfg processes that further reduce cost. The manufacturing processes are similar for all three of Northwest’s therapies. For each of the three, the production process is identical regardless of the patient, and even regardless of the solid tumor cancer type. Combined with centralized automatic mfg, this greatly simplifies large scale production, potentially allowing cost efficiency to reach levels unexpected for a product that is not a pill.[5]
Products[edit]
DCVax-L is now in Phase 3 trials in USA & Europe. It was awarded orphan drug status.
DCVax-Direct is a therapy to treat inoperable solid tumors in Phase 1 trials in the US.
DCVax-Prostate finished Phase 2 trials and has been approved for Phase 3 trials in the US.

Business model[edit]
Northwest relies upon the contract manufacturing organization Cognate Bioservices for services supporting manufacture of product for clinical trials. The relationship with Cognate is long term, having begun before 2007 and slated to extend through the first quarter of 2016.[1]:15 Due to cash flow issues common to development-stage companies, Northwest compensates Cognate through a combination of cash and stock payments.[1]:16 Further, Cognate has provided Northwest with at least one short-term loan, provided and paid in mid-2013.[1]:16 As of 2014[update], Northwest is undergoing an increase in activities as a result of expanding clinical trials, which has led to increasing reliance on Cognate for services, and subsequent renegotiation of the agreement with Cognate.[1][3]

Technology[edit]
The DCVax technology upon which NWBO's therapies rely involves injecting cancer patients with dendritic cells, which contain high levels of the same antigens found in tumor cells. The immune system, alerted by these antigens, attacks the cancer as well as the injected cells.
Dendritic cells[edit]
Northwest Biotherapeutics currently has three different cancer treatments in various levels of clinical trial. One thing in common to all three products is the use of dendritic cells, one of many types of white blood cells. The basic principle behind the DCVax line of products is that if one injects or creates a large enough number of dendritic cells carrying mutant proteins matching a cancer, these dendritic cells will excite enough T-cells and B-cells to overwhelm the cancer's many defenses.[citation needed]
DCVax-L[edit]
DCVax-L is a solid-tumor cancer therapy currently in phase III clinical testing in the US, Canada, Germany, and the UK, for newly diagnosed GBM, a common and aggressive form of brain cancer.[4] In Germany, it is being tested on all "gliomas" not just newly diagnosed GBM.[citation needed]
In this variation of the DCVax line, the tumor is removed through surgery, and some of the tumor presented to the aforementioned dendritic cells for the scavenging of tumor proteins. These dendritic cells, laden with tumor protein antigens, are then injected under the skin near lymph nodes. The dendritic cells then travel to the local lymph node where the dendritic cells present the proteins to the T and B Cells as previously described.[citation needed]
These dendritic cells are grown in the lab starting from stem cells extracted from the patient's blood.[citation needed] Only a sugar cube sized sample of the tumor is needed for subsequent presentation to the dendritic cells. The tumor sample is first broken down into constituent proteins using a caustic process known as lysing. (Thus the L in the name DCVax-L.) After the resulting "tumor lysate" is presented to the dendritic cells, they are ready for injection under the skin near the selected lymph node(s). Note that there are roughly 500 different lymph nodes in the body. Most are peripheral, some are internal.
DCVax-Direct[edit]
DCVax-Direct is the latest addition to the DCVax line, and is currently in phase 1 trials in the US.[citation needed] With DCVax-Direct, there is no removal of the tumor, making DCVax-Direct ideal for inoperable tumors, if proven effective. For that reason, DCVax-Direct is currently in Phase 1 testing on patients with inoperable tumors for a very large range of cancer types.
In the DCVax-Direct procedure, the dendritic cells are developed as in the DCVax-L process, prior to antigen exposure / "pulsing". In Direct however, the subsequent exposure to tumor antigens does not occur in vitro, but rather in vivo. The prepared dendritic cells, along with adjuncts, are injected directly into one or more tumors.
At least two adjuncts are added to the dendritic cells. One adjunct excites a general aspect of the body’s immune response, while another excites a more tumor specific response.[citation needed] This mixture is then injected into the patient's tumor. There, the dendritic cells are expected to scavenge tumor proteins, and then find their way to the local lymph node for presentation of the tumor protein antigens to T-Cells and B-Cells. The activated T-Cells and B-Cells then travel to the tumor and kill tumor cells. Ruptured tumor cells would release more mutant proteins that are picked up by dendritic cells and other immune cells, and carried to the lymph nodes to excite still more B and T-Cells. This cycle repeats, spiraling upward and then leveling off at a high but safe level. Or, at least that is what is expected to be seen in the ongoing phase 1 trial, which finished enrollment in July, 2014.
DCVax-L + DCVax-Direct, if effective, could combine to address virtually all forms of solid tumor cancers, operable and inoperable. One exception might be prostate cancer.[why?]
DCVax-Prostate[edit]
Northwest completed phase II clinicals for DCVax-Prostate some time ago, and received permission from the FDA to move forward with a phase III.[citation needed] The phase III trial is expected to be quite large, and Northwest has been seeking partnering to take on that endeavor.





This article needs to be updated. Please update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. (December 2015)


The DCVax-Prostate process is similar to DCVax-L, but rather than using the patient's tumor as the protein source, Northwest utilizes a synthetic protein that was determined to be a very common mutated protein located on prostate cancer cells.[citation needed] This method is very different, and is expected to be far more effective than the current approved immunotherapy for prostate.[citation needed]
Dendreon uses PAP, while NWBO uses PSMA. According to representatives at NWBO Dendreon’s target antigen (PAP) is not expressed on all prostrate cancers. They have to screen their patients to see the expression of their target. NWBO’s target antigen (PSMA) is expressed on all prostrate cancers. Additionally, with Dendreon’s target, the level of expression goes down as the cancer progresses. The level of expression on NWBO’s target goes up as the cancer progresses.[5]
Another difference in the target antigens is NWBO’s target is bound to the membrane of the tumor cell. “If the DCVax® hits our target,” explains Linda Powers, “it hits the cell for sure. Dendreon’s target is secreted by the cell, so while the target is close by, it is not necessarily bound to the cell in every instance. Antibodies can come along and glom onto to the target and not hit the cell itself, which means accuracy is an issue."[5]
Production efficiency[edit]
The high cost of production for first generation dendritic cell therapies is often used as evidence that DCVax-Prostate and the other DCVax therapies will not be economically viable. These arguments consistently ignore the fact that Northwest Biotherapeutics has developed and regularly utilizes methods to freeze dendritic cells for transport and storage. This gives NWBO an enormous production cost advantage over these older therapies and over current would-be competitors, in part because it allows centralized processing of the patient samples at one enormous facility. Further, as mentioned, Northwest has developed and patented automated mfg processes that further reduce cost. The manufacturing processes are similar for all three of Northwest’s therapies. For each of the three, the production process is identical regardless of the patient, and even regardless of the solid tumor cancer type. Combined with centralized automatic mfg, this greatly simplifies large scale production, potentially allowing cost efficiency to reach levels unexpected for a product that is not a pill.[5]

DCVax-L is now in Phase 3 trials in USA & Europe. It was awarded orphan drug status.
DCVax-Direct is a therapy to treat inoperable solid tumors in Phase 1 trials in the US.
DCVax-Prostate finished Phase 2 trials and has been approved for Phase 3 trials in the US.

					Full Description



Northwest Biotherapeutics, Inc., incorporated on July 29, 1998, is a biotechnology company. The Company is focused on developing immunotherapy products to treat cancer. One of the product lines (DCVax-L) is designed to cover all solid tumor cancers in which the tumors can be surgically removed. Another product line (DCVax-Direct) is designed for all solid tumor cancers. The Company's lead product, DCVax-L, is in an ongoing Phase III trial for diagnosed Glioblastome multiforme (GBM), with over 60 trial sites. Its second product, DCVax-Direct, is being studied in a 60-patient Phase I/II trial for all types of inoperable solid tumors. The 40-patient Phase I stage of the trial has been completed. The Company is working on preparations for Phase II trials of DCVax-Direct.The Company's platform technology, DCVax, uses activated dendritic cells to mobilize a patient's own immune system, including T cells, B cells and antibodies and natural killer cells, among others to attack cancer cells to attack their cancer. Its DCVax platform technology involves dendritic cells, the master cells of the immune system, and is designed to reinvigorate and educate the immune system to attack cancers. The Company's DCVax technology is designed to attack the full set of biomarkers, or antigens, on a patient's cancer, rather than just a particular selected target or several targets.DCVax-LThe Company's product DCVax-L is designed for operable solid tumors. The DCVax-L is made with cancer antigens from tumor lysate (a protein extract from processed tumor cells) from the patient's own tumor tissue. DCVax-L incorporates a set of tumor antigens, making it difficult for tumors to find ways around it (escape variants). DCVax-L is in its 348-patient Phase III clinical trial for GBM brain cancer.DCVax-DirectThe Company's product DCVax-Direct is designed for inoperable solid tumors. The DCVax-Direct incorporates a set of tumor antigens in situ, in the patient's body rather than at the manufacturing facility. With DCVax Direct, the fresh, dendritic cells are partially matured in a way so as to be ready to pick up antigens directly from tumor tissue in the patient's body, and also communicate the information about those antigens to other agents of the immune system, such as T cells. The partially matured dendritic cells are then injected directly into the patient's tumors. DCVax-Direct is indicated for the treatment of inoperable solid tumors. There, the dendritic cells pick up the antigens- in situ rather than picking up the antigens from tumor lysate in a lab dish at the manufacturing facility, as is done with DCVax-L.The Company competes with Juno, Kite, Bellicum, Atara, Argos, Agenus, Asterias, BMS, Merck & Co., Inc., Pfizer, Astra Zeneca, Roche Holding AG, Eisai Co. Ltd., NovoCure and MagForce Nano Technologies AG.

Its true I love the product. But, I do still love this company too. The fact that they are still afloat is a testament to the management. They have persevered through these rough waters. I've seen plenty of other biotechs crumble with far less pressure. It's remarkable they even got here now.   I think they know they have gold. Just praying it's not too little too late. I would hate to see a r/s. It would fuck all of us very hard. They can have a 50 mil share dilution but that's not enough, so without a solid price bump or an ace up her sleeve, a r/s with dilution is imminent.
