About this book




Die Pharmaindustrie sucht nach marktgerichteten, strategischen Führungsinstrumenten. Bio- und Gentechnologie ermöglichen neue Chancen für die Entwicklung, bedeuten aber auch erhöhte Kosten. Generikawettbewerb und globaler Kostendruck verschärfen den Wettbewerb in den Märkten. Erfolgreich sind jene Unternehmen, die eigene Projekte und Produkte wertoptimierend über den gesamten Lebenszyklus hinweg strategisch ausrichten und führen und dazu intern die entscheidenden Instrumente und Fähigkeiten entwickelt haben.

Christian Dreger erarbeitet in einem präskriptiven Modell diese Instrumente und Bewertungsmethoden für das Pharma-Management über den Total-Life-Cycle. Er definiert Managementprozesse, mit denen kontinuierlich neue Informationen eingebunden und bewertet werden. Die Bereiche F&E, ethischer und OTC-Produktlebenszyklus werden über den Total-Life-Cycle wertsteigernd optimiert.
