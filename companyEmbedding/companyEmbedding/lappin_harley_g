CCA Announces Hiring of Harley G. Lappin as Chief Corrections Officer

Wednesday, June 1, 2011 11:00:00 AM


NASHVILLE, Tenn., June 1, 2011 – CCA (Corrections Corporation of America) (NYSE: CXW), America's leader in partnership corrections, announced that effective June 1, 2011, Harley G. Lappin, 55, shall serve as Executive Vice President and Chief Corrections Officer (CCO). In this role, Mr. Lappin will be responsible for the oversight of facility operations, health services, inmate rehabilitation programs, purchasing and TransCor, the Company's wholly-owned transportation subsidiary. He succeeds Richard P. Seiter, who announced his decision to step down as CCO earlier this year, effective May 31, 2011. 
Mr. Lappin, as a career correctional administrator, previously served as the Director, Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) – the nation's largest correctional system, a position he held since 2003, prior to retirement in May 2011. He served in a variety of roles with the Bureau of Prisons for more than 25 years, beginning in 1985, including Regional Director, Warden of the United States Penitentiary in Indiana, and Warden of the Federal Correctional Institution in North Carolina, among other positions. As Director of the BOP, Lappin had oversight and management responsibility for 116 federal prisons, 14 large, private contract facilities and more than 250 contracts for community correction facilities, in total comprising more than 215,000 inmates managed by 38,000 employees, with a $6.4 billion budget. 
"Harley Lappin brings a breadth and depth of correctional expertise and leadership skills to our organization, and we believe his experience will help CCA continue to enhance the important role we play in America's correctional systems," said Damon Hininger, President and CEO. "We are keenly interested in hiring the most qualified leadership team from around the country and developing talent within our own organization. Mr. Lappin's commitment to correctional excellence fits well into our own model of business." 
Speaking of his new career with CCA, Mr. Lappin stated, "I look forward to continuing my career in corrections with a reputable organization like CCA. The company has an outstanding track record of working well with its government partners as they strive to set the highest standards in the administration of a correctional system." 
Having earned a masters degree in criminal justice from Kent State University and an undergraduate degree from Indiana University, Mr. Lappin serves in leadership roles for numerous professional organizations. He is chair of the Standards Committee of the American Correctional Association (ACA), and is a former board member of both the National Institute of Corrections and the Federal Prison Industry Board, and former chair of the Prison Industry Committee of the American State Correctional Administrators Association. Mr. Lappin was honored in 2010 by the ACA with the E.R. Cass Award for Correctional Achievement, the highest honor bestowed by that organization. He has received numerous other awards, including the Associate Warden of the Year award for the Bureau's South Central Region (1992); the Bureau's Excellence in Prison Management award (2000); the Attorney General's Award for Excellence in Management (2001); and the Presidential Rank Award of Meritorious Executive (2004). 
About CCA  CCA is the nation’s largest provider of partnership corrections to federal, state and local government, operating 66 facilities, including 45 company-owned facilities, with approximately 90,000 beds, in 19 states and the District of Columbia. In addition to providing the residential services for inmates, CCA facilities offer rehabilitation and educational programs, including education, vocation, religious services, life skills and employment training and substance abuse treatment.

Outgoing Bureau of Prisons director Harley Lappin arrested for drunk driving

Several days after the Department of Justice announced his retirement, Bureau of Prisons Director Harley Lappin sent an email to staff notifying them that he had recently been arrested for driving under the influence.
“I recently allowed a lapse in my judgment to occur, giving rise to potential embarrassment to the agency, the Department of Justice, and my position of director,” reads an internal email Lappin sent to members of the BOP staff on Tuesday. “I was arrested for driving under the influence. I immediately notified my supervisor, as all of us are required to do, and the matter will proceed through the courts.”
But even though the two announcements were made within a week of each other, Bureau of Prisons spokesperson Traci Billingsley says Lappin made plans to retire long before his recent arrest. “He had plans to retire in spring 2011 before the incident occurred,” Billingsley said.
Lappin has worked at the Bureau of Prisons since 1993, and has been BOP director since 2003, according to WhoRunsGov.



In a statement released last week* announcing Lappin’s retirement, Attorney General Eric Holder said Lappin “has lent his invaluable insights and expertise to address prison overcrowding and expand prisoner development and rehabilitation programs. He has worked tirelessly to provide people who have committed crimes with the job skills and educational opportunities necessary to make positive contributions once they reenter our communities.”
Lappin’s memo to staff is reprinted in full below:




Message from the Director
Topic: Personal Matter
March 29, 2011
Harley G. Lappin, Director
Bureau of Prisons




During my tenure as Director I have enjoyed communicating with you through these Messages to Staff on a variety of important issues. Today, the information is personal and especially difficult to share. Nevertheless, I appreciate the opportunity to address you directly.
I recently allowed a lapse in my judgment to occur, giving rise to potential embarrassment to the agency, the Department of Justice, and my position of Director. I was arrested for driving under the influence. I immediately notified my supervisor, as all of us are required to do, and the matter will proceed through the courts.
As I have said over the years, our behavior as staff extends beyond the confines of our work, because our affiliation with the Bureau of Prisons remains with us regardless of where we are or what we are doing. And as law enforcement officers we have a particular responsibility to respect the rule of law. It is with great humility that I offer my most sincere apology to each and every one of you for failing to lead by example. I extend my sincere gratitude to all of you for the support you have shown me during my tenure as Director and I am confident that through you, the agency will continue to do great things in the years ahead.
I hope to thank many of you personally, prior to my retirement on May 7, 2011, for the wonderful work you do in support of the Bureau of Prisons.
The post originally said that Holder’s statement was released Tuesday. Lappin’s email was released Tuesday, Holder’s statement was released last week.
