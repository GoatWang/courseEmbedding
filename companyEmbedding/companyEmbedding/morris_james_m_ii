Insurance Agent reviews in Oklahoma City

        Real People ~ Real Reviews ~ Real Results      




By far the best bank I work with.  You will not regret it. Even though it is  located in San Provider name locked. , the mobile banking makes it really easy to deposit checks.  Costumer Service is excellent when your working with them.     

            - Donny L.          




Provider name locked. was the absolute worst insurance company I've had the displeasure to deal with!  One of my trucks was destroyed in a May 2003 tornado.  The claims process was a true nightmare!  On my late-model truck, the damage was a crushed bed, broken glass and other damage, while the damage to my '70 Ford F250 was complete and total.  It took a great deal of work on my part to keep them from totalling the Dodge Provider name locked. diesel pickup.  It took me to go out and source parts and such to keep the damage threshold below their total limits, which seemed to me as I was doing the work THEY should've been doing.  That's not all...
The 1970 Ford was my Dad's truck, and I had two professional independent appraisals done on the truck for $7,500 and $8,000.  The Provider name locked. adjuster offered me a whopping $2,456.00 for the truck!  The adjuster claimed that the truck was missing the original air conditioning system (the truck NEVER HAD air, ever!), and that a color change "affected the value significantly"; never mind the color change was complete, to include every square inch of the truck, with the exclusion of the very bottom of the firewall!  He also claimed the color change was to a non-stock color (it was Ford Blue and was painted Ford Red!).  He knew absolutely nothing about Ford trucks at all!  The ended up going to an arbitrator of the Oklahoma Insurance Department, where the claim was "settled" at less than $5K, and I kept the truck remains.
I wholeheartedly recommend you RUN away from Provider name locked. !  Do not take them at their word, ever.  I learned a $3K mistake the hard way in dealing with Provider name locked. ,  I cancelled my policy with them the day I got the Dodge out of the body shop, and sent them a letter stating why I did so.  To add insult to it all, they kept sending me "come back, we miss you!" mailings for the next seven YEARS!  No way, Provider name locked. .
 

            - Patrick D.          




I have been a member of Provider name locked. since I married my husband 10 years ago. He has been a member since 1973. The representatives on the phone are professional and helpful in revising insurance coverage and handling claims. I revised my automobile policy recently online, and it was quite easy. Other insurance companies may be a little cheaper, but Provider name locked. 's service is unmatched.
 

            - Suzanne T.

For example, a doctor may improperly diagnose, treat or medicate outside the standard of medical care. The three types of malpractice are: a settlement, an arbitration award, or a judgment.If my doctor has malpractice history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact the quality of care you receive. Claim settlements and arbitration awards may occur for a variety of reasons, which should not necessarily reflect negatively on the doctor's professional competence or conduct.You may want to use this information to start a discussion with the doctor about his or her history and specific ability to provide healthcare for you.How far back does Healthgrades malpractice history go?Healthgrades reports details of a doctor’s malpractice history when the doctor has at least one closed medical malpractice claim within the last five years, even if he or she no longer practices in that state.For which states does Healthgrades collect malpractice history?Healthgrades collects malpractice information from California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and West Virginia. If your doctor has a malpractice claim, evaluate the information and determine if the action could potentially impact your quality of care. Sometimes multiple states report the same claim. If a provider practices in a state where data is unavailable, please reach out to your local state legislature to help make this data publicly available.0SanctionsNo sanctions history found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What is a sanction or disciplinary actionWhat is a sanction or disciplinary action?A sanction, also known as a disciplinary action, is an action taken to punish or restrict a doctor who has demonstrated professional misconduct. Sanctions may be imposed by a state medical board, professional medical licensing organization, or the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.If my doctor has sanction history, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a sanction, it does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor-quality doctor. Some sanctions are not related to medical care, and involve a doctor’s finances or administrative activities. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, we recommend that you evaluate the doctor’s sanction information and determine how severe or relevant you think the sanction cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades sanction history go?Healthgrades reports state and federal sanctions from the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered. Healthgrades displays all actions for doctors whose licenses have been revoked or surrendered.For which states does Healthgrades collect sanction history?Healthgrades collects sanction history from all 50 U.S. states. Physicians with a disciplinary action in one state may move to another state where they have a clean record. Since Healthgrades painstakingly compiles disciplinary action information from all 50 states, Healthgrades website will show if a physician has a disciplinary action in more than one state.0Board ActionsNo board actions found for the years that Healthgrades collects data.What are board actionsWhat are board actions?Board actions are non-disciplinary actions imposed upon a doctor based on a complaint investigation. A patient or medical colleague may file a complaint with that state medical board or professional licensing organization, which then investigates the complaint. Board actions are intended to ensure that a doctor is able to perform safe medical and health care tasks.Types of non-disciplinary actions include an advisory letter, a corrective action agreement, a limitation or restriction on the medical or healthcare tasks a doctor can perform, or a voluntary agreement by the doctor not to practice. A board action can also include a termination of a corrective action agreement or voluntary agreement, which allows the doctor to return to full practice.If my doctor has a board action, does that mean he or she is a poor-quality doctor?If a doctor has a board action, it means he or she has had a non-disciplinary action imposed upon him or her. It does not necessarily mean that he or she is a poor quality doctor. Before you make any choices about changing your doctor, evaluate the doctor's board action information and determine how severe or relevant you think the cause and action were.How far back does Healthgrades non-disciplinary board action history go?Healthgrades reports non-disciplinary board action history from for the previous five years, except when a doctor's license has been revoked or surrendered.

James Morris was born on April 9, 1920, in Columbus, Ohio. He enlisted in the Aviation Cadet Program of the U.S. Army Air Forces on February 21, 1942, and was commissioned a 2d Lt and awarded his pilot wings at Luke Field, Arizona, on September 29, 1942. His first assignment was as a P-39 Airacobra and then P-38 Lightning pilot with the 77th Fighter Squadron of the 20th Fighter Group at Paine Field, Washington, from September 1942 to January 1943, and then at March Field, California, from January to August 1943. Lt Morris deployed to England with the 77th Fighter Squadron in August 1943, and was credited with the destruction of 7.333 enemy aircraft in aerial combat, plus 2.8333 on the ground while strafing enemy airfields, before he was shot down and taken as a Prisoner of War on July 7, 1944. After spending 312 days in captivity, Capt Morris was released from Stalag Luft 1 in Barth-Vogelsang, Prussia, on May 14, 1945. He returned to the U.S. in July 1945, and after recovering from his captivity, he completed Purchasing and Contracting School in July 1946. Maj Morris served as a Purchasing & Contracting Officer at Selfridge AFB, Michigan, from July 1946 to June 1948, followed by service as Commanding Officer of the 56th Support Squadron and then as Material Officer for the 56th Air Base Group at Selfridge AFB from July 1948 to June 1949. His next assignment was as Assistant Material Officer for the 36th Air Base Group and then Manpower Officer for the 36th Fighter Wing at Furstenfeldbruck AB, Germany, from August 1949 to June 1950, and then as an F-84 Thunderjet pilot and Commander of the 22nd Fighter-Bomber Squadron at Furstenfeldbruck AB from June to November 1950. He served as Tactical Inspector for the 36th Fighter-Bomber Wing from November 1950 to January 1951, followed by service as Material Officer for the 36th Air Base Group from January to September 1951. LtCol Morris next served as Executive Officer for the 36th Air Base Group from October 1951 to May 1952, followed by Air Command and Staff College at Maxwell AFB, Alabama, from June to December 1952. He remained on as an Instructor at Air Command and Staff College from December 1952 to August 1956, and then served as Wing Inspector, Deputy Director of Operations, and then Plans Officer for the 27th Fighter-Bomber Wing at Bergstrom AFB, Texas, from August 1956 to June 1958. After attending French Language School at the Foreign Service Institute, LtCol Morris served as an Operations Staff Officer with the Air Force Military Assistance and Advisory Group in France from February to September 1959. His next assignment was as an Inspector General with Headquarters 10th Air Force at Selfridge AFB from September 1959 to January 1961, followed by service as an Operations Staff Officer with Headquarters 5th Air Force Reserve Region at Selfridge AFB from January 1961 to December 1962. He served as Chief of the Operations Plans Division with the 388th Tactical Fighter Wing at McConnell AFB, Kansas, from December 1962 to January 1963, and then as an F-105 Thunderchief pilot and Commander of the 563rd Tactical Fighter Squadron at McConnell from January to December 1963. LtCol Morris then served as Commander of the 561st Tactical Fighter Squadron at McConnell from December 1963 to September 1964, followed by service as Commander of the 8th Tactical Fighter Squadron at Spangdahlem AB, West Germany, from September 1964 to August 1965. His next assignment was as Assistant Deputy Commander for Operations of the 49th Tactical Fighter Wing at Spangdahlem AB from August 1965 to February 1967, when he deployed to Southeast Asia. He served as an F-105 pilot with the 421st Tactical Fighter Squadron at Korat Royal Thai AFB, Thailand, from March to July 1967, and then as Executive Officer for the 15th Tactical Fighter Wing at MacDill AFB, Florida, from July 1967 until his retirement from the Air Force on September 9, 1969. James Morris died on April 8, 2008, and was buried at the Garden of Memories Cemetery in Tampa, Florida.His Distinguished Service Cross Citation reads:For extraordinary heroism in action with the enemy, 8 February 1944. On that date Captain Morris was Pilot of a P-38 Fighter airplane on a bomber escort mission to Frankfort, Germany. While on this mission Captain Morris attacked and destroyed an ME-109 fighter. Very shortly thereafter he observed a moving train below him and immediately went down to attack it. As he proceeded homeward, he saw, in the vicinity of Sedan, two FW-190 Fighters taking off from an airdrome. Without thought of the danger of engaging the enemy at low altitude over his own airdrome, Captain Morris unhesitatingly attacked and destroyed one of the fighters and proceeded immediately to attack and destroy another FW-190 which had appeared over the field. With his fuel supply dangerously low, and in an area well defended by light anti-aircraft guns, Captain Morris set course for his base. Soon thereafter he sighted an enemy ME-109 flying above and ahead of him. With full knowledge that with his rapidly dwindling fuel supply any deviation from course would seriously jeopardize his chance for safe return to his base, and unmindful of his unfavorable position, Captain Morris courageously flew into attack and succeeded in seriously damaging the enemy aircraft. By his extraordinary flying skill and intrepidity Captain Morris rendered distinguished and valorous service to our nation.
