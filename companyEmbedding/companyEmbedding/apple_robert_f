Antares Pharma Announces Promotion of Robert F. Apple to Chief 
      Operating Officer






September 15, 2014 07:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



EWING, N.J.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Antares Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATRS) today announced that Robert F. Apple 
      has been promoted to Chief Operating Officer effective immediately. The 
      Company also announced that a retained search has begun to fill the 
      position of Chief Financial Officer. Until the position is filled, Mr. 
      Apple will continue to serve as the Company’s Chief Financial Officer as 
      he has since he joined Antares Pharma in 2006.
    


      Eamonn P. Hobbs, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, 
      stated, “Bob’s responsibilities have expanded since he joined the 
      Company to include oversight of the Parenteral Products Group, and we 
      believe that elevating him to Chief Operating Officer will leverage his 
      prior commercial background and his technical expertise in the 
      combination drug/device area, helping the Company increase overall 
      efficiency.” Mr. Hobbs continued, “We congratulate Bob on his promotion 
      and look forward his contributions to Antares Pharma’s future strategic 
      growth.”
    

      Mr. Apple joined the Company in February 2006 as Senior Vice President 
      and Chief Financial Officer and was promoted to Executive Vice 
      President, Chief Financial Officer and President of the Parenteral 
      Products Group in 2008. Prior to joining the Company, Mr. Apple served 
      as Chief Operating and Financial Officer at InKine Pharmaceutical 
      Company, Inc. (“InKine”) from 2003 to 2005, and Chief Financial Officer 
      from 1997 to 2002. In his role as Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Apple was 
      responsible for building a 60 person in-house sales team and grew 
      product sales until the ultimate acquisition of InKine by Salix 
      Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In his role as Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Apple 
      will be responsible for all aspects of operations at Antares Pharma 
      including sales, marketing, manufacturing and product development.
    

      “I’m excited to assume the newly created role of Chief Operating 
      Officer,” stated Robert F. Apple. “Antares Pharma has grown from an 
      innovator of novel technologies to a combination drug/device commercial 
      company in the eight plus years I’ve been here. I believe that the 
      combination of my commercial, technical and financial backgrounds will 
      provide a great source of experience as we move Antares toward becoming 
      a fully integrated pharmaceutical company.”

Business Wire




Sep 15, 2014 7:00 AM EDT













 




























































  Antares Pharma, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATRS) today announced that Robert F. Apple has been promoted to Chief Operating Officer effective immediately. The Company also announced that a retained search has begun to fill the position of Chief Financial Officer. Until the position is filled, Mr. Apple will continue to serve as the Company’s Chief Financial Officer as he has since he joined Antares Pharma in 2006.  Eamonn P. Hobbs, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, stated, “Bob’s responsibilities have expanded since he joined the Company to include oversight of the Parenteral Products Group, and we believe that elevating him to Chief Operating Officer will leverage his prior commercial background and his technical expertise in the combination drug/device area, helping the Company increase overall efficiency.” Mr. Hobbs continued, “We congratulate Bob on his promotion and look forward his contributions to Antares Pharma’s future strategic growth.”  Mr. Apple joined the Company in February 2006 as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and was promoted to Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and President of the Parenteral Products Group in 2008. Prior to joining the Company, Mr. Apple served as Chief Operating and Financial Officer at InKine Pharmaceutical Company, Inc. (“InKine”) from 2003 to 2005, and Chief Financial Officer from 1997 to 2002. In his role as Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Apple was responsible for building a 60 person in-house sales team and grew product sales until the ultimate acquisition of InKine by Salix Pharmaceuticals, Inc. In his role as Chief Operating Officer, Mr. Apple will be responsible for all aspects of operations at Antares Pharma including sales, marketing, manufacturing and product development.  “I’m excited to assume the newly created role of Chief Operating Officer,” stated Robert F. Apple. “Antares Pharma has grown from an innovator of novel technologies to a combination drug/device commercial company in the eight plus years I’ve been here. I believe that the combination of my commercial, technical and financial backgrounds will provide a great source of experience as we move Antares toward becoming a fully integrated pharmaceutical company.”

 |  Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights







RFK Human Rights NewsroomApple CEO Tim Cook Joins Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights’ BoardPosted on apr 6, 2016(New York, N.Y., April 6, 2016)—Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights proudly announces Apple CEO Tim Cook has joined its board of directors.
Announcing the appointment, Kerry Kennedy, President and CEO of Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, said, “Tim knows the importance of advocating for and representing people who have not been heard. He has integrity and does not shy away from challenging issues when he knows they are right and just. Tim is deeply committed to the social justice work that he is helping Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights accomplish.”
Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights is an international human rights organization founded by Robert Kennedy’s family and friends nearly 50 years ago. In December 2015, Tim Cook received the Ripple of Hope Award during the organization’s gala in New York City. The award was granted for Mr. Cook’s commitment to sustainable business practices and his lifelong commitment to human rights.
Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights is governed by its board of directors, a diverse group of experts representing business, finance, academia, government, entertainment, education, and civil society. The organization is dedicated to carrying on Robert Kennedy’s unfinished work of standing with those who stand against oppression, and is comprised of students and activists, lawyers and business leaders, teachers and advocates, all working towards a common goal: achieving Robert Kennedy’s dream of a more just and peaceful world. 
Tim Cook has counted Robert F. Kennedy as a personal hero and inspiration since growing up in rural Alabama. As CEO, Cook has continued to advocate for equality in everything he does and, under his leadership, Apple is determined to leave the world better than they found it. In 1966, Robert F. Kennedy said “everywhere new technology and communications bring men and nations closer together; the concerns of one inevitably become the concerns of all.” Every day, Tim Cook relentlessly works to create products that will change lives, products that change the world, empower the poorest communities though education, and protect our privacy.
"Growing up, I was inspired by Robert Kennedy’s infinite hope for humanity and his belief that people at their core are good, sharing universal goals for themselves and the world in which we live,” said Cook. “Robert Kennedy spoke to our highest aspirations, calling Americans from all walks of life to fight for something better. He was and is a hero and role model to me, and I am honored to serve alongside Kerry and the rest of the board to advance his message of justice and equality."
Ethel Kennedy, founder and board member of Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, said, “We are honored to have Tim Cook on our board. I love that he is inspired to "make gentle the life of the world" and stands with human rights defenders around the globe championing the causes and people Bobby cared about.
Robert F. Smith, Chair of Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights’ board of directors and Founder, Chairman and CEO of Vista Equity Partners, said, “The challenges we face in the world today are distressingly not dissimilar to those of 1968. The inequality, inequity, and inhumanity we read about every day demand the same values, courage, inspiration, and leadership of Robert F. Kennedy. As a technology visionary and a man who understands how people want to interact, engage, and live, Tim will bring this deep understanding to help advance the mission and relevance of Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights, which is needed now more than ever. We are thrilled by his commitment "to bend the arc of history for future generations.”About Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights
Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights takes a three-pronged approach to creating change. Through our advocacy and litigation efforts, we secure lasting legal change, bringing the arm of the law to the defense of the powerless. We engage the business community to be a force for change and prove that investors do well by doing good. We train and educate current and future human rights defenders to build capacity from the ground up to help prevent abuses before they occur.
