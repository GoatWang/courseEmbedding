Erster Eindruck: Rio de Janeiro & Santos Dumont (XP-10) Richard N. Gunes - simFlight.de


                  Spätestens seit der Flughafen Rio de Janeiro für X-Plane erschien, gab es in der Hauptstadt von Brasilien ein Problem, denn wie auch Tropical Sims Santos Dumont besaß der Flughafen ein eigenes Mesh. X-Plane akzeptiert in einer 1×1 Grad Kachel jedoch nur ein Mesh. Richard N. Gunes fand seine eigene Lösung: Er entwickelte einfach ein eigenes Santos Dumont.

VIRTUALCOL - EMBRAER 170-175 REGIONAL JETS FOR FSX P3D

 


HECTOR ALEJANDRO RODRIGUEZ DE ALBA
Nice add on. Very flyable model. I think that something to improve is to add information about the flaps deployed acccording the approach speed in the owner´s manual. At night there is no way to turn off of dimm the cockpit lights. The engines sound need to be more powerful...
Go-od job about the call the gorund serivces..I like it so much.

I recommend this package!








TROPICALSIM - ANTIGUA 2017 TAPA FS9

 


Nadeem Zabaneh
Great Scenery Accurate Detail and nice scenery features. I just wish if this version has more surrounding features such as Roads and cars + general buildings around the airport area to add a real life feeling! 

Nevertheles-s! SUPERB WORK and thanks to the TropicalSim Team for still supporting FS9! Much appreciated!!!

AFS-DESIGN - AIRBUS A350 P3D

 


FRANKLYN SALOMONS
I have purchased my share of sim-lite type aircraft and found them rather enjoyable for what they're worth. When I saw the AFS A350 released for P3D I thought why not? Now the V1 release which you'll see on youtube is really old and looks far from an A350, but the V2 is improved and wanting an A350 with a representative VC in Prepar3d ( I have the freeware FSP version, but the aliased A320/330 VC bugged me) I dove in to take one for the team.
When first released it was listed as V4 ready but this was quickly removed. I thought it was probably gauges but I still have V3.4 so no biggie, install away. Installed in V4 as well. 
In V3, it loads at my selected airport, but, no button in the VC works. Bring up the 2D panels, they work, but nothing in the 3D vc responds. Not a good start. I looked in the sim objects panel folder and the gauges are all xml files, so this should not be an issue, unless...
I loaded V4. Now it does not officially support V4 but lets be honest, the default FSX aircraft and many FSX native freeware port over just fine as long as they don't depend on dll's. But this A350, "Cannot load model" in the vehicle selection screen. Uh oh. This begins to confirm my suspicion. Load it anyway, select my scenario, loading, crash to desktop. 
Now a model that claims to be made for P3D having these much issues in two different P3D version where much older (almost 10 year old) FSX models load fine? So I pull up Model Converter X to check and sure enough, FS2004 based mdl file. Did a quick convert (sans animations) and it loads up in P3D v4 select screen and no crash scenario loads.
I have to say that in light of this discovery I'm very dissapointed with this developer. I was hoping to get it flying in V4 with some tweaks and offset the seeming negative views towards AFS with an honest recorded flight. but no. You release a model claiming it is P3D specific but its just the same FS2004 based mdl because it seemed to work? Not even tried to recompile with any P3D SDK. Nope. 
AFS Design let me give you some advice, Prepar3d V4 is here as well as Flight Sim World, the Microsoft ESP engine is moving forward in 64 bit era, these past few and upcoming weeks are a crucial time as people who are transitioning are eager for Natively produced models and sceneries. Many small developers like you have updated their products supporting FS9 to P3D V4 with each installer made with the Sim's Native SDK. And check the reviews, customers are won over. heck, even DD added an FSW install option to their scenery. I've purchase addons from developers I haven't before just because they made that effort and seeing what they did i would by from them again in a heartbeat. 

In closing, this item labelled as for P3D is outright untrue, but you can redeem yourself. Recompile it with the proper SDK and give that to your existing customers. I personally will rate you higher if you pull through. You have an opportunity right now to gain favor with the community during the transition to V4 and FSW. Other developers have gone in and are reaping the rewards. Don't get left behind.

Your move.

I love this aircraft. They did a great job. It is one of the best I've ever had. Makes me want to fly one in real life :)








FSIMSTUDIOS - CALGARY INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT CYYC FSX P3D

 


Marco Eckl
Perfect scenery, matching in every detail! Just to recommend!!








JETSTREAM DESIGNS - METZ-NANCY LORRAINE X  FSX P3D

 


Scott Harmes
A fantastic representation of this airport. Another great quality scenery from Jetstream Designs.








JUSTSIM - DÜSSELDORF AIRPORT EDDL FSX P3D

 


Philip Jensen
This scenery is really a let down by the ground textures. JUSTSIM other sceneries have better ground textures. It really is disappointing considering the buildings look great. You cannot see it easily from the distance but when taxiing it really shows.








AEROSOFT - TRONDHEIM- VAERNES X 2.0 FSX P3D

 


JASON SMART
This is one of the BEST and comprehensive in terms of developments and advancements I have seen, for instance the animated passengers adds a excellent realism to the overall sim and experience. 

The only negative thing is that the elevation is WAY off for instance on a downward view it takes you under ground, and some GSX integration errors seem apparent, when gSX was offloading my aircrafts luggage, the luggage containers were in the air, and there was NO baggage handler or equipment in sight as they were under ground again directly due to this elevation error.

Also, it seems for a pretty average airport in terms of size it is pretty frame-rate hungry, I have a decent spec PC and overall setup and I am getting some frame rates on ground of 6-10FPS with an average aircraft that I have had or don't have any issue in much more graphic challenging airports such as Mallorca, Malaga X etc in terms of size and details-hopeful-ly these will be rectified/or improved in an update in the very NEAR future, otherwise it is an excellent rendition and enjoyable airport and approach.
