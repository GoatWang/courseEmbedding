Testimonials



Our experience with Lars Soreide was very satisfying. He is a very sincere and dedicated lawyer. He did an excellent job in representing us in front of the arbitrator.We recovered 100% of the funds that we invested with the stockbroker. We highly recommend him.WILL GILLMAN • CLIENTMr. Soreide represented me and Everything went great. I highly recommend hiring Mr. Soreide. Preparation is key and he was super prepared for the hearing. Thank You.TODD FREDERICK • CLIENTWe are so happy we chose Lars K. Soreide of Soreide Law Group to handle a claim against our stock broker. Our long trusted broker was actually not to be trusted. We had lost over 6 figures because of illegal activity the FBI charged him with. We were devastated since my husband and I were in retirement. I researched for many hours before deciding on Lars Soreide to handle the case against our broker to try and recover some of our losses. He was professional and did an outstanding job. He knew how to reach a settlement when another legal firm representing a large group could not reach a settlement due to the size of that groups claim. We are so happy we did not go with the large group and chose someone that would concentrate on our loss and our settlement. We are very satisfied with the way he handled and settled our case. ANN HODY • CLIENTThe Soreide Law Group was of great help to us. They are true professionals in the field of the SEC law and in our case they won a satisfactory settlement. KRISTINA HALL • CLIENTExtremely Knowledgeable, professional, and prompt. No communication issues whatsoever and, of course, the desired best possible outcome was achieved.BRIAN FERY • CLIENTSoreide Law Group helped my wife and I recover a portion of what we lost with an Atlanta brokerage firm. Soreide stayed in touch every step of the way and concluded our claim in the amount of time they originally stated. Very good experience. KEN MILLS • CLIENTLars Soreide is a fantastic litigator and helped me recover 90% of my losses through my broker. After a sick wife, i took my eyes off my brokerage account – turns out the guy was running trades that were substantially more aggressive than the conservative basis i had established my portfolio under. He helped me arbitrate my case and litigated the matter. What do you know, they wound up firing the broker and paid me almost 100% of my losses. This guy is fantastic and will fight harder than any other lawyer I’m convinced to regain your money. He doesn’t get paid unless you do!!JEFFREY K • CLIENTExcellent Attorney, Trustworthy, Knowledgeable and Responsive.
I have many years experience in the legal field and I found Lars to be among the best attorneys that I have had the pleasure of dealing with. I have never had the need to file an action on behalf of myself or my family before. My mother’s life savings was lost to an investment which involved some unscrupulous dealings. I decided that I needed to do something to help my mother recover some of her savings as this investment devastated her financially. After investigating and speaking with several attorneys I was most impressed with Lars. I have dealt with many attorneys over the years due to my work and I found Lars to be extremely intelligent, compassionate and very knowledgeable in this field of litigation. Lars was on top of every detail of the process. Due to his prowess my mother was able to recover a good portion of her lost investment. I cannot say enough about his straight forward dealings with us as well as his compassion towards my mother and her situation. He truly believed in what he was doing for us and he brought this attitude in to the case. If I ever had to file suit again I would not hesitate to contact Lars again in a second. I cannot recommend him enough. He does not relegate you to his staff but he speaks with you directly every time. I was most impressed with his attitude, responsiveness, knowledge and compassion. I cannot thank him enough for helping our family in our time of need.JOHN C • CLIENTThank God for this Guy! Lars Soreide is amazing. He recovered over a half a million dollars of my funds from my churn and burn broker who actually counter sued me after filing the lawsuit. I didn’t even know it was possible to bring this type of lawsuit through FINRA to recover. Glad I went through with it. Would recommend Lars to anyone.Michael M • CLIENTMr. Soreide is very honest, he never promised an outcome but took the case when everyone said there was no case. I was very pleased with the outcome and how we recovered our losses and he saw it through until the end. Marissa Nugent • CLIENTI hired Lars Soreide to represent me against my stock broker who was running a ponzi scheme. Soreide Law sued the firm for not catching the fraud he was running. The case went to a full trial before 3 arbitrators and they awarded us back every dollar I lost in the Ponzi scheme. My wife and I felt this was totally hopeless because the stock broker was in jail and had no money but we collected every penny back from the firm. We owe a huge THANK YOU to Soreide Law Group.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (UNAUDITED)  Forward-Looking Statements  When used in this Form 10-Q, the words "believes", "anticipates," "expects" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties could cause actual results to differ materially from the results stated or implied in this document. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date hereof. We undertake no obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to forward-looking statements which we may make to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this Form 10-Q or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.  This Management's Discussion and Analysis should be read in conjunction with our Financial Statements and the Notes to our Financial Statements.  General  Atlas Resources Public #17-2008 (B) L.P. ("we", "us" or the "Partnership") is a Delaware limited partnership, formed on May 7, 2007 with Atlas Resources, LLC serving as its Managing General Partner and Operator ("Atlas Resources" or "MGP").

 We have drilled and currently operate wells located in Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Ohio. We have no employees and rely on our MGP for management, which in turn, relies on its parent company, Atlas Energy L.P. ("Atlas Energy"), for administrative services.  Our operating cash flows are generated from our wells, which produce natural gas and oil. Our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through third-party gas gathering systems. We do not plan to sell any of our wells and intend to produce them until they are depleted or become uneconomical to produce, at which time they will be plugged and abandoned or sold. We expect that no other wells will be drilled and no additional funds will be required for drilling.  Overview  The following discussion provides information to assist in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. Our operating cash flows are generated from our wells, which produce primarily natural gas, but also some oil. Our produced natural gas and oil is then delivered to market through affiliated or third-party gas gathering systems. Our ongoing operating and maintenance costs have been and are expected to be fulfilled through revenues from the sale of our natural gas and oil production. We pay our MGP, as operator, a monthly well supervision fee, which covers all normal and regularly recurring operating expenses for the production and sale of natural gas and oil such as:   well tending, routine maintenance and adjustment;   reading meters, recording production, pumping, maintaining appropriate books and records; and   preparation of reports for us and government agencies.  The well supervision fees, however, do not include costs and expenses related to the purchase of certain equipment, materials, and brine disposal. If these expenses are incurred, we pay cost for third-party services, materials, and a competitive charge for services performed directly by our MGP or its affiliates. Also, beginning one year after each of our wells has been placed into production, our MGP, as operator, may retain $200 per month, per well to cover the estimated future plugging and abandonment costs of the well. As of March 31, 2013, our MGP had not withheld any funds for this purpose.  Markets and Competition  The availability of a ready market for natural gas and oil produced by us, and the price obtained, depends on numerous factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production, imports of foreign natural gas and oil, political instability or terrorist acts in oil and gas producing countries and regions, market demand, competition from other energy sources, the effect of federal regulation on the sale of natural gas and oil in interstate commerce, other governmental regulation of the production and transportation of natural gas and oil and the proximity, availability and capacity of pipelines and other required facilities. Our MGP is responsible for selling our production. During 2013 and 2012, we experienced no problems in selling our natural gas and oil. Product availability and price are the principal means of competition in selling natural gas and oil production. While it is impossible to accurately determine our comparative position in the industry, we do not consider our operations to be a significant factor in the industry.  Table of Contents  Results of Operations The following table sets forth information relating to our production revenues, volumes, sales prices, production costs and depletion during the periods indicated: Three Months Ended March 31 2013 2012 Production revenues (in thousands): Gas $ 1,634 $ 1,819 Oil 179 319 Liquids - 18 Total $ 1,813 $ 2,156 Production volumes: Gas (mcf/day) (1) 5,051 5,968 Oil (bbl/day) (1) 23 37 Liquids (bbl/day) (1) - 3 Total (mcfe/day) (1) 5,189 6,208 Average sales prices: (2) Gas (per mcf) (1) (3) $ 3.91 $ 3.71 Oil (per bbl) (1) (4) $ 85.31 $ 93.85 Liquids (per bbl) (1) $ - $ 62.79 Production costs: As a percent of revenues 55 % 52 % Per mcfe (1) $ 2.13 $ 1.98 Depletion per mcfe $ 1.86 $ 1.78  (1) "Mcf" represents thousand cubic feet, "mcfe" represents thousand cubic feet equivalent, and "bbl" represents barrels. Bbl is converted to mcfe using the ratio of six mcfs to one bbl.  (2) Average sales prices represent accrual basis pricing after adjusting for the effect of previously recognized gains resulting from prior period impairment charges.  (3) Average gas prices are calculated by including in total revenue derivative gains previously recognized into income in connection with prior period impairment charges and dividing by the total volume for the period. Previously recognized derivative gains were $142,500 and $195,200 for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.  (4) Average oil prices are calculated by including in total revenue derivative gains previously recognized into income in connection with prior period impairment charges and dividing by the total volume for the period. Previously recognized derivative gains were $100 for the three months ended March 31, 2012.  Natural Gas Revenues. Our natural gas revenues were $1,633,600 and $1,818,600 for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, a decrease of $185,000 (10%). The $185,000 decrease in natural gas revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2013 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $296,400 decrease in production volumes, partially offset by a $111,400 increase in our natural gas sales prices after the effect of financial hedges, which was driven by market conditions. Our production volumes decreased to 5,051 mcf per day for the three months ended March 31, 2013 from 5,968 mcf per day for the three months ended March 31, 2012, a decrease of 917 mcf per day (15%). The overall decrease in natural gas production volumes for the three months ended March 31, 2013 as compared to the prior year similar period resulted primarily from the normal decline inherent in the life of a well.  Oil Revenues. We drill wells primarily to produce natural gas, rather than oil, but some wells have limited oil production. Our oil revenues were $178,800 and $319,600 for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, a decrease of $140,800 (44%). The $140,800 decrease in oil revenues for the three months ended March 31, 2013 as compared to the prior year similar period was attributable to a $122,900 decrease in production volumes and a $17,900 decrease in oil prices after the effect of financial hedges. Our production volumes decreased to 23 bbls per day for the three months ended March 31, 2013 from 37 bbls per day for the three months ended March 31, 2012, a decrease of 14 bbls per day (38%).  Table of Contents  Natural Gas Liquids Revenue. The majority of our wells produce "dry gas", which is composed primarily of methane and requires no additional processing before being transported and sold to the purchaser. Some wells, however, produce "wet gas", which contains larger amounts of ethane and other associated hydrocarbons (i.e. "natural gas liquids") that must be removed prior to transporting the gas. Once removed, these natural gas liquids are sold to various purchasers. Our natural gas liquid revenues were $17,800 for the three months ended March 31, 2012.  Costs and Expenses. Production expenses were $994,600 and $1,119,100 for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively, a decrease of $124,500 (11%). This decrease was due to lower transportation fees and monthly supervision fees due to wells being temporarily shut-in for repairs and maintenance.  Depletion of oil and gas properties as a percentage of oil and gas revenues was 48% and 47% for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. These percentage changes are directly attributable to changes in revenues, oil and gas reserve quantities, product prices and production volumes and changes in the depletable cost basis of oil and gas properties.  General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2013 and 2012 were $112,400 and $119,100, respectively, a decrease of $6,700 (6%). These expenses include third-party costs for services as well as the monthly administrative fees charged by our MGP. The decreases for the three months ended March 31, 2013 is primarily due to a decrease in third-party costs as compared to the prior year similar period.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  Cash provided by operating activities decreased $673,400 in the three months ended March 31, 2013 to $862,800 as compared to $1,536,200 for the three months ended March 31, 2012. This decrease was due to a decrease in the change in accounts receivable trade-affiliate decreasing operating cash flows by $307,300 and a decrease in net income before depletion and accretion of $212,500. In addition, the change in accrued liabilities and a net non-cash loss on hedge instruments decreased operating cash flows by $99,600 and $54,600, respectively. The change in asset retirement obligations settled of $600 increased operating cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2013 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2012.  Cash used in investing activities was $7,600 for the three months ended March 31, 2012, representing the net of $3,000 in proceeds from the sale of tangible equipment and $10,600 for the purchase of tangible equipment.  Cash used in financing activities decreased $869,400 during the three months ended March 31, 2013 to $716,100 from $1,585,500 for the three months ended March 31, 2012. This decrease was due to a decrease in cash distributions to partners.  Our MGP may withhold funds for future plugging and abandonment costs. Any additional funds, if required, will be obtained from production revenues or borrowings from our MGP or its affiliates, which are not contractually committed to make loans to us. The amount that we may borrow may not at any time exceed 5% of our total subscriptions, and we will not borrow from third-parties.  The Partnership is generally limited to the amount of funds generated by the cash flows from our operations, which we believe is adequate to fund future operations and distributions to our partners. Historically, there has been no need to borrow funds from our MGP to fund operations.  Subordination by Managing General Partner  Under the terms of the Partnership Agreement, the MGP may be required to subordinate up to 50% of its share of net production revenues so that the limited partners receive a return of at least 10% of their net subscriptions, determined on a cumulative basis, in each of the first five years of Partnership operations, commencing with the first distribution to the limited partners (February 2009) and expiring 60 months from that date. The MGP subordinated $139,600 of its net production revenue to the limited partners for the three months ended March 31, 2013.  Critical Accounting Policies  The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to our asset retirement obligations, depletion and certain accrued receivables and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. A discussion of significant accounting policies we have adopted and followed in the preparation of our financial statements is included within "Notes to Financial Statements" in Part I, Item 1, "Financial Statements" in this quarterly report and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012.

Atlas Resources Public #17-2008 (B) L.P. Investment Losses




(Last Updated On: January 11, 2017)Are you concerned about your losses investing in Atlas Resources Public #17-2008 (B) L.P.? If so, The White Law Group may be able to help you recover your losses.
According to their website, Atlas Resources Partners provides unique oil and gas opportunities that result in consistent and reliable performance for their investors.  The company often raises money for investments through Reg D private placement offerings like the company did for Atlas Resources Public #17-2008 (B) L.P. These Reg D private placements are then typically sold by brokerage firms in exchange for a large up front commission, usually between 7-10%, as well as additional “due diligence fees” that can range from 1-3%.
Atlas Resources Partners LP filed for bankruptcy protection on July 26 and joins dozens of struggling oil and gas producers that were pushed into Chapter 11 after energy prices began dropping in 2014. Since the beginning of 2015, at least 85 North American oil and gas producers have defaulted, according to Haynes & Boone LLP. Those cases involve about $61.2 billion in cumulative debt, the law firm said in a June 30 report.
The trouble with alternative investment products, like Atlas Resources Public #17-2008 (B) L.P., is that they involve a high degree of risk and are typically sold as unregistered securities which lack the same regulatory oversight as more traditional investment products like stocks or bonds.  An additional risk inherent to Atlas Resource Partners’ offerings is also the general risk that comes with the energy market – a market that has seen enormous losses over the last few years due to the declining cost of oil and other energy commodities.
The White Law Group continues to investigate the liability that brokerage firms may have for improperly selling oil and gas private placements like Atlas Resources Public #17-2008 (B) L.P.
Broker dealers that sell alternative investments are required to perform adequate due diligence on all investment recommendations to ensure that each investment is suitable for the investor in light of the investor’s age, risk tolerance, net worth, financial needs, and investment experience.
However, another problem with Reg D private placements is that the high sales commission and due diligence fees the brokers earn for selling such products sometimes can provide brokers with an enormous incentive to push the product to unsuspecting investors who do not fully understand the risks of these types of investments or to outright misrepresentation the basic features of the products – usually focusing on the income potential and tax benefits while downplaying the risks.
Fortunately, FINRA does provide for an arbitration forum for investors to resolve such disputes and if a broker or brokerage firm makes an unsuitable investment recommendation or fails to adequately disclose the risks associated with an investment they may be liable for investment losses in a FINRA arbitration claim.
To determine whether you may be able to recover investment losses incurred as a result of your purchase of Atlas Resources Public #17-2008 (B) L.P. or another Atlas Resource Partners private placement investment, please contact The White Law Group at 1-888-637-5510 for a free consultation.
The White Law Group is a national securities fraud, securities arbitration, and investor protection law firm with offices in Chicago, Illinois and Vero Beach, Florida. The firm represents investors throughout the country in claims against their brokerage firm.

Testimonials



Our experience with Lars Soreide was very satisfying. He is a very sincere and dedicated lawyer. He did an excellent job in representing us in front of the arbitrator.We recovered 100% of the funds that we invested with the stockbroker. We highly recommend him.WILL GILLMAN • CLIENTMr. Soreide represented me and Everything went great. I highly recommend hiring Mr. Soreide. Preparation is key and he was super prepared for the hearing. Thank You.TODD FREDERICK • CLIENTWe are so happy we chose Lars K. Soreide of Soreide Law Group to handle a claim against our stock broker. Our long trusted broker was actually not to be trusted. We had lost over 6 figures because of illegal activity the FBI charged him with. We were devastated since my husband and I were in retirement. I researched for many hours before deciding on Lars Soreide to handle the case against our broker to try and recover some of our losses. He was professional and did an outstanding job. He knew how to reach a settlement when another legal firm representing a large group could not reach a settlement due to the size of that groups claim. We are so happy we did not go with the large group and chose someone that would concentrate on our loss and our settlement. We are very satisfied with the way he handled and settled our case. ANN HODY • CLIENTThe Soreide Law Group was of great help to us. They are true professionals in the field of the SEC law and in our case they won a satisfactory settlement. KRISTINA HALL • CLIENTExtremely Knowledgeable, professional, and prompt. No communication issues whatsoever and, of course, the desired best possible outcome was achieved.BRIAN FERY • CLIENTSoreide Law Group helped my wife and I recover a portion of what we lost with an Atlanta brokerage firm. Soreide stayed in touch every step of the way and concluded our claim in the amount of time they originally stated. Very good experience. KEN MILLS • CLIENTLars Soreide is a fantastic litigator and helped me recover 90% of my losses through my broker. After a sick wife, i took my eyes off my brokerage account – turns out the guy was running trades that were substantially more aggressive than the conservative basis i had established my portfolio under. He helped me arbitrate my case and litigated the matter. What do you know, they wound up firing the broker and paid me almost 100% of my losses. This guy is fantastic and will fight harder than any other lawyer I’m convinced to regain your money. He doesn’t get paid unless you do!!JEFFREY K • CLIENTExcellent Attorney, Trustworthy, Knowledgeable and Responsive.
I have many years experience in the legal field and I found Lars to be among the best attorneys that I have had the pleasure of dealing with. I have never had the need to file an action on behalf of myself or my family before. My mother’s life savings was lost to an investment which involved some unscrupulous dealings. I decided that I needed to do something to help my mother recover some of her savings as this investment devastated her financially. After investigating and speaking with several attorneys I was most impressed with Lars. I have dealt with many attorneys over the years due to my work and I found Lars to be extremely intelligent, compassionate and very knowledgeable in this field of litigation. Lars was on top of every detail of the process. Due to his prowess my mother was able to recover a good portion of her lost investment. I cannot say enough about his straight forward dealings with us as well as his compassion towards my mother and her situation. He truly believed in what he was doing for us and he brought this attitude in to the case. If I ever had to file suit again I would not hesitate to contact Lars again in a second. I cannot recommend him enough. He does not relegate you to his staff but he speaks with you directly every time. I was most impressed with his attitude, responsiveness, knowledge and compassion. I cannot thank him enough for helping our family in our time of need.JOHN C • CLIENTThank God for this Guy! Lars Soreide is amazing. He recovered over a half a million dollars of my funds from my churn and burn broker who actually counter sued me after filing the lawsuit. I didn’t even know it was possible to bring this type of lawsuit through FINRA to recover. Glad I went through with it. Would recommend Lars to anyone.Michael M • CLIENTMr. Soreide is very honest, he never promised an outcome but took the case when everyone said there was no case. I was very pleased with the outcome and how we recovered our losses and he saw it through until the end. Marissa Nugent • CLIENTI hired Lars Soreide to represent me against my stock broker who was running a ponzi scheme. Soreide Law sued the firm for not catching the fraud he was running. The case went to a full trial before 3 arbitrators and they awarded us back every dollar I lost in the Ponzi scheme. My wife and I felt this was totally hopeless because the stock broker was in jail and had no money but we collected every penny back from the firm. We owe a huge THANK YOU to Soreide Law Group.
