                                Report abuseTranscript of Alternative MedicinesBy: Wendy Voong Alternative Medicines The person I interviewed name is Sally. She is a family member of mines and was born in Los Angles. Her ethnicity is Asian and she learned about this alternative medicine/treatment through the internet. Her ailment is having very bad Menstrual Cramps.  Her alternate medicine for preventing or reducing menstrual cramps is drinking Chamomile Tea, Pink Rose Bud Tea, or Green Tea. To prepare the Chamomile Tea and Green Tea, which are in tea bag already, is simple. For the Chamomile Tea, you just have to add hot water and let it steep for about five minutes. For the Green Tea, you would add hot water and let it steep for about a minute. For the Pink Rose Bud Tea, it’s different. You have to add 8 rose buds in a cup, then add hot water and let it steep for three minutes. According to Sally, the results of the Green Tea is that green tea works but it is more effective if you drink more than one cup.On the other hand, the Chamomile Tea is pretty effective and it has the same effects as the green tea. The Pink Rose Bud Tea work for cramps and it also gives good facial complexion, which is a double bonus. :)))))))))))) According to the article, "Instant cure for menstrual cramps", explains how drinking herbal tea, green tea helps against cramps, chamomile will make you feel more relaxed, and you can use peppermint for the bowel spasm which you can sometimes get during a painful period. Work Cited: "Instant Cure for MenstrualCramps." The Times Of India. Time Of India, 7 Apr. 2007. Web. 01 Oct. 2012. <http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-04-07/health/28226815_1_menstrual-cramps-vitamin-supplements-drinking>. The second person that I interviewed was my aunt, Mui. Her ethnicity is Asian and she was born in Vietnam. Her illness is having high blood pressure and the alternative medicine she used was recommended by a friend. What she used to reduce her high blood pressure is Sheep placenta capsule (all natural) The basic instruction for this is to only take two capsules a day with water or tea. Usually, people would use sheep placenta for facial so they can get rids of wrinkles. But where she came from, they say that using sheep placenta capsules is good for the blood pressure because it contains amino acid and it helps boost up the immune system. According to my aunt, she believe that taking these capsule helps. She noticed that her head does not hurt as much when she yells or think a lot. But she also knows that it is not going to eliminate the fact that she has high blood pressure. The "New Zealand Healthfood Placenta Stem Cell" states that it helps decrease the risk of heart disease and cancer. This is supposed to help to prevent and regulate problems associated with aging such as high blood pressure, diabetes, hypertension, cholesterol, gastric, migraine, blood circulation, & arthritis. Work Cited: "Life Cell Beauty Care." Life CellBeauty Care. Blogger, n.d. Web. 01 Oct. 2012. <http://lifecellbeautycare.blogspot.com/>. Sarah Cardenas was born in Bellflower, California. Her ethnicity are Spanish, Peruvian, and Native American. The main problem she been having is migraine. According to her family member, they told her that using Tiger balm will help lower the aches. Tiger balm is just an ointment so all you have to do is basically just rub on a desire amount on the forehead or the temples. Sarah said this treatment only works for only a couple of hours but it is more effective at night. Tiger balm also contain a very strong smell. The article called “Tiger Balm Medicated Ointments, Balms, and Liniment” tells us that it always helps for burns, wounds, sprain, muscle cramps, stuffy nose, stomach ache etc. Not only does tiger balm is good for migraine, but it also heals more than just a headache.
