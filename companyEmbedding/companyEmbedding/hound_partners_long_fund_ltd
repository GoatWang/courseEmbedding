Tiger Seed Auerbach’s Hound Partners Launches New Funds


					January 21, 2014

Jonathan Auerbach


Hound Partners





					The firm has debuted a concentrated fund and its anticipated long-only fund. 
				



Jonathan Auerbach’s Hound Partners has launched
    two new hedge funds in the new year.
The New York–based hedge fund firm has raised about
    $130 million for Hound Partners Concentrated Fund and an
    offshore equivalent. It also raised about $95 million for Hound
    Partners Long Fund and an offshore counterpart. Hound disclosed
    the launches in separate regulatory filings.
Hound is the latest Tiger Management ancestor to create a
    long only fund for investors in the past year alone. Auerbach
    is what is known as a Tiger Seed, because he received start-up
    investment capital from Tiger Management founder Julian
    Robertson, Jr. Auerbach cofounded his firm with Scott McLellan
    in 2004 while working at Tiger Management. (In 2007, McLellan
    left to launch Marble Arch Partners with Tiger alum Timothy
    Jenkins.) Auerbach previously served as a senior analyst at
    Ziff Brothers Investments before joining Tiger Management.
The long-only fund is no surprise to Alpha readers.
    We reported last July that Auerbach was
    considering launching one.
In a letter dated July 18, Auerbach said such a vehicle had
    been "under strong consideration" for a year and a half after
    he was inspired by a "very positive commentary of another Tiger
    Cub who Julian [Robertson] had over for lunch," we reported at
    the time.
Auerbach did not name the Cub. He also said a few investors
    had been asking for a long-only product. "We are actively
    debating the pros and cons of offering such a vehicle and would
    love your feedback," Auerbach urged investors.
Last year Tiger Global Management, founded by Tiger Cub
    Charles (Chase) Coleman, raised about $1.1 billion for its new
    long-only equity fund, called Tiger Global Long Opportunities,
    and its offshore version, according to a regulatory filing. The
    funds were launched on October 1 with a minimum investment of
    $1 million. We had reported earlier in the year that the New
    York-based hedge fund firm was mulling a long-only fund.
    Coleman runs Tiger Global’s hedge funds with
    partner Feroz Dewan, who oversees them on a day-to-day
    basis.
Earlier in the year, Philippe Laffont’s New
    York–based hedge fund firm Coatue Management began
    raising money for the Coatue Long Only Partners fund. Other
    Tiger Cubs who manage successful long-only funds include
    Stephen Mandel Jr. of Lone Pine Capital, O. Andreas Halvorsen
    of Viking Global Investors and Lee Ainslie of Maverick
    Capital.
In 2013 Hound Partners, Auerbauch’s long-short
    fund, finished the year up 16 percent. In a November letter
    obtained by Alpha, the hedge fund, which was up 17.23
    percent through the first 11 months of the year, pointed out
    that its long portfolio had gained 38.75 percent before
    accounting for fees. The short portfolio had lost 14.43 through
    November. At the time, Hound was 96 percent long and 65 percent
    short.

Tiger Seed Auerbach’s Hound Partners Mulls Long-Only Fund	


					July 25, 2013

					 
                    Stephen Taub
				

					The New York-based manager would join other Tiger-affiliated managers including Stephen Mandel Jr., O. Andreas Halvorsen and Lee Ainslie in launching a long-only product to run alongside his firm’s hedge funds.
				



Jonathan Auerbach’s New York–based
    hedge fund firm Hound Partners may become the latest
    Tiger-affiliated manager to launch a long-only fund.
In a letter dated July 18, Auerbach says such a vehicle has
    been "under strong consideration" for a year and a half after
    he was inspired by a "very positive commentary of another Tiger
    Cub who Julian [Robertson] had over for lunch." (Tiger Cubs are
    managers who worked for Robertson’s famed hedge
    fund firm, Tiger Management. Auerbach is what is known as a
    Tiger Seed, having launched with money from Robertson.)
Auerbach did not name the Cub. He also said a few investors
    have been asking for a long-only product. "We are actively
    debating the pros and cons of offering such a vehicle and would
    love your feedback," Auerbach urged investors.
We reported earlier this year that Tiger Cub
    Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management filed plans
    with the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch a
    long-only fund. Other Cubs who manage successful long-only
    funds include Stephen Mandel Jr. of Lone Pine Capital, O.
    Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors and Lee Ainslie of
    Maverick Capital.
Auerbach co-founded his firm with Scott McLellan in 2004. In
    2007, McLellan launched Marble Arch Partners with Tiger alum
    Timothy Jenkins. Auerbach previously served as a senior analyst
    at Ziff Brothers Investments.
In his letter, Auerbach said he will structure his long-only
    fund differently from those offered by the Cubs, whose long
    fund portfolios mostly mimic the long book in their hedge
    funds. His fund would be more concentrated and have a longer
    holding period and would focus on companies that can compound
    for many years. The fund would also "possibly focus on
    tax-efficiency," he said in the letter.
"In a world where tax rates are rising, recent performance
    from alternatives has been mediocre (and not particularly
    tax-efficient), the better long-short funds are capacity
    constrained (largely on the short side), and the traditional
    long-only business has suffered a decade-long brain drain, I
    have felt a clear need for this type of investment vehicle in
    my conversations with investors," Auerbach explained.
He is sensitive to the notion that earlier major launches of
    long-only funds "by the pioneers of long-only funds managed by
    long-short managers" occurred at tops of markets. Auerbach
    insists he is taking a longer view. He also pledged that he and
    his entire senior team will "make a substantial personal
    investment."
The hedge fund manager also told clients he will not raise
    "significant capital" in the long-short fund in 2014, other
    than to replace redemptions, which he said have been at very
    low levels. This is not surprising given that his hedge fund,
    Hound Partners, posted an impressive 14.71 percent net return
    in the first half of this year, while the long portfolio gained
    20.83 percent gross of fees. In 2012 it was up 18.59 percent
    net, while the long portfolio was up 18.55 percent gross.
In his July letter, Auerbach sounded almost giddy, telling
    investors, "After several years of getting off to a strong
    start and temporarily fading into mid-year, we are pleased to
    have held on to our gains and remain enthusiastic about our
    portfolio." He pointed out that he runs a concentrated
    portfolio, with three stocks each accounting for 10 percent of
    assets, which are about $1.8 billion according to sources.
The biggest winner was FleetCor Technologies, which provides
    specialized payment products and services to businesses,
    commercial fleets and energy companies. It surged 50 percent in
    the first half of the year. Auerbach said in the letter he
    continues to hold a sizable position.
He trimmed his position in the warrants of energy company
    Kinder Morgan, mostly due to strong performance, and said he
    expanded his position in Valeant Pharmaceuticals International
    prior to its announcement that it would acquire Bausch &
    Lomb. On the other hand, he acknowledged losing money on Golar
    LNG, a London-based liquefied natural gas shipping company.

Hedge Funds Database
In our Free Hedge Funds Database we have listed more than 4000+ hedge funds and institutional investors. You can see the fund’s summary, employees, AUM, portfolio values, historical 13F, current portfolio, holdings, new positions, sector weights, sentiment, turnover, top 10 holdings and more.
What is a Hedge Fund? A Closer Look at Hedge Funds.
There are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking. The hedge fund is just one of those, but it is also the one that is worth looking at. There’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle, but it is not always a tough nut to crack. What investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to.
How Do Hedge Funds Work?
Hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets. However, it is not open to every individual investor. Rather, the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown. Managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund, and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund.
It is theoretically similar to mutual funds, but they differ in the techniques. That’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors. There are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds, hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio.
Adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments. Hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, but that’s on a case to case basis. If the assets are large enough, the SEC will require reports. Hedge fund managers, however, are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face anti-fraud measures.
A Brief History of Hedge Funds
Hedge funds have a very long history. People and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early 21st century. The funds never lost popularity over time. Before the recession hit, there was a total value of US$1.93 trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide. The industry had a brief hiccup afterwards, because of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, but it eventually recovered. This is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are, and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers.
Hedge fund assets totaled $2 trillion worldwide by April 2011, just three years after the crisis burst. By the third quarter of 2014, the worldwide value of assets under management or AUM is at $2.38 trillion and may continue to grow in the next years.
Hedge Fund Strategies
Hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but, rather, they employ a combination of various strategies. It is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives.
There are, however, some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use. Hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market.
Here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use, either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets:

Global macro

This type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions. Managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments. The Global Macro approach leverages multiple markets, and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements. This approach is very flexible, and very diversified as well because there are many variations of sub-strategy under this umbrella.

Directional

The directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis. Instead, directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments. A typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term, and to couple that position with short-term buying and selling to hedge against risk.

Event-driven

Hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences. For instance, company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price. Event-driven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur. Even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from event-driven hedge fund managers.

Relative value

Relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those. This is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far. Analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic, as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies.
How Do Hedge Fund Managers Approach Risk?
As mentioned above, hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation. That is where risk mitigation comes in. In fact, managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings.
The most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify. The entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments, and varying investment positions. For instance, some of the funds may be put into long-term positions in low-risk, low-return funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time.
A portion of the funds may be invested in high-risk, high-return investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term, taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment.
In addition, hedge fund companies may employ risk officers. These are not people who are directly involved in trading, but have knowledge in how markets work. These risk officers will focus on identifying long and short-term risks to the assets under management, and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets.
Other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence.
Offshore and Onshore Hedge Funds
Because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment, hedge fund managers can be found all over the world. There are two types of hedge fund management companies, and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers. Their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings.
Offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences. For example, US-based investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments, particularly in retirement funds, will turn to offshore hedge funds. This helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds.
On the other hand, if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the United States, they can expect the US government to slap withholding taxes on their investments. However, there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not double-taxed for any increase on the value of their assets. Only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments.
The presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation. In addition, it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of double-taxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally.
Prominent Centers of Investment
The United States remains the center of global hedge fund management. 70% of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the United States. The Securities and Exchange Commission has in its registry nearly 4,000 financial experts, as of April 2012, who handled management of hedge funds. These are found across the US, but most of them are based in New York City and Connecticut’s Gold Coast.
As for European hedge funds, London is the home of the managers with over 800 of them found in the city. In 2011, these firms were responsible for managing 85% of the hedge fund assets from continental Europe.
There is a growing market in Asia, particularly in Japan. Growing economic centers Hong Kong and Singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management, but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the US and London in Europe. In fact, most of the hedge funds from Asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers.

Hedge Funds are not the only alternative way to invest in the investment universe. A different class of investment are Managed Futures.

 
Commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds. Managed Futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements. Because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis alpha, managed funds which do, are a good way to avoid painful market correction.

Hound Partners, Marble Arch Partners Returns, Letters
































































 


















Hound Partners And Marble Arch Partners Resource Page




Jonathan Auerbach and Scott McLellan were the joint founders of long/short equity fund Hound Partners. The fund was founded during 2004, and, as is the case with many Tiger Funds, was started with seed capital from Tiger Management.
Jonathan Auerbach previously worked at Ziff Brothers Investments and then Tiger Management where he was put in charge of a new fund that would ultimately become Hound Partners.
Scott McLellan was brought in by Jonathan Auerbach to help him run Hound Partners shortly after inception. Prior to that, McLellan worked at Highbridge Capital. During 2007, Scott McLellan left to form Marble Arch Partners with Timothy Jenkins. Jenkins is another Tiger alumni.
Jonathan Auerbach: Hound Partners

 
Like almost all of the Tiger Cub funds, and those funds started with seed capital from Julian Robertson, Hound Partners uses a long/short fundamental equity strategy. Hound was provided with seed capital from Julian Robertson. The fund currently manages around $3 billion. Like most Tiger seeds, Hound’s headquarters are located in Tiger Management’s offices on the 47th and 48th floors of 101 Park Avenue in midtown Manhattan.
Hound doesn’t pay much attention to macro implications, using a bottom-up approach to picking stocks. Also, Hound tends to run a highly concentrated portfolio of stocks and management have, in the past, made heavy use of derivatives to express the fund’s investment viewpoint. Hound’s top positions can account for more than 10% of the total portfolio with many positions going unreported because they trade otc or other illiquid markets. Due to its concentrated basket of stocks, Hound is a good fund for tracking purposes as you know they have conviction in their plays.
Hound has always been a fan of what are known as LEAPS options. Long Term Equity AnticiPation Securities, their technical name, are options on stocks and indexes that go out two years or longer.
An example of a Hound trade: For full-year 2011 Hound returned 18.97%, net of fees and expenses. The long side of the portfolio contributed 5.58% while the short side picked up 17.73%. Around one-third of total profits came from a massive short bet on the global solar sector.

Scott McLellan: Marble Arch
Like Hound, Marble Arch runs a highly concentrated, long/short equity focused portfolio. At the end of 2014 the fund had 22 long positions and was looking to reduce the size of the portfolio further in the near future. 20 positions is the target. During the fourth quarter of 2014, the fund’s top ten longs averaged 63% of capital. Marble Arch targets a gross exposure of 150%.
Marble Arch favors stocks that are trading at an attractive valuation have a strong competitive advantage and are driving change through reorganization, cost cutting, and acquisitions. In the fund’s own words, cash is deployed into situations that have: “inefficiency-inducing special situation characteristics and opportunities for self-help or accretive capital deployment”. Marble Arch and Hound have shown a lot of similarity in their stock picking over the years.

 The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost; current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance for one year and under are cumulative, not annualized. Short term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. For additional information, see the fund(s) prospectus.
Each Direxion Fund share price is calculated as of the close of regular trading, usually as of 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time, each day the New York Stock Exchange is open for business. Each fund seeks to meet its investment objective relative to the value of the target index or benchmark as of 4:00 p.m.
Shares of Direxion Shares are bought and sold at market price (not NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund. Brokerage commissions will reduce returns. Market Price returns are based upon the midpoint of the bid/ask spread at 4:00 PM Eastern time (when NAV is normally determined), and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times. Fund returns assume that dividends and capital gains distributions have been reinvested in the Fund at NAV. Some performance results reflect expense subsidies and waivers in effect during certain periods shown. Absent these waivers, results would have been less favorable.
After-Tax and After-Tax, Post Sales Returns
Tax-adjusted returns and tax cost ratio are estimates of the impact taxes have had on a fund. We assume the highest tax rate in calculating these figures. These returns follow the SEC guidelines for calculating returns before sale of shares. Tax-adjusted returns show a fund’s annualized after tax total return for the one, three and five year periods, excluding any capital-gains effects that would result from selling the fund at the end of the period. To determine this figure, all income and short-term capital gains distributions are taxed at the maximum federal rate at the time of distribution. Long-term capital gains are taxed at a 15% rate. The after tax portion is then assumed to be reinvested in the fund. State and local taxes are not included in our calculations. For more information, please consult your tax consultant.
Distribution Dates

Payable and Ex-Date – With regard to mutual funds, this is the day on which declared distributions (dividends or capital gains) are deducted from the fund’s assets before it calculates its net asset value (NAV). The NAV per share will drop by the amount of the distribution per share.
Record Date – Date by which a shareholder must officially own shares in order to be entitled to a dividend.

Types of Distributions

Income Dividend – A portion of a company’s profit paid to common and preferred shareholders.
Long Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for more than one year.
Short Term Capital Gains – Profits distributed to shareholders resulting from the sale of securities held in the fund’s portfolio for less than one year
