How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

As a result of several factors which may include changing interest rates, refundings, and sales or defaults on the underlying securities, there is no guarantee that distributions will either remain at current levels or increase over time. Estimated current return is determined by dividing a Trusts estimated net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price per unit. Estimated long-term return is a measure of the estimated return over the estimated life of a Trust. Unlike estimated current return, estimated long-term return reflects maturities, estimated principal prepayments, Trust charges and expenses, and discounts and premiums of securities in a Trust. Returns and prices will fluctuate. Consult a prospectus for a more complete description of the estimated net income, estimated current return and estimated long-term return calculations.





This product information does not constitute an offer to sell, or a solicitation of an offer to buy securities in any state to any person to whom it is not lawful to make such an offer.  Sales of any of these securities must include prospectus delivery and the services of a retail broker/dealer duly licensed in the appropriate states.

First Trust has no knowledge of and has not been provided any information regarding any investor.  Financial advisors must determine whether particular investments are appropriate for their clients.

NEW YORK TRUST, SERIES 50   
3,133 UNITS   
PROSPECTUS                                                                      
Part One                                                                        
Dated November 25, 1998                                                         

Note: Part One of this Prospectus may not be distributed unless accompanied by  
Part Two and Part Three.                                            

In the opinion of Counsel, interest income to the Trust and to Unit holders,    
with certain exceptions, is exempt under existing law from all Federal income   
taxes.  In addition, the interest income is, in the opinion of Special          
Counsel, exempt to the extent indicated from New York State and local income    
taxes.  Capital gains, if any, are subject to tax.                              

The Trust                                                                       

The First Trust of Insured Municipal Bonds - Multi-State New York Trust,        
Series 50 (the "Trust") is an insured and fixed portfolio of interest-bearing   
obligations issued by or on behalf of municipalities and other governmental     
authorities within the State of New York, counties, municipalities,             
authorities and political subdivisions thereof, the interest on which is, in    
the opinion of recognized bond counsel to the issuing governmental              
authorities, exempt from all Federal income taxes and from New York State and   
local income taxes under existing law.  At October 16, 1998, each Unit          
represented a 1/3,133 undivided interest in the principal and net income of     
the Trust (see "The Fund" in Part Two).                                         

The Units being offered by this Prospectus are issued and outstanding Units     
which have been purchased by the Sponsor in the secondary market or from the    
Trustee after having been tendered for redemption.  The profit or loss          
resulting from the sale of Units will accrue to the Sponsor.  No proceeds from  
the sale of Units will be received by the Trust.                                

Public Offering Price                                                           

The Public Offering Price of the Units is equal to the aggregate value of the   
Bonds in the Portfolio of the Trust divided by the number of Units              
outstanding, plus a sales charge of 5.2% of the Public Offering Price (5.485%   
of the amount invested).  At October 16, 1998, the Public Offering Price per    
Unit was $1,030.09 plus net interest accrued to date of settlement (three       
business days after such date) of $7.19 and $24.05 for the monthly and semi-    
annual distribution plans, respectively (see "Market for Units" in Part Two).   

Please retain all parts of this Prospectus for future reference.  
______________________________________________________________________________  
THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED BY THE SECURITIES AND    
EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR HAS THE COMMISSION PASSED UPON THE ACCURACY OR          
ADEQUACY OF THIS PROSPECTUS.  ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A CRIMINAL  
OFFENSE.

Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return                         

Estimated Current Return to Unit holders under the semi-annual distribution     
plan was 4.90% per annum on October 16, 1998, and 4.84% under the monthly       
distribution plan.  Estimated Long-Term Return to Unit holders under the semi-  
annual distribution plan was 3.84% per annum on October 16, 1998, and 3.78%     
under the monthly distribution plan.  Estimated Current Return is calculated    
by dividing the Estimated Net Annual Interest Income per Unit by the Public     
Offering Price.  Estimated Long-Term Return is calculated using a formula       
which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative   
weightings of the market values, yields (which take into account the            
amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated          
retirements of all of the Bonds in the Trust and (2) takes into account a       
compounding factor and the expenses and sales charge associated with each Unit  
of the Trust.  Since the market values and estimated retirements of the Bonds   
and the expenses of the Trust will change, there is no assurance that the       
present Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return indicated       
above will be realized in the future.  Estimated Current Return and Estimated   
Long-Term Return are expected to differ because the calculation of the          
Estimated Long-Term Return reflects the estimated date and amount of principal  
returned while the Estimated Current Return calculations include only Net       
Annual Interest Income and Public Offering Price.  The above figures are based  
on estimated per Unit cash flows.  Estimated cash flows will vary with changes  
in fees and expenses, with changes in current interest rates, and with the      
principal prepayment, redemption, maturity, call, exchange or sale of the       
underlying Bonds.  See "What are Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-   
Term Return?" in Part Two.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT AUDITORS  

The Unit Holders of The First Trust Combined                                    
Series 194, The First Trust of Insured Municipal                                
Bonds  - Multi-State, New York Trust, Series 50                                 

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,           
including the portfolio, of The First Trust Combined Series 194, The First      
Trust of Insured Municipal Bonds - Multi-State, New York Trust, Series 50 as    
of July 31, 1998, and the related statements of operations and changes in net   
assets for each of the three years in the period then ended.  These financial   
statements are the responsibility of the Trust's Sponsor.  Our responsibility   
is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits.     

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing          
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to       
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of  
material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence  
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  Our        
procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of July 31, 1998, by    
correspondence with the Trustee.  An audit also includes assessing the          
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by the Sponsor, as    
well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation.  We believe    
that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.                     

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in   
all material respects, the financial position of The First Trust Combined       
Series 194, The First Trust of Insured Municipal Bonds - Multi-State, New York  
Trust, Series 50 at July 31, 1998, and the results of its operations and        
changes in its net assets for each of the three years in the period then ended  
in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

THE FIRST TRUST COMBINED SERIES 194   
THE FIRST TRUST OF INSURED MUNICIPAL BONDS - MULTI-STATE  
NEW YORK TRUST, SERIES 50   
NOTES TO PORTFOLIO  
July 31, 1998   

(a)   Shown under this heading are the year in which each issue of Bonds is     
initially redeemable and the redemption price in that year.  Unless 
   otherwise indicated, each issue continues to be redeemable at declining
    prices thereafter (but not below par value).  "S.F." indicates a sinking
fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.  In addition,
    certain bonds are sometimes redeemable in whole or in part other than by
operation of the stated redemption or sinking fund provisions under 
   specified unusual or extraordinary circumstances.  Approximately 95% of
  the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds in the Trust is subject to
call within five years.                                             

(b)   The ratings shown are those effective at July 31, 1998.                   

(c)   Insurance has been obtained by the Bond issuer.                           

(d)   These Bonds have no stated interest rate ("zero coupon bonds") and,       
    accordingly, will have no periodic interest payments to the Trust.  Upon
    maturity, the holders of these Bonds are entitled to receive 100% of the
stated principal amount.  The Bonds were issued at an original issue
discount on June 2, 1993 at a price of 18.963% of their original    
principal amount.                                                   

(e)   These Bonds were issued at an original issue discount on the following    
dates and at the following percentages of their original principal  
amount:                                                             

                                                                [Download Table]

The City of New York (General                                 
   Obligation)                            5/27/93       94.756

   Authority                              8/13/92       90.154

(f)   The Trust consists of eight obligations of issuers located in New York.   
One of the Bonds in the Trust, representing approximately 7% of the 
aggregate principal amount of Bonds in the Trust, is a general      
  obligation of a governmental entity.  The remaining issues are revenue
    bonds payable from the income of a specific project or authority and are
divided by purpose of issue as follows:  Water and Sewer, 1;        
Transportation, 2; Health Care, 2; University and School, 1; and    
   Miscellaneous, 1.  Approximately 33% and 21% of the aggregate principal
  amount of the Bonds consist of transportation revenue bonds and health
  care revenue bonds, respectively.  Each of five Bond issues represents
   10% or more of the aggregate principal amount of the Bonds in the Trust
or a total of approximately 85%.  The largest such issue represents 
approximately 19%.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   

1.  Significant accounting policies                                             

Security valuation -                                                            

Bonds are stated at values as determined by Securities Evaluation Service,      
Inc. (the Evaluator), certain shareholders of which are officers of the         
Sponsor.  The bond values are based on (1) current bid prices for the bonds     
obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to    
those held by the Trust, (2) current bid prices for comparable bonds, (3)       
appraisal or (4) any combination of the above.                                  

Security cost -                                                                 

The Trust's cost of its portfolio is based on the offering prices of the bonds  
on the Date of Deposit, August 13, 1993.  The premium or discount (including    
original issue discount) existing at the Date of Deposit is not being           
amortized.  Realized gain (loss) from bond transactions is reported on an       
identified cost basis.  Sales and redemptions of bonds are recorded on the      
trade date.                                                                     

Federal income taxes -                                                          

The Trust is not taxable for Federal income tax purposes.  Each unit holder is  
considered to be the owner of a pro rata portion of the Trust and,              
accordingly, no provision has been made for Federal income taxes.               

Expenses of the Trust -                                                         

The Trust pays a fee for Trustee services which is based on $1.05 and $.55 per  
$1,000 principal amount of Bonds for those portions of the Trust under the      
monthly and semi-annual distribution plans, respectively.  Prior to September
1, 1995, the Trustee was United States Trust Company of New York; effective     
September 1, 1995, The Chase Manhattan Bank succeeded United States Trust       
Company of New York as Trustee.  Additionally, a fee of $1,026 annually is      
payable to the Evaluator and the Trust pays all related expenses of the         
Trustee, recurring financial reporting costs and an annual supervisory fee      
payable to an affiliate of the Sponsor.

3.  Insurance                                                                   

The issuers of all of the bond issues in the Trust have acquired insurance      
coverage which provides for the payment, when due, of all principal and         
interest on those bonds (see Note (c) to Portfolio).  Such insurance coverage   
continues in force so long as the bonds are outstanding and the insurer         
remains in business.                                                            

4.  Other information                                                           

Cost to investors -                                                             

The cost to initial investors of units of the Trust was based on the aggregate  
offering price of the bonds on the date of an investor's purchase, plus a       
sales charge of 4.9% of the public offering price which is equivalent to        
approximately 5.152% of the net amount invested.                                

Distributions to unit holders -                                                 

Distributions of net interest income to unit holders are made monthly or semi-  
annually.  Such income distributions per unit, on an accrual basis, were as     
follows:

Part Two                                   ONLY BE USED WITH PART ONE           
Dated May 29, 1998                                     AND PART THREE           

IN THE OPINION OF COUNSEL, INTEREST INCOME TO THE TRUSTS AND TO THE UNIT        
HOLDERS, WITH CERTAIN EXCEPTIONS, IS EXEMPT UNDER EXISTING LAW FROM ALL         
FEDERAL INCOME TAXES. IN ADDITION, THE INTEREST INCOME TO THE TRUSTS IS,        
IN THE OPINION OF SPECIAL COUNSEL, EXEMPT TO THE EXTENT INDICATED FROM          
STATE AND LOCAL TAXES WHEN HELD BY RESIDENTS OF THE STATE IN WHICH THE          
ISSUERS OF THE BONDS IN SUCH TRUSTS ARE LOCATED. CAPITAL GAINS, IF ANY,         
ARE SUBJECT TO TAX.                                                             

THE FIRST TRUST COMBINED SERIES (the "Fund") consists of underlying             
separate unit investment trusts (the "Trusts"). The various trusts are          
collectively referred to herein as the "Trusts" while all Trusts that           
are not designated as "The First Trust Advantage" are sometimes                 
collectively referred to herein as the "Insured Trusts" and a Trust with        
the name designation of "The First Trust of Insured Municipal Bonds,            
Discount Trust" or "The First Trust Advantage: Discount Trust" is               
sometimes referred to herein as a "Discount Trust." Each Trust consists         
of a portfolio of interest-bearing obligations, issued by or on behalf          
of states and territories of the United States, and political                   
subdivisions and authorities thereof, the interest on which is, in the          
opinion of recognized bond counsel to the issuing governmental                  
authorities, exempt from all Federal income taxes under existing law            
although interest on certain Bonds in certain Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas,          
Maine, Mississippi and Nebraska Trusts will be a preference item for            
purposes of the Alternative Minimum Tax. In addition, the interest              
income of each Trust is, in the opinion of Special Counsel, exempt to           
the extent indicated from state and local income taxes when held by             
residents of the state in which the issuers of the Bonds in such Trust          
are located. The securities in a Discount Trust are acquired at prices          
which result in a Discount Trust portfolio, as a whole, being purchased         
at a deep discount from the aggregate par value of such Securities              
although a substantial portion of the Securities in a Discount Trust            
portfolio may be acquired at a premium over the par value of such               
Securities. All of the Bonds in an Intermediate Trust mature within 8 to        
12 years of the Initial Date of Deposit. All of the Bonds in a Short            
Intermediate Trust mature within 3 to 6 years of the Initial Date of            
Deposit. All of the Bonds in a Long Intermediate Trust mature within 10         
to 15 years of the Initial Date of Deposit. The portfolio for each              
Trust, essential information based thereon and financial statements,            
including a report of independent auditors relating to the series of the        
Fund offered hereby, are contained in Part One to which reference should        
be made for such information.                                                   

INSURANCE GUARANTEEING THE SCHEDULED PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST         
ON ALL BONDS IN THE PORTFOLIO OF EACH INSURED TRUST HAS BEEN OBTAINED           
FROM FINANCIAL GUARANTY INSURANCE COMPANY AND/OR AMBAC INDEMNITY                
CORPORATION BY THE INSURED TRUSTS OR WAS DIRECTLY OBTAINED BY THE BOND          
ISSUER, THE UNDERWRITERS, THE SPONSOR OR OTHERS PRIOR TO THE INITIAL            
DATE OF DEPOSIT FROM FINANCIAL GUARANTY INSURANCE COMPANY, AMBAC                
INDEMNITY CORPORATION, OR OTHER INSURERS (THE "PREINSURED BONDS").              
INSURANCE OBTAINED BY AN INSURED TRUST APPLIES ONLY WHILE BONDS ARE             
RETAINED IN SUCH TRUST, WHILE INSURANCE ON PREINSURED BONDS IS EFFECTIVE        
SO LONG AS SUCH BONDS ARE OUTSTANDING. PURSUANT TO AN IRREVOCABLE               
COMMITMENT OF FINANCIAL GUARANTY INSURANCE COMPANY, AND/OR AMBAC                
INDEMNITY CORPORATION IN THE EVENT OF A SALE OF A BOND INSURED UNDER AN         
INSURANCE POLICY OBTAINED BY AN INSURED TRUST, THE TRUSTEE HAS THE RIGHT        
TO OBTAIN PERMANENT INSURANCE FOR SUCH BOND UPON THE PAYMENT OF A SINGLE        
PREDETERMINED INSURANCE PREMIUM FROM THE PROCEEDS OF THE SALE OF SUCH           
BOND. THE INSURANCE, IN EITHER CASE, RELATES ONLY TO THE BONDS IN THE           
INSURED TRUSTS AND NOT TO THE UNITS OFFERED HEREBY. AS A RESULT OF SUCH         
INSURANCE, THE UNITS OF EACH INSURED TRUST HAVE RECEIVED A RATING OF            
"AAA" BY STANDARD & POOR'S RATINGS GROUP, A DIVISION OF MCGRAW-HILL,            
INC. ("STANDARD & POOR'S"). SEE "WHY AND HOW ARE THE INSURED TRUSTS 
INSURED?" ON PAGE 10. NO REPRESENTATION IS MADE AS TO ANY INSURER'S             
ABILITY TO MEET ITS COMMITMENTS.                                                
ALL PARTS OF THE PROSPECTUS SHOULD BE RETAINED FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.            
THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED BY THE SECURITIES        
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR HAS THE COMMISSION PASSED UPON THE ACCURACY         
OR ADEQUACY OF THIS PROSPECTUS. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A         
CRIMINAL OFFENSE.                                                               

Page 1                                                                          

For convenience the Prospectus is divided into sections which give              
general information about the Fund and specific information such as the         
public offering price, distributions and tax status for each Trust.             

The Objectives of the Fund are conservation of capital through                  
investment in portfolios of tax-exempt bonds and income exempt from             
Federal and applicable state and local income taxes although interest on        
certain Bonds in certain Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi and        
Nebraska Trusts will be a preference item for purposes of the Federal           
Alternative Minimum Tax. ACCORDINGLY, CERTAIN ARKANSAS, IDAHO, KANSAS,          
MAINE, MISSISSIPPI AND NEBRASKA TRUSTS MAY BE APPROPRIATE ONLY FOR              
INVESTORS WHO ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX. CERTAIN           
BONDS IN THE OKLAHOMA TRUSTS ARE SUBJECT TO OKLAHOMA STATE INCOME TAXES.        
The payment of interest and the preservation of principal are, of               
course, dependent upon the continuing ability of the issuers, obligors          
and/or insurers to meet their respective obligations.                           

Distributions to Unit holders may be reinvested as described herein. See        
"Rights of Unit Holders-How Can Distributions to Unit Holders be                
Reinvested?"                                                                    

The Sponsor, although not obligated to do so, intends to maintain a             
market for the Units at prices based upon the aggregate bid price of the        
Bonds in the portfolio of each Trust. In the absence of such a market, a        
Unit holder will nonetheless be able to dispose of the Units through            
redemption at prices based upon the bid prices of the underlying Bonds.         
See "Rights of Unit Holders-How May Units be Redeemed?" With respect to         
each Insured Trust, neither the bid nor offering prices of the                  
underlying Bonds or of the Units, absent situations in which Bonds are          
in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of        
such default, include value attributable to the portfolio insurance             
obtained by such Trust. See "Why and How are the Insured Trusts Insured?"       

Page 2                                                                          

THE FIRST TRUST COMBINED SERIES       

What is The First Trust Combined Series?                                        

The First Trust Combined Series (the "Fund") is one of a series of              
investment companies created by the Sponsor under the name of The First         
Trust Combined Series, all of which are generally similar but each of           
which is separate and is designated by a different series number. This          
Series consists of underlying separate unit investment trusts (such             
Trusts being collectively referred to herein as the "Fund"). Each Series        
was created under the laws of the State of New York pursuant to a Trust         
Agreement (the "Indenture"), dated the Initial Date of Deposit, with            
Nike Securities L.P., as Sponsor, The Chase Manhattan Bank, as Trustee,         
Securities Evaluation Service, Inc., as Evaluator and First Trust               
Advisors L.P., as Portfolio Supervisor. Only Units of a National Trust          
may be offered for sale to residents of the State of Illinois. Only             
Units of an Indiana Trust and/or a National Trust may be offered for            
sale to residents of the State of Indiana. Only Units of a Virginia             
Trust and/or a National Trust may be offered for sale to residents of           
the State of Virginia. Only Units of a Washington Trust and/or a                
National Trust may be offered for sale to residents of Washington. On           
the Initial Date of Deposit, the Sponsor deposited with the Trustee             
interest-bearing obligations, including delivery statements relating to         
contracts for the purchase of certain such obligations and irrevocable          
letters of credit issued by a financial institution in the amounts              
required for such purchases (the "Bonds"). The Trustee thereafter               
credited the account of the Sponsor for Units of each Trust representing        
the entire ownership of the Fund which Units are being offered hereby.          

The objectives of the Fund are Federal tax-exempt income and state and          
local tax-exempt income and conservation of capital through investment          
in portfolios of interest-bearing obligations issued by or on behalf of         
the state for which such Trust is named (collectively, the "State               
Trusts"), and counties, municipalities, authorities and political               
subdivisions thereof, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and other                 
territories or municipalities of the United States, or authorities or           
political subdivisions thereof, the interest on which obligations is, in        
the opinion of recognized bond counsel to the issuing governmental              
authorities, exempt from all Federal income tax and, where applicable,          
state and local taxes under existing law although interest on certain           
Bonds in certain Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi and                
Nebraska Trusts will be a preference item for purposes of the                   
Alternative Minimum Tax and certain Bonds in the Oklahoma Trusts are            
subject to Oklahoma State Income Taxes. The current market value of             
certain of the obligations in a Discount Trust were significantly below         
face value when the obligations were acquired by such Trust. The prices         
at which the obligations are acquired result in a Discount Trust's              
portfolio, as a whole, being purchased at a deep discount from the              
aggregate par value of such Securities although a substantial portion of        
the Securities in a Discount Trust portfolio may be acquired at a               
premium over the par value of such Securities. Insurance guaranteeing           
the scheduled payment of all principal and interest on Bonds in the             
Trusts with the name designation of "The First Trust of Insured                 
Municipal Bonds," "The First Trust of Insured Municipal Bonds-                  
Intermediate" or "The First Trust of Insured Municipal Bonds-Multi-             
State" (the "Insured Trusts") has been obtained by such Trusts from             
Financial Guaranty Insurance Company ("Financial Guaranty") and/or AMBAC        
Indemnity Corporation ("AMBAC Indemnity") or was obtained directly by           
the Bond issuer, the underwriters, the Sponsor or others prior to the           
Initial Date of Deposit from Financial Guaranty, AMBAC Indemnity, or            
other insurers (the "Preinsured Bonds"). NO PORTFOLIO INSURANCE POLICY          
HAS BEEN OBTAINED BY THE TRUSTS WITH THE NAME DESIGNATION OF "THE FIRST         
TRUST ADVANTAGE" (THE "ADVANTAGE TRUSTS").  The portfolio insurance             
obtained by the Insured Trusts is effective only while the Bonds thus           
insured are held in such Trusts, while insurance on Preinsured Bonds is         
effective so long as such Bonds are outstanding. See "Why and How are
the Insured Trusts Insured?" THERE IS, OF COURSE, NO GUARANTEE THAT THE         
FUND'S OBJECTIVES WILL BE ACHIEVED. AN INVESTMENT IN THE FUND SHOULD BE         
MADE WITH AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE RISKS WHICH AN INVESTMENT IN FIXED            
RATE LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS MAY ENTAIL, INCLUDING THE RISK THAT THE         
VALUE OF THE UNITS WILL DECLINE WITH INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES.               

Neither the Public Offering Price of the Units of an Insured Trust nor          
any evaluation of such Units for purposes of repurchases or redemptions         
reflects any element of value for the insurance obtained by such Trust          
unless Bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or in           
significant risk of such default. See "Public Offering-How is the Public
Offering Price Determined?" On the other hand, the value of insurance           

Page 3                                                                          

obtained by the Bond issuer, the Sponsor or others is reflected and             
included in the market value of such Bonds.                                     

Insurance obtained by an Insured Trust or by the Bond issuer, the               
Sponsor or others is not a substitute for the basic credit of an issuer,        
but supplements the existing credit and provides additional security            
therefor. If an issue is accepted for insurance, a noncancelable policy         
for the scheduled payment of interest and principal on the Bonds is             
issued by the insurer. A single premium is paid by the Bond issuer, the         
underwriters, the Sponsor or others for Preinsured Bonds and a monthly          
premium is paid by each Insured Trust for the insurance obtained by such        
Trust except for Bonds in such Trust which are insured by the Bond              
issuer, the underwriters, the Sponsor or others in which case no                
premiums for insurance are paid by such Trust. Upon the sale of a Bond          
insured under the insurance policy obtained by an Insured Trust, the            
Trustee has the right to obtain permanent insurance from Financial              
Guaranty and/or AMBAC Indemnity with respect to such Bond upon the              
payment of a single predetermined insurance premium from the proceeds of        
the sale of such Bond. Accordingly, any Bond in an Insured Trust of the         
Fund is eligible to be sold on an insured basis. Standard & Poor's and          
Moody's Investors Service, Inc. have rated the claims-paying ability of         
Financial Guaranty and AMBAC Indemnity "AAA" and "Aaa," respectively.           
See "Why and How are the Insured Trusts Insured?"                               

In selecting Bonds, the following facts, among others, were considered:         
(i) the Standard & Poor's rating or Fitch Investors Service, Inc.'s             
rating of the Bonds was in no case less than "BBB" in the case of an            
Insured Trust (or an Arkansas, Kansas or Maine Advantage Trust) and "A-"        
in the case of other Advantage Trusts, or the Moody's Investors Service,        
Inc. rating of the Bonds was in no case less than "Baa" in the case of          
an Insured Trust (or an Arkansas, Kansas or Maine Advantage Trust) and          
"A" in the case of other Advantage Trusts, including provisional or             
conditional ratings, respectively, or, if not rated, the Bonds had, in          
the opinion of the Sponsor, credit characteristics sufficiently similar         
to the credit characteristics of interest-bearing tax-exempt obligations        
that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by the Fund (see         
"Description of Bond Ratings"); (ii) the prices of the Bonds relative to        
other bonds of comparable quality and maturity; (iii) with respect to           
the Insured Trusts, the availability and cost of insurance of the               
principal and interest on the Bonds and (iv) the diversification of             
Bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer. Subsequent to the          
Initial Date of Deposit, a Bond may cease to be rated or its rating may         
be reduced below the minimum required as of the Initial Date of Deposit.        
Neither event requires elimination of such Bond from the portfolio, but         
may be considered in the Sponsor's determination as to whether or not to        
direct the Trustee to dispose of the Bond. See "Rights of Unit Holders-         
How May Bonds be Removed from the Fund?" The Portfolio appearing in Part        
One contains Bond ratings, when available, for the Bonds listed at the          
date shown.                                                                     

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may have been acquired at a market           
discount from par value at maturity. The coupon interest rates on the           
discount bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in the             
Trust were lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued        
bonds of comparable rating and type. The market discount of previously          
issued bonds will increase when interest rates for newly issued                 
comparable bonds increase and decrease when such interest rates fall,           
other things being equal. A discount bond held to maturity will have a          
larger portion of its total return in the form of taxable income and            
capital gain and less in the form of tax-exempt interest income than a          
comparable bond newly issued at current market rates. See "What is the
Federal Tax Status of Unit Holders?" appearing in Part Three for each           
Trust.                                                                          

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be original issue discount bonds.        
Under current law, the original issue discount, which is the difference         
between the stated redemption price at maturity and the issue price of          
the Bonds, is deemed to accrue on a daily basis and the accrued portion         
is treated as tax-exempt interest income for Federal income tax                 
purposes. On sale or redemption, any gain realized that is in excess of         
the earned portion of original issue discount will be taxable as capital        
gain unless the gain is attributable to market discount in which case           
the accretion of market discount is taxable as ordinary income. See             
"What is the Federal Tax Status of Unit Holders?" appearing in Part             
Three for each Trust. The current value of an original discount bond            
reflects the present value of its stated redemption price at maturity.          
The market value tends to increase in greater increments as the Bonds           
approach maturity.                                                              

Certain of the original issue discount bonds may be Zero Coupon Bonds           
(including bonds known as multiplier bonds, money multiplier bonds,             

Page 4                                                                          

capital appreciation bonds, capital accumulator bonds, compound interest        
bonds and money discount maturity payment bonds). Zero Coupon Bonds do          
not provide for the payment of any current interest and generally               
provide for payment at maturity at face value unless sooner sold or             
redeemed. Zero Coupon bond features include (1) not paying interest on a        
semi-annual basis and (2) providing for the reinvestment of the bond's          
semi-annual earnings at the bond's stated yield to maturity. While Zero         
Coupon Bonds are frequently marketed on the basis that their fixed rate         
of return minimizes reinvestment risk, this benefit can be negated in           
large part by weak call protection.                                             

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may have been acquired at a market           
premium from par value at maturity. The coupon interest rates on the            
premium bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in the              
Trusts were higher than the current market interest rates for newly             
issued bonds of comparable rating and type. The current returns of bonds        
trading at a market premium are initially higher than the current               
returns of comparable bonds of a similar type issued at currently               
prevailing interest rates because premium bonds tend to decrease in             
market value as they approach maturity when the face amount becomes             
payable. Because part of the purchase price is thus returned not at             
maturity but through current income payments, early redemption of a             
premium bond at par or early prepayments of principal will result in a          
reduction in yield. Redemptions are more likely to occur at times when          
the Bonds have an offering side valuation which represents a premium            
over par, or for original issue discount Bonds, a premium over the              
accreted value. To the extent that the Bonds were deposited in the Fund         
at a price higher than the price at which they are redeemed, this will          
represent a loss of capital when compared to the original Public                
Offering Price of the Units. Because premium bonds generally pay a              
higher rate of interest than bonds priced at or below par, the effect of        
the redemption of premium bonds would be to reduce Estimated Net Annual         
Unit Income by a greater percentage than the par amount of such bonds           
bears to the total par amount of Bonds in the Trust. Although the actual        
impact of any such redemptions that may occur will depend upon the              
specific Bonds that are redeemed, it can be anticipated that the                
Estimated Net Annual Unit Income will be significantly reduced after the        
dates on which such Bonds are eligible for redemption. The Trust may be         
required to sell Zero Coupon Bonds prior to maturity (at their current          
market price which is likely to be less than their par value) in order          
to pay expenses of the Trust or in case the Trust is terminated. See            
"Rights of Unit Holders-How May Bonds be Removed from the Fund?" and            
"Other Information-How May the Indenture be Amended or Terminated?"             

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be general obligations of a              
governmental entity that are backed by the taxing power of such entity.         
All other Bonds in the Trusts are revenue bonds payable from the income         
of a specific project or authority and are not supported by the issuer's        
power to levy taxes. General obligation bonds are secured by the                
issuer's pledge of its faith, credit and taxing power for the payment of        
principal and interest. Revenue bonds, on the other hand, are payable           
only from the revenues derived from a particular facility or class of           
facilities or, in some cases, from the proceeds of a special excise tax         
or other specific revenue source. There are, of course, variations in           
the security of the different Bonds in the Fund, both within a                  
particular classification and between classifications, depending on             
numerous factors.                                                               

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be healthcare revenue bonds.             
Healthcare revenue bonds are obligations of issuers whose revenues are          
primarily derived from services provided by hospitals or other                  
healthcare facilities, including nursing homes. A healthcare issuer's           
ability to make debt service payments on these obligations is dependent         
on various factors, including occupancy levels of the facility, demand,         
government regulations, wages of employees, overhead expenses,                  
competition from other similar providers, malpractice insurance costs           
and the degree of governmental competition from other similar providers,        
malpractice insurance costs and the degree of governmental financial            
assistance, including Medicare and Medicaid and other similar third-            
party payer programs.                                                           

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be housing revenue bonds. Housing        
revenue bonds are obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily           
derived from mortgage loans on single family residences or housing              
projects for low to moderate income families. Housing revenue bonds are         
generally payable at any time and therefore their average life will             
ordinarily be less than their stated maturities. The ability of such            
issuers to make debt service payments on these obligations is dependent         
on various factors, including occupancy levels, rental income, mortgage         
default rates, taxes, operating expenses, governmental regulations and          
the appropriation of subsidies.                                                 

Page 5                                                                          

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be obligations of issuers whose          
revenues are derived from the sale of water and/or sewerage services.           
Water and sewerage bonds are generally payable from user fees. Problems         
faced by such issuers include the ability to obtain timely and adequate         
rate increases, population decline resulting in decreased user fees, the        
difficulty of financing large construction programs, the limitations on         
operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental         
considerations, the increasing difficulty of obtaining or discovering           
new supplies of fresh water, the effect of conservation programs and the        
impact of "no-growth" zoning ordinances.                                        

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be obligations of issuers whose          
revenues are primarily derived from the sale of electric energy.                
Utilities are generally subject to extensive regulation by state utility        
commissions which, among other things, establish the rates which may be         
charged and the appropriate rate of return. The problems faced by such          
issuers include the difficulty in obtaining approval for timely and             
adequate rate increases from the governing public utility commission,           
the difficulty in financing large construction programs, increased              
federal, state and municipal government regulations, the limitations on         
operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental         
considerations, increased competition, recent reductions in estimates of        
future demand for electricity in certain areas of the country, the              
difficulty of the capital market in absorbing utility debt, the                 
difficulty in obtaining fuel at reasonable prices and the effect of             
energy conservation.                                                            

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be lease obligations issued              
primarily by governmental authorities that have no taxing power or other        
means of directly raising revenues. Rather, the governmental authorities        
are financing vehicles created solely for the construction of buildings         
(i.e., schools, administrative offices, convention centers and prisons)         
or the purchase of equipment (i.e., police cars and computer systems)           
that will be used by a state or local government (the "lessee"). These          
obligations are subject to the ability and willingness of the lessee            
government to meet its lease rental payments which include debt service         
on the obligations. Lease obligations are subject, in almost all cases,         
to annual appropriation risk, i.e., the lessee government is not legally        
obligated to budget and appropriate for the rental payments beyond the          
current fiscal year, or construction and abatement risk-rental                  
obligations cease in the event that delays in building, damage,                 
destruction or condemnation of the project prevents its use by the              
lessee.                                                                         

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be industrial revenue bonds              
("IRBs"), tax-exempt securities issued by states, municipalities, public        
authorities or similar entities to finance the cost of acquiring,               
constructing or improving various industrial projects. Debt service             
payments on IRBs are dependent on various factors, including the                
creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project and, if               
applicable, corporate guarantor, revenues generated from the project            
and, if applicable, corporate guarantor, revenues generated from the            
project and regulatory and environmental restrictions.                          

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be obligations which are payable         
from and secured by revenues derived from the ownership and operation of        
facilities such as airports, bridges, turnpikes, port authorities,              
convention centers and arenas. The ability of issuers to make debt              
service payments on airport obligations is dependent on the capability          
of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements. Due to              
increased competition, deregulation, increased fuel costs and other             
factors, many airlines may have difficulty meeting their obligations            
under these use agreements. Similarly, payment on Bonds related to other        
facilities is dependent on revenues from the projects, such as user fees        
from ports, tolls on turnpikes and bridges and rents from buildings.            
Therefore, payment may be adversely affected by reduction in revenues           
due to such factors as increased cost of maintenance, decreased use of a        
facility, lower cost of alternative modes of transportation, scarcity of        
fuel and reduction or loss of rents.                                            

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be obligations of issuers which          
govern the operation of schools, colleges and universities and whose            
revenues are derived mainly from ad valorem taxes. General problems             
relating to college and university obligations would include the                
prospect of a declining percentage of the population consisting of              
"college" age individuals, possible inability to raise tuitions and fees        
sufficiently to cover increased operating costs, the uncertainty of             
continued receipt of Federal grants and state funding and new government        
legislation or regulations which may adversely affect the revenues or           
costs of such issuers.                                                          

Certain of the Bonds in the Trusts may be obligations which are payable         
from and secured by revenues derived from the operation of resource             
recovery facilities. Resource recovery facilities are designed to               

Page 6                                                                          

process solid waste, generate steam and convert steam to electricity.           
Resource recovery bonds may be subject to extraordinary optional                
redemption at par upon the occurrence of certain circumstances,                 
including but not limited to: destruction or condemnation of a project;         
contracts relating to a project becoming void, unenforceable or                 
impossible to perform; changes in the economic availability of raw              
materials, operating supplies or facilities necessary for the operation         
of a project or technological or other unavoidable changes adversely            
affecting the operation of a project; administrative or judicial actions        
which render contracts relating to the projects void, unenforceable or          
impossible to perform; or impose unreasonable burdens or excessive              
liabilities.                                                                    

Certain Trusts may contain Bonds of issuers located in the Commonwealth         
of Puerto Rico or issuers which will be affected by general economic            
conditions of Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico's unemployment rate remains              
significantly higher than the U.S. unemployment rate. Furthermore, the          
economy is largely dependent for its development upon U.S. policies and         
programs that are being reviewed and may be eliminated.                         

The economy of Puerto Rico is closely integrated with that of the               
mainland United States. During fiscal 1996 approximately 88% of Puerto          
Rico's exports were to the U.S. mainland, which was also the source of          
approximately 62% of Puerto Rico's imports. The economy of Puerto Rico          
is dominated by the manufacturing and service sectors. The manufacturing        
sector has experienced fundamental changes over the years as a result of        
increased emphasis on higher wage, high technology industries such as           
pharmaceuticals, electronics, computers, microprocessors, professional          
and scientific instruments, and certain high technology machinery and           
equipment. The service sector, including finance, insurance and real            
estate, also plays a major role in the economy. It ranks second only to         
manufacturing in contribution to the gross domestic product and leads           
all sectors in providing employment. In recent years, the service sector        
has experienced significant growth in response to the expansion of the          
manufacturing sector.                                                           

The Puerto Rican economy is affected by a number of Commonwealth and            
federal investment incentive programs. Aid for Puerto Rico's economy has        
traditionally depended heavily on federal programs, and current federal         
budgetary policies suggest that an expansion of aid to Puerto Rico is           
unlikely. An adverse effect on the Puerto Rican economy could result            
from other U.S. policies, including further reduction in transfer               
payment programs such as food stamps, curtailment of military spending          
and policies which could lead to a stronger dollar. One of the factors          
assisting the development of the Puerto Rican economy has been the tax          
incentives offered by the federal and Puerto Rico governments.                  

Puerto Rico's future will be determined by the leadership and                   
initiatives of both the private and public sector to compensate for the         
loss of the federal tax credit under Section 936 of the U.S. tax code.          
This important credit which enabled companies to repatriate profits at a        
40-60% reduction in federal taxes was terminated as of July 1996.               
Existing U.S. companies operating in Puerto Rico were given a ten year          
grace period, but new U.S. manufacturing companies coming to Puerto Rico        
will have to pay U.S. deferral taxes when repatriating their profits to         
the mainland.                                                                   

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of           
the financial difficulties which may impact certain issuers of Bonds and        
does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of all              
adverse conditions to which the issuers of the Bonds are subject.               
Additionally, many factors including national economic, social and              
environmental policies and conditions, which are not within the control         
of the issuers of Bonds, could affect or could have an adverse impact on        
the financial condition of Puerto Rico and various agencies and                 
political subdivisions located in Puerto Rico. The Sponsor is unable to         
predict whether or to what extent such factors or other factors may             
affect the issuers of Bonds, the market value or marketability of the           
Bonds or the ability of the respective issuers of the Bonds acquired by         
the Trusts to pay interest on or principal of the Bonds.                        

Interest on certain of the Bonds in certain Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas,            
Maine, Mississippi and Nebraska Trusts will be an item of tax preference        
for purposes of the Alternative Minimum Tax ("AMT"). The investment by          
non-AMT individual taxpayers in AMT municipal bonds generally results in        
a higher yield to such bondholders than non-AMT municipal bonds. Since a        
portion of the interest from certain Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Maine,            
Mississippi and Nebraska Trusts is an AMT preference item, certain              
Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Mississippi and Nebraska Trusts may be          
more appropriate for investors who are not subject to AMT.                      

Investors should be aware that many of the Bonds in the Trusts are              
subject to continuing requirements such as the actual use of Bond               

Page 7                                                                          

proceeds or manner of operation of the project financed from Bond               
proceeds that may affect the exemption of interest on such Bonds from           
Federal income taxation. Although at the time of issuance of each of the        
Bonds in the Trusts an opinion of bond counsel was rendered as to the           
exemption of interest on such obligations from Federal income taxation,         
there can be no assurance that the respective issuers or other obligors         
on such obligations will fulfill the various continuing requirements            
established upon issuance of the Bonds. A failure to comply with such           
requirements may cause a determination that interest on such obligations        
is subject to Federal income taxation, perhaps even retroactively from          
the date of issuance of such Bonds, thereby reducing the value of the           
Bonds and subjecting Unit holders to unanticipated tax liabilities.             

Because certain of the Bonds may from time to time under certain                
circumstances be sold or redeemed or will mature in accordance with             
their terms and because the proceeds from such events will be                   
distributed to Unit holders and will not be reinvested, no assurance can        
be given that a Trust will retain for any length of time its present            
size and composition. Neither the Sponsor nor the Trustee shall be              
liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in any Bond.               
Certain of the Bonds contained in the Trusts may be subject to being            
called or redeemed in whole or in part prior to their stated maturities         
pursuant to optional redemption provisions, sinking fund provisions,            
special or extraordinary redemption provisions or otherwise. A bond             
subject to optional call is one which is subject to redemption or               
refunding prior to maturity at the option of the issuer. A bond subject         
to sinking fund redemption is one which is subject to partial call from         
time to time at par or, in the case of a zero coupon bond, at the               
accreted value from a fund accumulated for the scheduled retirement of a        
portion of an issue prior to maturity. Special or extraordinary                 
redemption provisions may provide for redemption at par (or for original        
issue discount bonds at issue price plus the amount of original issue           
discount accreted to redemption date plus, if applicable, some premium)         
of all or a portion of an issue upon the occurrence of certain                  
circumstances. The exercise of redemption or call provisions will               
(except to the extent the proceeds of the called Bonds are used to pay          
for Unit redemptions) result in the distribution of principal and may           
result in a reduction in the amount of subsequent interest                      
distributions; it may also affect the long-term return and the current          
return on Units of each Trust. Redemption pursuant to call provisions is        
more likely to occur, and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions        
may occur, when the Bonds have an offering side valuation which                 
represents a premium over par or for original issue discount bonds a            
premium over the accreted value. Unit holders may recognize capital gain        
or loss upon any redemption or call.                                            

Like other investment companies, financial and business organizations           
and individuals around the world, the Fund could be adversely affected          
if the computer systems used by the Sponsor, Evaluator, Portfolio               
Supervisor or Trustee or other service providers to the Fund do not             
properly process and calculate date-related information and data                
involving dates of January 1, 2000 and thereafter. This is commonly             
known as the "Year 2000 Problem." The Sponsor, Evaluator, Portfolio             
Supervisor and Trustee are taking steps that they believe are reasonably        
designed to address the Year 2000 Problem with respect to computer              
systems that they use and to obtain reasonable assurances that                  
comparable steps are being taken by the Fund's other service providers.         
At this time, however, there can be no assurance that these steps will          
be sufficient to avoid any adverse impact to the Fund. The Sponsor is           
unable to predict what impact, if any, the Year 2000 Problem will have          
on issuers of the Bonds contained in the Fund.                                  

To the best knowledge of the Sponsor, there is no litigation pending as         
of the date hereof in respect of any Bonds which might reasonably be            
expected to have a material adverse effect upon the Trusts. At any time         
after the date hereof, litigation may be initiated on a variety of              
grounds with respect to Bonds in a Trust. Such litigation, as for               
example suits challenging the issuance of pollution control revenue             
bonds under recently-enacted environmental protection statutes, may             
affect the validity of such Bonds or the tax-free nature of the interest        
thereon. While the outcome of litigation of such nature can never be            
entirely predicted, the Fund has received opinions of bond counsel to           
the issuing authority of each Bond on the date of issuance to the effect        
that such Bonds have been validly issued and that the interest thereon          
is exempt from Federal income taxes and state and local taxes. In               
addition, other factors may arise from time to time which potentially           
may impair the ability of issuers to meet obligations undertaken with           
respect to the Bonds.                                                           

Page 8                                                                          

What are Estimated Long-Term Return and Estimated Current Return?               

At the date of this Prospectus, the Estimated Current Return and the            
Estimated Long-Term Return, under the monthly, quarterly (if applicable)        
and semi-annual (if applicable) distribution plans, are as set forth in         
Part One attached hereto for each Trust. Estimated Current Return is            
computed by dividing the Estimated Net Annual Interest Income per Unit          
by the Public Offering Price. Any change in either amount will result in        
a change in the Estimated Current Return. For each Trust, the Public            
Offering Price will vary in accordance with fluctuations in the prices          
of the underlying Bonds and the Net Annual Interest Income per Unit will        
change as Bonds are redeemed, paid, sold or exchanged in certain                
refundings or as the expenses of each Trust change. Therefore, there is         
no assurance that the Estimated Current Return indicated in Part One for        
each Trust will be realized in the future. Estimated Long-Term Return is        
calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and               
determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values,         
yields (which take into account the amortization of premiums and the            
accretion of discounts) and estimated retirements of all of the Bonds in        
the Trust and (2) takes into account a compounding factor, the expenses         
and sales charge associated with each Unit of a Trust. Since the market         
values and estimated retirements of the Bonds and the expenses of the           
Trust will change, there is no assurance that the Estimated Long-Term           
Return indicated in Part One for each Trust will be realized in the             
future. Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return are             
expected to differ because the calculation of Estimated Long-Term Return        
reflects the estimated date and amount of principal returned while              
Estimated Current Return calculations include only Net Annual Interest          
Income and Public Offering Price. Neither rate reflects the true return         
to Unit holders, which is lower, because neither includes the effect of         
certain delays in distributions to Unit holders.                                

A comparison of tax-free and equivalent taxable estimated current     
returns and estimated long-term returns with the returns on various             
taxable investments is one element to consider in making an investment          
decision. The Sponsor may from time to time in its advertising and sales        
materials compare the then current estimated returns on the Trust and           
returns over specified periods on other similar Trusts sponsored by Nike        
Securities L.P. with returns on taxable investments such as corporate or        
U.S. Government bonds, bank CDs and money market accounts or money              
market funds, each of which has investment characteristics that may             
differ from those of the Trust.                                                 

How are Purchased Interest and Accrued Interest Treated?                        

Purchased Interest. For The First Trust Combined Series 198-208, each           
Trust contains an amount of Purchased Interest. Purchased Interest is a         
portion of the unpaid interest that has accrued on the Bonds from the           
later of the last payment date on the Bonds or the date of issuance             
thereof through the First Settlement Date and is included in the                
calculation of the Public Offering Price. Purchased Interest will be            
distributed to Unit holders as Units are redeemed or Securities are             
sold, mature or are called. See "Summary of Essential Information"              
appearing in Part One for each Trust for the amount of Purchased                
Interest per Unit for each Trust. Purchased Interest is an element of           
the determination of the price Unit holders will receive in connection          
with the sale or redemption of Units prior to the termination of the            
Trust.                                                                          

Accrued Interest. Accrued interest is the accumulation of unpaid                
interest on a bond from the last day on which interest thereon was paid.        
Interest on Bonds generally is paid semi-annually, although each Trust          
accrues such interest daily. Because of this, a Trust always has an             
amount of interest earned but not yet collected by the Trustee. For this        
reason, with respect to sales settling subsequent to the First                  
Settlement Date, the Public Offering Price of Units will have added to          
it the proportionate share of accrued interest to the date of                   
settlement. Unit holders will receive on the next distribution date of          
the Trust the amount, if any, of accrued interest paid on their Units.          

For The First Trust Combined Series 1-197, except through an advancement        
of its own funds, the Trustee has no cash for distribution to Unit              
holders until it receives interest payments on the Bonds in a Trust. The        
Trustee will recover its advancements without interest or other costs to        
such Trust from interest received on the Bonds in the Trust. When these         
advancements have been recovered, regular distributions of interest to          
Unit holders will commence. See "Rights of Unit Holders-How are Interest        
and Principal Distributed?" Interest account balances are established           
with generally positive cash balances so that it will not be necessary          
on a regular basis for the Trustee to advance its own funds in                  
connection with interest distributions.                                         

Page 9                                                                          

For The First Trust Combined Series 198-208, in an effort to reduce the         
amount of Purchased Interest which would otherwise have to be paid by           
Unit holders, the Trustee may advance a portion of the accrued interest         
to the Sponsor as the Unit holder of record as of the First Settlement          
Date. Consequently, the amount of accrued interest to be added to the           
Public Offering Price of Units will include only accrued interest from          
the First Settlement Date to the date of settlement (other than the             
Purchased Interest already included therein), less any distributions            
from the Interest Account subsequent to the First Settlement Date. See          
"Rights of Unit Holders-How are Interest and Principal Distributed?"            

For The First Trust Combined Series 209 and subsequent Series, in an            
effort to reduce the amount of accrued interest which would otherwise           
have to be paid in addition to the Public Offering Price in the sale of         
Units to the public, the Trustee will advance the amount of accrued             
interest as of the First Settlement Date and the same will be                   
distributed to the Sponsor as the Unit holder of record as of the First         
Settlement Date. Consequently, the amount of accrued interest to be             
added to the Public Offering Price of Units will include only accrued           
interest from the First Settlement Date to the date of settlement, less         
any distributions from the Interest Account subsequent to the First             
Settlement Date. See "Rights of Unit Holders-How are Interest and               
Principal Distributed?"                                                         

Because of the varying interest payment dates of the Bonds, accrued             
interest at any point in time will be greater than the amount of                
interest actually received by a Trust and distributed to Unit holders.          
If a Unit holder sells or redeems all or a portion of his Units, he will        
be entitled to receive his proportionate share of the Purchased Interest        
(if any) and accrued interest from the purchaser of his Units. Since the        
Trustee has the use of the funds (including Purchased Interest, if any)         
held in the Interest Account for distributions to Unit holders and since        
such Account is non-interest-bearing to Unit holders, the Trustee               
benefits thereby.                                                               

Why and How are the Insured Trusts Insured?
THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION IS APPLICABLE ONLY TO THE INSURED TRUSTS. THE          
BONDS IN THE PORTFOLIO OF AN ADVANTAGE TRUST ARE NOT INSURED BY                 
INSURANCE OBTAINED BY THE FUND.                                                 

All Bonds in the portfolio of an Insured Trust are insured as to the            
scheduled payment of interest and principal by policies obtained by each        
Insured Trust from Financial Guaranty Insurance Company ("Financial             
Guaranty" or "FGIC"), a New York stock insurance company, or AMBAC              
Indemnity Corporation ("AMBAC Indemnity" or "AMBAC"), a Wisconsin-              
domiciled stock insurance company, or obtained by the Bond issuer, the          
underwriters, the Sponsor or others prior to the Initial Date of Deposit        
directly from Financial Guaranty, AMBAC Indemnity or other insurers (the        
"Preinsured Bonds"). The insurance policy obtained by each Insured Trust        
is noncancellable and will continue in force for such Trust so long as          
such Trust is in existence and the Bonds described in the policy                
continue to be held by such Trust (see "Portfolio" for each Insured             
Trust). Nonpayment of premiums on the policy obtained by each Insured           
Trust will not result in the cancellation of insurance, but will permit         
Financial Guaranty and/or AMBAC Indemnity to take action against the            
Trustee to recover premium payments due it. Premium rates for each issue        
of Bonds protected by the policy obtained by each Insured Trust are             
fixed for the life of such Trust. The premium for any Preinsured Bonds          
has been paid in advance by the Bond issuer, the underwriters, the              
Sponsor or others and any such policy or policies are noncancellable and        
will continue in force so long as the Bonds so insured are outstanding          
and the insurer and/or insurers thereof remain in business. If the              
provider of an original issuance insurance policy is unable to meet its         
obligations under such policy, or if the rating assigned to the claims-         
paying ability of such insurer deteriorates, Financial Guaranty and/or          
AMBAC Indemnity has no obligation to insure any issue adversely affected        
by either of the above described events. A monthly premium is paid by           
each Insured Trust for the insurance obtained by such Trust, which is           
payable from the interest income received by such Trust. In the case of         
Preinsured Bonds, no premiums for insurance are paid by the Insured Trust.      

Financial Guaranty Insurance Company. Under the provisions of the               
aforementioned portfolio insurance issued by Financial Guaranty,                
Financial Guaranty unconditionally and irrevocably agrees to pay to             
Citibank, N.A., or its successor, as its agent (the "Fiscal Agent"),            
that portion of the principal of and interest on the Bonds covered by           
the policy which shall become due for payment but shall be unpaid by            
reason of nonpayment by the issuer of the Bonds. The term "due for              
payment" means, when referring to the principal of a Bond, its stated           
maturity date or the date on which it shall have been called for                
mandatory sinking fund redemption and does not refer to any earlier date        
on which payment is due by reason of call for redemption (other than by         

Page 10                                                                         

mandatory sinking fund redemption), acceleration or other advancement of        
maturity and means, when referring to interest on a Bond, the stated            
date for payment of interest, except that when the interest on a Bond           
shall have been determined, as provided in the underlying documentation         
relating to such Bond, to be subject to Federal income taxation, "due           
for payment" also means, when referring to the principal of such Bond,          
the date on which such Bond has been called for mandatory redemption as         
a result of such determination of taxability, and when referring to             
interest on such Bond, the accrued interest at the rate provided in such        
documentation to the date on which such Bond has been called for such           
mandatory redemption, together with any applicable redemption premium.          
The term "due for payment" will not include, when referring to either           
the principal of a Bond or the interest on a Bond, any acceleration of          
payment unless such acceleration is at the sole option of Financial             
Guaranty.                                                                       

Financial Guaranty will make such payments to the Fiscal Agent on the           
date such principal or interest becomes due for payment or on the               
business day next following the day on which Financial Guaranty shall           
have received notice of nonpayment, whichever is later. The Fiscal Agent        
will disburse to the Trustee the face amount of principal and interest          
which is then due for payment but is unpaid by reason of nonpayment by          
the issuer but only upon receipt by the Fiscal Agent of (i) evidence of         
the Trustee's right to receive payment of the principal or interest due         
for payment and (ii) evidence, including any appropriate instruments of         
assignment, that all of the rights to payment of such principal or              
interest due for payment shall thereupon vest in Financial Guaranty.            
Upon such disbursement, Financial Guaranty shall become the owner of the        
Bond, appurtenant coupon or right to payment of principal or interest on        
such Bond and shall be fully subrogated to all of the Trustee's rights          
thereunder, including the right to payment thereof.                             

Pursuant to an irrevocable commitment of Financial Guaranty, the                
Trustee, upon the sale of a Bond covered under a policy obtained by an          
Insured Trust has the right to obtain permanent insurance with respect          
to such Bond (i.e., insurance to maturity of the Bonds regardless of the        
identity of the holder thereof) (the "Permanent Insurance") upon the            
payment of a single predetermined insurance premium from the proceeds of        
the sale of such Bond. Accordingly, any Bond in an Insured Trust is             
eligible to be sold on an insured basis. It is expected that the Trustee        
will exercise the right to obtain Permanent Insurance only if upon such         
exercise the Insured Trust would receive net proceeds (sale of Bond             
proceeds less the insurance premium attributable to the Permanent               
Insurance) from such sale in excess of the sale proceeds if such Bonds          
were sold on an uninsured basis. The insurance premium with respect to          
each Bond eligible for Permanent Insurance is determined based upon the

AMBAC Indemnity Corporation ("AMBAC Indemnity"). The Insurance Policy of        
AMBAC Indemnity obtained by an Insured Trust is noncancellable and will         

Page 11                                                                         

continue in force for so long as the Bonds described in the Insurance           
Policy are held by an Insured Trust. A monthly premium is paid by an            
Insured Trust for the Insurance Policy obtained by it. The Trustee will         
pay, when due, successively, the full amount of each installment of the         
insurance premium. Pursuant to a binding agreement with AMBAC Indemnity,        
in the event of a sale of a Bond covered by the AMBAC Indemnity                 
Insurance Policy, the Trustee has the right to obtain permanent                 
insurance for such Bond upon payment of a single predetermined premium          
from the proceeds of the sale of such Bond.                                     

Under the terms of the Insurance Policy, AMBAC Indemnity agrees to pay          
to the Trustee that portion of the principal of and interest on the             
Bonds insured by AMBAC Indemnity which shall become due for payment but         
shall be unpaid by reason of nonpayment by the issuer of the Bonds. The         
term "due for payment" means, when referring to the principal of a Bond         
so insured, its stated maturity date or the date on which it shall have         
been called for mandatory sinking fund redemption and does not refer to         
any earlier date on which payment is due by reason of call for                  
redemption (other than by mandatory sinking fund redemption),                   
acceleration or other advancement of maturity and means, when referring         
to interest on a Bond, the stated date for payment of interest.                 

AMBAC Indemnity will make payment to the Trustee not later than thirty          
days after notice from the Trustee is received by AMBAC Indemnity that a        
nonpayment of principal or of interest on a Bond has occurred, but not          
earlier than the date on which the Bonds are due for payment. AMBAC             
Indemnity will disburse to the Trustee the face amount of principal and         
interest which is then due for payment but is unpaid by reason of               
nonpayment by the issuer in exchange for delivery of Bonds, not less in         
face amount than the amount of the payment in bearer form, free and             
clear of all liens and encumbrances and uncancelled. In cases where             
Bonds are issuable only in a form whereby principal is payable to               
registered holders or their assigns, AMBAC Indemnity shall pay principal        
only upon presentation and surrender of the unpaid Bonds uncancelled and        
free of any adverse claim, together with an instrument of assignment in         
satisfactory form, so as to permit ownership of such Bonds to be                
registered in the name of AMBAC Indemnity or its nominee. In cases where        
Bonds are issuable only in a form whereby interest is payable to                
registered holders or their assigns, AMBAC Indemnity shall pay interest         
only upon presentation of proof that the claimant is the person entitled        
to the payment of interest on the Bonds and delivery of an instrument of        
assignment, in satisfactory form, transferring to AMBAC Indemnity all           
right under such Bonds to receive the interest in respect of which the          
insurance payment was made.

The information relating to AMBAC Indemnity contained above has been            
furnished by AMBAC Indemnity. No representation is made herein as to the        
accuracy or adequacy of such information, or as to the existence of any         
adverse changes in such information, subsequent to the date hereof.             

In determining whether to insure bonds, Financial Guaranty and/or AMBAC         
Indemnity has applied its own standards which are not necessarily the           
same as the criteria used in regard to the selection of bonds by the            
Sponsor. This decision is made prior to the Initial Date of Deposit, as         
bonds not covered by such insurance are not deposited in an Insured             
Trust, unless such bonds are Preinsured Bonds. The insurance obtained by        

Page 12                                                                         

an Insured Trust covers Bonds deposited in such Trust and physically            
delivered to the Trustee in the case of bearer bonds or registered in           
the name of the Trustee or its nominee or delivered along with an               
assignment in the case of registered bonds or registered in the name of         
the Trustee or its nominee in the case of Bonds held in book-entry form.        
Contracts to purchase Bonds are not covered by the insurance obtained by        
an Insured Trust although Bonds underlying such contracts are covered by        
insurance upon physical delivery to the Trustee.                                

Insurance obtained by each Insured Trust or by the Bond issuer, the             
underwriters, the Sponsor or others does not guarantee the market value         
of the Bonds or the value of the Units of such Trust. The insurance             
obtained by an Insured Trust is effective only as to Bonds owned by and         
held in such Trust. In the event of a sale of any such Bond by the              
Trustee, the insurance terminates as to such Bond on the date of sale.          
In the event of a sale of a Bond insured by an Insured Trust, the               
Trustee has the right to obtain Permanent Insurance upon the payment of         
an insurance premium from the proceeds of the sale of such Bond. Except         
as indicated below, insurance obtained by an Insured Trust has no effect        
on the price or redemption value of Units. It is the present intention          
of the Evaluator to attribute a value to such insurance obtained by an          
Insured Trust (including the right to obtain Permanent Insurance) for           
the purpose of computing the price or redemption value of Units only if         
the Bonds covered by such insurance are in default in payment of                
principal or interest or, in the Sponsor's opinion, in significant risk         
of such default. The value of the insurance will be equal to the                
difference between (i) the market value of a Bond which is in default in        
payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default         
assuming the exercise of the right to obtain Permanent Insurance (less          
the insurance premium attributable to the purchase of Permanent                 
Insurance) and (ii) the market value of such Bonds not covered by               
Permanent Insurance. See "Public Offering-How is the Public Offering
Price Determined?" herein for a more complete description of the                
Evaluator's method of valuing defaulted Bonds and Bonds which have a            
significant risk of default. Insurance on a Preinsured Bond is effective        
as long as such Bond is outstanding. Therefore, any such insurance may          
be considered to represent an element of market value in regard to the          
Bonds thus insured, but the exact effect, if any, of this insurance on          
such market value cannot be predicted.                                          

A contract of insurance obtained by an Insured Trust and the                    
negotiations in respect thereof represent the only relationship between         
Financial Guaranty and/or AMBAC Indemnity and the Fund. Otherwise               
neither Financial Guaranty nor its parent, FGIC Corporation, or any             
affiliate thereof, nor AMBAC Indemnity nor its parent, AMBAC, Inc., or          
any affiliate thereof has any significant relationship, direct or               
indirect, with the Fund or the Sponsor, except that the Sponsor has in          
the past and may from time to time in the future, in the normal course          
of its business, participate as sole underwriter or as manager or as a          
member of underwriting syndicates in the distribution of new issues of          
municipal bonds in which the investors or the affiliates of FGIC                
Corporation and/or AMBAC Inc. have or will be participants or for which         
a policy of insurance guaranteeing the scheduled payment of interest and        
principal has been obtained from Financial Guaranty and/or AMBAC                
Indemnity. Neither the Fund nor the Units of a Trust nor the portfolio          
of such Trust is insured directly or indirectly by FGIC Corporation             
and/or AMBAC Inc.

Financial Security Assurance. Financial Security Assurance Inc.                 
("Financial Security") is a monoline insurance company incorporated in          
1984 under the laws of the State of New York. Financial Security is

50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico.                            

Financial Security and its subsidiaries are engaged in the business of          
writing financial guaranty insurance, principally in respect of                 
securities offered in domestic and foreign markets. In general,                 
financial guaranty insurance consists of the issuance of a guaranty of          
scheduled payments of an issuer's securities, thereby enhancing the             
credit rating of those securities, in consideration for payment of a            
premium to the insurer. Financial Security and its subsidiaries                 
principally insure asset-backed, collateralized and municipal                   
securities. Asset-backed securities are generally supported by                  
residential mortgage loans, consumer or trade receivables, securities or        
other assets having an ascertainable cash flow or market value.                 
Collateralized securities include public utility first mortgage bonds           
and sale/leaseback obligation bonds. Municipal securities consist               
largely of general obligation bonds, special revenue bonds and other            
special obligations of state and local governments. Financial Security          
insures both newly issued securities sold in the primary market and             
outstanding securities sold in the secondary market that satisfy                
Financial Security's underwriting criteria.                                     

Financial Security is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Financial Security

its subsidiaries or to make any additional contribution to the capital          
of Financial Security or its subsidiaries. As of March 31, 1998, the            
total policyholders' surplus and contingency reserves and the total

Pursuant to an intercompany agreement, liabilities on financial guaranty        
insurance written or reinsured from third parties by Financial Security         
or any of its domestic operating insurance company subsidiaries                 
(including FSA Maryland) are reinsured among such companies on an agreed-       
upon percentage substantially proportional to their respective capital,         
surplus and reserves, subject to applicable statutory risk limitations.         
In addition, Financial Security and FSA Maryland reinsure a portion of          
their liabilities under certain of their financial guaranty insurance           
policies with other reinsurers under various quota share treaties and on        
a transaction-by-transaction basis. Such reinsurance is utilized as a           
risk management device and to comply with certain statutory and rating          
agency requirements; it does not alter or limit the obligations of              
Financial Security or FSA Maryland under any financial guaranty                 
insurance policy.                                                               

The claims-paying ability of Financial Security and FSA Maryland is             
rated "Aaa" by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., and "AAA" by Standard &         
Poor's Rating Services, Nippon Investors Service Inc. and Standard &            
Poor's (Australia) Pty. Ltd. Such ratings reflect only the views of the         
respective rating agencies, are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold        
securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by such        
rating agencies.                                                                

Connie Lee Insurance Company. On December 18, 1997, all of the                  
outstanding shares of Construction Loan Insurance Corporation (which            
previously owned all of the outstanding shares of Connie Lee Insurance          
Company) were merged into Connie Lee Holdings, Inc. ("Connie Lee").             
Connie Lee is a wholly-owned subsidiary of AMBAC Assurance Company, a           
Wisconsin-domiciled insurance company.                                          

As of December 31, 1997, the total policyholders' surplus of Connie Lee         
was $92,563,017 (unaudited) and total admitted assets were $233,237,273         
(unaudited), as reported to the Commissioner of Insurance of the State          
of Wisconsin in Connie Lee's financial statements prepared in accordance        
with statutory accounting principles applicable to insurance companies.         
Copies of these financial statements are available from Connie Lee upon         
request.                                                                        

CCLIA's consolidated annual (audited) and quarterly (unaudited)                 
financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted             
accounting principles are filed periodically with the Nationally                
Recognized Municipal Securities Information Repositories designated             
under Rule 15c2-12 of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The               
information contained in these financial statements is incorporated             
herein by reference. Copies of these financial statements are available         
from Connie Lee upon request.                                                   

Standard & Poor's has rated the claims-paying ability of Connie Lee "AAA".      

Connie Lee makes no representation regarding the Bonds or the                   
advisability of investing in the Bonds. The above rating is not a               
recommendation to buy, sell or hold the Connie Lee insured Bonds and            
such rating is subject to the revision or withdrawal at any time by the         
rating agency. Any downward revision or withdrawal of the rating may            
have an adverse effect on the market price of the Connie Lee insured            
Bonds.                                                                          

The address of Connie Lee's administrative offices and its telephone            
number are 1299 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20004 and           
(800) 221-1854.                                                                 

Because the Bonds in each Insured Trust are insured as to the scheduled         
payment of principal and interest and on the basis of the financial             
condition of the insurance companies referred to above, Standard &              
Poor's has assigned to units of each Insured Trust its "AAA" investment         
rating. This is the highest rating assigned to securities by Standard &         
Poor's. See "Description of Bond Ratings." The obtaining of this rating         
by each Insured Trust should not be construed as an approval of the             
offering of the Units by Standard & Poor's or as a guarantee of the             
market value of each Insured Trust or the Units of such Trust. Standard         
& Poor's has indicated that this rating is not a recommendation to buy,         
hold or sell Units nor does it take into account the extent to which            
expenses of each Trust or sales by each Trust of Bonds for less than the        
purchase price paid by such Trust will reduce payment to Unit holders of        
the interest and principal required to be paid on such Bonds. Such              
rating will be in effect for a period of thirteen months from the               
Initial Date of Deposit of an Insured Trust and will, unless renewed,           
terminate at the end of such period. There is no guarantee that the             
"AAA" investment rating with respect to the Units of an Insured Trust           
will be maintained.                                                             

An objective of portfolio insurance obtained by such Insured Trust is to        
obtain a higher yield on the Bonds in the portfolio of such Trust than          

Page 15                                                                         

would be available if all the Bonds in such portfolio had the Standard &        
Poor's "AAA" and/or Moody's Investors Service, Inc. "Aaa" rating(s) and         
at the same time to have the protection of insurance of scheduled               
payment of interest and principal on the Bonds. There is, of course, no         
certainty that this result will be achieved. Bonds in a Trust for which         
insurance has been obtained by the Bond issuer, the underwriters, the           
Sponsor or others (all of which were rated "AAA" by Standard & Poor's           
and/or "Aaa" by Moody's Investors Service, Inc.) may or may not have a          
higher yield than uninsured bonds rated "AAA" by Standard & Poor's or           
"Aaa" by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. In selecting Bonds for the             
portfolio of each Insured Trust, the Sponsor has applied the criteria           
herein before described.                                                        

What is the Federal Tax Status of Unit Holders?                                 

See Part Three for each Trust.                                                  

FOR INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO EXEMPTION FROM STATE OR OTHER LOCAL             
TAXES, SEE PART THREE FOR EACH TRUST.                                           

What are the Expenses and Charges?                                              

With the exception of bookkeeping and other administrative services             
provided to the Trusts, for which the Sponsor will be reimbursed in             
amounts as set forth under "Special Trust Information" in each Part One         
of this Prospectus, the Sponsor will not receive any fee in connection          
with its activities relating to the Trusts. For Series 49 and all               
subsequent Series, First Trust Advisors L.P., an affiliate of the               
Sponsor, will receive an annual supervisory fee, which is not to exceed         
the amount set forth in Part One for each Trust, for providing portfolio        
supervisory services for the Trust. Such fee is based on the number of          
Units outstanding in each Trust on January 1 of each year except for            
Trusts which were established subsequent to the last January 1, in which        
case the fee will be based on the number of Units outstanding in such           
Trusts as of the respective Initial Dates of Deposit.                           

For each valuation of the Bonds in a Trust, the Evaluator will receive a        
fee as indicated in Part One of this Prospectus. The Trustee pays               
certain expenses of each Trust for which it is reimbursed by such Trust.        

The Trustee will receive for its ordinary recurring services to a Trust         
an annual fee computed as indicated in Part One of this Prospectus. For         
a discussion of the services performed by the Trustee pursuant to its           
obligations under the Indenture, reference is made to the material set          
forth under "Rights of Unit Holders."                                           

The Trustee's and Evaluator's fees are payable monthly on or before each        
Distribution Date from the Interest Account of each Trust to the extent         
funds are available and then from the Principal Account of such Trust.          
Since the Trustee has the use of the funds being held in the Principal          
and Interest Accounts for future distributions, payment of expenses and         
redemptions and since such Accounts are non-interest-bearing to Unit            
holders, the Trustee benefits thereby. Part of the Trustee's                    
compensation for its services to the Fund is expected to result from the        
use of these funds. However, the Trustee may bear from its own resources        
certain expenses relating to a Trust.                                           

Each of the above mentioned fees may be increased without approval of           
the Unit holders by amounts not exceeding proportionate increases under         
the category "All Services Less Rent of Shelter" in the Consumer Price          
Index published by the United States Department of Labor. In addition,          
with respect to the fees payable to the Sponsor or an affiliate of the          
Sponsor for providing bookkeeping and other administrative services and         
supervisory services, such individual fees may exceed the actual costs          
of providing such services for a Trust, but at no time will the total           
amount received for such Services rendered to all unit investment trusts        
of which Nike Securities L.P. is the Sponsor in any calendar year exceed        
the actual cost to the Sponsor or its affiliate of supplying such               
services in such year.                                                          

The annualized cost of the portfolio insurance obtained by the Fund for         
each Insured Trust is indicated in Part One for each Trust in a Series          
of the Fund. The portfolio insurance continues so long as such Trust            
retains the Bonds thus insured. Premiums are payable monthly in advance         
by the Trustee on behalf of such Trust. As Bonds in the portfolio are           
redeemed by their respective issuers or are sold by the Trustee, the            
amount of premium will be reduced in respect of those Bonds no longer           
owned by and held in the Trust which were insured by insurance obtained         
by such Trust. Preinsured Bonds for which insurance has been obtained           

Page 16                                                                         

from Financial Guaranty and/or AMBAC Indemnity or, beginning with Series        
25 and all subsequent Series, other insurers, are not insured by such           
Trust. The premium payable for Permanent Insurance will be paid solely          
from the proceeds of the sale of such Bond in the event the Trustee             
exercises the right to obtain Permanent Insurance on a Bond. The                
premiums for such Permanent Insurance with respect to each Bond will            
decline over the life of the Bond. An Advantage Trust is not insured;           
accordingly, there are no premiums for insurance payable by such Trust.         

The following additional charges are or may be incurred by a Trust: all         
expenses (including legal and annual auditing expenses) of the Trustee          
incurred in connection with its responsibilities under the Indenture,           
except in the event of negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on           
its part; the expenses and costs of any action undertaken by the Trustee        
to protect the Trust and the rights and interests of the Unit holders;          
fees of the Trustee for any extraordinary services performed under the          
Indenture; indemnification of the Trustee for any loss, liability or            
expense incurred by it without negligence, bad faith or willful                 
misconduct on its part, arising out of or in connection with its                
acceptance or administration of the Trust; indemnification of the               
Sponsor for any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross               
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct in acting as Depositor of           
the Trust; all taxes and other government charges imposed upon the Bonds        
or any part of the Trust (no such taxes or charges are being levied or          
made or, to the knowledge of the Sponsor, are contemplated); and                
expenditures incurred in contacting Unit holders upon termination of the        
Trust. The above expenses and the Trustee's annual fee, when paid or            
owing to the Trustee, are secured by a lien on the Trust. In addition,          
the Trustee is empowered to sell Bonds of a Trust in order to make funds        
available to pay all these amounts if funds are not otherwise available         
in the Interest and Principal Accounts of the Trust.                            

Unless the Sponsor determines that such an audit is not required, the           
Indenture requires the accounts of each Trust to be audited on an annual        
basis at the expense of the Trust by independent auditors selected by           
the Sponsor. So long as the Sponsor is making a secondary market for            
Units, the Sponsor shall bear the cost of such annual audits to the             
extent such cost exceeds $.50 per Unit. Unit holders of a Trust covered         
by an audit may obtain a copy of the audited financial statements from          
the Trustee upon request.                                                       

PUBLIC OFFERING       

How is the Public Offering Price Determined?                                    

Although it is not obligated to do so, the Sponsor intends to maintain a        
market for the Units and continuously to offer to purchase Units at             
prices, subject to change at any time, based upon the aggregate bid             
price of the Bonds in the portfolio of each Trust plus the amount of            
Purchased Interest of a Trust (if any) and interest accrued to the date         
of settlement. All expenses incurred in maintaining a market, other than        
the fees of the Evaluator and the costs of the Trustee in transferring          
and recording the ownership of Units, will be borne by the Sponsor. If          
the supply of Units exceeds demand, or for some other business reason,          
the Sponsor may discontinue purchases of Units at such prices. IF A UNIT        
HOLDER WISHES TO DISPOSE OF HIS UNITS, HE SHOULD INQUIRE OF THE SPONSOR         
AS TO CURRENT MARKET PRICES PRIOR TO MAKING A TENDER FOR REDEMPTION TO          
THE TRUSTEE. Prospectuses relating to certain other bond funds indicate         
an intention, subject to change, on the part of the respective sponsors         
of such funds to repurchase units of those funds on the basis of a price        
higher than the bid prices of the securities in the funds. Consequently,        
depending upon the prices actually paid, the repurchase price of other          
sponsors for units of their funds may be computed on a somewhat more            
favorable basis than the repurchase price offered by the Sponsor for            
Units of a Trust in secondary market transactions. As in the First Trust        
Combined Series, the purchase price per unit of such bond funds will            
depend primarily on the value of the securities in the Portfolio of the         
applicable Trust.                                                               

The Public Offering Price of Units of a Trust will be determined by             
adding to the Evaluator's determination of the aggregate bid price of           
the Bonds in a Trust plus the amount of Purchased Interest of a Trust           
(if any) and the appropriate sales charge determined in accordance with         
the schedule set forth below, based upon the number of years remaining          
to the maturity of each Bond in the portfolio of the Trust, adjusting           
the total to reflect the amount of any cash held in or advanced to the          
principal account of the Trust and dividing the result by the number of         
Units of such trust then outstanding. The minimum sales charge on Units         

Page 17                                                                         

will be 3% of the Public Offering Price (equivalent to 3.093% of the net        
amount invested). For purposes of computation, Bonds will be deemed to          
mature on their expressed maturity dates unless: (a) the Bonds have been        
called for redemption or funds or securities have been placed in escrow         
to redeem them on an earlier call date, in which case such call date            
will be deemed to be the date upon which they mature; or (b) such Bonds         
are subject to a "mandatory tender," in which case such mandatory tender        
will be deemed to be the date upon which they mature. The offering price        
of Bonds in the Trust may be expected to be greater than the bid price          
of such Bonds by approximately 1-2% of the aggregate principal amount of        
such Bonds.                                                                     

The effect of this method of sales charge computation will be that              
different sales charge rates will be applied to each of the various             
Bonds in the Trusts based upon the maturities of such bonds, in                 
accordance with the following schedule:                                         

                                                                [Download Table]

There will be no reduction of the sales charges for volume purchases. A         
dealer will receive from the Sponsor a dealer concession of 70% of the          
total sales charges for Units sold by such dealer and dealers will not          
be eligible for additional concessions for Units sold pursuant to the           
above schedule.                                                                 

An investor may aggregate purchases of Units of two or more consecutive         
series of a particular State, National, Discount, Intermediate, Long            
Intermediate or Short Intermediate Trust for purposes of calculating the        
discount for volume purchases listed above. Additionally, with respect          
to the employees, officers and directors (including their immediate             
family members, defined as spouses, children, grandchildren, parents,           
grandparents, mothers-in-law, fathers-in-law, sons-in-law and daughters-        
in-law, and trustees, custodians or fiduciaries for the benefit of such         
person) of the Sponsor and broker/dealers and their subsidiaries and            
vendors providing services to the Sponsor, may purchase Units of the            
Trusts during the secondary market at the Public Offering Price less the        
concession the Sponsor typically allows broker/dealers.                         

Any such reduced sales charge shall be the responsibility of the selling        
broker/dealer. The reduced sales charge structure will apply on all             
purchases of Units in a Trust by the same person on any one day from the        
Sponsor or any one broker/dealer and, for purposes of calculating the           
applicable sales charge, purchases of Units in the Fund will be                 
aggregated with concurrent purchases by the same person from the Sponsor        
or such broker/dealer of Units in any series of tax-exempt unit                 
investment trusts sponsored by Nike Securities L.P. Additionally, Units         
purchased in the name of the spouse of a purchaser or in the name of a          
child of such purchaser will be deemed, for the purpose of calculating          
the applicable sales charge, to be additional purchases by the                  
purchaser. The reduced sales charges will also be applicable to a               
trustee or other fiduciary purchasing securities for a single trust             
estate or single fiduciary account.                                             

From time to time the Sponsor may implement programs under which                
broker/dealers and other selling agents of the Fund may receive nominal         
awards from the Sponsor for each of their registered representatives who        
have sold a minimum number of UIT Units during a specified time period.         
In addition, at various times the Sponsor may implement other programs          
under which the sales force of broker/dealers and other selling agents          
may be eligible to win other nominal awards for certain sales efforts,          
or under which the Sponsor will reallow to any such broker/dealer or            
other selling agent that sponsors sales contests or recognition programs        
conforming to criteria established by the Sponsor, or participates in           

Page 18                                                                         

sales programs sponsored by the Sponsor, an amount not exceeding the            
total applicable sales charges on the sales generated by such person at         
the public offering price during such programs. Also, the Sponsor in its        
discretion may from time to time pursuant to objective criteria                 
established by the Sponsor pay fees to qualifying broker/dealers and            
other selling agents for certain services or activities which are               
primarily intended to result in sales of Units of the Trusts. Such              
payments are made by the Sponsor out of its own assets, and not out of          
the assets of the Trusts. These programs will not change the price Unit         
holders pay for their Units or the amount that the Trusts will receive          
from the Units sold.                                                            

A comparison of tax-free and equivalent taxable estimated current               
returns and estimated long-term returns with the returns on various             
taxable investments is one element to consider in making an investment          
decision. The Sponsor may from time to time in its advertising and sales        
materials compare the then current estimated returns on the Trust and           
returns over specified periods on other similar Trusts sponsored by Nike        
Securities L.P. with returns on taxable investments such as corporate or        
U.S. Government bonds, bank CDs and money market accounts or money              
market funds, each of which has investment characteristics that may             
differ from those of the Trust. U.S. Government bonds, for example, are         
backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government and bank CDs         
and money market accounts are insured by an agency of the federal               
government. Money market accounts and money market funds provide                
stability of principal, but pay interest at rates that vary with the            
condition of the short-term debt market. The investment characteristics         
of the Trust are described more fully elsewhere in this Prospectus.             

The aggregate price of the Bonds in each Trust is determined by the             
evaluator (the "Evaluator"), on the basis of bid prices (1) on the basis        
of current market prices for the Bonds obtained from dealers or brokers         
who customarily deal in bonds comparable to those held by the Trust; (2)        
if such prices are not available for any of the Bonds, on the basis of          
current market prices for comparable bonds; (3) by determining the value        
of the Bonds by appraisal; or (4) by any combination of the above.              
Unless Bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or, in          
the Sponsor's opinion, in significant risk of such default, the                 
Evaluator will not attribute any value to the insurance obtained by an          
Insured Trust. On the other hand, the value of insurance obtained by the        
issuer of Bonds in a Trust is reflected and included in the market value        
of such Bonds.                                                                  

The Evaluator will consider in its evaluation of Bonds which are in             
default in payment of principal or interest or, in the Sponsor's                
opinion, in significant risk of such default (the "Defaulted Bonds") and        
which are covered by insurance obtained by an Insured Trust, the value          
of the insurance guaranteeing interest and principal payments. The value        
of the insurance will be equal to the difference between (i) the market         
value of Defaulted Bonds assuming the exercise of the right to obtain           
Permanent Insurance (less the insurance premium attributable to the             
purchase of Permanent Insurance) and (ii) the market value of such              
Defaulted Bonds not covered by Permanent Insurance. In addition, the            
Evaluator will consider the ability of Financial Guaranty and/or AMBAC          
Indemnity to meet its commitments under an Insured Trust's insurance            
policy, including the commitments to issue Permanent Insurance. It is           
the position of the Sponsor that this is a fair method of valuing the           
Bonds and the insurance obtained by an Insured Trust and reflects a             
proper valuation method in accordance with the provisions of the                
Investment Company Act of 1940.                                                 

The Evaluator will be requested to make a determination of the aggregate        
price of the Bonds in each Trust, on a bid price basis, as of the close         
of trading on the New York Stock Exchange on each day on which it is            
open, effective for all sales, purchases or redemptions made subsequent         
to the last preceding determination.                                            

Although payment is normally made three business days following the             
order for purchase, payment may be made prior thereto. A person will            
become owner of the Units on the date of settlement provided payment has        
been received. Cash, if any, made available to the Sponsor prior to the         
date of settlement for the purchase of Units may be used in the                 
Sponsor's business and may be deemed to be a benefit to the Sponsor,            
subject to the limitations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.              
Delivery of Certificates representing Units so ordered will be made             
three business days following such order or shortly thereafter. See             
"Rights of Unit Holders-How May Units Be Redeemed?" for information             
regarding the ability to redeem Units ordered for purchase.                     

Page 19                                                                         

How are Units Distributed?                                                      

Units repurchased in the secondary market (see "Public Offering-Will            
There be a Secondary Market?") may be offered by this Prospectus at the         
secondary market public offering price determined in the manner                 
described above.                                                                

It is the intention of the Sponsor to qualify Units of the Fund for sale        
in a number of states. Sales will be made to dealers and others at              
prices which represent a concession or agency commission of 4.0% of the         
Public Offering Price per Unit for each State, Discount or National             
Trust, 3.0% of the Public Offering Price for an Intermediate or Long            
Intermediate Trust, and 2.5% of the Public Offering Price per Unit for a        
Short Intermediate Trust. Notwithstanding the foregoing, broker/dealers         
or other selling agents who purchase, in the aggregate, $250,000 of the         
Trusts on any day will receive a volume concession or agency commission         
of $40.00 per Unit. However, resales of Units of a Trust by such                
broker/dealers and other selling agents to the public will be made at           
the Public Offering Price described in this Prospectus. The Sponsor             
reserves the right to change the amount of the concession or agency             
commission from time to time. Certain commercial banks are making Units         
of the Fund available to their customers on an agency basis. A portion          
of the sales charge paid by these customers is retained by or remitted          
to the banks in the amounts indicated in the amounts indicated above.           
Under the Glass-Steagall Act, banks are prohibited from underwriting            
Units; however, the Glass-Steagall Act does permit certain agency               
transactions and the banking regulators have not indicated that these           
particular agency transactions are not permitted under such Act. In             
Texas and in certain other states, any banks making Units available must        
be registered as broker/dealers under state law.                                

What are the Sponsor's Profits?                                                 

The Sponsor and participating dealers will receive a maximum gross sales        
commission equal to 5.8% of the Public Offering Price of the Units of           
each State Trust (equivalent to 6.157% of the net amount invested), 5.8%        
of the Public Offering Price of the Units of a National or Discount             
Trust (equivalent to 6.157% of the net amount invested), 4.7% of the            
Public Offering Price of the Units of an Intermediate or Long                   
Intermediate Trust (equivalent to 4.932% of the net amount invested),           
and 3.7% of the Public Offering Price of the Units of a Short                   
Intermediate Trust (equivalent to 3.842% of the net amount invested)            
less any reduced sales charge for quantity purchases as described under         
"Public Offering-How is the Public Offering Price Determined?"                  

In maintaining a market for the Units, the Sponsor will also realize            
profits or sustain losses in the amount of any difference between the           
price at which Units are purchased (based on the bid prices of the Bonds        
in each Trust) and the price at which Units are resold (which price is          
also based on the bid prices of the Bonds in each Trust and includes a          
maximum sales charge of 5.8% for a State Trust, 5.8% for a National or          
Discount Trust, 4.7% for an Intermediate or Long Intermediate Trust and         
3.7% for a Short Intermediate Trust) or redeemed. The secondary market          
public offering price of Units may be greater or less than the cost of          
such Units to the Sponsor.                                                      

RIGHTS OF UNIT HOLDERS 

How are Certificates Issued and Transferred?                                    

The Trustee is authorized to treat as the record owner of Units that            
person who is registered as such owner on the books of the Trustee.             
Ownership of Units is evidenced by registered certificates executed by          
the Trustee and the Sponsor. Delivery of certificates representing Units        
ordered for purchase is normally made three business days following such        
order or shortly thereafter. Certificates are transferable by                   
presentation and surrender to the Trustee properly endorsed or                  
accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer.                 
Certificates to be redeemed must be properly endorsed or accompanied by         
a written instrument or instruments of transfer. A Unit holder must sign        
exactly as his name appears on the face of the certificate with the             
signature guaranteed by a participant in the Securities Transfer Agents         
Medallion Program ("STAMP") or such other signature guaranty program in         
addition to, or in substitution for, STAMP, as may be accepted by the           
Trustee. In certain instances the Trustee may require additional                
documents such as, but not limited to, trust instruments, certificates          
of death, appointments as executor or administrator or certificates of          
corporate authority. Record ownership may occur before settlement.              

Page 20                                                                         

Certificates will be issued in fully registered form, transferable only         
on the books of the Trustee in denominations of one Unit or any multiple        
thereof, numbered serially for purposes of identification. Certificates         
for Units will bear an appropriate notation on their face indicating            
which plan of distribution has been selected in respect thereof. When a         
change is made, the existing certificate must be surrendered to the             
Trustee and a new certificate issued to reflect the then currently              
effective plan of distribution. There is no charge for this service.            

Although no such charge is now made or contemplated, a Unit holder may          
be required to pay $2.00 to the Trustee per certificate reissued or             
transferred for reasons other than to change the plan of distribution,          
and to pay any governmental charge that may be imposed in connection            
with each such transfer or exchange. For new certificates issued to             
replace destroyed, stolen or lost certificates, the Unit holder may be          
required to furnish indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee and pay such          
expenses as the Trustee may incur. Mutilated certificates must be               
surrendered to the Trustee for replacement.                                     

How are Interest and Principal Distributed?                                     

Record Dates for the distribution of interest under the semi-annual             
distribution plan are the fifteenth day of June and December with the           
Distribution Dates being the last day of the month in which the related         
Record Date occurs. It is anticipated that an amount equal to                   
approximately one-half of the amount of net annual interest income per          
Unit will be distributed on or shortly after each Distribution Date to          
Unit holders of record on the preceding Record Date. Record Dates for           
monthly distributions of interest are the fifteenth day of each month.          
The Distribution Dates for distributions of interest under the monthly          
plan is the last day of each month in which the related Record Date             
occurs. See "Special Trust Information" appearing in each Part I of this        
Prospectus.                                                                     

The plan of distribution selected by a Unit holder will remain in effect        
until changed. Unit holders purchasing Units in the secondary market            
will initially receive distributions in accordance with the election of         
the prior owner. Each year, approximately six weeks prior to the end of         
May, the Trustee will furnish each Unit holder a card to be returned to         
the Trustee not more than thirty nor less than ten days before the end          
of such month. Unit holders desiring to change the plan of distribution         
in which they are participating may so indicate on the card and return          
same, together with their certificate, to the Trustee. If the card and          
certificate are returned to the Trustee, the change will become                 
effective as of June 16 of that year. If the card and certificate are           
not returned to the Trustee, the Unit holder will be deemed to have             
elected to continue with the same plan for the following twelve months.         

The pro rata share of cash in the Principal Account of each Trust will          
be computed as of the fifteenth day of each month, and distributions to         
the Unit holders of such Trust as of such Record Date will be made on           
the dates specified in Part One. Proceeds from the disposition of any of        
the Bonds of such Trust (less any premiums due with respect to Bonds for        
which the Trustee has exercised the right to obtain Permanent Insurance)        
received after such Record Date and prior to the following Distribution         
Date will be held in the Principal Account of such Trust and not                
distributed until the next Distribution Date. The Trustee is not                
required to make a distribution from the Principal Account of a Trust           
unless the amount available for distribution shall equal at least $1.00         
per Unit.                                                                       

The Trustee will credit to the Interest Account of each Trust all               
interest received by such Trust, including that part of the proceeds            
(including insurance proceeds if any, paid to an Insured Trust) of any          
disposition of Bonds which represents accrued interest. Other receipts          
will be credited to the Principal Account of such Trust. The                    
distribution to the Unit holders of a Trust as of each Record Date will         
be made on the following Distribution Date or shortly thereafter and            
shall consist of an amount substantially equal to such portion of the           
holder's pro rata share of the estimated annual income of such Trust            
after deducting estimated expenses. Except through an advancement of its        
own Funds, the Trustee has no cash for distribution to Unit holders             
until it receives interest payments on the Bonds in a Trust. The Trustee        
shall be reimbursed, without interest, for any such advances from funds         
in the Interest Account of such Trust on the ensuing Record Date.               
Persons who purchase Units between a Record Date and a Distribution Date        
will receive their first distribution on the second Distribution Date           
after the purchase, under the applicable plan of distribution. The              
Trustee is not required to pay interest on funds held in the Principal          
or Interest Account of a Trust (but may itself earn interest thereon and        
therefore benefit from the use of such funds).                                  

Page 21                                                                         

As of the fifteenth day of each month, the Trustee will deduct from the         
Interest Account of each Trust and, to the extent funds are not                 
sufficient therein, from the Principal Account of each Trust, amounts           
necessary to pay the expenses of such Trust. The Trustee also may               
withdraw from said accounts such amounts, if any, as it deems necessary         
to establish a reserve for any governmental charges payable out of the          
Trust. Amounts so withdrawn shall not be considered a part of the               
Trust's assets until such time as the Trustee shall return all or any           
part of such amounts to the appropriate account. In addition, the               
Trustee may withdraw from the Interest Account and the Principal Account        
of a Trust such amounts as may be necessary to cover redemption of Units        
of such Trust by the Trustee.                                                   

How Can Distributions to Unit Holders be Reinvested?                            

Universal Distribution Option. Unit holders may elect participation in a        
Universal Distribution Option which permits a Unit holder to direct the         
Trustee to distribute principal and interest payments to any other              
investment vehicle of which the Unit holder has an existing account. For        
example, at a Unit holder's direction, the Trustee would distribute             
automatically on the applicable distribution date interest income or            
principal on the participant's Units to, among other investment                 
vehicles, a Unit holder's checking, bank savings, money market,                 
insurance, reinvestment or any other account. All such distributions, of        
course, are subject to the minimum investment and sales charges, if any,        
of the particular investment vehicle to which distributions are                 
directed. The Trustee will notify the participant of each distribution          
pursuant to the Universal Distribution Option. The Trustee will                 
distribute directly to the Unit holder any distributions which are not          
accepted by the specified investment vehicle. A participant may at any          
time, by so notifying the Trustee in writing, elect to terminate his            
participation in the Universal Distribution Option and receive directly         
future distributions on his Units.                                              

Distribution Reinvestment Option. The Sponsor has entered into an               
arrangement with Oppenheimer Management Corporation, which permits any          
Unit holder of a Trust to elect to have each distribution of interest           
income or principal on his Units automatically reinvested in shares of          
either the Oppenheimer Intermediate Tax-Exempt Bond Fund (the                   
"Intermediate Series") or the Oppenheimer Insured Tax-Exempt Bond Fund          
(the "Insured Series"). Oppenheimer Management Corporation is the               
investment adviser of each Series which are open-end, diversified               
management investment companies. The investment objective of the                
Intermediate Series is to provide a high level of current interest              
income exempt from Federal income tax through the purchase of investment        
grade securities. The investment objective of the Insured Series is to          
provide as high a level of current interest income exempt from Federal          
income tax as is consistent with the assurance of the scheduled receipt         
of interest and principal through insurance and the preservation of             
capital (the income of either Series may constitute an item of                  
preference for determining the Federal alternative minimum tax). The            
objectives and policies of each Series are presented in more detail in          
the prospectus for each Series.                                                 

Each person who purchases Units of a Trust may contact the Trustee to           
request a prospectus describing each Series and a form by which such            
person may elect to become a participant in a Distribution Reinvestment         
Option with respect to a Series. Each distribution of interest income or        
principal on the participant's Units will automatically be applied by           
the Trustee to purchase shares (or fractions thereof) of a Series               
without a sales charge and with no minimum investment requirements.             

The shareholder service agent for each Series will mail to each                 
participant in the Distribution Reinvestment Option confirmations of all        
transactions undertaken for such participant in connection with the             
receipt of distributions from The First Trust Combined Series and the           
purchase of shares (or fractions thereof) of a Series.                          

A participant may at any time, by so notifying the Trustee in writing,          
elect to terminate his participation in the Distribution Reinvestment           
Option and receive future distributions on his Units in cash. There will        
be no charge or other penalty for such termination. The Sponsor and             
Oppenheimer Management Corporation each have the right to terminate the         
Distribution Reinvestment Option, in whole or in part.                          

It should be remembered that even if distributions are reinvested               
through the Universal Distribution Option or the Distribution                   
Reinvestment Option they are still treated as distributions for income          
tax purposes.                                                                   

Page 22                                                                         

What Reports Will Unit Holders Receive?                                         

The Trustee shall furnish Unit holders of each Trust in connection with         
each distribution a statement of the amount of interest, if any, and the        
amount of other receipts, if any, which are being distributed, expressed        
in each case as a dollar amount per Unit. Within a reasonable time after        
the last business day of each calendar year, the Trustee will furnish to        
each person who at any time during the calendar year was a Unit holder          
of a Trust of record, a statement as to (1) the Interest Account:               
interest received by such Trust (including amounts representing interest        
received upon any disposition of Bonds of such Trust), the amount of            
such interest representing insurance proceeds (if applicable),                  
deductions for payment of applicable taxes and for fees and expenses of         
the Trust, redemption of Units and the balance remaining after such             
distributions and deductions, expressed both as a total dollar amount           
and as a dollar amount representing the pro rata share of each Unit             
outstanding on the last business day of such calendar year; (2) the             
Principal Account: the dates of disposition of any Bonds of such Trust          
and the net proceeds received therefrom (excluding any portion                  
representing interest and the premium attributable to the exercise of           
the right, if applicable, to obtain Permanent Insurance), deduction for         
payment of applicable taxes and for fees and expenses of the Trust,             
redemptions of Units, and the balance remaining after such distributions        
and deductions, expressed both as a total dollar amount and as a dollar         
amount representing the pro rata share of each Unit outstanding on the          
last business day of such calendar year; (3) the Bonds held and the             
number of Units of such Trust outstanding on the last business day of           
such calendar year; (4) the Redemption Price per Unit based upon the            
last computation thereof made during such calendar year; and (5) the            
amounts actually distributed during such calendar year from the Interest        
Account and from the Principal Account of such Trust, separately stated,        
expressed both as total dollar amounts and as dollar amounts per Unit           
outstanding on the Record Date for such distributions.                          

In order to comply with Federal and state tax reporting requirements,           
Unit holders will be furnished, upon request to the Trustee, evaluations        
of the Bonds in their Trust furnished to it by the Evaluator.                   

Each distribution statement will reflect pertinent information in               
respect of each plan of distribution so that Unit holders may be                
informed regarding the results of the other plan or plans of distribution.      

How May Units be Redeemed?                                                      

A Unit holder may redeem all or a portion of his Units by tender to the         
Trustee at its unit investment trust office in the City of New York of          
the certificates representing the Units to be redeemed, duly endorsed or        
accompanied by proper instruments of transfer with signature guaranteed         
as explained above (or by providing satisfactory indemnity, as in               
connection with lost, stolen or destroyed certificates), and payment of         
applicable governmental charges, if any. No redemption fee will be              
charged. On the third day following such tender, the Unit holder will be        
entitled to receive in cash an amount for each Unit equal to the                
Redemption Price per Unit next computed after receipt by the Trustee of         
such tender of Units. The "date of tender" is deemed to be the date on          
which Units are received by the Trustee (if such day is a day on which          
the New York Stock Exchange is open for trading), except that as regards        
Units received after the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange        
(generally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time or as of any earlier closing time on a        
day on which the New York Stock Exchange is scheduled in advance to             
close at such earlier time), the date of tender is the next day on which        
such Exchange is open for trading and such Units will be deemed to have         
been tendered to the Trustee on such day for redemption at the                  
redemption price computed on that day. Units so redeemed shall be               
cancelled.                                                                      

Purchased Interest (if any) and other accrued interest to the settlement        
date paid on redemption shall be withdrawn from the Interest Account of         
a Trust or, if the balance therein is insufficient, from the Principal          
Account of such Trust. All other amounts paid on redemption shall be            
withdrawn from the Principal Account of the Trust.                              

The Redemption Price per Unit will be determined on the basis of the bid        
price of the Bonds in a Trust and the amount of Purchased Interest of           
the Trust (if any), as of the close of trading on the New York Stock            
Exchange on the date any such determination is made. The Redemption Price       
per Unit is the pro rata share of each Unit determined by the Trustee on        
the basis of (1) the cash on hand in the Trust or moneys in the process         
of being collected, (2) the value of the Bonds in such Trust based on           
the bid prices of the Bonds, except for those cases in which the value          
of the insurance, if applicable, has been added, and (3) Purchased              

Page 23                                                                         

Interest (if any) and any other interest accrued thereon, less (a)              
amounts representing taxes or other governmental charges payable out of         
such Trust, (b) the accrued expenses of such Trust, and (c) cash held           
for distribution to Unit holders of record as of a date prior to the            
evaluation then being made. The Evaluator may determine the value of the        
Bonds in a Trust (1) on the basis of current bid prices of the Bonds            
obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds                  
comparable to those held by such Trust, (2) on the basis of bid prices          
for bonds comparable to any Bonds for which bid prices are not                  
available, (3) by determining the value of the Bonds by appraisal, or           
(4) by any combination of the above. In determining the Redemption Price        
per Unit for an Insured Trust, no value will be attributed to the               
portfolio insurance covering the Bonds in such Trust unless such Bonds          
are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant            
risk of such default. On the other hand, Bonds insured under a policy           
obtained by the Bond issuer, the underwriters, the Sponsor or others are        
entitled to the benefits of such insurance at all times and such                
benefits are reflected and included in the market value of such Bonds.          
See "Why and How are the Insured Trusts Insured?" For a description of          
the situations in which the evaluator may value the insurance obtained          
by an Insured Trust, see "Public Offering-How is the Public Offering
Price Determined?"                                                              

The difference between the bid and offering prices of such Bonds may be         
expected to average 1-2% of the principal amount. In the case of                
actively traded bonds, the difference may be as little as 1/2 of 1% and,        
in the case of inactively traded bonds, such difference usually will not        
exceed 3%. Therefore, the price at which Units may be redeemed could be         
less than the price paid by the Unit holder and may be less than the par        
value of the Securities represented by the Units so redeemed.                   

The Trustee is empowered to sell underlying Bonds in a Trust in order to        
make funds available for redemption. To the extent that Bonds are sold,         
the size and diversity of such Trust will be reduced. Such sales may be         
required at a time when Bonds would not otherwise be sold and might             
result in lower prices than might otherwise be realized.                        

The right of redemption may be suspended and payment postponed for any          
period during which the New York Stock Exchange is closed, other than           
for customary weekend and holiday closings, or during which the                 
Securities and Exchange Commission determines that trading on that              
Exchange is restricted or an emergency exists, as a result of which             
disposal or evaluation of the Bonds is not reasonably practicable, or           
for such other periods as the Securities and Exchange Commission may by         
order permit. Under certain extreme circumstances, the Sponsor may apply        
to the Securities and Exchange Commission for an order permitting a full        
or partial suspension of the right of Unit holders to redeem their Units.       

How May Units be Purchased by the Sponsor?                                      

The Trustee shall notify the Sponsor of any tender of Units for                 
redemption. If the Sponsor's bid in the secondary market at that time           
equals or exceeds the Redemption Price per Unit, which for certain              
Trusts includes Purchased Interest, it may purchase such Units by               
notifying the Trustee before 1:00 p.m. Eastern time on the next                 
succeeding business day and by making payment therefor to the Unit              
holder not later than the day on which the Units would otherwise have           
been redeemed by the Trustee. Units held by the Sponsor may be tendered         
to the Trustee for redemption as any other Units. Any profit or loss            
resulting from the resale or redemption of such Units will belong to the        
Sponsor.                                                                        

How May Bonds be Removed from the Fund?                                         

The Trustee is empowered to sell such of the Bonds in each Trust on a           
list furnished by the Sponsor as the Trustee in its sole discretion may         
deem necessary to meet redemption requests or pay expenses to the extent        
funds are unavailable. As described in the following paragraph and in           
certain other unusual circumstances for which it is determined by the           
Depositor to be in the best interests of the Unit holders or if there is        
no alternative, the Trustee is empowered to sell Bonds in a Trust which         
are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant            
risk of such default and for which value has been attributed to the             
insurance, if any, obtained by the Trust. See "Rights of Unit Holders-          
How May Units be Redeemed?" The Sponsor is empowered, but not obligated,        
to direct the Trustee to dispose of Bonds in a Trust in the event of            
advanced refunding. The Sponsor may from time to time act as agent for a        
Trust with respect to selling Bonds out of a Trust. From time to time,          
the Trustee may retain and pay compensation to the Sponsor subject to           
the restrictions under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.          

Page 24                                                                         

If any default in the payment of principal or interest on any Bond              
occurs and no provision for payment is made therefor, either pursuant to        
the portfolio insurance, if any, or otherwise, within thirty days, the          
Trustee is required to notify the Sponsor thereof. If the Sponsor fails         
to instruct the Trustee to sell or to hold such Bond within thirty days         
after notification by the Trustee to the Sponsor of such default, the           
Trustee may, in its discretion, sell the defaulted Bond and not be              
liable for any depreciation or loss thereby incurred.                           

The Sponsor shall instruct the Trustee to reject any offer made by an           
issuer of any of the Bonds to issue new obligations in exchange and             
substitution for any Bonds pursuant to a refunding or refinancing plan,         
except that the Sponsor may instruct the Trustee to accept such an offer        
or to take any other action with respect thereto as the Sponsor may deem        
proper if the issuer is in default with respect to such Bonds or in the         
written opinion of the Sponsor the issuer will probably default in              
respect to such Bonds in the foreseeable future. Any obligations so             
received in exchange or substitution will be held by the Trustee subject        
to the terms and conditions in the Indenture to the same extent as Bonds        
originally deposited thereunder. Within five days after the deposit of          
obligations in exchange or substitution for underlying Bonds, the               
Trustee is required to give notice thereof to each Unit holder of the           
affected Trust, identifying the Bonds eliminated and the Bonds                  
substituted therefor. Except as stated in this paragraph and under "What
is the First Trust Combined Series?" for Failed Bonds, the acquisition          
by a Trust of any securities other than the Bonds initially deposited is        
prohibited.

The Trustee is The Chase Manhattan Bank, with its principal executive           
office located at 270 Park Avenue, New York, New York 10017 and its unit

Page 25                                                                         

Limitations on Liabilities of Sponsor and Trustee                               

The Sponsor and the Trustee shall be under no liability to Unit holders         
for taking any action or for refraining from taking any action in good          
faith pursuant to the Indenture, or for errors in judgment, but shall be        
liable only for their own willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross                 
negligence (ordinary negligence in the case of the Trustee) or reckless         
disregard of their obligations and duties. The Trustee shall not be             
liable for depreciation or loss incurred by reason of the sale by the           
Trustee of any of the Bonds. In the event of the failure of the Sponsor         
to act under the Indenture, the Trustee may act thereunder and shall not        
be liable for any action taken by it in good faith under the Indenture.         

The Trustee shall not be liable for any taxes or other governmental             
charges imposed upon or in respect of the Bonds or upon the interest            
thereon or upon it as Trustee under the Indenture or upon or in respect         
of the Fund which the Trustee may be required to pay under any present          
or future law of the United States of America or of any other taxing            
authority having jurisdiction. In addition, the Indenture contains other        
customary provisions limiting the liability of the Trustee.                     

If the Sponsor shall fail to perform any of its duties under the                
Indenture or become incapable of acting or become bankrupt or its               
affairs are taken over by public authorities, then the Trustee may (a)          
appoint a successor Sponsor at rates of compensation deemed by the              
Trustee to be reasonable and not exceeding amounts prescribed by the            
Securities and Exchange Commission, or (b) terminate the Indenture and          
liquidate the Trusts as provided herein, or (c) continue to act as              
Trustee without terminating the Indenture.                                      

Who is the Evaluator?                                                           

The Evaluator is Securities Evaluation Service, Inc., 531 East Roosevelt        
Road, Suite 200, Wheaton, Illinois 60187. The Evaluator may resign or           
may be removed by the Sponsor and the Trustee, in which event the               
Sponsor and the Trustee are to use their best efforts to appoint a              
satisfactory successor. Such resignation or removal shall become                
effective upon the acceptance of appointment by the successor Evaluator.        
If upon resignation of the Evaluator no successor has accepted                  
appointment within thirty days after notice of resignation, the                 
Evaluator may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for the                
appointment of a successor.                                                     

The Trustee, Sponsor and Unit holders may rely on any evaluation                
furnished by the Evaluator and shall have no responsibility for the             
accuracy thereof. Determinations by the Evaluator under the Indenture           
shall be made in good faith upon the basis of the best information              
available to it, provided, however, that the Evaluator shall be under no        
liability to the Trustee, Sponsor or Unit holders for errors in                 
judgment. This provision shall not protect the Evaluator in any case of         
willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard          
of its obligations and duties.                                                  

OTHER INFORMATION       

How May the Indenture be Amended or Terminated?                                 

The Sponsor and the Trustee have the power to amend the Indenture               
without the consent of any of the Unit holders when such an amendment is        
(1) to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement any provision of          
the Indenture which may be defective or inconsistent with any other             
provision contained therein, or (2) to make such other provisions as            
shall not adversely affect the interest of the Unit holders (as                 
determined in good faith by the Sponsor and the Trustee), provided that         
the Indenture is not amended to increase the number of Units of any             
Trust issuable thereunder or to permit the deposit or acquisition of            
securities either in addition to or in substitution for any of the Bonds        
of any Trust initially deposited in a Trust, except for the substitution        
of certain refunding securities for Bonds or New Bonds for Failed Bonds.        
In the event of any amendment, the Trustee is obligated to notify               
promptly all Unit holders of the substance of such amendment.                   

Each Trust may be liquidated at any time by consent of 100% of the Unit         
holders of such Trust or by the Trustee when the value of such Trust, as        
shown by any evaluation, is less than 20% of the aggregate principal            
amount of the Bonds initially deposited in the Trust or by the Trustee          
in the event that Units of a Trust not yet sold aggregating more than           
60% of the Units of such Trust are tendered for redemption by the               
Underwriters, including the Sponsor. If a Trust is liquidated because of        
the redemption of unsold Units of the Trust by the Underwriters, the            

Page 26                                                                         

Sponsor will refund to each purchaser of Units of such Trust the entire         
sales charge paid by such purchaser. The Indenture will terminate upon          
the redemption, sale or other disposition of the last Bond held                 
thereunder, but in no event shall it continue beyond the Mandatory              
Termination Date as indicated in Part One for each Trust. In the event          
of termination, written notice thereof will be sent by the Trustee to           
all Unit holders of such Trust. Within a reasonable period after                
termination, the Trustee will sell any Bonds remaining in the Trust,            
and, after paying all expenses and charges incurred by such Trust, will         
distribute to each Unit holder of such Trust (including the Sponsor if          
it then holds any Units), upon surrender for cancellation of his                
Certificate for Units, his pro rata share of the balances remaining in          
the Interest and Principal Accounts of such Trust, all as provided in           
the Indenture.

DESCRIPTION OF BOND RATINGS*        

Standard & Poor's. A brief description of the applicable Standard &             
Poor's rating symbols and their meanings follow:                                

A Standard & Poor's corporate or municipal bond rating is a current             
assessment of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a              
specific debt obligation. This assessment may take into consideration           
obligors such as guarantors, insurers, or lessees.                              

The bond rating is not a recommendation to purchase, sell or hold a             
security, inasmuch as it does not comment as to market price or                 
suitability for a particular investor.                                          

The ratings are based on current information furnished by the issuer or         
obtained by Standard & Poor's from other sources it considers reliable.         
Standard & Poor's does not perform an audit in connection with any              
rating and may, on occasion, rely on unaudited financial information.           
The ratings may be changed, suspended or withdrawn as a result of               
changes in, or unavailability of, such information, or for other                
circumstances.                                                                  

The ratings are based, in varying degrees, on the following                     
considerations:                                                                 

l.   Likelihood of default-capacity and willingness of the obligor as to        
the timely payment of interest and repayment of principal in accordance         
with the terms of the obligation;                                               

ll.  Nature of and provisions of the obligation;                                

lll. Protection afforded by, and relative position of, the obligation in        
the event of bankruptcy, reorganization or other arrangements under the         
laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights.                  

AAA-Bonds rated AAA have the highest rating assigned by Standard &              
Poor's to a debt obligation. Capacity to pay interest and repay                 
principal is extremely strong.**                                                

AA-Bonds rated AA have a very strong capacity to pay interest and repay         
principal and differ from the highest rated issues only in small degree.        

A-Bonds rated A have a strong capacity to pay interest and repay                
principal although they are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse            
effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than bonds          
in higher rated categories.                                                     

BBB-Bonds rated BBB are regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay          
interest and repay principal. Whereas they normally exhibit adequate            
protection parameters, adverse economic conditions or changing                  
circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay             
interest and repay principal for bonds in this category than for bonds          
in higher rated categories.                                                     

Plus (+) or Minus (-): The ratings from "AA" to "BBB" may be modified by        
the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within           
the major rating categories.                                                    

Provisional Ratings: The letter "p" indicates that the rating is                
provisional. A provisional rating assumes the successful completion of          
the project being financed by the bonds being rated and indicates that          
payment of debt service requirements is largely or entirely dependent           
upon the successful and timely completion of the project. This rating,          
however, while addressing credit quality subsequent to completion of the        
project, makes no comment on the likelihood of, or the risk of default          
upon failure of, such completion. The investor should exercise his/her          
own judgment with respect to such likelihood and risk.                          

Credit Watch: Credit Watch highlights potential changes in ratings of           
bonds and other fixed income securities. It focuses on events and trends        
which place companies and government units under special surveillance by        
S&P's 180-member analytical staff. These may include mergers, voter             
referendums, actions by regulatory authorities, or developments gleaned         
from analytical reviews. Unless otherwise noted, a rating decision will         
be made within 90 days. Issues appear on Credit Watch where an event,           
situation, or deviation from trends occurred and needs to be evaluated          
as to its impact on credit ratings. A listing, however, does not mean a         
rating change is inevitable. Since S&P continuously monitors all of its         
ratings, Credit Watch is not intended to include all issues under               
review. Thus, rating changes will occur without issues appearing on             
Credit Watch.

Moody's Investors Service, Inc. A brief description of the applicable           
Moody's Investors Service, Inc. rating symbols and their meanings follow:       

Aaa-Bonds which are rated Aaa are judged to be of the best quality. They        
carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred         
to as "gilt edge." Interest payments are protected by a large or by an          
exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure. While the various          
protective elements are likely to change, such changes as can be                
visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position        
of such issues. Their safety is so absolute that with the occasional            
exception of oversupply in a few specific instances, characteristically,        
their market value is affected solely by money market fluctuations.             

Aa-Bonds which are rated Aa are judged to be of high quality by all             
standards. Together with the Aaa group they comprise what are generally         
known as high grade bonds. They are rated lower than the best bonds             
because margins of protection may not be as large as in Aaa securities          
or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or            
there may be other elements present which make the long term risks              
appear somewhat large than in Aaa securities. Their market value is             
virtually immune to all but money market influences, with the occasional        
exception of oversupply in a few specific instances.                            

A-Bonds which are rated A possess many favorable investment attributes          
and are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations. Factors             
giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate, but          
elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment            
sometime in the future. The market value of A-rated bonds may be                
influenced to some degree by economic performance during a sustained            
period of depressed business conditions, but, during periods of                 
normalcy, A-rated bonds frequently move in parallel with Aaa and Aa             
obligations, with the occasional exception of oversupply in a few               
specific instances.                                                             

A 1 and Baa 1-Bonds which are rated A 1 and Baa 1 offer the maximum in          
security within their quality group, can be bought for possible                 
upgrading in quality, and additionally, afford the investor an                  
opportunity to gauge more precisely the relative attractiveness of              
offerings in the market place.                                                  

Baa-Bonds which are rated Baa are considered as medium grade                    
obligations; i.e., they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured.        
Interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the present        
but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be                        
characteristically unreliable over any great length of time. Such bonds         
lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative        
characteristics as well. The market value of Baa-rated bonds is more            
sensitive to changes in economic circumstances, and aside from                  
occasional speculative factors applying to some bonds of this class, Baa        
market valuations will move in parallel with Aaa, Aa, and A obligations         
during periods of economic normalcy, except in instances of oversupply.         

Moody's bond rating symbols may contain numerical modifiers of a generic        
rating classification. The modifier 1 indicates that the bond ranks at          
the high end of its category; the modifier 2 indicates a mid-range              
ranking; and the modifier 3 indicates that the issue ranks in the lower         
end of its generic rating category.                                             

Con.(---)-Bonds for which the security depends upon the completion of           
some act or the fulfillment of some condition are rated conditionally.          
These are bonds secured by (a) earnings of projects under construction,         
(b) earnings of projects unseasoned in operation experience, (c) rentals        
which begin when facilities are completed, or (d) payments to which some        
other limiting condition attaches. Parenthetical rating denotes probable        
credit stature upon completion of construction or elimination of basis          
of condition.                                                                   

Fitch Investors Service, Inc. A brief description of the applicable             
Fitch Investors Service, Inc. rating symbols and their meanings follow:         

AAA-Bonds considered to be investment grade and of the highest credit           
quality. The obligor has an exceptionally strong ability to pay interest        
and repay principal, which is unlikely to be affected by reasonably             
foreseeable events.                                                             

AA-Bonds considered to be investment grade and of very high credit              
quality. The obligor's ability to pay interest and repay principal is           
very strong, although not quite as strong as bonds rated AAA. Bonds             
rated in the AAA and AA categories are not significantly vulnerable to          
foreseeable future developments.                                                

A-Bonds considered to be investment grade and of high credit quality.           
The obligor's ability to pay interest and repay principal is considered         
to be strong, but may be more vulnerable to adverse changes in economic         
conditions and circumstances than bonds with higher ratings.                    

BBB-Bonds considered to be investment grade and of satisfactory credit          
quality. The obligor's ability to pay interest and repay principal is           

Page 29                                                                         

considered to be adequate. Adverse changes in economic conditions and           
circumstances, however, are more likely to have adverse impact on these         
bonds, and therefore impair timely payment. The likelihood that the             
ratings of these bonds will fall below investment grade is higher than          
for bonds with higher ratings.                                                  

To provide more detailed indications of credit quality, the AA, A and           
BBB ratings may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to          
show relative standing within these major rating categories.

Federal Tax Status of Unit Holders                                              

At the respective times of issuance of the Bonds, opinions relating to          
the validity thereof and to the exclusion of interest thereon from              
Federal gross income were rendered by bond counsel to the respective            
issuing authorities. In addition, with respect to State Trusts, where           
applicable, bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions as        
to the exemption of interest on such Bonds when held by residents of the        
State in which the issuers of such Bonds are located, from State income         
taxes and certain state or local intangibles and local income taxes.            
Neither the Sponsor, Chapman and Cutler, nor any of the Special Counsel         
to the Fund for State tax matters have made any special review for the          
Fund of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the Bonds or of the         
bases for the opinions rendered in connection therewith. If the interest        
on a Bond should be determined to be taxable, the Bond would generally          
have to be sold at a substantial discount. In addition, investors could         
be required to pay income tax on interest received prior to the date on         
which interest is determined to be taxable.                                     

Gain realized on the sale or redemption of the Bonds by the Trustee or          
of a Unit by a Unit holder is includable in gross income for Federal            
income tax purposes and may be includable in gross income for state tax         
purposes. (Such gain does not include any amounts received in respect of        
accrued interest or accrued original issue discount, if any.) If a Bond         
is acquired with accrued interest, that portion of the price paid for           
the accrued interest is added to the tax basis of the Bond. When this           
accrued interest is received, it is treated as a return of capital and          
reduces the tax basis of the Bond. If a Bond is purchased for a premium,        
the amount of the premium is added to the tax basis of the Bond. Bond           
premium is amortized over the remaining term of the Bond, and the tax           
basis of the Bond is reduced each tax year by the amount of the premium         
amortized in that tax year.                                                     

For purposes of the following opinions, it is assumed that each asset of        
the Trust is debt the interest on which is excluded from gross income           
for Federal income tax purposes. At the time of the closing for each            
Trust, Chapman and Cutler, Counsel for the Sponsor, rendered an opinion         
under then existing law substantially to the effect that:                       

(1)   the Trusts are not associations taxable as corporations for               
Federal income tax purposes and interest and accrued original issue             
discount on Bonds which is excludable from gross income under the               
Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code") will retain its status for           
Federal income tax purposes, when received by the Trusts and distributed        
to a Unit holder; however, such interest may be taken into account in           
computing the alternative minimum tax and the additional tax on branches        
of foreign corporations and the environmental tax (the "Superfund Tax"),        
as noted below. See "Certain Tax Matters Applicable to Corporate Unit
Holders";                                                                       

ALL PARTS OF THE PROSPECTUS SHOULD BE RETAINED FOR FUTURE REFERENCE.            
THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN APPROVED OR DISAPPROVED BY THE SECURITIES        
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION NOR HAS THE COMMISSION PASSED UPON THE ACCURACY         
OR ADEQUACY OF THIS PROSPECTUS. ANY REPRESENTATION TO THE CONTRARY IS A         
CRIMINAL OFFENSE.                                                               

Page 1                                                                          

(2)   each Unit holder is considered to be the owner of a pro rata              
portion of each asset of the respective Trust under subpart E,                  
subchapter J of chapter 1 of the Code and will have a taxable event when        
the Trust disposes of a Bond, or when the Unit holder redeems or sells          
his Units. If the Unit holder disposes of a Unit, he is deemed thereby          
to have disposed of his entire pro rata interest in all assets of the           
Trust involved including his pro rata portion of all the Bonds                  
represented by the Unit. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (the "1997             
Act") includes provisions that treat certain transactions designed to           
reduce or eliminate risk of loss and opportunities for gain (e.g. short         
sales, offsetting notional principal contracts, futures or forward              
contracts or similar transactions) as constructive sales for purposes of        
recognition of gain (but not loss) and for purposes of determining the          
holding period. Unit holders should consult their own tax advisors with         
regard to any such constructive sale rules. Unit holders must reduce the        
tax basis of their Units for their share of accrued interest received by        
the respective Trust, if any, on Bonds before the date the Trust                
acquired ownership of the Bonds (and the amount of this reduction may           
exceed the amount of accrued interest paid to the seller) and,                  
consequently, such Unit holders may have an increase in taxable gain or         
reduction in capital loss upon the disposition of such Units. Gain or           
loss upon the sale or redemption of Units is measured by comparing the          
proceeds of such sale or redemption with the adjusted basis of the              
Units. If the Trustee disposes of Bonds (whether by sale, payment on            
maturity, redemption or otherwise), gain or loss is recognized to the           
Unit holder (subject to various non-recognition provisions of the Code).        
The amount of any such gain or loss is measured by comparing the Unit           
holder's pro rata share of the total proceeds from such disposition with        
the Unit holder's basis for his or her fractional interest in the asset         
disposed of. In the case of a Unit holder who purchases Units, such             
basis (before adjustment for accrued original issue discount and                
amortized bond premium, if any) is determined by apportioning the cost          
of the Units among each of the Trust assets ratably according to value          
as of the valuation date nearest the date of acquisition of the Units.          
Unit holders should consult their own tax advisers with regard to the           
calculation of basis. The tax basis reduction requirements of the Code          
relating to amortization of bond premium may, under some circumstances,         
result in the Unit holder realizing a taxable gain when his Units are           
sold or redeemed for an amount equal to or less than his original cost;         
and                                                                             

(3)  any insurance proceeds paid under individual policies obtained by          
issuers of Bonds which represent maturing interest on defaulted Bonds           
held by the Trustee will be excludable from Federal gross income if, and        
to the same extent as, such interest would have been so excludable if           
paid in the normal course by the issuer of the defaulted Bonds provided         
that, at the time such policies are purchased, the amounts paid for such        
policies are reasonable, customary and consistent with the reasonable           
expectation that the issuer of the Bonds, rather than the insurer, will         
pay debt service on the Bonds.                                                  

Sections 1288 and 1272 of the Code provide a complex set of rules               
governing the accrual of original issue discount. These rules provide           
that original issue discount accrues either on the basis of a constant          
compound interest rate or ratably over the term of the Bond, depending          
on the date the Bond was issued. In addition, special rules apply if the        
purchase price of a Bond exceeds the original issue price plus the              
amount of original issue discount which would have previously accrued           
based upon its issue price (its "adjusted issue price") to prior owners.        
If a Bond is acquired with accrued interest, that portion of the price          
paid for the accrued interest is added to the tax basis of the Bond.            
When this accrued interest is received, it is treated as a return of            
capital and reduces the tax basis of the Bond. If a Bond is purchased           
for a premium, the amount of the premium is added to the tax basis of           
the Bond. Bond premium is amortized over the remaining term of the Bond,        
and the tax basis of the Bond is reduced each tax year by the amount of         
the premium amortized in that tax year. The application of these rules          
will also vary depending on the value of the Bond on the date a Unit            
holder acquires his Unit, and the price the Unit holder pays for his            
Unit. Unit holders should consult their tax advisers regarding these            
rules and their application. See "Portfolio" appearing in Part One for          
each Trust for information relating to Bonds, if any, issued at an              
original issue discount.                                                        

The Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993 (the "Tax Act") subjects tax-            
exempt bonds to the market discount rules of the Code effective for             
bonds purchased after April 30, 1993. In general, market discount is the        
amount (if any) by which the stated redemption price at maturity exceeds        
an investor's purchase price (except to the extent that such difference,        

Page 2                                                                          

if any, is attributable to original issue discount not yet accrued),            
subject to statutory de minimis rule. Market discount can arise based on        
the price a Trust pays for Bonds or the price a Unit holder pays for his        
or her Units. Under the Tax Act, accretion of market discount is taxable        
as ordinary income; under prior law the accretion had been treated as           
capital gain. Market discount that accretes while a Trust holds a Bond          
would be recognized as ordinary income by the Unit holders when                 
principal payments are received on the Bond, upon sale or at redemption         
(including early redemption) or upon the sale or redemption of his or           
her Units, unless a Unit holder elects to include market discount in            
taxable income as it accrues. The market discount rules are complex and         
Unit holders should consult their tax advisers regarding these rules and        
their application.                                                              

Counsel for the Sponsor has also advised that under Section 265 of the          
Code, interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or             
carry Units of a Trust is not deductible for Federal income tax                 
purposes. The Internal Revenue Service has taken the position that such         
indebtedness need not be directly traceable to the purchase or carrying         
of Units (however, these rules generally do not apply to interest paid          
on indebtedness incurred to purchase or improve a personal residence).          
Also, under Section 265 of the Code, certain financial institutions that        
acquire Units generally would not be able to deduct any of the interest         
expense attributable to ownership of Units. Legislative proposals have          
been made that would extend the financial institution rules to certain          
other corporations including securities dealers and other financial             
intermediaries. Investors with questions regarding these issues should          
consult with their tax advisers.                                                

In the case of certain of the Bonds in a Trust, the opinions of bond            
counsel indicate that interest on such Bonds received by a "substantial         
user" of the facilities being financed with the proceeds of these Bonds,        
or persons related thereto, for periods while such Bonds are held by            
such a user or related person, will not be excludable from Federal gross        
income, although interest on such Bonds received by others would be             
excludable from Federal gross income. "Substantial user" and "related           
person" are defined under the Code and U.S. Treasury Regulations. Any           
person who believes he or she may be a substantial user or related              
person as so defined should contact his tax adviser.                            

ALL STATEMENTS OF LAW IN THE PROSPECTUS CONCERNING EXCLUSION FROM GROSS         
INCOME FOR FEDERAL, STATE OR OTHER TAX PURPOSES ARE THE OPINIONS OF             
COUNSEL AND ARE TO BE SO CONSTRUED.                                             

At the respective times of issuance of the Bonds, opinions relating to          
the validity thereof and to the exclusion of interest thereon from              
Federal gross income are rendered by bond counsel to the respective             
issuing authorities. Neither the Sponsor nor Chapman and Cutler has made        
any special review for the Fund of the proceedings relating to the              
issuance of the Bonds or of the basis for such opinions.                        

In general, Section 86 of the Code provides that 50% of Social Security         
benefits are includable in gross income to the extent that the sum of           
"modified adjusted gross income" plus 50% of the Social Security                
benefits received exceeds the "base amount." The base amount is $25,000         
for unmarried taxpayers, $32,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint           
return and zero for married taxpayers who do not live apart at all times        
during the taxable year and who file separate returns. Modified adjusted        
gross income is adjusted gross income determined without regard to              
certain otherwise allowable deductions and exclusions from gross income         
and by including tax-exempt interest. To the extent that Social Security        
benefits are includible in gross income, they will be treated as any            
other item of gross income.                                                     

In addition, under the Tax Act, for taxable years beginning after               
December 31 1993, up to 85% of Social Security benefits are includible          
in gross income to the extent that the sum of "modified adjusted gross          
income" plus 50% of Social Security benefits received exceeds an                
"adjusted base amount." The adjusted base amount is $34,000 for                 
unmarried taxpayers, $44,000 for married taxpayers filing a joint               
return, and zero for married taxpayers who do not live apart at all             
times during the taxable year and who file separate returns.                    

Although tax-exempt interest is included in modified adjusted gross             
income solely for the purpose of determining what portion, if any, of           
Social Security benefits will be included in gross income, no tax-exempt        
interest, including that received from a Trust, will be subject to tax.         
A taxpayer whose adjusted gross income already exceeds the base amount          
or the adjusted base amount must include 50% or 85%, respectively, of           
his Social Security benefits in gross income whether or not he receives         
any tax-exempt interest. A taxpayer whose modified adjusted gross income        
(after inclusion of tax-exempt interest) does not exceed the base amount        
need not include any Social Security benefits in gross income.                  

Page 3                                                                          

For purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax for individuals           
and corporations, interest on certain private activity bonds (which             
includes most industrial and housing revenue bonds) issued on or after          
August 8, 1986 is included as an item of tax preference. EXCEPT AS              
OTHERWISE NOTED IN PART ONE FOR CERTAIN TRUSTS, THE TRUSTS DO NOT               
INCLUDE ANY SUCH PRIVATE ACTIVITY BONDS ISSUED ON OR AFTER THAT DATE.           

For taxpayers other than corporations, net capital gains (which is              
defined as net long-term capital gain over net short-term capital loss          
for the taxable year) are subject to a maximum marginal stated tax rate         
of either 28% or 20%, depending upon the holding period of the capital          
assets. Capital gain or loss is long-term if the holding period for the         
asset is more than one year, and is short-term if the holding period for        
the asset is one year or less. Generally, capital gain realized from            
assets held for more than one year but not more than 18 months are taxed        
at a maximum marginal stated tax rate of 28% and capital gains realized         
from assets (with certain exclusions) held for more than 18 months are          
taxed at a maximum marginal stated tax rate of 20% (10% in the case of          
certain taxpayers in the lowest tax bracket). Further, capital gains            
realized from assets held for one year or less are taxed at the same            
rate as ordinary income. Legislation is currently pending that provides         
the appropriate methodology that should be applied in netting the               
realized capital gains and losses. Such legislation is proposed to be           
effective retroactively for tax years ending after May 6, 1997. The date        
on which a Unit is acquired (i.e., the "trade date") is excluded for            
purposes of determining the holding period of the Unit. It should be            
noted that legislative proposals are introduced from time to time that          
affect tax rates and could affect relative differences at which ordinary        
income and capital gains are taxed.                                             

In addition, please note that capital gains may be recharacterized as           
ordinary income in the case of certain financial transactions that are          
considered "conversion transactions" effective for transactions entered         
into after April 30, 1993. Unit holders and prospective investors should        
consult with their tax advisers regarding the potential effect of this          
provision on their investment in Units.                                         

Under the Code, taxpayers must disclose to the Internal Revenue Service         
the amount of tax-exempt interest earned during the year.                       

Certain Tax Matters Applicable to Corporate Unit Holders. In the case of        
certain corporations, the alternative minimum tax and the Superfund Tax         
for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1986 depend upon the             
corporation's alternative minimum taxable income ("AMTI"), which is the         
corporation's taxable income with certain adjustments. One of the               
adjustment items used in computing AMTI of a corporation (other than an         
S Corporation, Regulated Investment Company, Real Estate Investment             
Trust, or REMIC) is an amount equal to 75% of the excess of such                
corporation's "adjusted current earnings" over an amount equal to its           
AMTI (before such adjustment item and the alternative tax net operating         
loss deduction). "Adjusted current earnings" includes all tax-exempt            
interest, including interest on all of the Bonds in the Trusts. Under           
current Code provisions, the Superfund Tax does not apply to tax years          
beginning on or after January 1, 1996. Legislative proposals have been          
introduced that would reinstate the Superfund Tax for taxable years             
beginning after December 31, 1997 and before January 1, 2009. Under the         
provisions of Section 884 of the Code, a branch profits tax is levied on        
the "effectively connected earnings and profits" of certain foreign             
corporations which include tax-exempt interest such as interest on the          
Bonds in the Trust. Unit holders should consult their tax advisers with         
respect to the particular tax consequences to them, including the               
corporate alternative minimum tax, the Superfund Tax and the branch             
profits tax imposed by Section 884 of the Code.                                 

Ownership of the Units may result in collateral federal income tax              
consequences to certain taxpayers, including, without limitation,               
corporations, subject to the branch profits tax, financial institutions,        
certain insurance companies, certain S corporations, individual                 
recipients of Social Security or Railroad Retirement benefits and               
taxpayers who may be deemed to have incurred (or continued) indebtedness        
to purchase or carry tax-exempt obligations. Prospective investors              
should consult their tax advisers as to the applicability of any such           
collateral consequences.                                                        

At the time of the closing, Winston & Strawn (previously named Cole &           
Deitz), Special Counsel to Series 4-125 of the Fund for New York tax            
matters, rendered an opinion under then existing income tax laws of the         
State and City of New York, substantially to the effect that each Trust         
in Series 4-125 of the Fund is not an association taxable as a                  
corporation and the income of each Trust in Series 4-125 of the Fund            

Page 4                                                                          

will be treated as the income of the Unit holder in the same manner as          
for Federal income tax purposes (subject to differences in accounting           
for discount and premium to the extent the State and/or City of New York        
do not conform to current Federal law).                                         

At the time of the closing, Carter, Ledyard & Milburn, Special Counsel          
to the Fund for New York tax matters for Series 126 and subsequent              
Series of the Fund, rendered an opinion under then existing income tax          
laws of the State and City of New York, substantially to the effect that        
each Trust will not constitute an association taxable as a corporation          
under New York law, and accordingly will not be subject to the New York         
State franchise tax or the New York City general corporation tax. Under         
the income tax laws of the State and City of New York, the income of            
each Trust will be considered the income of the holders of the Units.           

All statements in the Prospectus concerning exclusion from gross income         
for Federal, state or other are the opinions of Counsel and are to be so        
construed.                                                                      

New York Tax Status of Unit Holders                                             

At the time of the closing for Series 1, 2 and 3 of The First Trust             
Combined Series; Series 1-9 of The First Trust of Insured Municipal             
Bonds-Multi-State; and all Series of the New York Trust included in a           
Series of The First Trust of Insured Municipal Bonds-New York; Booth &          
Baron, Special Counsel to these Series for New York tax matters,                
rendered an opinion under then existing New York income tax law                 
applicable to taxpayers whose income is subject to New York income              
taxation substantially to the effect that:                                      

Each New York Trust is not an association taxable as a corporation, and         
the income of a New York Trust will be treated as the income of the Unit        
holders under the existing income tax laws of the State and City of New         
York, in the same manner as for Federal income tax purposes (subject to         
differences in accounting for discount and premium to the extent the            
State and/or City of New York do not conform to current Federal law).           

Individuals holding Units of a New York Insured Trust who reside in New         
York State or City will not be subject to State and City personal income        
tax on interest income which is excludable from Federal gross income            
under section 103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and derived from         
any obligation of New York State or a political subdivision thereof, or         
of the Government of Puerto Rico or a political subdivision thereof, or         
of the Government of Guam or by its authority, although they will be            
subject to New York State and City personal income tax with respect to          
any gains realized when such obligations are sold, redeemed or paid at          
maturity or when any such Units are sold or redeemed; and                       

For individuals holding Units of a New York Trust who reside in New York        
State or City, any proceeds paid to the Trustee under the applicable            
insurance policies which represent maturing interest on defaulted               
obligations held by the Trustee will not be subject to New York State or        
City personal income tax if, and to the same extent as, such interest           
would not have been subject to New York State or City personal income           
tax if paid by the issuer of the defaulted obligations.                         

For information with respect to the Federal income tax status and other         
matters, see "What is the Federal Tax Status of Unit Holders?"                  

Certain Considerations                                                          

Each New York Trust includes obligations issued by New York State (the          
"State"), by its various public bodies (the "Agencies"), and/or by other        
entities located within the State, including the City of New York (the          
"City").                                                                        

Some of the more significant events and conditions relating to the              
financial situation in New York are summarized below. This section              
provides only a brief summary of the complex factors affecting the              
financial situation in New York and is derived from sources that are            
generally available to investors and is believed to be accurate. It is          
based in part on Official Statements and prospectuses issued by, and on         
other information reported by the State, the City, and the Agencies in          
connection with the issuance of their respective securities.                    

There can be no assurance that current or future statewide or regional          
economic difficulties, and the resulting impact on State or local               
government finances generally, will not adversely affect the market             
value of New York Municipal Obligations held in the portfolios of the           
Trusts or the ability of particular obligors to make timely payments of         
debt service on (or relating to) those obligations.                             

Page 5                                                                          

(1) The State: The State has historically been one of the wealthiest            
states in the nation. For decades, however, the State economy has grown         
more slowly than that of the nation as a whole, gradually eroding the           
State's relative economic affluence. Statewide, urban centers have              
experienced significant changes involving migration of the more affluent        
to the suburbs and an influx of generally less affluent residents.              
Regionally, the older Northeast cities have suffered because of the             
relative success that the South and the West have had in attracting             
people and business. The City has also had to face greater competition          
as other major cities have developed financial and business capabilities        
which make them less dependent on the specialized services traditionally        
available almost exclusively in the City.                                       

The State has for many years had a very high state and local tax burden         
relative to other states. The burden of State and local taxation, in            
combination with the many other causes of regional economic dislocation,        
has contributed to the decisions of some businesses and individuals to          
relocate outside, or not locate within, the State. However, the State's         
1995-96 budget reflected significant actions to reduce the burden of            
State taxation, including adoption of a 3-year, 20% reduction in the            
State's personal income tax. During 1996-97, New York led the nation in         
tax cuts, at 54.1%, bringing the total value of tax reductions in effect        
for the 1997 year to over $6 billion. Annual savings are intended to            
grow to $12 billion by 2001-02. When measured as a percentage of                
personal income, state-imposed taxes in New York should be below the            
national median in 1998. The budget for fiscal year 1998-99 proposes an         
additional $700 million in tax reductions.                                      

Slowdown of Regional Economy. A national recession commenced in mid-            
1990. Economic recovery started considerably later in the State than in         
the nation as a whole due in part to the significant retrenchment in the        
banking and financial services industries, downsizing by several major          
corporations, cutbacks in defense spending, and an oversupply of office         
buildings. In the last few years, New York has shown signs of economic          
resurgence. New York has gone from last in the nation in percentage of          
private sector employment growth to a level that is on par with the             
national average, gaining 250,000 private sector jobs since December            
1994. Overall employment growth was close to 1.4% for 1997. National            
employment growth in 1997 was estimated at 2.3%. The New York economy in        
1998 is expected to grow at about the same rate as in 1997. Many                
uncertainties exist in forecasts of both the national and State                 
economies and there can be no assurance that the State economy will             
perform at a level sufficient to meet the State's projections of                
receipts and disbursements. Personal income is expected to increase 6.1%        
in 1997 and 4.5% in 1998.                                                       

1997-98 Fiscal Year. The 1997-98 General Fund Financial Plan continues          
to be balanced, with a projected surplus of $1.83 billion. This will be         
the third consecutive budget surplus generated by the Governor's                
administration. Of this amount, $700 million is being used to finance           
one-time costs related to an extra 27th payroll and 53rd Medicaid cycle         
($282 million) due to the cyclical timing of these payments and to              
provide "hard-dollar" financing for capital projects of the Community           
Enhancement Facilities Assistance Program which were previously                 
anticipated to be supported with bond proceeds. Proposed tax cut                
accelerations account for the use of another $685 million of the                
surplus. Of the remainder, $365 million is being used to finance 1998-99        
Executive Budget recommendations, and $68 million is being deposited            
into the Tax Stabilization Reserve Fund (the State's "rainy day" fund)          
as provided by the Constitution. This is the third consecutive                  
extraordinary deposit in the rainy day fund and increases the size of           
that fund to $400 million by the end of 1997-98, the highest balance            
ever achieved.                                                                  

The surplus results primarily from growth in projected receipts. As             
compared to the enacted budget, revenues increased by $1.28 billion,            
while disbursements increased by only $565 million. These changes from          
Mid-Year Financial Plan projections reflect actual results through              
December 1997 as well as modified economic and caseload projections for         
the balance of the fiscal year.                                                 

The General Fund is projected to be balanced on a cash basis for the            
1997-98 fiscal year. Total receipts and transfers from other funds are          
projected to be $35.197 billion, an increase of $216 billion from total         
receipts in the prior fiscal year. Total General Fund disbursements and         
transfers to other funds are projected to be $35.165 billion, an                
increase of $2.26 billion from the total amount disbursed in the prior          
fiscal year.                                                                    

The General Fund closing balance is expected to be $465 million at the          
end of 1997-98. Of this amount, $400 million will be on deposit in the          
Tax Stabilization Reserve Fund (TSRF), while another $65 million will be

on deposit in the Contingency Reserve Fund (CRF) after a $24 million            
deposit in 1997-98. The TSRF had an opening balance of $317 million to          
be supplemented by a required payment of $15 million and an                     
extraordinary maximum deposit of $68 million from surplus 1997-98 monies.       

In recent years, State actions affecting the level of receipts and              
disbursements, as well as the relative strength of the State and                
regional economy, actions of the Federal government and other factors,          
have created structural gaps for the State. These gaps resulted from a          
significant disparity between recurring revenues and the costs of               
maintaining or increasing the level of support for State programs. As           
noted, the 1997-98 enacted budget combines significant tax and program          
reductions which will, in the current and future years, lower both the          
recurring receipts base (before the effect of any economic stimulus from        
such tax reductions) and the historical annual growth in State program          
spending. Notwithstanding these changes, the State can expect to                
continue to confront structural deficits in future years.                       

One major uncertainty to the 1997-98 State Financial Plan continues to          
be risks related to the economy and tax collections, which could produce        
either favorable or unfavorable variances during the balance of the             
year. It is possible that recent changes could produce slower economic          
growth and a deterioration in State receipts. An additional risk to the         
1997-98 State Financial Plan arises from the potential impact of certain        
litigation now pending against the State, which could produce adverse           
effects on the State's projections of receipts and disbursements.               

1998-99 Fiscal Year. General Fund receipts in 1998-99 will reflect the          
initial phases of the STAR property tax reduction program as well as the        
continuing impact of other 1997 and earlier tax reduction                       
accomplishments. In addition, the 1998-99 budget reflects several tax           
reduction proposals that will reduce receipts available to the General          
Fund by about $700 million during the fiscal year. Recurring growth in          
the State General Fund tax base is projected to be nearly 6% during 1998-       
99. That growth rate is lower than that achieved in 1996-97 or currently        
estimated for 1997-98 and roughly equivalent to the rate experienced in         
1995-96. Total General Fund receipts for 1998-99 are projected at $36.22        
billion, an increase of more than $1 billion from the revised 1997-98           
estimate. The largest source of receipts is the sales and use tax which         
accounts for nearly 80% of projected receipts.                                  

Total General Fund spending in the 1998-99 Executive Budget is projected        
to increase $1.02 billion of 2.89% from the current year. The average           
annual increase since 1994-95 is 1.85%. This rate is below the rate of          
inflation and much lower than the average annual increase of 5.4% prior         
to 1994-95. Education's recommended share of General Fund spending is           
30% in 1998-99 and criminal justice spending is 6.5%. Medicaid and              
welfare spending growth has been reduced, reflecting Medicaid and               
welfare reforms implemented since 1995.                                         

The 1998-99 Financial Plan includes approximately $62 million in non-           
recurring resources, the lowest projected level ever recorded. In fiscal        
year 1986-87 through 1994-95, the average annual level of one-timers was        
approximately $819 million.                                                     

The projected 1998-99 closing fund balance of $500 million in the               
General Fund is composed of monies available in the TSRF and the CRF. An        
additional deposit of $35 million will supplement the $65 million               
balance in the CRF, increasing that amount available for possible               
litigation risks to $100 million in 1998-99.                                    

On November 16, 1993, the Court of Appeals, the State's highest court,          
affirmed the decision of a lower court in three actions, which declared         
unconstitutional State actuarial funding methods for determining State          
and local contributions to the State employee retirement system.                
Following the decision, the State Comptroller developed a plan to phase         
in a constitutional funding method and to restore prior funding levels          
of the retirement systems over a four-year period. The plan is not              
expected to require the State to make additional contributions with             
respect to the 1993-94 fiscal year nor to materially and adversely              
affect the State's financial condition thereafter. Through fiscal year          
1998-99, the State expects to contribute $643 million more to the               
retirement plans than would have been required under the prior funding          
method.                                                                         

Future Fiscal Years. There can be no assurance that the State will not          
face substantial potential budget gaps in the future resulting from a           
significant disparity between tax revenues projected from a lower               
recurring receipts base and the spending required to maintain State             
programs at current levels. To address any potential budgetary                  
imbalance, the State may need to take significant actions to align              
recurring receipts and disbursements.                                           

Indebtedness. As of March 31, 1997, the total amount of long-term State         
general obligation debt authorized but unissued stood at $2.767 billion.        

Page 7                                                                          

As of the same date, the State had approximately $5.03 billion in               
outstanding general obligation debt, including $294 million of Bond             
Anticipation Notes ("BANS") outstanding.                                        

As of March 31, 1997, $22.499 billion of bonds, issued in connection            
with lease-purchase and contractual obligation financings of State              
capital programs, were outstanding. The total amount of outstanding             
State-supported debt as of March 31, 1997 was $32.766 billion. As of            
March 31, 1997, total State-related debt (which includes the State-             
supported debt, moral obligation and certain other financings and State-        
guaranteed debt) was $37.114 billion.                                           

The State anticipates that its borrowings for capital purposes during           
the State's 1997-98 fiscal year will consist of $605 million in general         
obligation bonds and BANS and $140 million in general obligation                
commercial paper. The Legislature has also authorized the issuance of           
$311 million in certificates of participation (including costs of               
issuance, reserve funds and other costs) during the State's 1997-98             
fiscal year for equipment purchases. The projection of the State                
regarding its borrowings for the 1997-98 fiscal year may change if              
actual receipts fall short of State projections or if other                     
circumstances require.                                                          

In June 1990, legislation was enacted creating the New York Local               
Government Assistance Corporation ("LGAC"), a public benefit corporation        
empowered to issue long-term obligations to fund certain payments to            
local governments traditionally funded through the State's annual               
seasonal borrowing. As of June, 1995, LGAC had issued bonds and notes to        
provide net proceeds of $4.7 billion, and has been authorized to issue          
its bonds to provide net proceeds of up to $529 million during the              
State's 1995-96 fiscal year to redeem notes sold in June 1995. The LGAC         
program was completed in 1995-96 with the issuance of the last                  
installment of authorized bond sales. As of March 31, 1997, $5.239              
billion remained outstanding of the LGAC.                                       

Ratings. Moody's rating of the State's general obligation bonds is Aa2,         
and S&P's rating is A. Previously, Moody's lowered its rating to A on           
June 6, 1990, its rating having been A1 since May 27, 1986. S&P's               
previous rating was A- on January 13, 1992. S&P's ratings were A from           
March 1990 to January 1992, AA- from August 1987 to March 1990 and A+           
from November 1982 to August 1987.                                              

(2) The City and the Municipal Assistance Corporation ("MAC"): The City         
accounts for approximately 41% of the State's population and personal           
income, and the City's financial health affects the State in numerous           
ways.                                                                           

In response to the City's fiscal crisis in 1975, the State took a number        
of steps to assist the City in returning to fiscal stability. Among             
other actions, the State Legislature (i) created MAC to assist with long-       
term financing for the City's short-term debt and other cash                    
requirements and (ii) created the State Financial Control Board (the            
"Control Board") to review and approve the City's budgets and City four-        
year financial plans (the financial plans also apply to certain City-           
related public agencies (the "Covered Organizations")).                         

From 1993 to 1996, the rate of economic growth in the City slowed               
substantially. The City's economic improvement significantly accelerated        
in fiscal year 1997, resulting in an unusually high, across-the-board           
increase in tax receipts. Much of the increase can be traced to the             
performance of the securities industry, but the City's economy has              
produced gains in retail trade, tourism, and in business services. In           
1997, the City experienced the largest private sector job growth in the         
last 13 years.                                                                  

Pursuant to State law, the City prepares a four-year annual financial           
plan, which is reviewed and revised on a quarterly basis and which              
includes the City's capital, revenue and expense projections. The City          
is required to submit its financial plans to review bodies, including           
the Control Board. If the City were to experience certain adverse               
financial circumstances, including the occurrence or the substantial            
likelihood and imminence of the occurrence of an annual operating               
deficit of more than $100 million or the loss of access to the public           
credit markets to satisfy the City's capital and seasonal financial             
requirements, the Control Board would be required by State law to               
exercise certain powers, including prior approval of City financial             
plans, proposed borrowings and certain contracts.                               

The City depends on the State for State aid both to enable the City to          
balance its budget and to meet its cash requirements. If the State              
experiences revenue shortfalls or spending increases beyond its                 
projections during its 1997-98 fiscal year or subsequent years, such            
developments could result in reductions in projected State aid to the           
City. In addition, there can be no assurance that State budgets in              
future fiscal years will be adopted by the April 1 statutory deadline           

Page 8                                                                          

and that there will not be adverse effects on the City's cash flow and          
additional City expenditures as a result of such delays.                        

The Mayor is responsible for preparing the City's four-year financial           
plan, including the City's current financial plan. The City projections         
set forth in its financial plan are based on various assumptions and            
contingencies which are uncertain and which may not materialize. Changes        
in major assumptions could significantly affect the City's ability to           
balance its budget as required by State law and to meet its annual cash         
flow and financing requirements. Such assumptions and contingencies             
include the condition of the regional and local economies, the absence          
of wage increases in excess of the increases assumed in its financial           
plan, employment growth, provision of State and Federal aid and mandate         
relief, State legislative approval of future State budgets, levels of           
education expenditures as may be required by State law, adoption of             
future City budgets by the New York City Council, and approval by the           
Governor or the State Legislature and the cooperation of MAC with               
respect to various other actions proposed in such financial plan.               

Attaining a balanced budget is also dependent upon the City's ability to        
market its securities successfully in the public credit markets. The            
City's financing program for fiscal years 1996 through 1999 contemplates        
the issuance of $9.7 billion of general obligation bonds primarily to           
reconstruct and rehabilitate the City's infrastructure and physical             
assets and to make capital investments. In addition, the City issues            
revenue and tax anticipation notes to finance its seasonal working              
capital requirements. The terms and success of projected public sales of        
City general obligation bonds and notes will be subject to prevailing           
market conditions at the time of the sale, and no assurance can be given        
that the credit markets will absorb the projected amounts of public bond        
and note sales. Future developments concerning the City and public              
discussion of such developments, the City's future financial needs and          
other issues may affect the market for outstanding City general                 
obligation bonds and notes. If the City were unable to sell its general         
obligation bonds and notes, it would be prevented from meeting its              
planned operating and capital expenditures.                                     

1996-99 Financial Plan. On July 11, 1995, the City submitted to the             
Control Board the 1996-99 Financial Plan, which relates to the City, the        
Board of Education and the City University of New York. The 1996-99             
Financial Plan is based on the City's expense and capital budgets for           
the City's 1996 fiscal year, which were adopted on June 14, 1995, and           
sets forth proposed actions by the City for the 1996 fiscal year to             
close substantial projected budget gaps resulting from lower than               
projected tax receipts and other revenues and greater than projected            
expenditures. In addition to substantial proposed agency expenditure            
reductions and productivity, efficiency and labor initiatives negotiated        
with the City's labor unions, the 1996-99 Financial Plan reflects a             
strategy to substantially reduce spending for entitlements for the 1996         
and subsequent fiscal years.                                                    

1998-2002 Financial Plan. In January, 1998, the New York City mayor             
announced the City's Financial Plan for Fiscal Years 1998-2002. For the         
second year in a row, the New York City four-year financial plan                
contains a record surplus of more than $1 billion. Since the adoption of        
the fiscal year 1998 budget, the City is now forecasting additional             
resources of $3.1 billion. Approximately 73% will be used to reduce the         
out-year gaps, 19% will fund targeted educational, public safety and            
other initiatives, and 8% will be used to reduce taxes further.                 

To reduce the out-year gaps, the City has imposed fiscal discipline on          
the rate of growth of City spending which has, over the last four years,        
been held below the rate of inflation. For fiscal year 1999, the                
proposed City-funded spending increase will be held to 0.6%. The budget         
stabilization account, established for the first time in 1997, will be          
maintained in fiscal year 1999 at $210 million with an additional $210          
million created for fiscal year 2000. As a result of this fiscal                
planning, the out-year gaps have been cut in half compared to six years         
ago: fiscal year 1993 was $13.3 billion and fiscal year 1998 is $6.75           
billion.                                                                        

According to recent staff reports, while economic recovery in New York          
City has been slower than in other regions of the country, a surge in           
Wall Street profitability resulted in increased tax revenues and                
generated a substantial surplus for the City in City fiscal year 1996-          
97. Although several sectors of the City's economy have expanded                
recently, especially tourism and business and professional services,            
City tax revenues remain heavily dependent on the continued                     
profitability of the securities industry and the course of the national         
economy. These reports have also indicated that recent City budgets have        
been balanced in part through the use of non-recurring resources; that          
the City's Financial Plan tends to rely on actions outside its direct           

Page 9                                                                          

control; that the City has not yet brought its long-term expenditure            
growth in line with recurring revenue growth; and that the City is              
therefore likely to continue to face substantial gaps between forecast          
revenues and expenditures in future years that must be closed with              
reduced expenditures and/or increased revenues.                                 

Given the foregoing factors, there can be no assurance that the City            
will continue to maintain a balanced budget, or that it can maintain a          
balanced budget without additional tax or other revenue increases or            
reductions in City services, which could adversely affect the City's            
economic base.                                                                  

Litigation. The City is a defendant in a significant number of lawsuits.        
Such litigation includes, but is not limited to, actions commenced and          
claims asserted against the City arising out of alleged constitutional          
violations, torts, breaches of contracts, and other violations of law           
and condemnation proceedings. While the ultimate outcome and fiscal             
impact, if any, on the proceedings and claims are not currently                 
predictable, adverse determinations in certain of them might have a             
material adverse effect upon the City's ability to carry out its                
financial plan. The 1996-99 Financial Plan includes provisions for              
judgments and claims of $279 million, $236 million, $251 million and            
$264 million for the 1996 through 1999 fiscal years, respectively.              

Ratings. As of March 1996, Moody's rating of the City's general                 
obligation bonds stood at Baa1. S&P's current rating of the City's              
general obligation bonds is BBB+. S&P's previous rating of the City's           
general obligation bonds was A-.                                                

On July 10, 1995, S&P revised downward its rating on City general               
obligation bonds from A- to BBB+ and removed City bonds from                    
CreditWatch. S&P stated that "structural budgetary balance remains              
elusive because of persistent softness in the City's economy,                   
highlighted by weak job growth and a growing dependence on the                  
historically volatile financial services sector." Other factors                 
identified by S&P in lowering its rating on City bonds included a trend         
of using one-time measures, including debt refinancings, to close               
projected budget gaps, dependence on unratified labor savings to help           
balance financial plans, optimistic projections of additional Federal           
and State aid or mandate relief, a history of cash flow difficulties            
caused by State budget delays and continued high debt levels. Fitch             
IBCA, Inc. (formerly Fitch Investors Service, L.P.) continues to rate           
the City general obligation bonds A-.                                           

On February 11, 1991, Moody's had lowered its rating from A. Previously,        
Moody's had raised its rating to A in May 1988, to Baa1 in December             
1986, to Baa in November 1983 and to Ba1 in November 1981. S&P had              
raised its rating to A- in November 1987, to BBB+ in July 1985 and to           
BBB in March 1981.                                                              

Indebtedness. As of June 30, 1997, the City had $3.671 billion of               
outstanding debt service of which $3.515 billion was net long-term              
indebtedness.                                                                   

(3) The State Agencies: Certain Agencies of the State have faced                
substantial financial difficulties which could adversely affect the             
ability of such Agencies to make payments of interest on, and principal         
amounts of, their respective bonds. The difficulties have in certain            
instances caused the State (under so-called "moral obligation"                  
provisions which are non-binding statutory provisions for State                 
appropriations to maintain various debt service reserve funds) to               
appropriate funds on behalf of the Agencies. Moreover, it is expected           
that the problems faced by these Agencies will continue and will require        
increasing amounts of State assistance in future years. Failure of the          
State to appropriate necessary amounts or to take other action to permit        
those Agencies having financial difficulties to meet their obligations          
could result in a default by one or more of the Agencies. Such default,         
if it were to occur, would be likely to have a significant adverse              
effect on investor confidence in, and therefore the market price of,            
obligations of the defaulting Agencies. In addition, any default in             
payment on any general obligation of any Agency whose bonds contain a           
moral obligation provision could constitute a failure of certain                
conditions that must be satisfied in connection with Federal guarantees         
of City and MAC obligations and could thus jeopardize the City's long-          
term financing plans.                                                           

(4) State Litigation: The State is a defendant in numerous legal                
proceedings pertaining to matters incidental to the performance of              
routine governmental operations. Such litigation includes, but is not           
limited to, claims asserted against the State arising from alleged              
torts, alleged breaches of contracts, condemnation proceedings, and             
other alleged violations of State and Federal laws. Included in the             
State's outstanding litigation are a number of cases challenging the            
constitutionality or the adequacy and effectiveness of a variety of             
significant social welfare programs primarily involving the State's             
mental hygiene programs. Adverse judgments in these matters generally           
could result in injunctive relief coupled with prospective changes in           

Page 10                                                                         

patient care which could require substantial increased financing of the         
litigated programs in the future.                                               

The State is also engaged in a variety of claims wherein significant            
monetary damages are sought. In 1997, a civil rights claim alleging             
intentional school segregation in Yonkers has resulted in a $9 million          
judgment for plaintiffs that the State must pay.                                

Adverse developments in the foregoing proceedings or new proceedings            
could adversely affect the financial condition of the State in the future.      

(5) Other Municipalities: Certain localities in addition to New York            
City could have financial problems leading to requests for additional           
State assistance and the need to reduce their spending or increase their        
revenues. The potential impact on the State of such actions by                  
localities is not included in projections of State receipts and                 
expenditures in the State's 1997-98 fiscal year.                                

Fiscal difficulties experienced by the City of Yonkers ("Yonkers")              
resulted in the re-establishment of the Financial Control Board for the         
City of Yonkers (the "Yonkers Board") by the State in 1984. The Yonkers         
Board is charged with oversight of the fiscal affairs of Yonkers. Future        
actions taken by the Governor or the State Legislature to assist Yonkers        
could result in increased State expenditures for extraordinary local            
assistance.                                                                     

Beginning in 1990, the City of Troy experienced a series of budgetary           
deficits that resulted in the establishment of a Supervisory Board for          
the City of Troy in 1994. The Supervisory Board's powers were increased         
in 1995, when Troy MAC was created to help Troy avoid default on certain        
obligations. The legislation creating Troy MAC prohibits the City of            
Troy from seeking federal bankruptcy protection while Troy MAC bonds are        
outstanding. Troy MAC has issued bonds to effect a restructuring of the         
City of Troy's obligations.                                                     

Eighteen municipalities received extraordinary assistance during the            
1996 legislative session through $50 million in special appropriations          
targeted for distressed cities, aid that was largely continued in 1997.         
Twenty-eight municipalities are scheduled to share the more than $32            
million in targeted unrestricted aid allocated in the 1997-98 budget. An        
additional $21 million will be dispersed among all cities, towns and            
villages, a 3.97% increase in General Purpose State Aid.                        

Municipalities and school districts have engaged in substantial short-          
term and long-term borrowings. In 1995, the total indebtedness of all           
localities in the State other than New York City was approximately $19.0        
billion. Approximately $102.3 million of that indebtedness represented          
borrowing to finance budgetary deficits and was issued pursuant to State        
enabling legislation. State law requires the Comptroller to review and          
make recommendations concerning the budgets of those local government           
units other than New York City authorized by State law to issue debt to         
finance deficits during the period that such deficit financing is               
outstanding. Eighteen localities had outstanding indebtedness for               
deficit financing at the close of their fiscal year ending in 1995.             

From time to time, Federal expenditure reductions could reduce, or in           
some cases eliminate, Federal funding of some local programs and                
accordingly might impose substantial increased expenditure requirements         
on affected localities. If the State, New York City or any of the               
Agencies were to suffer serious financial difficulties jeopardizing             
their respective access to the public credit markets, the marketability         
of notes and bonds issued by localities within the State, including             
notes or bonds in the New York Trust, could be adversely affected.              
Localities also face anticipated and potential problems resulting from          
certain pending litigation, judicial decisions, and long-range economic         
trends. The long-range potential problems of declining urban population,        
increasing expenditures, and other economic trends could adversely              
affect localities and require increasing State assistance in the future.        

(6) Other Issuers of New York Municipal Obligations. There are a number         
of other agencies, instrumentalities and political subdivisions of the          
State that issue Municipal Obligations, some of which may be conduit            
revenue obligations payable from payments from private borrowers. These         
entities are subject to various economic risks and uncertainties, and           
the credit quality of the securities issued by them may vary                    
considerably from the credit quality of obligations backed by the full          
faith and credit of the State.                                                  

The foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of           
the general factors which may impact certain issuers of Bonds and does          
not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of all adverse           
conditions to which the issuers of Bonds held by the New York Trusts are        
subject. Additionally, many factors including national economic, social         
and environmental policies and conditions, which are not within the             

Page 11                                                                         

control of the issuers of the Bonds, could affect or could have an              
adverse impact on the financial condition of the issuers. The Sponsor is        
unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other               
factors may affect the issuers of the Bonds, the market value or                
marketability of the Bonds or the ability of the respective issuers of          
the Bonds acquired by the New York Trusts to pay interest on or                 
principal of the Bonds.

____________

(1) Because certain of the Securities may, in certain circumstances, be
sold, redeemed or mature in accordance with their terms, the Unit value
at the Termination Date may not equal the Principal Amount (Par Value)
of Securities per Unit stated above.

(2)The Public Offering Price shown above reflects the value of the
Securities at the opening of business on the Initial Date of Deposit. No
investor will purchase Units at this price. The price you pay for your
Units will be based on their valuation at the Evaluation Time on the
date you purchase your Units. On the Initial Date of Deposit, the Public
Offering Price per Unit will not include any accrued interest on the
Securities. After this date, a pro rata share of any accrued interest on
the Securities will be included.

(3)You will pay a maximum sales charge of 3.95% of the Public Offering
Price per Unit (equivalent to 4.112% of the net amount invested).
Investors will not be assessed a sales charge on the portion of their
Units represented by cash deposited to pay the Trust's organization costs.

(4) Each Security is valued at its aggregate offering price. The initial
evaluation for purposes of determining the purchase, sale or redemption
price of Units on the Initial Date of Deposit will occur at the latter
of 4:00 p.m. Eastern time or the effectiveness of the Trust. Thereafter,
evaluations for purposes of determining the purchase, sale or redemption
price of Units are made as of the close of trading on the New York Stock
Exchange ("NYSE") (generally 4:00 p.m. Eastern time) on each day on
which it is open (the "Evaluation Time").

(5) The Net Asset Value per Unit figure reflects the deduction of
estimated organization costs, which will be deducted from the assets of
the Trust at the end of the initial offering period. The Sponsor's
Initial Repurchase Price per Unit does not reflect the deduction of
estimated organization costs until the end of the initial offering
period as set forth under "Fee Table." The Redemption Price per Unit
reflects the deduction of such estimated organization costs. See
"Redeeming Your Units."

(6)See "Amending or Terminating the Indenture."

(7) Distributions will be paid on the twenty-fifth day of each month
("Distribution Date") to Unit holders of record on the tenth day of such
month ("Distribution Record Date"). The amount of the Estimated Regular
Distributions per Unit was calculated on the basis of the Estimated
Annual Interest Income per Unit less the estimated annual expenses and
divided by twelve. Each Unit holder will receive the Initial
Distribution per Unit on _________, 2011. Estimated Regular
Distributions per Unit will occur monthly, beginning ________, 2011. The
actual distribution you receive will vary from that set forth above with
changes in the Trust's fees and expenses and with the sale, maturity or
redemption of Securities. See "Fee Table" and "Expenses and Charges."
Distributions from the Principal Account will be made monthly if the
amount available for distribution equals at least $1.00 per Unit.
Notwithstanding, distributions of funds in the Principal Account, if
any, will be made in December of each year and as part of the final
liquidation distribution. See "Interest and Principal Distributions."

(8) Estimated Current Return is calculated by dividing Estimated Net
Annual Interest Income per Unit by the Public Offering Price. Estimated
Long-Term Return is calculated using a formula which (1) factors in the
relative weightings of the market values, yields (which take into
account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and
estimated retirements of the Securities; and (2) takes into account a
compounding factor, the sales charge and expenses. There is no assurance
that the Estimated Current and Long-Term Returns set forth above will be
realized in the future because the various components used to calculate
these figures, such as Trust expenses, market values and estimated
retirements of the Securities, will change. In addition, neither rate
reflects the true return you will receive, which will be lower, because
neither includes the effect of certain delays in distributions.

Fee Table



This Fee Table describes the fees and expenses that you may pay if you
buy and hold Units of the Trust and receive distributions monthly. See
"Public Offering" and "Expenses and Charges." Although the Trust has a
term of approximately ___ years and is a unit investment trust rather
than a mutual fund, this information allows you to compare fees.

                                 Example

This example is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in
the Trust with the cost of investing in other investment products. The
example assumes that you invest $10,000 in the Trust for the periods
shown. The example also assumes a 5% return on your investment each year
and that the Trust's operating expenses stay the same. The example does
not take into consideration transaction fees which may be charged by
certain broker/dealers for processing redemption requests. Although your
actual costs may vary, based on these assumptions your costs, assuming
you sell or redeem your Units at the end of each period, would be:

1 Year             3 Years            5 Years            10 Years
______             _______            _______            _______
$                  $                  $                  $

The example will not differ if you hold rather than sell your Units at
the end of each period.

____________

(a)The maximum sales charge consists entirely of an initial sales
charge, deducted at the time of purchase. Investors will not be assessed
a sales charge on the portion of their Units represented by cash
deposited to pay the Trust's organization costs.

(b) Estimated organization costs will be deducted from the assets of the
Trust at the end of the initial offering period. Estimated organization
costs are assessed on a fixed dollar amount per Unit basis which, as a
percentage of average net assets, will vary over time.

(c)Each of the fees listed herein is assessed on a fixed dollar amount
per Unit basis which, as a percentage of average net assets, will vary
over time.

(d)Other operating expenses include the costs incurred for annually
updating the Trust's registration statement, but do not include
brokerage costs and other portfolio transaction fees. A portion of the
Trustee's fee represents the cost to the Trustee of advancing funds to
the Trust to meet scheduled distributions, to provide funds for payment
of redemptions, or otherwise as required for the administration of the
Trust. The Trustee can adjust the amount of its fee in response to,
among other things, changes in short term interest rates and changes in
the average cash balances on hand in the Trust Accounts. In certain
circumstances the Trust may incur additional expenses not set forth
above. See "Expenses and Charges."

_____________

                    NOTES TO STATEMENT OF NET ASSETS

The Sponsor is responsible for the preparation of financial statements
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States which require the Sponsor to make estimates and
assumptions that affect amounts reported herein. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

(1) The Trust invests in a diversified portfolio of taxable municipal
bonds. Aggregate cost of the Securities listed under "Schedule of
Investments" is based on their aggregate underlying value. The Trust has
a Termination Date of ________, 20__.

(2) An irrevocable letter of credit issued by The Bank of New York
Mellon, of which $_________ is allocated to the Trust, has been
deposited with the Trustee as collateral, covering the monies necessary
for the purchase of Securities subject to purchase contracts ($   ),
accrued interest to the Initial Date of Deposit ($   ), cash ($   ) and
accrued interest from the Initial Date of Deposit to the later of the
First Settlement Date of the Trust or the expected dates of delivery of
the Securities ($   ). The Trustee will advance to the Trust the amount
of net interest accrued to the First Settlement Date, which will be
distributed to the Sponsor as Unit holder of record.

(3) The purchased interest on the underlying Securities accrued to the
Initial Date of Deposit will be distributed to the Sponsor as Unit
holder of record.

(4) A portion of the Public Offering Price consists of an amount
sufficient to reimburse the Sponsor for all or a portion of the costs of
establishing the Trust. These costs have been estimated at $    per
Unit. A payment will be made at the end of the initial offering period
to an account maintained by the Trustee from which the obligation of the
investors to the Sponsor will be satisfied. To the extent that actual
organization costs are greater than the estimated amount, only the
estimated organization costs added to the Public Offering Price will be
reimbursed to the Sponsor and deducted from the assets of the Trust.

(5) Net asset value per Unit is calculated by dividing the Trust's net
assets by the number of Units outstanding. This figure includes
organization costs, which will only be assessed to Units outstanding at
the close of the initial offering period.

(6) The aggregate cost to investors in the Trust, excluding the amount
held in cash deposited to pay the Trust's organization costs, includes a
maximum sales charge computed at the rate of 3.95% of the Public
Offering Price per Unit (equivalent to 4.112% of the net amount
invested), assuming no reduction of sales charge as set forth under
"Public Offering."

                    NOTES TO SCHEDULE OF INVESTMENTS

(1) All Securities are represented by the actual Securities and/or
regular way contracts to purchase such Securities which are backed by an
irrevocable letter of credit deposited with the Trustee. The Sponsor
entered into purchase contracts for the Securities on August __, 2011,
and the Sponsor expects that any outstanding purchase contracts as of
August __, 2011 will settle on or prior to August __, 2011. The
Securities are obligations of issuers of certain states or United States
territories. The Securities in the Trust are divided by source of
revenue and represent the percentage of net assets as indicated by the
following table:

Number of Issues        Source of Revenue                  Portfolio Percentage
________________        ________________                   ____________________
                                                                     %
                                                                     %
                                                                     %
                                                                     %
                                                                     %
                                                                     %

(2) The cost of the Securities to the Trust represents the aggregate
underlying value with respect to the Securities acquired (generally
determined by the aggregate offering price of the Securities at the
opening of business on the Initial Date of Deposit). The evaluation of
the Securities at the opening of business on the Initial Date of Deposit
has been determined by Standard & Poor's Securities Evaluations, Inc.,
an independent pricing agent. The cost of the Securities to the Sponsor
and the Sponsor's profit or loss (which is the difference between the cost
of the Securities to the Sponsor and the cost of the Securities to the
Trust) are $    and $   , respectively. The cost of the Securities to
the Sponsor may include the cost of and gain or loss on certain futures
contracts entered into by the Sponsor in an effort to hedge the impact
of interest rate fluctuations on the value of certain of the Securities
to the extent the Sponsor entered into such contracts. The aggregate bid
price of the Securities at the opening of business on the Initial Date
of Deposit was $    (unaudited).

(3) The ratings are by Standard & Poor's Ratings Group, a division of
The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. ("S&P" or "Standard & Poor's") and are
unaudited. Such ratings were obtained from an information reporting
service other than S&P. "NR" indicates no rating by S&P. Such Securities
may, however, be rated by another nationally recognized statistical
rating organization. "(e)" indicates an "Expected Rating" and is
intended to anticipate Standard & Poor's forthcoming rating assignment.
Expected Ratings are generated by Bloomberg Finance L.P. ("Bloomberg")
based on sources it considers reliable or established Standard & Poor's
rating practices. Expected Ratings exist only until Standard & Poor's
assigns a rating to the issue. There is no guarantee that the ratings,
when assigned, will not differ from those currently expected.

(4) Certain Securities may be redeemed before their stated maturity.
This column shows when a Security is initially redeemable and the
redemption price for that year. Securities are redeemable at declining
prices (but not below par value) in subsequent years. S.F. indicates a
sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of Securities.
Certain Securities may also be redeemed in whole or in part other than
by operation of the stated redemption provisions under certain
circumstances detailed in the instruments creating them. Such redemption
provisions may result in a redemption price less than the value of the
Securities on the Initial Date of Deposit. Redemption pursuant to call
provisions generally will occur at times when the redeemed Securities
have an offering side valuation which represents a premium over par. To
the extent that Securities were deposited in the Trust at a price higher
than the price at which they are redeemed, this will represent a loss of
capital when compared with the original Public Offering Price of the
Units. Distributions will generally be reduced by the amount of the
income which would otherwise have been paid with respect to redeemed
Securities and Unit holders will receive a distribution of the principal
amount and any premium received on such redemption (except to the extent
the proceeds of the redeemed Securities are used to pay for Unit
redemptions). Estimated Current Return and Estimated Long-Term Return
may also be affected by such redemptions.

(5) In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 820 ("ASC
820"), "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures," fair value is defined
as the price that the Trust would receive upon selling an investment in
a timely transaction to an independent buyer in the principal or most
advantageous market of the investment. ASC 820 established a three-tier
hierarchy to maximize the use of the observable market data and minimize
the use of unobservable inputs and to establish classification of the
fair value measurements for disclosure purposes. Inputs refer broadly to
the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset
or liability, including the technique or pricing model used to measure
fair value and the risk inherent in the inputs to the valuation
technique. Inputs may be observable or unobservable. Observable inputs
are inputs that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in
pricing the asset or liability, developed based on market data obtained
from sources independent of the reporting entity. Unobservable inputs
are inputs that may reflect the reporting entity's own assumptions about
the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or
liability, developed based on the best information available in the
circumstances. The three-tier hierarchy of inputs is summarized in the
three broad levels: Level 1 which represents quoted prices in active
markets for identical investments; Level 2 which represents fair value
based on other significant observable inputs (including the yield or
price of equivalent securities of comparable quality, coupon rate,
maturity, embedded call features, type of issue, trading characteristics
and other market data available as of the deposit date); and Level 3
which represents fair value based on significant unobservable inputs

Page 10

(including the Trust's own assumptions in determining the fair value of
investments). At the date of deposit, all of the Trust's investments are
classified as Level 2; the valuation on the date of deposit was
determined by the Evaluator using offering prices provided by
third-party pricing services. The inputs used by these third party
pricing services were based upon significant observable inputs, that
included, but were not limited to, the items noted above.

(6)These Securities were issued at an original issue discount on the
following dates and at the following percentages of their original
principal amount:

                                                            Date               %
                                                            ____              _____
                                                                               %
                                                                               %
                                                                               %
                                                                               %
                                                                               %
                                                                               %

(7)Insurance has been obtained by the issuer of this Security. Such
insurance coverage continues in force so long as a Security is
outstanding and the insurer remains in business. See "Risk Factors" in
the prospectus for a discussion of risks of investing in insured
Securities.

(8)This Security has a "make whole" call option and is redeemable in
whole or in part at any time, unless otherwise provided below, at the
option of the issuer, at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i)
100% of their principal amount or (ii) the sum of the present values of
the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon,
discounted to the date of redemption on a semi-annual basis (assuming a
360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at a set premium to the
then current applicable Treasury Rate, plus, in either case, accrued and
unpaid interest on the principal amount being redeemed to the date of
redemption. Securities bearing this option within the Trust and their
respective premiums to the applicable Treasury rate are as follows:
__________, ____%; __________, ____%; __________, ____%; __________,
____%; __________, ____%; __________, ____%; __________, ____%;
__________, ____%; __________, ____%; __________, ____%; __________,
____%; __________, ____%.

(9)This Security may be redeemed in whole or in part in the event that
the issuer's cash subsidy payment (either 35% or 45%) from the U.S.
government is reduced or eliminated ("extraordinary redemption"). Such
redemption may result in a redemption price less than the value of the
Security on the Initial Date of Deposit.

The First Trust Combined Series




The First Trust Combined Series Defined.



We, First Trust Portfolios L.P. (the "Sponsor"), have created hundreds
of similar yet separate series of an investment company which we have
named The First Trust Combined Series. The series to which this
prospectus relates, The First Trust Combined Series 376, consists of a
single portfolio known as Build America Bonds Portfolio, Series 39. We
anticipate depositing The First Trust Combined Series 376 on or about
August 23, 2011. However, for a variety of reasons, we may elect to
postpone or cancel the deposit or, if we proceed with the deposit, we
may elect to create fewer Units than we currently anticipate.


The Trust was created under the laws of the State of New York by a Trust
Agreement (the "Indenture") dated the Initial Date of Deposit. This
agreement, entered into between First Trust Portfolios L.P., as Sponsor,
The Bank of New York Mellon as Trustee, FTP Services LLC ("FTPS") as
FTPS Unit Servicing Agent and First Trust Advisors L.P. as Portfolio
Supervisor and Evaluator, governs the operation of the Trust.


YOU MAY GET MORE SPECIFIC DETAILS CONCERNING THE NATURE, STRUCTURE AND
RISKS OF THIS PRODUCT IN AN "INFORMATION SUPPLEMENT" BY CALLING THE

SPONSOR AT 1-800-621-1675, EXT. 1.



How We Created the Trust.



On the Initial Date of Deposit, we deposited municipal bonds and/or
contracts for municipal bonds (including a letter of credit or the
equivalent) with the Trustee and in turn, the Trustee delivered
documents to us representing our ownership of the Trust, in the form of
units ("Units").


After the Initial Date of Deposit, we may deposit additional Securities
in the Trust, or cash (including a letter of credit or the equivalent)
with instructions to buy more Securities to create new Units for sale.
If we create additional Units, we will attempt, to the extent
practicable, to maintain the percentage relationship established among
the Securities on the Initial Date of Deposit (as set forth under
"Schedule of Investments"), adjusted to reflect the occurrence of an
event which affects the capital structure of the issuer of a Security or
a sale of a Security made as described in "Removing Securities from the
Trust."


Since the prices of the Securities will fluctuate daily, the ratio of
Securities in the Trust, on a market value basis, will also change
daily. The portion of Securities represented by each Unit will not
change as a result of the deposit of additional Securities in the Trust.
If we deposit cash, you and new investors may experience a dilution of
your investment. This is because prices of Securities will fluctuate
between the time of the cash deposit and the purchase of the Securities,
and because the Trust pays the associated brokerage fees. To reduce this
dilution, the Trust will try to buy the Securities as close to the
Evaluation Time and as close to the evaluation price as possible. In
addition, because the Trust pays the brokerage fees associated with the
creation of new Units and with the sale of Securities to meet redemption
and exchange requests, frequent redemption and exchange activity will
likely result in higher brokerage expenses.


An affiliate of the Trustee may receive these brokerage fees or the
Trustee may retain and pay us (or our affiliate) to act as agent for the
Trust to buy Securities. If we or an affiliate of ours act as agent to
the Trust, we will be subject to the restrictions under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act").


We cannot guarantee that the Trust will keep its present size and
composition for any length of time. Securities will mature or may be
redeemed prior to the Termination Date or may be periodically sold under
certain circumstances to satisfy Trust obligations, to meet redemption
requests and, as described in "Removing Securities from the Trust," to
maintain the sound investment character of the Trust, and the proceeds
received by the Trust will be used to meet Trust obligations or
distributed to Unit holders, but will not be reinvested. However,
Securities will not be sold to take advantage of market fluctuations or
changes in anticipated rates of appreciation or depreciation, or if they
no longer meet the criteria by which they were selected. You will not be
able to dispose of or vote any of the Securities in the Trust. As the
holder of the Securities, the Trustee will vote the Securities and will
endeavor to vote the Securities such that the Securities are voted as
closely as possible in the same manner and the same general proportion
as are the Securities held by owners other than such Trust.


Neither we nor the Trustee will be liable for a failure in any of the
Securities. However, if a contract for the purchase of any of the
Securities initially deposited in the Trust fails, unless we can
purchase substitute Securities ("Replacement Securities"), we will
refund to you that portion of the purchase price and sales charge
resulting from the failed contract on the next Distribution Date. Any
Replacement Security the Trust acquires will meet requirements specified
in the Indenture.

Portfolio




Objectives.



The Trust seeks to distribute income and preserve capital by investing
in a professionally selected, fixed portfolio of investment grade
taxable municipal bonds. Under normal circumstances, at least 80% of the
Trust's portfolio will consist of bonds issued under the Build America
Bond provision of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009,
but the Trust may also invest in other taxable municipal bonds.



Build America's Infrastructure with Bonds.



A municipal bond is a debt obligation of a state and/or local government
entity which can be used to help build America's infrastructure by
raising money to finance public projects such as new hospitals, schools
and improved roads. With the signing into law of the American Recovery
and Reinvestment Act of 2009, an entirely new type of taxable municipal
bond was created-Build America Bonds, or BABs. Essentially, Build
America Bonds are identical to traditional tax-exempt issues except the
interest is taxable at the federal, and possibly state and local level.


BABs provided state and local governments with a new method of financing
capital projects with the aid of a federal subsidy. The subsidy was
intended to ease the burden of budgetary-pressured state and local
governments and to stimulate spending on a variety of public projects.
The federal government reimburses the municipality 35% of the interest
paid on the bonds (45% in the case of certain bonds), thereby reducing
their net interest cost. The subsidy provided by the government allowed
issuers to offer higher interest rates on bonds than they do on their
tax-free debt, while offsetting some or all of the additional financing
burden. The BAB program expired at the end of 2010. There is no
assurance that the BAB program will be continued in the future or, if it
is continued, that the program terms will not be modified, possibly
significantly.



Build America Bonds At-A-Glance:



o Part of the U.S. government's plan to fund infrastructure;


o U.S. government will subsidize 35% (45% in the case of certain bonds)
of the interest payment on taxable bonds issued as direct pay BABs
directly to the issuers of such securities;


o Municipal bonds have historically low default rates and relatively low
volatility;


o Provide taxable income;


o Generally high credit quality;


o Interest will be treated as state tax-exempt in those states that
treat municipal bond interest as exempt from state income tax.



Growth in BAB Issuance.



Increased Demand. Growth in BABs issuance throughout the program's
existence was spurred by investor demand since BABs represented a new
taxable fixed income option for investors to augment corporate, asset-
backed, Federal agency and Treasury bonds. In addition, BABs have drawn
interest from investors who are not typically purchasers of tax-exempt
bonds because they don't benefit from federal tax exemption, such as
foreign investors who have no U.S. tax liability or pension funds that
are not required to pay taxes.


The first BABs were sold on April 15, 2009 and by the end of 2009 a
total of $64.1 billion in BABs were issued. In 2010, another $117.3
billion had been issued. Since 2009, all 50 states and the District of
Columbia have participated in the program. [Securities Industry and
Financial Markets Association (SIFMA)]


Increased Share of Issuance. States and local governments have always
issued taxable debt, accounting for an average of 7% of overall long-
term issuance since 2000. [Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board] The
emergence of BABs, however, led to record levels of issuance of taxable
municipal securities. [Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board] From the
first BAB issuance on April 15, 2009 through the end of 2009, BABs
accounted for 20% of long-term securities issued in the municipal
market. [SIFMA] In 2010, BAB's share grew to account for 30% of long-
term municipal bond issuance.



The Appeal of Taxable Municipal Bonds.



Lower Default Rates than Corporate Bonds. Municipal bonds have
historically had a very low overall default rate as compared to
corporate bonds. According to data from Moody's, the historical default
rate of Moody's-rated municipal bonds is lower than that of corporate
bonds in every rating category. In fact, despite the economic struggles
facing many states and municipalities, investment grade municipal bonds
have experienced significantly lower default rates than even the highest
rated corporate bonds.


One reason for the historically lower default rates has been due to the
relatively more stable revenue streams of municipalities, which have the
ability to levy taxes to offset declining revenues. Corporate revenues,
on the other hand, can be more volatile as they have fewer ways to
increase revenues during difficult economic periods.

Attractive Yields. The subsidy provided by the government enables BAB
issuers to offer yields at attractive spreads over comparable
traditional types of taxable bonds such as Treasury bonds and corporate
bonds. Although the interest on the bonds is taxable for federal
purposes, states are permitted to treat the interest as exempt from
state taxes.


The taxable bond marketplace is often short on supply of longer-dated
taxable bonds, which has made BABs a popular option for both
institutional and individual investors who are attracted to the higher
yields relative to other taxable bonds.

Professional Evaluation and Selection.



We believe thorough analysis of the credit quality of any bond is
critically important in light of the challenges present in the municipal
market today. Relying on a bond's rating does not adequately inform
investors about the inherent credit quality of the bond.


At First Trust we take a thorough approach to analyzing municipal
securities that are under consideration for inclusion in our unit
investment trusts. Our analysts use a multiple factor approach when
evaluating the credit strength of a bond. Factors specific to different
sectors of the municipal market enter into the analysis as well as
comparisons to peers.


To do so, our analysts assess the financial strength of the obligor by
examining its fiscal health and economic health. We determine the
relative strength of protection afforded the bondholder by the legal and
contractual elements of the bond documents. And we look to other
qualitative factors that could enhance or compromise the credit strength
of the bond.


Assessing Municipal Credit Risk. The goal of our credit analysis is
primarily two-fold:


o Avoidance of potentially severe credit impairment, especially default.


o Determining probability of transitional credit events leading to
credit quality volatility or degradation.


Although municipal bonds have exhibited a very low rate of default,
defaults can and do happen. However, it is more common for the credit
quality of a bond to become worse over time-a negative credit
transition. By thoroughly analyzing every bond, we seek to identify and
avoid those bonds that have the potential for adverse credit
developments in the future.


Unlike other fixed income investment alternatives, once a unit
investment trust is established new bonds cannot be added or substituted
for the Trust's holdings. Therefore we approach the analysis of each and
every security with the understanding that they will be held in any
given portfolio for a long period of time. The purpose of our credit
analysis is to identify securities that we believe will stand the test
of time for the duration of the life of the Trust.


As of the Initial Date of Deposit, all of the Securities were rated "BBB-"
or better by Standard & Poor's and/or another nationally recognized
statistical rating organization. See "Description of Bond Ratings."
After the Initial Date of Deposit, a Security's rating may be lowered.
This would not immediately cause the Security to be removed from the
Trust, but may be considered by us in determining whether to direct the
Trustee to dispose of such Security. See "Removing Securities from the
Trust."


The Trust has an expected life of approximately ___ years. A diversified
portfolio helps to offset the risks normally associated with such an
investment, although it does not eliminate them entirely. Of course, as
with any similar investments, there can be no guarantee that the
objectives of the Trust will be achieved. See "Risk Factors" for a
discussion of the risks of investing in the Trust.



Estimated Returns



The Estimated Current and Long-Term Returns set forth in the "Summary of
Essential Information" are estimates and are designed to be comparative
rather than predictive. We cannot predict your actual return, which will
vary with Unit price, how long you hold your investment and with changes
in the portfolio, interest income and expenses. In addition, neither
rate reflects the true return you will receive, which will be lower,
because neither includes the effect of certain delays in distributions
with respect to when the Securities pay interest and when distributions
are paid by the Trust. Estimated Current Return equals the estimated
annual interest income to be received from the Securities less estimated
annual Trust expenses, divided by the Public Offering Price per Unit


Page 14


(which includes the initial sales charge). Estimated Long-Term Return is
a measure of the estimated return over the estimated life of the Trust
and is calculated using a formula which (1) factors in the market
values, yields (which take into account the amortization of premiums and
the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirements of the Securities,
and (2) takes into account a compounding factor, the sales charge and
expenses. Unlike Estimated Current Return, Estimated Long-Term Return
reflects maturities, discounts and premiums of the Securities in the
Trust. We will provide you with estimated cash flows for the Trust at no
charge upon your request.



Risk Factors



Price Volatility. The Trust invests in municipal bonds. The value of the
Securities will decline with increases in interest rates, not only
because increases in rates generally decrease values, but also because
increased rates may indicate an economic slowdown. An economic slowdown,
or a reduction in an issuer's creditworthiness, may result in the issuer
being unable to maintain earnings at a level sufficient to maintain
interest and principal payments. The value of the Securities will also
fluctuate with changes in investors' perceptions of an issuer's
financial condition or the general condition of the municipal bond
market, changes in inflation rates or when political or economic events
affecting the issuers occur.


Because the Trust is not managed, the Trustee will not sell Securities
in response to or in anticipation of market fluctuations, as is common
in managed investments. As with any investment, we cannot guarantee that
the performance of the Trust will be positive over any period of time or
that you won't lose money. Units of the Trust are not deposits of any
bank and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation or any other government agency.


Interest. There is no guarantee that the issuers of the Securities will
be able to satisfy their interest payment obligations to the Trust over
the life of the Trust.


Current Economic Conditions. The National Bureau of Economic Research
announced that the U.S. economy's recession which began in December 2007
technically ended in June 2009. Despite this announcement, economic
activity remains below average levels, the United States continues to
experience increased unemployment and stock markets remain below pre-
recession levels. The recession began with problems in the housing and
credit markets, many of which were caused by defaults on "subprime"
mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, eventually leading to the
failures of some large financial institutions and has negatively
impacted all sectors of the economy. The current economic crisis has
also affected the global economy with European and Asian markets
suffering historic losses. Due to the current state of uncertainty in
the economy, the value of the Securities held by the Trust may be
subject to steep declines or increased volatility due to changes in
performance or perception of the issuers. Extraordinary steps have been
taken by the governments of several leading economic countries to combat
the economic crisis; however, the impact of these measures is not yet
known and cannot be predicted.


The markets for credit instruments, including municipal securities, have
experienced periods of extreme illiquidity and volatility since the
latter half of 2007. Liquidity in the municipal bond market (the ability
to buy and sell bonds readily) has been reduced. General market
uncertainty and consequent repricing risk have led to market imbalances
of sellers and buyers, which in turn have resulted in significant
valuation uncertainties in a variety of debt securities, including
municipal securities. In addition, during 2008, several major dealers of
municipal bonds exited the market via acquisition or bankruptcy. These
conditions resulted, and in many cases continue to result in, greater
volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price
transparency, with many debt securities remaining illiquid and of
uncertain value. These market conditions may make valuation of some of
the Trust's Securities uncertain and/or result in sudden and significant
valuation increases or declines in its holdings. During times of reduced
market liquidity, such as at the present, the Trust may not be able to
sell Securities readily at prices reflecting the values at which the
Securities are carried on the Trust's books. Sales of large blocks of
securities by market participants, such as the Trust, that are seeking
liquidity can further reduce security prices in an illiquid market.


In response to the current national economic downturn, governmental cost
burdens may be reallocated among federal, state and local governments.
In addition, laws enacted in the future by Congress or state
legislatures or referenda could extend the time for payment of principal
and/or interest, or impose other constraints on enforcement of such
obligations, or on the ability of municipalities to levy taxes. Issuers
of municipal securities might seek protection under the bankruptcy laws.


On August 5, 2011, Standard & Poor's Ratings Services lowered its long-
term sovereign credit rating on the United States of America to "AA+"
from "AAA."  In reaching its decision, Standard & Poor's cited the
prolonged controversy over raising the statutory debt ceiling and the
related fiscal policy debate and their belief that further near-term


Page 15


progress containing the growth in public spending, especially on
entitlements, or on reaching an agreement on revenues is less likely
than they previously assumed. The impact of the downgrade of the U.S.
long-term sovereign credit rating by Standard & Poor's is uncertain, but
will likely lead to increased interest rates and volatility in the short-
term.


Municipal Securities. The Trust invests in taxable municipal bonds.
Municipal bonds are debt obligations issued by states or political
subdivisions or authorities of states. Municipal bonds are typically
designated as general obligation bonds, which are general obligations of
a governmental entity that are backed by the taxing power of such
entity, or revenue bonds, which are payable from the income of a
specific project or authority and are not supported by the issuer's
power to levy taxes. Municipal bonds are long-term fixed rate debt
obligations that generally decline in value with increases in interest
rates, when an issuer's financial condition worsens or when the rating
on a bond is decreased. Many municipal bonds may be called or redeemed
prior to their stated maturity, an event which is more likely to occur
when interest rates fall. In such an occurrence, you may not be able to
reinvest the money you receive in other bonds that have as high a yield
or as long a maturity.


The market for municipal bonds is generally less liquid than for other
securities and therefore the price of municipal bonds may be more
volatile and subject to greater price fluctuations than securities with
greater liquidity. In addition, an issuer's ability to make income
distributions generally depends on several factors including the
financial condition of the issuer and general economic conditions. Any
of these factors may negatively impact the price of municipal bonds held
by the Trust and would therefore impact the price of both the Securities
and the Units. The current economic downturn is negatively affecting
towns, counties and school districts across the nation. In recognition
of this fact, Moody's recently assigned a negative outlook to the
creditworthiness of all local governments in the United States.


Acts of terrorism and any resulting damage may not be covered by
insurance on the bonds. Issuers of the bonds may therefore be at risk of
default due to losses sustained as a result of terrorist activities.


Build America Bonds. Most of the Securities in the Trust are Build
America Bonds. The Build America Bonds market is smaller and less
diverse than the broader municipal securities market.  In addition,
because BABs are a new form of municipal financing and because bonds
issued after December 31, 2010 will not qualify as BABs, it is difficult
to predict the extent to which a market for such bonds will develop,
meaning that BABs may experience greater illiquidity than other types of
municipal securities.


Because issuers of direct pay BABs held in the Trust receive
reimbursement from the U.S. Treasury with respect to interest payments
on the bonds, there is a risk that those municipal issuers will not
receive timely payment from the U.S. Treasury and may remain obligated
to pay the full interest due on direct pay BABs held by the Trust.
Furthermore, it is possible that a municipal issuer may fail to comply
with the requirements to receive the direct pay subsidy or that a future
Congress may terminate the subsidy altogether. In addition, the Internal
Revenue Code contains a general offset rule (the "IRS Offset Rule")
which allows for the possibility that the subsidy payments received by
issuers of the BABs may be subject to offset against amounts owed by
them to the Federal government. Moreover, the Internal Revenue Service
("IRS") may audit the agencies issuing BABs and such audits may, among
other things, examine the price at which BABs are initially sold to
investors. If the IRS concludes that a Build America Bond was mispriced
based on its audit, it could disallow a portion or all of the interest
subsidy received by the issuer of the Build America Bond. The IRS Offset
Rule and the disallowance of any interest subsidy as a result of an IRS
audit could potentially adversely affect a BABs issuer's credit rating,
and adversely affect the issuer's ability to repay or refinance BABs.
This, in turn, could adversely affect the ratings and value of the BABs
held by the Trust and the value of the Trust's Units and could impair
the issue's ability to make scheduled interest payments.


Because the BABs program is new, certain aspects of the BABs program may
be subject to additional Federal or state level guidance or subsequent
legislation. For example, the IRS or U.S. Treasury could impose
restriction or limitations on the payments received. Aspects of the BABs
program for which the IRS and U.S. Treasury have solicited public
comment include, but have not been limited to, methods for making direct
payments to issuers, the tax procedural framework for such payments, and
compliance safeguards. It is not known what additional procedures will
be implemented with respect to direct pay BABs, if any, nor is it known
what effect such possible procedures would have on the BABs market.


Insurance Risk. Certain of the Securities in the Trust are covered by
insurance policies obtained by the issuers or underwriters of the bonds
from insurance companies. The "Schedule of Investments" identifies the
insurer of each Security. Insurance guarantees the timely payment, when
due, of all principal and interest on the insured Securities. Such
insurance is effective so long as the insured Security is outstanding
and the insurer remains in business. Insurance relates only to the
particular Security and not to the Units offered hereby or to their
market value. Insured Securities have received the rating described in
the "Schedule of Investments" by Standard & Poor's in recognition of
such insurance. There can be no assurance that any insurer listed will
be able to satisfy its commitments in the event claims are made in the
future. Certain significant providers of insurance for municipal


Page 16


securities have recently incurred significant losses as a result of
exposure to sub-prime mortgages and other lower credit quality
investments that have experienced recent defaults or otherwise suffered
extreme credit deterioration. As a result, such losses have reduced the
insurers' capital and called into question their continued ability to
perform their obligations under such insurance if they are called upon
to do so in the future. While an insured municipal security will
typically be deemed to have the rating of its insurer, if the insurer of
a municipal security suffers a downgrade in its credit rating or the
market discounts the value of the insurance provided by the insurer, the
rating of the underlying municipal security will be more relevant and
the value of the municipal security would more closely, if not entirely,
reflect such rating. In such a case, the value of insurance associated
with a municipal security would decline and may not add any value.


Insurance companies are subject to extensive regulation and supervision
where they do business by state insurance commissioners who regulate the
standards of solvency which must be maintained, the nature of and
limitations on investments, reports of financial condition, and
requirements regarding reserves for unearned premiums, losses and other
matters. A significant portion of the assets of insurance companies is
required by law to be held in reserve against potential claims on
policies and is not available to general creditors. Although the federal
government does not regulate the business of insurance, federal
initiatives including pension regulation, controls on medical care
costs, minimum standards for no-fault automobile insurance, national
health insurance, tax law changes affecting life insurance companies and
repeal of the antitrust exemption for the insurance business can
significantly impact the insurance business.


Because the insurance on the Securities, if any, will be effective so
long as the Securities are outstanding, such insurance will be taken
into account in determining the market value of the Securities and
therefore, some value attributable to such insurance will be included in
the value of the Units of the Trust. The insurance does not, however,
guarantee the market value of the Securities or of the Units.


Discount Bonds. Discount bonds are bonds which have been acquired at a
market discount from par value at maturity. The coupon interest rates on
the discount bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in the
Trust were lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued
bonds of comparable rating and type. The market discount on previously
issued bonds will increase when interest rates for newly issued
comparable bonds increase and decrease when such interest rates fall,
other things being equal.


Original Issue Discount Bonds. ____ of the Securities are considered
original issue discount bonds. These bonds typically pay a lower
interest rate than comparable bonds that were issued at or above their
par value. Under current law, the original issue discount, which is the
difference between the stated redemption price at maturity and the issue
price of the bonds, is deemed to accrue on a daily basis and the accrued
portion is treated as taxable interest income for Federal income tax
purposes.


Unit holders may receive ordinary income dividends from the Trust if the
Trust sells or redeems bonds that were acquired at a market discount, or
sells bonds at a short term capital gain. In general, the Internal
Revenue Service will treat bonds as market discount bonds when the cost
of the bond, plus any original issue discount that has not yet accrued,
is less than the amount due to be paid at the maturity of the bond. Any
gain realized that is in excess of the earned portion of original issue
discount will be taxable as capital gain unless the gain is attributable
to market discount in which case the accretion of market discount is
taxable as ordinary income.


The current value of an original issue discount bond reflects the
present value of its stated redemption price at maturity. In a stable
interest rate environment, the market value of these bonds tends to
increase more slowly in early years and greater increments as the bonds
approach maturity.


The issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before
its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bond's par value.


Premium Bonds. Premium bonds are bonds which have been acquired at a
market premium from par value at maturity. The coupon interest rates on
the premium bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in the
Trust were higher than the current market interest rates for newly
issued bonds of comparable rating and type. The current returns of such
bonds are initially higher than the current returns of comparable bonds
issued at currently prevailing interest rates because premium bonds tend
to decrease in market value as they approach maturity when the face
amount becomes payable. Because part of the purchase price is thus
returned not at maturity but through current income payments, early
redemption of a premium bond at par or early prepayments of principal
will result in a reduction in yield. Redemptions are more likely to


Page 17


occur at times when the bonds have an offering side valuation which
represents a premium over par, or for original issue discount bonds, a
premium over the accreted value. To the extent that the Securities were
deposited in the Fund at a price higher than the price at which they are
redeemed, this will represent a loss of capital when compared to the
original Public Offering Price of the Units. The Trust may be required
to sell zero coupon bonds prior to maturity (at their current market
price which is likely to be less than their par value) in order to pay
expenses of the Trust or in case the Trust is terminated. See "Removing
Securities from the Trust" and "Amending or Terminating the Indenture."


Legislation/Litigation. From time to time, various legislative
initiatives are proposed which may have a negative impact on the prices
of certain of the municipal bonds represented in the Trust. In addition,
litigation regarding any of the issuers of the municipal bonds, such as
litigation affecting the validity of certain municipal bonds or the
qualification of bonds as Build America Bonds eligible for a federal
subsidy payment, may negatively impact the value of these Securities. We
cannot predict what impact any pending or proposed legislation or
pending or threatened litigation will have on the value of the
Securities or on the issuers.



Public Offering




The Public Offering Price.



You may buy Units at the Public Offering Price, the price per Unit of
which is comprised of the following:


- The aggregate underlying value of the Securities;


- The amount of any cash in the Interest and Principal Accounts of the
Trust;


- Net interest accrued but unpaid on the Securities after the First
Settlement Date to the date of settlement; and


- The sales charge.


The price you pay for your Units will differ from the amount stated
under "Summary of Essential Information" due to various factors,
including fluctuations in the prices of the Securities, changes in the
value of the Interest and/or Principal Accounts and the accrual of
interest on the Securities.


Although you are not required to pay for your Units until three business
days following your order (the "date of settlement"), you may pay before
then. You will become the owner of Units ("Record Owner") on the date of
settlement if payment has been received. If you pay for your Units
before the date of settlement, we may use your payment during this time
and it may be considered a benefit to us, subject to the limitations of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.


Organization Costs. Cash which comprises the portion of the Public
Offering Price intended to be used to reimburse the Sponsor for the
Trust's organization costs (including costs of preparing the
registration statement, the Indenture and other closing documents,
registering Units with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
and states, the initial audit of the Trust's statement of net assets,
legal fees and the initial fees and expenses of the Trustee) has been
included in the Trust. The Sponsor will be reimbursed for the Trust's
organization costs at the end of the initial offering period (a
significantly shorter time period than the life of the Trust). To the
extent actual organization costs are less than the estimated amount,
only the actual organization costs will be deducted from the assets of
the Trust.



Accrued Interest.



Accrued interest represents unpaid interest on a bond from the last day
it paid interest. Interest on the Securities generally is paid
semiannually, although the Trust accrues such interest daily. Because
the Trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected,
the Public Offering Price of Units will have added to it the
proportionate share of accrued interest to the date of settlement. You
will receive the amount, if any, of accrued interest you paid for on the
next distribution date. In addition, if you sell or redeem your Units
you will be entitled to receive your proportionate share of accrued
interest from the purchaser of your Units.



Minimum Purchase.



The minimum amount you can purchase of the Trust is generally $1,000
worth of Units ($1,000 if you are purchasing Units for your Individual
Retirement Account or any other qualified retirement plan), but such
amounts may vary depending on your selling firm.



Sales Charges.



Initial Offering Period. The maximum sales charge during the initial
offering period equals 3.95% of the Public Offering Price (equivalent to
4.112% of the net amount invested).


Secondary Market. The maximum sales charge during the secondary market
is determined based upon the number of years remaining to the maturity
of each Security in the Trust, but in no event will the secondary market
sales charge exceed 4.80% of the Public Offering Price (equivalent to
5.042% of the net amount invested). For purposes of computation,
Securities will be deemed to mature either on their expressed maturity
dates, or an earlier date if: (a) they have been called for redemption


Page 18


or funds have been placed in escrow to redeem them on an earlier call
date; or (b) such Securities are subject to a "mandatory tender." The
effect of this method of sales charge computation will be that different
sales charge rates will be applied to each of the Securities, in
accordance with the following schedule:








                                           Secondary

If you invest at least $100,000 including any proceeds as described
below (except if you are purchasing for "Wrap Fee Accounts" as described
below), the maximum sales charge for the amount of the investment
eligible to receive the reduced sales charge is reduced as follows:

requirement that only whole Units be issued.


The reduced sales charge for quantity purchases will apply only to
purchases made by the same person on any one day from any one dealer. To
help you reach the above levels, you can combine same day purchases of
Units of the Trust with any other same day purchases of other trusts for
which we are Principal Underwriter and are currently in the initial
offering period. In addition, we will also consider Units you purchase
in the name of your spouse or child under 21 years of age to be
purchases by you. The reduced sales charge will also apply to a trustee
or other fiduciary purchasing Units for a single trust estate or single
fiduciary account including pension, profit sharing or employee benefit
plans, as well as multiple-employee benefit plans of a single employer
or affiliated employers (provided they are not aggregated with personal
accounts). You must inform your dealer of any combined purchases before
the sale in order to be eligible for the reduced sales charge.


Investors purchasing Units through registered broker/dealers who charge
periodic fees in lieu of commissions or who charge for financial
planning, investment advisory or asset management services or provide
these or comparable services as part of an investment account where a
comprehensive "wrap fee" or similar charge is imposed ("Wrap Fee
Accounts") can purchase Units at the Public Offering Price less the
applicable dealer concession. Certain Wrap Fee Accounts Unit holders may
be assessed transaction or other account fees on the purchase and/or
redemption of such Units by their broker/dealer or other processing
organizations for providing certain transaction or account activities.
Wrap Fee Accounts Units are not available for purchase in the secondary
market. We reserve the right to limit or deny purchases of Units not
subject to the transactional sales charge by investors whose frequent
trading activity we determine to be detrimental to the Trust.


Employees, officers and directors (and immediate family members) of the
Sponsor, our related companies and dealers may purchase Units at the
Public Offering Price less the applicable dealer concession. Immediate
family members include spouses, children, grandchildren, parents,
grandparents, siblings, mothers-in-law, fathers-in-law, sons-in-law,
daughters-in-law, brothers-in-law and sisters-in-law, and trustees,
custodians or fiduciaries for the benefit of such persons.


The Sponsor and certain dealers may establish a schedule where
employees, officers and directors of such dealers can purchase Units of
the Trust at the Public Offering Price less the established schedule
amount, which is designed to compensate such dealers for activities
relating to the sale of Units (the "Employee Dealer Concession").



The Value of the Securities.



The Evaluator will appraise the aggregate underlying value of the
Securities in the Trust as of the Evaluation Time on each business day
and will adjust the Public Offering Price of the Units according to this
valuation. This Public Offering Price will be effective for all orders
received before the Evaluation Time on each such day. If we or the
Trustee receive orders for purchases, sales or redemptions after that
time, or on a day which is not a business day, they will be held until
the next determination of price. The term "business day" as used in this
prospectus will exclude Saturdays, Sundays and holidays on which the
NYSE is closed.


The aggregate underlying value of the Securities in the Trust will be
determined as follows:


Page 19


a) On the basis of current market offering prices for the Securities
obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds
comparable to those held by the Trust;


b) If such prices are not available for any of the Securities, on the
basis of current market offering prices of comparable bonds;


c) By determining the value of the Securities on the offering side of
the market by appraisal; or


d) By any combination of the above.


After the initial offering period is over, the aggregate underlying
value of the Securities will be determined as set forth above, except
that bid prices are used instead of ask prices when necessary. The
offering price of the Securities may be expected to be greater than
their bid price by approximately 1-3% of the aggregate principal amount
of such Securities.



Distribution of Units



We intend to qualify Units of the Trust for sale in a number of states.
All Units will be sold at the current Public Offering Price.


The Sponsor compensates intermediaries, such as broker/dealers and
banks, for their activities that are intended to result in sales of
Units of the Trust. This compensation includes dealer concessions
described in the following section and may include additional
concessions and other compensation and benefits to broker/dealers and
other intermediaries.



Dealer Concessions.



Dealers and other selling agents can purchase Units at prices which
represent a concession or agency commission of $30.00 per Unit (80% of
the maximum sales charge for secondary market sales), subject to the
reduced concession applicable to volume purchases as set forth in
"Public Offering-Discounts for Certain Persons."


Eligible dealer firms and other selling agents who sell at least
$250,000 worth of Units will be entitled to the following additional
concessions with respect to total sales:








                                           Additional
Total Sales                                Concession
(in thousands)                              per Unit
_____________________                     ___________
$250 but less than $1,000                    $1.00
$1,000 or more                               $2.00








Underwriters other than the Sponsor will sell Units of the Trust to
other broker/dealers and selling agents at the Public Offering Price per
Unit less a concession or agency commission not in excess of the
underwriter concession allowed to the Underwriters by the Sponsor as
described under "Underwriting Concessions" below. In addition, dealers
and other selling agents may sell Units of the Trust to other
broker/dealers and other selling agents at the Public Offering Price
less a concession or agency commission not in excess of the dealer
concessions set forth above.


In addition, eligible dealer firms and other selling agents who, during
the previous consecutive 12-month period through the end of the most
recent month, sold primary market units of unit investment trusts
sponsored by us in the dollar amounts shown below will be entitled to
the following additional sales concession on primary market sales of
units during the current month of unit investment trusts sponsored by us:








Total Sales                               Additional
(in millions)                             Concession
_____________________                     ___________
$25 but less than $100                      0.050%
$100 but less than $150                     0.075%
$150 but less than $250                     0.100%
$250 but less than $500                     0.115%
$500 but less than $750                     0.125%
$750 but less than $1,000                   0.130%
$1,000 but less than $1,500                 0.135%
$1,500 but less than $2,000                 0.140%
$2,000 but less than $3,000                 0.150%
$3,000 but less than $4,000                 0.160%
$4,000 but less than $5,000                 0.170%
$5,000 or more                              0.175%








Dealers and other selling agents will not receive a concession on the
sale of Wrap Fee Account Units, but such Units will be included in
determining whether the above volume sales levels are met. Eligible
dealer firms and other selling agents include clearing firms that place
orders with First Trust and provide First Trust with information with
respect to the representatives who initiated such transactions. Eligible
dealer firms and other selling agents will not include firms that solely
provide clearing services to other broker/dealer firms or firms who
place orders through clearing firms that are eligible dealers. We
reserve the right to change the amount of concessions or agency
commissions from time to time. Certain commercial banks may be making
Units of the Trust available to their customers on an agency basis. A
portion of the sales charge paid by these customers is kept by or given
to the banks in the amounts shown above.


Page 20



Other Compensation and Benefits to Broker/Dealers.



The Sponsor, at its own expense and out of its own profits, currently
provides additional compensation and benefits to broker/dealers who sell
shares of Units of this Trust and other First Trust products. This
compensation is intended to result in additional sales of First Trust
products and/or compensate broker/dealers and financial advisors for
past sales. A number of factors are considered in determining whether to
pay these additional amounts. Such factors may include, but are not
limited to, the level or type of services provided by the intermediary,
the level or expected level of sales of First Trust products by the
intermediary or its agents, the placing of First Trust products on a
preferred or recommended product list, access to an intermediary's
personnel, and other factors. The Sponsor makes these payments for
marketing, promotional or related expenses, including, but not limited
to, expenses of entertaining retail customers and financial advisers,
advertising, sponsorship of events or seminars, obtaining information
about the breakdown of unit sales among an intermediary's
representatives or offices, obtaining shelf space in broker/dealer firms
and similar activities designed to promote the sale of the Sponsor's
products. The Sponsor makes such payments to a substantial majority of
intermediaries that sell First Trust products. The Sponsor may also make
certain payments to, or on behalf of, intermediaries to defray a portion
of their costs incurred for the purpose of facilitating Unit sales, such
as the costs of developing or purchasing trading systems to process Unit
trades. Payments of such additional compensation described in this and
the preceding paragraph, some of which may be characterized as "revenue
sharing," may create an incentive for financial intermediaries and their
agents to sell or recommend a First Trust product, including the Trust,
over products offered by other sponsors or fund companies. These
arrangements will not change the price you pay for your Units.



Advertising and Investment Comparisons.



Advertising materials regarding the Trust may discuss several topics,
including: developing a long-term financial plan; working with your
financial professional; the nature and risks of various investment
strategies and unit investment trusts that could help you reach your
financial goals; the importance of discipline; how the Trust operates;
how securities are selected; various unit investment trust features such
as convenience and costs; and options available for certain types of
unit investment trusts. These materials may include descriptions of the
principal businesses of the companies represented in the Trust, research
analysis of why they were selected and information relating to the
qualifications of the persons or entities providing the research
analysis. In addition, they may include research opinions on the economy
and industry sectors included and a list of investment products
generally appropriate for pursuing those recommendations.


From time to time we may compare the estimated returns of the Trust
(which may show performance net of the expenses and charges the Trust
would have incurred) and returns over specified periods of other similar
trusts we sponsor in our advertising and sales materials, with (1)
returns on other taxable investments such as the common stocks
comprising various market indexes, corporate or U.S. Government bonds,
bank CDs and money market accounts or funds, (2) performance data from
Morningstar Publications, Inc. or (3) information from publications such
as Money, The New York Times, U.S. News and World Report, Bloomberg
Businessweek, Forbes or Fortune. The investment characteristics of the
Trust differ from other comparative investments. You should not assume
that these performance comparisons will be representative of the Trust's
future performance. We may also, from time to time, use advertising
which classifies trusts or portfolio securities according to
capitalization and/or investment style.



Underwriting Concessions



The Agreement Among Underwriters provides that a public offering of the
Units of each Trust will be made at the Public Offering Price described
in the prospectus. Units may also be sold to or through dealers and
other selling agents during the initial offering period and in the
secondary market at prices representing a concession or agency
commission as described in "Distribution of Units."


The Sponsor will receive from the Underwriters the excess over the gross
sales commission contained in the following table:








                                          Underwriting
Total Sales                               Concession
(in thousands)                             Per Unit
_________________                        ________________
$250 but less than $1,000                    $31.00
$1,000 or more                               $32.00








Any reduced sales charge for quantity purchases listed under "Discounts
for Certain Persons" is the responsibility of the Underwriter making the
sale.


Page 21


In addition to any other benefits that the Underwriters may realize from
the sale of the Units of the Trust, the Agreement Among Underwriters
provides that the Sponsor will share with the other Underwriters, on a
pro rata basis, 50% of the net gain, if any, represented by the
difference between the Sponsor's cost of the Securities in connection
with their acquisition and the Aggregate Offering Price thereof on the
Initial Date of Deposit, less a charge for acquiring the Securities in
the portfolio and for the Sponsor maintaining a secondary market for the
Units. Underwriters are not, however, eligible to receive the additional
dealer concession in connection with sales of $250,000 or more of Units
of this Trust as set forth in "Distribution of Units."

Underwriters:








The Sponsor's Profits



We will receive a gross sales commission equal to the maximum sales
charge per Unit for the Trust less any reduction as stated in "Public
Offering." Also, any difference between our cost to purchase the
Securities and the price at which we sell them to the Trust is
considered a profit or loss (see Note 2 of "Notes to Schedule of
Investments"). During the initial offering period, dealers and others
may also realize profits or sustain losses as a result of fluctuations
in the Public Offering Price they receive when they sell the Units.


In maintaining a market for the Units, any difference between the price
at which we purchase Units and the price at which we sell or redeem them
will be a profit or loss to us.



The Secondary Market



Although not obligated, we may maintain a market for the Units after the
initial offering period and continuously offer to purchase Units at
prices based on the Redemption Price per Unit.


We will pay all expenses to maintain a secondary market, except the
Evaluator fees, Trustee costs to transfer and record the ownership of
Units and costs incurred in annually updating the Trust's registration
statement. We may discontinue purchases of Units at any time. IF YOU
WISH TO DISPOSE OF YOUR UNITS, YOU SHOULD ASK US FOR THE CURRENT MARKET
PRICES BEFORE MAKING A TENDER FOR REDEMPTION TO THE TRUSTEE (OR THE FTPS
UNIT SERVICING AGENT IN THE CASE OF FTPS UNITS).



How We Purchase Units



The Trustee (or the FTPS Unit Servicing Agent in the case of FTPS Units)
will notify us of any tender of Units for redemption. If our bid at that
time is equal to or greater than the Redemption Price per Unit, we may
purchase the Units. You will receive your proceeds from the sale no
later than if they were redeemed by the Trustee. We may tender Units we
hold to the Trustee for redemption as any other Units. If we elect not
to purchase Units, the Trustee (or the FTPS Unit Servicing Agent in the
case of FTPS Units) may sell Units tendered for redemption in the over-
the-counter market, if any. However, the amount you will receive is the
same as you would have received on redemption of the Units.



Expenses and Charges



The estimated annual expenses of the Trust are listed under "Fee Table."
If actual expenses of the Trust exceed the estimate, the Trust will bear
the excess, other than for excess annual audit costs. The Trustee will
pay operating expenses of the Trust from the Interest Account of the
Trust if funds are available, and then from the Principal Account. The
Interest and Principal Accounts are non-interest-bearing to Unit holders,
so the Trustee may earn interest on these funds, thus benefiting from
their use.


First Trust Advisors L.P., an affiliate of ours, acts as Portfolio
Supervisor and Evaluator and will be compensated for providing portfolio
supervisory services and evaluation services as well as bookkeeping and
other administrative services to the Trust. In providing portfolio
supervisory services, the Portfolio Supervisor may purchase research
services from a number of sources, which may include underwriters or
dealers of the Trust. In addition, the Portfolio Supervisor may, at its


Page 22


own expense, employ one or more sub-Portfolio Supervisors to assist in
providing services to the Trust. The Portfolio Supervisor has employed
BondWave, LLC ("BondWave"), an affiliate of the Sponsor, as sub-
Portfolio Supervisor. BondWave, based in Wheaton, Illinois, specializes
in providing strategies and solutions for the management of fixed-income
investments. As Sponsor, we will receive brokerage fees when the Trust
uses us (or an affiliate of ours) as agent in buying or selling
Securities. Legal and regulatory filing fees and expenses associated
with updating the Trust's registration statement yearly are also
chargeable to the Trust. As authorized by the Indenture, the Trustee may
employ a subsidiary or affiliate of the Trustee to act as broker to
execute certain transactions for the Trust. The Trust will pay for such
services at standard commission rates.


FTP Services LLC, an affiliate of ours, acts as FTPS Unit Servicing
Agent to the Trust with respect to the Trust's FTPS Units. FTPS Units
are Units which are purchased and sold through the Fund/SERV(R) trading
system or on a manual basis through FTP Services LLC. In all other
respects, FTPS Units are identical to other Units. FTP Services LLC will
be compensated for providing shareholder services to the FTPS Units.


The fees payable to First Trust Advisors L.P., FTP Services LLC and the
Trustee are based on the largest aggregate number of Units of the Trust
outstanding at any time during the calendar year, except during the
initial offering period, in which case these fees are calculated based
on the largest number of Units outstanding during the period for which
compensation is paid. These fees may be adjusted for inflation without
Unit holders' approval, but in no case will the annual fees paid to us
or our affiliate for providing services to all unit investment trusts be
more than the actual cost of providing such services in such year.


In addition to the Trust's operating expenses, and the fees set forth
above, the Trust may also incur the following charges:


- All legal and annual auditing expenses of the Trustee according to its
responsibilities under the Indenture;


- The expenses and costs incurred by the Trustee to protect the Trust
and your rights and interests;


- Fees for any extraordinary services the Trustee performed under the
Indenture;


- Payment for any loss, liability or expense the Trustee incurred
without negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on its part, in
connection with its acceptance or administration of the Trust;


- Payment for any loss, liability or expenses we incurred without
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct in acting as Sponsor of the
Trust; and/or


- All taxes and other government charges imposed upon the Securities or
any part of the Trust.


The above expenses and the Trustee's annual fee are secured by a lien on
the Trust. We cannot guarantee that distributions from the Securities
will be sufficient to meet any or all expenses of the Trust. If there is
not enough cash in the Interest or Principal Accounts of the Trust, the
Trustee has the power to sell Securities to make cash available to pay
these charges. These sales may result in capital gains or losses to the
Unit holders. See "Tax Status."


The Trust will be audited annually, so long as we are making a secondary
market for Units. We will bear the cost of these annual audits to the
extent the cost exceeds $0.50 per Unit. Otherwise, the Trust will pay
for the audit. You may request a copy of the audited financial
statements from the Trustee.



Tax Status




Federal Tax Matters.



This section summarizes some of the main U.S. federal income tax
consequences of owning Units of the Trust. This section is current as of
the date of this prospectus. Tax laws and interpretations change
frequently, and these summaries do not describe all of the tax
consequences to all taxpayers. For example, these summaries generally do
not describe your situation if you are a corporation, a non-U.S. person,
a broker/dealer, or other investor with special circumstances. In
addition, this section does not describe your state or foreign tax
consequences.


This federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of
counsel to the Sponsor. The Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") could
disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section. In addition,
our counsel was not asked to review, and has not reached a conclusion
with respect to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be
deposited in the Trust. This may not be sufficient for you to use for
the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law.


As with any investment, you should seek advice based on your individual
circumstances from your own tax advisor.



Trust Status.



The Trust intends to qualify as a "regulated investment company,"
commonly known as a "RIC," under the federal tax laws. If the Trust


Page 23


qualifies as a RIC and distributes its income as required by the tax
law, the Trust generally will not pay federal income taxes.


For federal income tax purposes, you are treated as the owner of Trust
Units and not of the assets held by the Trust. Taxability issues are
taken into account at the trust level. Your federal income tax treatment
of income from the Trust is based on the distributions paid by the Trust.



Income From the Trust.



Trust distributions are generally taxable. After the end of each year,
you will receive a tax statement that separates the Trust's
distributions into ordinary dividends, capital gains dividends and
returns of capital. Income reported is generally net of expenses (but
see Deductibility of Trust Expenses, below). Ordinary income
distributions are generally taxed at your ordinary tax rate. Generally,
you will treat all capital gains dividends as long-term capital gains
regardless of how long you have owned your Units. To determine your
actual tax liability for your capital gains dividends, you must
calculate your total net capital gain or loss for the tax year after
considering all of your other taxable transactions, as described below.
In addition, the Trust may make distributions that represent a return of
capital for tax purposes and thus will generally not be taxable to you.
The tax status of your distributions from the Trust is not affected by
whether you reinvest your distributions in additional Units or receive
them in cash. The income from the Trust that you must take into account
for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a
deferred sales charge, if any. The tax laws may require you to treat
distributions made to you in January as if you had received them on
December 31 of the previous year.


Under the "Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010," income
from the Trust may also be subject to a new 3.8% "Medicare tax" imposed
for taxable years beginning after 2012. This tax will generally apply to
your net investment income if your adjusted gross income exceeds certain
threshold amounts, which are $250,000 in the case of married couples
filing joint returns and $200,000 in the case of single individuals.



Dividends Received Deduction.



A corporation that owns Units generally will not be entitled to the
dividends received deduction with respect to dividends received from the
Trust because the dividends received deduction is generally not
available for distributions from regulated investment companies.



Sale or Redemption of Units.



If you sell or redeem your Units, you will generally recognize a taxable
gain or loss. To determine the amount of this gain or loss, you must
subtract your tax basis in your Units from the amount you receive in the
transaction. Your tax basis in your Units is generally equal to the cost
of your Units, generally including sales charges. In some cases,
however, you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your
Units.


For Units purchased on or after January 1, 2011 (or, 2012, if the Units
are acquired in a reinvestment plan in 2011), the information statement
you receive in regard to the sale or redemption of your Units may
contain information about your basis in the Units and whether any gain
or loss recognized by you should be considered long term or short term
capital gain. The information reported to you is based upon rules that
do not take into consideration all facts that may be known to you or
your advisors. You should consult with your tax advisors about any
adjustments that may need to be made to the information reported to you.



Capital Gains and Losses.



If you are an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net
capital gain is generally 15% (generally 0% for certain taxpayers in the
10% and 15% tax brackets). These capital gains rates are generally
effective for taxable years beginning before January 1, 2013. For later
periods, if you are an individual, the maximum marginal federal tax rate
for net capital gain is generally 20% (10% for certain taxpayers in the
10% and 15% tax brackets). The 20% rate is reduced to 18% for net
capital gains from most property acquired after December 31, 2000 with a
holding period of more than five years, and the 10% rate is reduced to
8% for net capital gains from most property (regardless of when
acquired) with a holding period of more than five years.


Net capital gain equals net long-term capital gain minus net short-term
capital loss for the taxable year. Capital gain or loss is long-term if
the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is short-term
if the holding period for the asset is one year or less. You must
exclude the date you purchase your Units to determine your holding
period. However, if you receive a capital gain dividend from the Trust
and sell your Units at a loss after holding it for six months or less,
the loss will be recharacterized as long term capital loss to the extent
of the capital gain dividend received. The tax rates for capital gains
realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as
for ordinary income. The Internal Revenue Code treats certain capital
gains as ordinary income in special situations.



Deductibility of Trust Expenses.



Expenses incurred and deducted by the Trust will generally not be
treated as income taxable to you. In some cases, however, you may be
required to treat your portion of these Trust expenses as income. In
these cases you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses.
However, certain miscellaneous itemized deductions, such as investment
expenses, may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of


Page 24


these deductions exceed 2% of the individual's adjusted gross income.



Foreign Investors.



If you are a foreign investor (i.e., an investor other than a U.S.
citizen or resident or a U.S. corporation, partnership, estate or
trust), you should be aware that, generally, subject to applicable tax
treaties, distributions from the Trust will be characterized as
dividends for federal income tax purposes (other than dividends which
the Trust properly reports as capital gain dividends) and will be
subject to U.S. income taxes, including withholding taxes, subject to
certain exceptions described below. However, distributions received by a
foreign investor from the Trust that are properly reported by such Trust
as capital gain dividends may not be subject to U.S. federal income
taxes, including withholding taxes, provided that the Trust makes
certain elections and certain other conditions are met. In the case of
dividends with respect to taxable years of the Trust beginning prior to
2012, distributions from the Trust that are properly reported by the
Trust as an interest-related dividend attributable to certain interest
income received by the Trust or as a short-term capital gain dividend
attributable to certain net short-term capital gain income received by
the Trust may not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes, including
withholding taxes when received by certain foreign investors, provided
that the Trust makes certain elections and certain other conditions are
met.


Distributions after December 31, 2012 may be subject to a U.S.
withholding tax of 30% in the case of distributions to (i) certain non-
U.S. financial institutions that have not entered into an agreement with
the U.S. Treasury to collect and disclose certain information and (ii)
certain other non-U.S. entities that do not provide certain
certifications and information about the entity's U.S. owners.


You should consult your tax advisor regarding potential foreign, state
or local taxation with respect to your Units.



Rights of Unit Holders




Unit Ownership.



Ownership of Units will not be evidenced by certificates. If you
purchase or hold Units through a broker/dealer or bank, your ownership
of Units will be recorded in book-entry form at the Depository Trust
Company ("DTC") and credited on its records to your broker/dealer's or
bank's DTC account. If you purchase or hold FTPS Units, your ownership
of FTPS Units will be recorded in book-entry form on the register of
Unit holdings maintained by the FTPS Unit Servicing Agent. If you
purchase or hold Units through First Trust's online transaction system
which enables certain financial representatives to process Unit trades
through the First Trust Advisor Direct system ("Advisor Direct"), your
ownership of Units ("Advisor Direct Units") will be recorded in book-
entry form on the register of Unit holdings maintained by the Trustee.
Transfer of Units will be accomplished by book entries made by DTC and
its participants if the Units are registered to DTC or its nominee, Cede
& Co., or otherwise will be accomplished by book entries made by the
FTPS Unit Servicing Agent, with respect to FTPS Units, or by the
Trustee, with respect to Advisor Direct Units. DTC will forward all
notices and credit all payments received in respect of the Units held by
the DTC participants. You will receive written confirmation of your
purchases and sales of Units from the broker/dealer or bank through
which you made the transaction or from the FTPS Unit Servicing Agent if
you purchased and hold FTPS Units or from Advisor Direct or the Trustee
with respect to Advisor Direct Units. You may transfer your Units by
contacting the broker/dealer or bank through which you hold your Units,
or the FTPS Unit Servicing Agent, if you hold FTPS Units, or Advisor
Direct or the Trustee, if you hold Advisor Direct Units.



Unit Holder Reports.



The Trustee will prepare a statement detailing the per Unit amounts (if
any) distributed from the Interest Account and Principal Account in
connection with each distribution. In addition, at the end of each
calendar year, the Trustee will prepare a statement which contains the
following information:


- A summary of transactions in the Trust for the year;


- A list of any Securities sold during the year and the Securities held
at the end of that year by the Trust;


- The Redemption Price per Unit, computed on the 31st day of December of
such year (or the last business day before); and


- Amounts of income and capital distributed during the year.


It is the responsibility of the entity through which you hold your Units
to distribute these statements to you. In addition, you may also request
from the Trustee copies of the evaluations of the Securities as prepared
by the Evaluator to enable you to comply with applicable federal and
state tax reporting requirements.


Interest and Principal
Distributions


You will begin receiving distributions on your Units only after you
become a Record Owner. The Trustee will credit interest received on the
Trust's Securities to the Interest Account of the Trust. All other
receipts, such as return of capital or capital gain dividends, are
credited to the Principal Account of the Trust.


After deducting the amount of accrued interest the Trustee advanced to
us as Unit holder of record as of the First Settlement Date, the Trustee
will distribute an amount substantially equal to your pro rata share of
the balance of the Interest Account calculated on the basis of one-
twelfth of the estimated annual amount of interest received in the
Interest Account after deducting estimated expenses on or near the
Distribution Dates to Unit holders of record on the preceding
Distribution Record Date. See "Summary of Essential Information" for the
Trust. Because interest is not received by the Trust at a constant rate
throughout the year, the distributions you receive may be more or less
than the amount credited to the Interest Account as of the Distribution
Record Date. In order to minimize fluctuations in distributions, the


Page 25


Trustee is authorized to advance such amounts as may be necessary to
provide distributions of approximately equal amounts. The Trustee will
be reimbursed, without interest, for any such advances from funds in the
Interest Account at the next Distribution Record Date. The Trustee will
distribute amounts in the Principal Account on the twenty-fifth day of
each month to Unit holders of record on the tenth day of each month
provided the amount equals at least $1.00 per Unit. However, amounts in
the Principal Account from the sale of Securities designated to meet
redemptions of Units or pay expenses will not be distributed. In any
case, the Trustee will distribute any funds in the Principal Account in
December of each year and as part of the final liquidation distribution.
If the Trustee does not have your TIN, it is required to withhold a
certain percentage of your distribution and deliver such amount to the
IRS. You may recover this amount by giving your TIN to the Trustee, or
when you file a tax return. However, you should check your statements to
make sure the Trustee has your TIN to avoid this "back-up withholding."


Within a reasonable time after the Trust is terminated you will receive
the pro rata share of the money from the disposition of the Securities.


The Trustee may establish reserves (the "Reserve Account") within the
Trust to cover anticipated state and local taxes or any governmental
charges to be paid out of the Trust.



Redeeming Your Units



You may redeem all or a portion of your Units at any time by sending a
request for redemption to your broker/dealer or bank through which you
hold your Units or to the FTPS Unit Servicing Agent, if you hold FTPS
Units, or Advisor Direct, if you hold Advisor Direct Units. No
redemption fee will be charged, but you are responsible for any
governmental charges that apply. Certain broker/dealers may charge a
transaction fee for processing redemption requests. Three business days
after the day you tender your Units (the "Date of Tender") you will
receive cash in an amount for each Unit equal to the Redemption Price
per Unit calculated at the Evaluation Time on the Date of Tender.


The Date of Tender is considered to be the date on which your redemption
request is received by the Trustee from the broker/dealer or bank
through which you hold your Units, or, if you hold FTPS Units, the date
the redemption request is received by the FTPS Servicing Agent, or, if
you hold Advisor Direct Units, the date the redemption request is
received either by Advisor Direct or the Trustee, as applicable (if such
day is a day the NYSE is open for trading). However, if the redemption
request is received after 4:00 p.m. Eastern time (or after any earlier
closing time on a day on which the NYSE is scheduled in advance to close
at such earlier time), the Date of Tender is the next day the NYSE is
open for trading.


Any amounts paid on redemption representing interest will be withdrawn
from the Interest Account if funds are available for that purpose, or
from the Principal Account. All other amounts paid on redemption will be
taken from the Principal Account. The IRS will require the Trustee to
withhold a portion of your redemption proceeds if the Trustee does not
have your TIN as generally discussed under "Interest and Principal
Distributions."


The Trustee may sell Securities in the Trust to make funds available for
redemption. If Securities are sold, the size and diversification of the
Trust will be reduced. These sales may result in lower prices than if
the Securities were sold at a different time.


Your right to redeem Units (and therefore, your right to receive
payment) may be delayed:


- If the NYSE is closed (other than customary weekend and holiday
closings);


- If the SEC determines that trading on the NYSE is restricted or that
an emergency exists making sale or evaluation of the Securities not
reasonably practical; or


- For any other period permitted by SEC order.


The Trustee is not liable to any person for any loss or damage which may
result from such a suspension or postponement.



The Redemption Price.



The Redemption Price per Unit is determined by the Trustee by:


adding


1. cash in the Interest and Principal Accounts of the Trust not
designated to purchase Securities;


2. the aggregate underlying value of the Securities held in the Trust; and


3. accrued interest on the Securities; and


deducting


1. any applicable taxes or governmental charges that need to be paid out
of the Trust;


2. any amounts owed to the Trustee for its advances;


3. estimated accrued expenses of the Trust, if any;


4. cash held for distribution to Unit holders of record of the Trust as
of the business day before the evaluation being made; and


5. other liabilities incurred by the Trust; and


Page 26


dividing


1. the result by the number of outstanding Units of the Trust.


Until the end of the initial offering period, the Redemption Price per
Unit will include estimated organization costs as set forth under "Fee
Table."



Removing Securities from the Trust



The portfolio of the Trust is not managed. However, we may, but are not
required to, direct the Trustee to dispose of a Security in certain
limited circumstances, including situations in which:


-  The issuer of the Security has defaulted in the payment of principal
or interest on the Security;


-  Any action or proceeding seeking to restrain or enjoin the payment of
principal or interest on the Security has been instituted;


-  There is any legal question or impediment affecting the Security;


-  The issuer of the Security has breached a covenant which would affect
the payment of principal or interest on the Security, the issuer's
credit standing, or otherwise damage the sound investment character of
the Security;


-  The issuer has defaulted on the payment of any other of its
outstanding obligations;


-  The Security is the subject of an advanced refunding;


-  The sale of Securities is necessary or advisable (i) in order to
maintain the qualification of the Trust as a "regulated investment
company" or (ii) to provide funds to make any distribution for a taxable
year in order to avoid imposition of any income or excise taxes on
undistributed income in the Trust;


-  Such factors arise which, in our opinion, adversely affect the tax or
exchange control status of the Security;


-  The price of the Security has declined to such an extent, or such
other credit factors exist, that in our opinion keeping the Security
would be harmful to the Trust; or


- The sale of the Security is necessary for the Trust to comply with
such federal and/or state securities laws, regulations and/or regulatory
actions and interpretations which may be in effect from time to time.


If a Security defaults in the payment of principal or interest and no
provision for payment is made, the Trustee must notify us of this fact.
If we fail to instruct the Trustee whether to sell or hold the Security
within 30 days of our being notified, the Trustee may, in its
discretion, sell any defaulted Securities and will not be liable for any
depreciation or loss incurred thereby.


Except for instances in which the Trust acquires Replacement Securities
as described in "The First Trust Combined Series," the Trust will
generally not acquire any bonds or other property other than the
Securities. The Trustee, on behalf of the Trust and at the direction of
the Sponsor, will vote for or against any offer for new or exchanged
bonds or property in exchange for a Security. In that regard, we may
instruct the Trustee to accept such an offer or to take any other action
with respect thereto as we may deem proper if the issuer is in default
with respect to such Securities or in our written opinion the issuer
will likely default in respect to such Securities in the foreseeable
future. Any obligations received in exchange or substitution will be
held by the Trustee subject to the terms and conditions in the Indenture
to the same extent as Securities originally deposited in the Trust. We
may get advice from the Portfolio Supervisor before reaching a decision
regarding the receipt of new or exchange securities or property. The
Trustee may retain and pay us or an affiliate of ours to act as agent
for the Trust to facilitate selling Securities, exchanged bonds or
property from the Trust. If we or our affiliate act in this capacity, we
will be held subject to the restrictions under the 1940 Act.


The Trustee may sell Securities designated by us, or, absent our
direction, at its own discretion, in order to meet redemption requests
or pay expenses. We will maintain a list with the Trustee of which
Securities should be sold. We may consider sales of units of unit
investment trusts which we sponsor in making recommendations to the
Trustee on the selection of broker/dealers to execute the Trust's
portfolio transactions, or when acting as agent for the Trust in
acquiring or selling Securities on behalf of the Trust.



Amending or Terminating the Indenture



Amendments. The Indenture may be amended by us and the Trustee without
your consent:


- To cure ambiguities;


- To correct or supplement any defective or inconsistent provision;


- To make any amendment required by any governmental agency; or


- To make other changes determined not to be adverse to your best
interests (as determined by us and the Trustee).


Page 27


Termination. As provided by the Indenture, the Trust will terminate upon
the redemption, sale or other disposition of the last Security held in
the Trust, but in no case later than the Termination Date as stated in
the "Summary of Essential Information." The Trust may be terminated
prior to the Termination Date:


- Upon the consent of 100% of the Unit holders of the Trust;


- If the value of the Securities owned by the Trust as shown by any
evaluation is less than 20% of the aggregate principal amount of
Securities deposited in the Trust during the initial offering period
("Discretionary Liquidation Amount"); or


- In the event that Units of the Trust not yet sold aggregating more
than 60% of the Units of such Trust are tendered for redemption by
underwriters, including the Sponsor.


If the Trust is terminated due to this last reason, we will refund your
entire sales charge. For various reasons, the Trust may be reduced below
the Discretionary Liquidation Amount and could therefore be terminated
before the Termination Date.


The Trustee will notify you of any termination prior to the Termination
Date. You will receive a cash distribution from the sale of the
remaining Securities, along with your interest in the Interest and
Principal Accounts of the Trust, within a reasonable time after the
Trust is terminated. The sale of Securities upon termination may result
in a lower sales price than might otherwise be realized if the sale were
not required at that time. For this reason, among others, the amount
realized by a Unit holder upon termination may be less than the
principal amount of Securities per Unit or value at the time of
purchase. The Trustee will deduct from the Trust any accrued costs,
expenses, advances or indemnities provided for by the Indenture,
including estimated compensation of the Trustee and costs of liquidation
and any amounts required as a reserve to pay any taxes or other
governmental charges.

Description of Bond Ratings*



* As published by Standard & Poor's.



Standard & Poor's.



A Standard & Poor's issue credit rating is a forward-looking opinion
about the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific
financial obligation, a specific class of financial obligations, or a
specific financial program (including ratings on medium-term note
programs and commercial paper programs). It takes into consideration the
creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers, or other forms of credit
enhancement on the obligation and takes into account the currency in
which the obligation is denominated. The opinion reflects Standard &


Page 29


Poor's view of the obligor's capacity and willingness to meet its
financial commitments as they come due, and may assess terms, such as
collateral security and subordination, which could affect ultimate
payment in the event of default.


Issue credit ratings can be either long-term or short-term. Short-term
ratings are generally assigned to those obligations considered short-
term in the relevant market. In the United States, for example, that
means obligations with an original maturity of no more than 365 days-
including commercial paper. Short-term ratings are also used to indicate
the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to put features on long-
term obligations. The result is a dual rating, in which the short-term
rating addresses the put feature, in addition to the usual long-term
rating. Medium-term notes are assigned long-term ratings.



Long-Term Issue Credit Ratings.



Issue credit ratings are based, in varying degrees, on the following
considerations:


1. Likelihood of payment: capacity and willingness of the obligor to
meet its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the
terms of the obligation;


2. Nature of and provisions of the obligation;


3. Protection afforded by, and relative position of, the obligation in
the event of bankruptcy, reorganization, or other arrangement under the
laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors' rights.


The issue rating definitions are an assessment of default risk, but may
incorporate an assessment of relative seniority or ultimate recovery in
the event of default. Junior obligations are typically rated lower than
senior obligations, to reflect the lower priority in bankruptcy, as
noted above. (Such differentiation may apply when an entity has both
senior and subordinated obligations, secured and unsecured obligations,
or operating company and holding company obligations.)


AAA An obligation rated "AAA" has the highest rating assigned by
Standard & Poor's. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial
commitment on the obligation is extremely strong.


AA  An obligation rated "AA" differs from the highest rated obligations
only in small degree. The obligor's capacity to meet its financial
commitment on the obligation is very strong.


A   An obligation rated "A" is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse
effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than
obligations in higher rated categories. However, the obligor's capacity
to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is still strong.


BBB An obligation rated "BBB" exhibits adequate protection parameters.
However, adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more
likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its
financial commitment on the obligation.


Obligations rated "BB," "B," "CCC," "CC" and "C" are regarded as having
significant speculative characteristics. "BB" indicates the least degree
of speculation and "C" the highest. While such obligations will likely
have some quality and protective characteristics, these may be
outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse
conditions.


BB  An obligation rated "BB" is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other
speculative issues. However, it faces major ongoing uncertainties or
exposure to adverse business, financial, or economic conditions which
could lead to the obligor's inadequate capacity to meet its financial
commitment on the obligation.


B   An obligation rated "B" is more vulnerable to nonpayment than
obligations rated "BB," but the obligor currently has the capacity to
meet its financial commitment on the obligation. Adverse business,
financial, or economic conditions will likely impair the obligor's
capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the
obligation.


CCC An obligation rated "CCC" is currently vulnerable to nonpayment, and
is dependent upon favorable business, financial, and economic conditions
for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation. In
the event of adverse business, financial, or economic conditions, the
obligor is not likely to have the capacity to meet its financial
commitment on the obligation.


CC  An obligation rated "CC" is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment.


C   A "C" rating is assigned to obligations that are currently highly
vulnerable to nonpayment, obligations that have payment arrearages
allowed by the terms of the documents, or obligations of an issuer that
is the subject of a bankruptcy petition or similar action which have not
experienced a payment default. Among others, the "C" rating may be
assigned to subordinated debt, preferred stock or other obligations on
which cash payments have been suspended in accordance with the
instrument's terms or when preferred stock is the subject of a
distressed exchange offer, whereby some or all of the issue is either


Page 30


repurchased for an amount of cash or replaced by other instruments
having a total value that is less than par.


D   An obligation rated "D" is in payment default. The "D" rating
category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date
due even if the applicable grace period has not expired, unless Standard
& Poor's believes that such payments will be made during such grade
period. The "D" rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy
petition or the taking of a similar action if payments on an obligation
are jeopardized. An obligation's rating is lowered to "D" upon
completion of a distressed exchange offer, whereby some or all of the
issue is either repurchased for an amount of cash or replaced by other
instruments having a total value that is less than par.


Plus(+) or Minus(-): The ratings from "AA" to "CCC" may be modified by
the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within
the major rating categories.


Expected Ratings are designated on the "Schedule of Investments" by an
"(e)" after the rating code. Expected Ratings are intended to anticipate
S&P's forthcoming rating assignments. Expected Ratings are generated by
Bloomberg based on sources it considers reliable or established S&P
rating practices. Expected Ratings exist only until S&P assigns a rating
to the issue.

Risk Factors.



The Trust will invest most of its net assets in securities issued by or
on behalf of (or in certificates of participation in lease-purchase
obligations of) certain states or United States Territories. The Trust
is therefore susceptible to general or particular economic, political or
regulatory factors that may affect issuers of such obligations. The
following information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the
many complex factors that may have an effect. The information does not
apply to "conduit" obligations on which the public issuer itself has no
financial responsibility. This information is derived from official
statements of certain national issuers published in connection with
their issuance of securities and from other publicly available
information, and is believed to be accurate. No independent verification
has been made of any of the following information.


The timely payment of principal of and interest on certain of the
Securities may be guaranteed by bond insurance purchased by certain of
the issuers or other parties.


Insurance Risk. Certain of the bonds in the Trust are insured. In the
case of insured bonds, insurance has been obtained either by the issuer
of bonds in the Trust, by a prior owner of such bonds, or by the Sponsor
prior to the deposit of such bonds in the Trust guaranteeing prompt
payment of interest and principal, when due, in respect of such bonds in
the Trust. The premium for any preinsured bond insurance has been paid
by such issuer, by a prior owner of such bonds or the Sponsor and any
such policy or policies are non-cancellable and will continue in force
so long as the bonds so insured are outstanding and the respective
preinsured bond insurer remains in business. If the provider of an
original issuance insurance policy is unable to meet its obligations
under such policy or if the rating assigned to the claims-paying ability
of any such insurer deteriorates, the insurers have no obligation to
insure any issue adversely affected by either of the above described
events.


Page 1


In order to be in an Insured Trust, bonds must be insured by an insurer.
In determining eligibility for insurance, insurers have applied their
own standards which correspond generally to the standards they normally
use in establishing the insurability of new issues of municipal bonds
and which are not necessarily the criteria used in the selection of
bonds by the Sponsor. To the extent the standards of the insurers are
more restrictive than those of the Sponsor, the previously stated Trust
investment criteria have been limited with respect to the bonds. This
decision is made prior to the Date of Deposit, as debt obligations not
eligible for insurance are not deposited in an Insured Trust. Thus, all
of the bonds in the portfolios of the Insured Trusts are insured by the
issuer of the bonds, by a prior owner of such bonds or by the Sponsor
prior to the deposit of such bonds in a Trust.


In the event of nonpayment of interest or principal, when due, in
respect of a bond, an insurer shall make such payment after the
respective insurer has been notified that such nonpayment has occurred
or is threatened (but not earlier than the date such payment is due).
The insurer, as regards any payment it may make, will succeed to the
rights of the Trustee in respect thereof. All policies issued by the
insurers are substantially identical insofar as obligations to an
Insured Trust are concerned.


Each insurer is subject to regulation by the department of insurance in
the state in which it is qualified to do business. Such regulation,
however, is no guarantee that each insurer will be able to perform on
its contract of insurance in the event a claim should be made thereunder
at some time in the future. At the date hereof, it is reported that no
claims have been submitted or are expected to be submitted to any of the
insurers which would materially impair the ability of any such company
to meet its commitment pursuant to any contract of bond or portfolio
insurance.


There have been a number of recent developments with respect to ratings
actions impacting insurance companies by the rating agencies, Standard &
Poor's Ratings Group, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.
("S&P"), Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") and Fitch Ratings
Ltd. ("Fitch"). In light of the ongoing nature of ratings actions or
announcements by the rating agencies, you should consult announcements
by the rating agencies, the websites of the rating agencies and the
websites of the insurers for the then current publicly available
information. These ratings actions have had a significant impact on the
ability of insurers to compete in the financial guarantee business.



Municipal Securities.



Certain of the bonds may be general obligations of a governmental entity
that are backed by the taxing power of such entity. Other bonds in the
funds may be revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project
or authority and are not supported by the issuer's power to levy taxes.
General obligation bonds are secured by the issuer's pledge of its
faith, credit and taxing power for the payment of principal and
interest. Revenue bonds, on the other hand, are payable only from the
revenues derived from a particular facility or class of facilities or,
in some cases, from the proceeds of a special excise tax or other
specific revenue source. There are, of course, variations in the
security of the different bonds in the funds, both within a particular
classification and between classifications, depending on numerous
factors. A description of certain types of revenue bonds follows.


Healthcare Revenue Securities. Certain of the bonds may be healthcare
revenue bonds. Ratings of bonds issued for healthcare facilities are
sometimes based on feasibility studies that contain projections of
occupancy levels, revenues and expenses. A facility's gross receipts and
net income available for debt service may be affected by future events
and conditions including among other things, demand for services, the
ability of the facility to provide the services required, physicians'
confidence in the facility, management capabilities, competition with
other hospitals, efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit
rates, legislation establishing state rate-setting agencies, expenses,
government regulation, the cost and possible unavailability of
malpractice insurance and the termination or restriction of governmental
financial assistance, including that associated with Medicare, Medicaid
and other similar third party payor programs. Pursuant to recent Federal
legislation, Medicare reimbursements are currently calculated on a
prospective basis utilizing a single nationwide schedule of rates. Prior
to such legislation Medicare reimbursements were based on the actual
costs incurred by the health facility. The current legislation may
adversely affect reimbursements to hospitals and other facilities for
services provided under the Medicare program.


Multi-Family Mortgage Revenue Securities. Certain of the bonds may be
obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from housing
projects for low to moderate income families. The ability of such
issuers to make debt service payments will be affected by events and
conditions affecting financed projects, including, among other things,
the achievement and maintenance of sufficient occupancy levels and
adequate rental income, increases in taxes, employment and income
conditions prevailing in local labor markets, utility costs and other


Page 2


operating expenses, the managerial ability of project managers, changes
in laws and governmental regulations, the appropriation of subsidies and
social and economic trends affecting the localities in which the
projects are located. The occupancy of housing projects may be adversely
affected by high rent levels and income limitations imposed under
Federal and state programs. Multi-family mortgage revenue bonds are
subject to redemption and call features, including extraordinary
mandatory redemption features, upon prepayment, sale or non-origination
of mortgage loans as well as upon the occurrence of other events.
Certain issuers of multi-family housing bonds have considered various
ways to redeem bonds they have issued prior to the stated first
redemption dates for such bonds. In one situation the New York City
Housing Development Corporation, in reliance on its interpretation of
certain language in the indenture under which one of its bond issues was
created, redeemed all of such issue at par in spite of the fact that
such indenture provided that the first optional redemption was to
include a premium over par and could not occur prior to 1992.


Water and Sewerage Revenue Securities. Certain of the bonds may be
obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived from the sale of water
and/or sewerage services. Water and sewerage bonds are generally payable
from user fees. Problems faced by such issuers include the ability to
obtain timely and adequate rate increases, population decline resulting
in decreased user fees, the difficulty of financing large construction
programs, the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays
attributable to environmental considerations, the increasing difficulty
of obtaining or discovering new supplies of fresh water, the effect of
conservation programs and the impact of "no-growth" zoning ordinances.
All of such issuers have been experiencing certain of these problems in
varying degrees.


Utility Revenue Securities. Certain of the bonds may be obligations of
issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from the sale of energy.
Utilities are generally subject to extensive regulation by state utility
commissions which, among other things, establish the rates which may be
charged and the appropriate rate of return on an approved asset base.
The problems faced by such issuers include the difficulty in obtaining
approval for timely and adequate rate increases from the governing
public utility commission, the difficulty in financing large
construction programs, the limitations on operations and increased costs
and delays attributable to environmental considerations, increased
competition, recent reductions in estimates of future demand for
electricity in certain areas of the country, the difficulty of the
capital market in absorbing utility debt, the difficulty in obtaining
fuel at reasonable prices and the effect of energy conservation. All of
such issuers have been experiencing certain of these problems in varying
degrees. In addition, Federal, state and municipal governmental
authorities may from time to time review existing legislation and impose
additional regulations governing the licensing, construction and
operation of nuclear power plants, which may adversely affect the
ability of the issuers of such bonds to make payments of principal
and/or interest on such bonds.


Lease Obligation Revenue Securities. Certain of the bonds may be lease
obligations issued for the most part by governmental authorities that
have no taxing power or other means of directly raising revenues.
Rather, the governmental authorities are financing vehicles created
solely for the construction of buildings (schools, administrative
offices, convention centers and prisons, for example) or the purchase of
equipment (police cars and computer systems, for example) that will be
used by a state or local government (the "lessee"). Thus, these
obligations are subject to the ability and willingness of the lessee
government to meet its lease rental payments which include debt service
on the obligations. Lease obligations are subject, in almost all cases,
to the annual appropriation risk, i.e., the lessee government is not
legally obligated to budget and appropriate for the rental payments
beyond the current fiscal year. These obligations are also subject to
construction and abatement risk in many states-rental obligations cease
in the event that delays in building, damage, destruction or
condemnation of the project prevents its use by the lessee. In these
cases, insurance provisions designed to alleviate this risk become
important credit factors. In the event of default by the lessee
government, there may be significant legal and/or practical difficulties
involved in the re-letting or sale of the project. Some of these issues,
particularly those for equipment purchase, contain the so-called
"substitution safeguard," which bars the lessee government, in the event
it defaults on its rental payments, from the purchase or use of similar
equipment for a certain period of time. This safeguard is designed to
insure that the lessee government will appropriate, even though it is
not legally obligated to do so, but its legality remains untested in
most, if not all, states.


Industrial Revenue Securities. Certain of the bonds may be industrial
revenue bonds ("IRBs"), including pollution control revenue bonds, which
are taxable or tax-exempt securities issued by states, municipalities,
public authorities or similar entities to finance the cost of acquiring,
constructing or improving various industrial projects. These projects
are usually operated by corporate entities. Issuers are obligated only
to pay amounts due on the IRBs to the extent that funds are available


Page 3


from the unexpended proceeds of the IRBs or receipts or revenues of the
issuer under an arrangement between the issuer and the corporate
operator of a project. The arrangement may be in the form of a lease,
installment sale agreement, conditional sale agreement or loan
agreement, but in each case the payments to the issuer are designed to
be sufficient to meet the payments of amounts due on the IRBs.
Regardless of the structure, payment of IRBs is solely dependent upon
the creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project or
corporate guarantor. Corporate operators or guarantors may be affected
by many factors which may have an adverse impact on the credit quality
of the particular company or industry. These include cyclicality of
revenues and earnings, regulatory and environmental restrictions,
litigation resulting from accidents or environmentally-caused illnesses,
extensive competition and financial deterioration resulting from a
complete restructuring pursuant to a leveraged buy-out, takeover or
otherwise. Such a restructuring may result in the operator of a project
becoming highly leveraged which may impact on such operator's
creditworthiness, which in turn would have an adverse impact on the
rating and/or market value of such bonds. Further, the possibility of
such a restructuring may have an adverse impact on the market for and
consequently the value of such bonds, even though no actual takeover or
other action is ever contemplated or affected. The IRBs in a fund may be
subject to special or extraordinary redemption provisions which may
provide for redemption at par or, with respect to original issue
discount bonds, at issue price plus the amount of original issue
discount accreted to the redemption date plus, if applicable, a premium.
The Sponsor cannot predict the causes or likelihood of the redemption of
IRBs or other bonds in the funds prior to the stated maturity of such
bonds.


Transportation Facility Revenue Securities. Certain of the bonds may be
obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from
the ownership and operation of facilities such as airports, bridges,
turnpikes, port authorities, convention centers and arenas. The major
portion of an airport's gross operating income is generally derived from
fees received from signatory airlines pursuant to use agreements which
consist of annual payments for leases, occupancy of certain terminal
space and service fees. Airport operating income may therefore be
affected by the ability of the airlines to meet their obligations under
the use agreements. The air transport industry is experiencing
significant variations in earnings and traffic, due to increased
competition, excess capacity, increased costs, deregulation, traffic
constraints and other factors, and several airlines are experiencing
severe financial difficulties. The Sponsor cannot predict what effect
these industry conditions may have on airport revenues which are
dependent for payment on the financial condition of the airlines and
their usage of the particular airport facility. Similarly, payment on
bonds related to other facilities is dependent on revenues from the
projects, such as user fees from ports, tolls on turnpikes and bridges
and rents from buildings. Therefore, payment may be adversely affected
by reduction in revenues due to such factors as increased cost of
maintenance, decreased use of a facility, lower cost of alternative
modes of transportation, scarcity of fuel and reduction or loss of rents.


Education Revenue Securities. Certain of the bonds may be obligations of
issuers which are, or which govern the operation of, schools, colleges
and universities and whose revenues are derived mainly from ad valorem
taxes, or for higher education systems, from tuition, dormitory
revenues, grants and endowments. General problems relating to school
bonds include litigation contesting the state constitutionality of
financing public education in part from ad valorem taxes, thereby
creating a disparity in educational funds available to schools in
wealthy areas and schools in poor areas. Litigation or legislation on
this issue may affect the sources of funds available for the payment of
school bonds in the Trusts. General problems relating to college and
university obligations would include the prospect of a declining
percentage of the population consisting of "college" age individuals,
possible inability to raise tuitions and fees sufficiently to cover
increased operating costs, the uncertainty of continued receipt of
Federal grants and state funding and new government legislation or
regulations which may adversely affect the revenues or costs of such
issuers. All of such issuers have been experiencing certain of these
problems in varying degrees.


Resource Recovery Facility Revenue Securities. Certain of the bonds may
be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived
from the operation of resource recovery facilities. Resource recovery
facilities are designed to process solid waste, generate steam and
convert steam to electricity. Resource recovery bonds may be subject to
extraordinary optional redemption at par upon the occurrence of certain
circumstances, including but not limited to: destruction or condemnation
of a project; contracts relating to a project becoming void,
unenforceable or impossible to perform; changes in the economic
availability of raw materials, operating supplies or facilities
necessary for the operation of a project or technological or other
unavoidable changes adversely affecting the operation of a project;
administrative or judicial actions which render contracts relating to
the projects void, unenforceable or impossible to perform; or impose
unreasonable burdens or excessive liabilities. The Sponsor cannot


Page 4


predict the causes or likelihood of the redemption of resource recovery
bonds in the funds prior to the stated maturity of the Securities.


Discount Securities. Certain of the bonds may have been acquired at a
market discount from par value at maturity. The coupon interest rates on
the discount bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in the
funds were lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued
bonds of comparable rating and type. If such interest rates for newly
issued comparable bonds increase, the market discount of previously
issued bonds will become greater, and if such interest rates for newly
issued comparable bonds decline, the market discount of previously
issued bonds will be reduced, other things being equal. Investors should
also note that the value of bonds purchased at a market discount will
increase in value faster than bonds purchased at a market premium if
interest rates decrease. Conversely, if interest rates increase, the
value of bonds purchased at a market discount will decrease faster than
bonds purchased at a market premium. In addition, if interest rates
rise, the prepayment risk of higher yielding, premium bonds and the
prepayment benefit for lower yielding, discount bonds will be reduced.
Market discount attributable to interest changes does not indicate a
lack of market confidence in the issue. Neither the Sponsor nor the
Trustee shall be liable in any way for any default, failure or defect in
any of the bonds.


Original Issue Discount Securities. Certain of the bonds are considered
original issue discount bonds. Under current law, the original issue
discount, which is the difference between the stated redemption price at
maturity and the issue price of the bonds, is deemed to accrue on a
daily basis and the accrued portion is treated as taxable interest
income for Federal income tax purposes. On sale or redemption, any gain
realized that is in excess of the earned portion of original issue
discount will be taxable as capital gain unless the gain is attributable
to market discount in which case the accretion of market discount is
taxable as ordinary income. The current value of an original issue
discount bond reflects the present value of its stated redemption price
at maturity. The market value tends to increase in greater increments as
the bonds approach maturity.


When Issued Securities. "When, as and if issued" bonds are bonds that
trade before they are actually issued. This means that the Sponsor can
only deliver them to the Trust when the bonds are actually issued.
Delivery of these Securities may be delayed or may not occur. Interest
on these Securities does not begin accruing to the Trust until the
Sponsor delivers them to the Trust. You may have to adjust your tax
basis if the Sponsor delivers any of these Securities after their
expected delivery date. Any adjustment would reflect interest that
accrued between the time you purchased your Units and the delivery of
the Securities to the Trust. This could lower your first year estimated
current return. In addition, you may experience gains or losses on these
Securities from the time you purchase Units even though the Trust has
not received them.


Zero Coupon Securities. Zero coupon bonds (which include bonds known as
multiplier bonds, money multiplier bonds, capital appreciation bonds,
capital accumulator bonds, compound interest bonds and money discount
maturity payment bonds) do not provide for the payment of any current
interest and generally provide for payment at maturity at face value
unless sooner sold or redeemed. Zero coupon bonds may be subject to more
price volatility than conventional bonds. While some types of zero
coupon bonds, such as multipliers and capital appreciation bonds, define
par as the initial offering price rather than the maturity value, they
share the basic zero coupon bond features of (1) not paying interest on
a semi-annual basis and (2) providing for the reinvestment of the bond's
semi-annual earnings at the bond's stated yield to maturity. While zero
coupon bonds are frequently marketed on the basis that their fixed rate
of return minimizes reinvestment risk, this benefit can be negated in
large part by weak call protection, i.e., a bond's provision for
redemption at only a modest premium over the accreted value of the bond.


Premium Securities. Certain of the bonds may have been acquired at a
market premium from par value at maturity. The coupon interest rates on
the premium bonds at the time they were purchased by the fund were
higher than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds of
comparable rating and type. If such interest rates for newly issued and
otherwise comparable bonds decrease, the market premium of previously
issued bonds will be increased, and if such interest rates for newly
issued comparable bonds increase, the market premium of previously
issued bonds will be reduced, other things being equal. The current
returns of bonds trading at a market premium are initially higher than
the current returns of comparable bonds of a similar type issued at
currently prevailing interest rates because premium bonds tend to
decrease in market value as they approach maturity when the face amount
becomes payable. Because part of the purchase price is thus returned not
at maturity but through current income payments, early redemption of a
premium bond at par or early prepayments of principal will result in a
reduction in yield. Redemption pursuant to call provisions generally
will, and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may, occur at


Page 5


times when the redeemed bonds have an offering side valuation which
represents a premium over par or for original issue discount bonds a
premium over the accreted value.


Special Tax Securities. Certain of the bonds may be special tax bonds
payable from and secured by the revenues derived by a municipality from
a particular tax. Examples of special taxes are a tax on the rental of a
hotel room, on the purchase of food and beverages, on the purchase of
fuel, on the rental of automobiles or on the consumption of liquor.
Special tax bonds are not secured by the general tax revenues of the
municipality, and they do not represent general obligations of the
municipality. Payment on special tax bonds may be adversely affected by
a reduction in revenues realized from the underlying special tax. Also,
should spending on the particular goods or services that are subject to
the special tax decline, the municipality may be under no obligation to
increase the rate of the special tax to ensure that sufficient revenues
are raised from the shrinking taxable base.


Tax Allocation Securities. Certain of the bonds may be tax allocation
bonds. Tax allocation bonds are typically secured by incremental tax
revenues collected on property within the areas where redevelopment
projects financed by bond proceeds are located. Bond payments are
expected to be made from projected increases in tax revenues derived
from higher assessed values of property resulting from development in
the particular project area and not from an increase in tax rates.
Special risk considerations include: variations in taxable values of
property in the project area; successful appeals by property owners of
assessed valuations; substantial delinquencies in the payment of
property taxes; or imposition of any constitutional or legislative
property tax rate decrease.
