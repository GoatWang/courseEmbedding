This article lays a foundation for discussing transitions in urban governance, which enable cities to navigate change, build capacity to withstand shocks, and use experimentation and innovation in face of uncertainty. Using the three concrete case cities— New Orleans, Cape Town, and Phoenix—the article analyzes thresholds and cross-scale interactions, and expands the scale at which urban resilience has been discussed by integrating the idea from geography that cities form part of “system of cities” (i.e., they cannot be seen as single entities). Based on this, the article argues that urban governance need to harness social networks of urban innovation to sustain ecosystem services, while nurturing discourses that situate the city as part of regional ecosystems. The article broadens the discussion on urban resilience while challenging resilience theory when addressing human-dominated ecosystems. Practical examples of harnessing urban innovation are presented, paired with an agenda for research and policy.

See also his article, Andersson (2006).   2 In discussing Cape Town with its previous institutionalized apartheid system, we recognize that racial categories are social constructs that serve certain interests of domination. However, through practices of domination, racial categories nonetheless become real as they constrain or facilitate individuals' access to society's resources.   3 It needs to be acknowledged that average per capita numbers conceals high inequities. For instance, people classified during apartheid as whites consumed more water than the majority, e.g., through being owners of wineries and being better connected to water infrastructure.   4 Arbesman et al. (2009) mention two other possible explanations to urban innovation: that cities simply have more highly educated people, and more transient people that bring new ideas. However, the social networks of cities—especially the great number of long-distance (weak) ties—constitute a fundamental difference between urban and non-urban systems.   5 We note how this also partly resonates with ideas from the early 1900's as articulated by for instance the american intellectual and regional planning theorist Luis Mumford (1895–1990) (Luccarelli 1996).
