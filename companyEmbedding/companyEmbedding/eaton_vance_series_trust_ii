    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

TO SHAREHOLDERS                                                                 

Eaton Vance  Income Fund of Boston had a total return of 3.4 percent for the six
months  ended  March 31,  1995,  the result of a decline in net asset  value per
share to $7.75 on March 31,  1995,  from $7.90 on September  30,  1994,  and the
reinvestment of $0.406 per share in dividends. The total return does not include
the effect of the Fund's 4.75 percent maximum sales charge. For comparison,  the
Lehman  Brothers  High Yield Bond Index  returned 5.6 percent for the  six-month
period.                                                                         

Based on the Fund's  most  recent  dividend  and a net asset  value per share of
$7.75, the Fund had a distribution rate of 10.45 percent at March 31.           

AMID A VOLATILE TREASURY MARKET, HIGH YIELD BONDS FARED WELL...                 
The high yield market,  less sensitive to interest rates and bolstered by robust
corporate  earnings,  was  considerably  less volatile than the Treasury  market
which has undergone  large  fluctuations  in the past year.*  Ten-year  Treasury
yields,  which were around 6.8  percent in March  1994,  rose above 8 percent by
November as the Federal  Reserve  pushed  rates higher in an effort to cut short
inflation.  However, as inflation fears ebbed at year-end,  Treasury yields fell
back to 7.2 percent by March 31.                                                

*High yield bonds carry a higher degree of investment risk, while the principal 
 and interest of Treasury  issues are  guaranteed  by the U.S. government.  High
 yield bonds are  considered  speculative  because they present greater risks of
price volatility and default.                                                 

WITH A STRONGER ECONOMY, CREDIT QUALITY IMPROVED WITHIN THE HIGH YIELD SECTOR...
According  to  Securities  Data Corp.,  issues  rated B- or below  comprised  18
percent of new high yield  issuance in 1994.  That is a significant  improvement
from  1989,  when  nearly  30  percent  of new debt was  rated B- or  below.  In
addition,  interest  coverage for new high yield issues - the ratio of free cash
flow to interest  payments - rose from 1.6 percent at the  beginning  of 1994 to
1.9  percent  by the  year-end,  according  to  Chemical  Securities  Inc.  That
statistic  indicates a widening comfort margin for purchasers of high yield debt
and another sign of the improving  credit quality of the $272 billion high yield
market.                                                                         

In the following pages,  portfolio  manager Hooker Talcott  provides  additional
information  that  presents a strong  case for  Income  Fund of Boston as a high
income, long-term investment.

Management Discussion                                                           

An interview with Hooker  Talcott Jr., Vice  President and Portfolio  Manager of
Eaton Vance Income Fund of Boston.                                              

Q.   HOOKER,  HOW WOULD YOU EVALUATE THE FUND'S PERFORMANCE DURING THE SIX-MONTH
PERIOD?                                                               

A.   The Fund  performed  relatively  well  during  the  six-month  period.  The
     principal  reason for the Fund's  positive  performance  was that our focus
     remained on high-coupon  bonds,  which avoided much of the volatility  that
     characterized the Treasury market through much of 1994.  Another reason for
     the Fund's performance was an emphasis on cyclical issues,  which have been
the clear market leaders.                                             

Q.   WHAT RECENT CHANGES HAVE YOU MADE TO THE PORTFOLIO?                        

A.   After an  extended  recovery,  the  economy has  recently  showed  signs of
     slowing  somewhat.  Therefore,  I have reduced the Portfolio's  exposure to
     early-cycle  industries such as home builders and automobiles.  While those
     companies have fared well, they have seen sales decline  modestly in recent
     months. Meanwhile,  we've increased the Portfolio's positions in late-stage
     cyclicals  such as  chemicals,  energy  companies  and paper and  packaging
     companies. In addition, since the beginning of the year, we have moved into
     some more  defensive  issues such as cable  television,  casinos,  and food
companies.                                                            

Q.   WOULD A SUSTAINED,  STABLE-GROWTH  ECONOMY BE FAVORABLE  FOR THE HIGH YIELD
MARKET?                                                               

A.   In my view,  it would.  If  interest  rates  remain  stable,  we should see
     continued  improvement in earnings,  which would support interest  payments
for debt service and help sustain principal payments.                 

Q.   WHAT INDUSTRIES WILL BENEFIT?                                              

A.   If the economy  maintains a slow but steady course for an extended  period,
     the late  cyclical  companies  that we have  emphasized  would very  likely
     continue  to  prosper.  Many  late-cycle  companies  are  beneficiaries  of
     increased  capital  spending and higher  commodity prices that accompany an
advancing economic cycle.                                             

Q.   CAN YOU GIVE AN EXAMPLE?                                                   

A.   Chemical companies are a good example.  The industry is expected to operate
     near 85 percent of capacity in 1995, an  improvement  over 1994,  which was
     another  strong  year.  Yet,  even with the  increased  capacity,  chemical
     producers  may still be  hard-pressed  to meet rising demand.  According to
     the Chemical Manufacturers  Association,  industry sales could rise as much
as 8 percent in 1995.                                                 

     Two Portfolio holdings, NL Industries and Agricultural Minerals & Chemicals
     have each been able to raise prices,  while  benefiting from the wide-scale
     cost cutting of recent  years.  NL Industries  makes  titanium  dioxide,  a
     pigmentation  chemical  used in the  manufacture  of paints  and  plastics.
     Agricultural  Minerals  produces specialty  chemicals,  including  nitrogen
fertilizers used in the agriculture sector.                           

Q.   THE DOLLAR HAS WEAKENED  SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT MONTHS AGAINST THE YEN AND
     THE DEUTSCHMARK. WHAT KIND OF IMPACT MIGHT THAT HAVE ON CYCLICAL COMPANIES?

A.   That surely helps the global competitiveness of U.S. manufacturers relative
     to their  counterparts  abroad.  But  while  the  weaker  dollar  may  help
     marginally,  the primary  driver,  by far, has been strong global  economic
     growth.  Cyclical  companies  have been  helped by an  economic  revival in
     Europe as well as the growth in some emerging markets.  American  Standard,
     for instance, a long-time Portfolio holding, has substantial  operations in
     Europe in their plumbing and transportation  businesses. The company should
see significant growth in sales to the expanding markets in Europe.   

Q.   YOU MENTIONED  ADDING SOME  DEFENSIVE  ISSUES TO THE  PORTFOLIO.  COULD YOU
EXPAND ON THAT THEME?                                                 

A.   Certainly.  Adding some defensive names to the Portfolio nicely complements
     our late cyclical  strategy.  As I indicated  earlier,  it's  impossible to
     consistently  predict turns in the economy. If the Fed is a bit overzealous
     in  combating  inflation,  the economy  could slow  significantly.  In that
     event,  defensive issues would benefit.  For example,  the unit volumes and
     pricing of food retailers like Food 4 Less Supermarkets,  a large Portfolio
     investment,  are fairly immune from the  fluctuations in the economy.  That
     stability serves the companies well in a slower economic  environment,  and
they, in turn, tend to attract the attention of investors.            

Q.   HOOKER, WHAT IS YOUR OUTLOOK FOR THE HIGH YIELD MARKET?                    

A.   With an upbeat economic  picture,  the high yield market should continue to
     fare well.  The  economy  currently  enjoys a climate of  moderate  growth:
     neither  weak  enough  to risk  recession  nor  strong  enough  to prompt a
     resurgence of inflation.  Meanwhile, 10-year BB-rated bonds currently offer
     a premium of 300 basis points over 10-year  Treasuries,  a very  attractive
     yield  advantage.  While past  trends are not always  repeated,  high yield
     bonds have been among the best-performing  assets classes during the 1990s.
     And I  believe  the  high  yield  sector  continues  to  represent  a major
opportunity for investors seeking high current income.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS   
------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
(1) SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                             
Eaton Vance Income Fund of Boston (the Trust),  a Massachusetts  business trust,
is  registered  under the  Investment  Company  Act of 1940,  as  amended,  as a
diversified, open-end, management investment company. The following is a summary
of significant  accounting  policies  consistently  followed by the Trust in the
preparation  of its financial  statements.  The policies are in conformity  with
generally accepted accounting principles.                                       

A. INVESTMENT VALUATIONS -- Investments listed on securities exchanges or in the
NASDAQ  National  Market are valued at closing sale  prices.  Listed or unlisted
investments  for which  closing sale prices are not  available are valued at the
mean between the latest bid and asked prices.  Fixed income  investments  (other
than short-term  obligations),  including listed investments and investments for
which price  quotations are  available,  will normally be valued on the basis of
market  valuations  furnished  by a  pricing  service.  Short-term  obligations,
maturing in sixty days or less, are valued at amortized cost, which approximates
value.  Investments  for which there is no quotation or valuation  are valued at
fair value using methods  determined in good faith by or at the direction of the
Trustees.                                                                       

B. INCOME -- Interest  income is  determined  on the basis of interest  accrued,
adjusted  for  amortization  of premium or discount  when  required  for federal
income tax purposes. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date.       

C. FEDERAL TAXES -- The Trust's  policy is to comply with the  provisions of the
Internal  Revenue Code  applicable  to  regulated  investment  companies  and to
distribute to shareholders all of its taxable income, including any net realized
gain on investments.  Accordingly, no provision for federal income or excise tax
is necessary. At September 30, 1994, the Trust, for federal income tax purposes,
had a capital losscarryover of $12,556,308 which will reduce the Trust's taxable
income  arising from future net realized  gains on  investments,  if any, to the
extent  permitted by the Internal  Revenue Code, and thus will reduce the amount
of the  distributions  to  shareholders  which would  otherwise  be necessary to
relieve  the Trust of any  liability  for  federal  income or excise  tax.  Such
capital loss carryovers will expire on September 30, 1999  ($7,407,810) and 2000
($5,148,498).                                                                   

D.  DISTRIBUTIONS  TO SHAREHOLDERS -- The net investment  income of the Trust is
determined  daily,  and  substantially  all  of the  net  investment  income  so
determined is declared daily as a dividend to shareholders of record at the time
of  declaration.  Distributions  are paid  monthly.  Distributions  of  realized
capital gains,  if any, are made at least  annually.  Shareholders  may reinvest
capital gain  distributions  in additional  shares of the Trust at the net asset
value  as of the  ex-dividend  date.  Distributions  are  paid  in the  form  of
additional shares of the Trust or, at the election of the shareholder,  in cash.
The Trust  distinguishes  between  distributions  on a tax basis and a financial
reporting basis.  Generally  accepted  accounting  principles  require that only
distributions  in excess of tax basis  earnings  and  profits be reported in the
financial  statements as a return of capital.  Differences in the recognition or
classification  of income between the financial  statements and tax earnings and
profits which result in temporary  over-distributions  for  financial  statement
purposes are classified as distributions  in excess of net investment  income or
accumulated  net  realized  gains.  Permanent  differences  between book and tax
accounting relating to distributions are reclassified to paid-in capital.       

E.  OTHER  --  Investment  transactions  are  accounted  for  on  the  date  the
investments are purchased or sold.                                              

------------------------------------------------------------------------------  

(2) SHARES OF BENEFICIAL INTEREST                                               
The  Declaration  of Trust permits the Trustees to issue an unlimited  number of
full  and  fractional  shares  of  beneficial   interest  (without  par  value).
Transactions in Trust shares were as follows:

(3) PURCHASES AND SALES OF INVESTMENTS                                          
The Trust invests  primarily in debt  securities.  The ability of the issuers of
the debt securities held by the Trust to meet their  obligations may be affected
by  economic  developments  in a  specific  industry.  Purchases  and  sales  of
investments,  other than U.S. Government securities and short-term  obligations,
aggregated $30,681,270 and $35,814,849, respectively.                           

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4) INVESTMENT ADVISER FEE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES               
The investment  adviser fee, computed at the monthly rate of 5/96 of 1% ( 5/8 of
1%  annually)  of the Trust's  average  monthly net assets,  was earned by Eaton
Vance Management  (EVM) as compensation  for management and investment  advisory
services  rendered to the Trust.  Except as to Trustees of the Trust who are not
members of EVM's  organization,  officers and Trustees receive  remuneration for
their  services to the Trust out of such  investment  adviser  fee.  Eaton Vance
Distributors,  Inc., a subsidiary of EVM and the Trust's principal  underwriter,
received  approximately  $17,450 as its portion of the sales  charge on sales of
Trust shares during the six months ended March 31, 1995.  Investors Bank & Trust
Company (IBT), an affiliate of EVM,  serves as custodian of the Trust.  Pursuant
to the  custodian  agreement,  IBT  receives a fee reduced by credits  which are
determined  based on the average  daily cash balances the Trust  maintains  with
IBT.  Certain  of the  officers  and  Trustees  of the  Trust are  officers  and
directors/trustees of the above organizations.                                  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
(5) SERVICE PLAN                                                                
The  Trustees  of the Trust on behalf  of the Fund have  adopted a Service  Plan
designed to meet the requirements of Rule 12b-1 under the Investment Company Act
of 1940 and the service fee requirements of the revised sales charge rule of The
National  Association of Securities  Dealers Inc. The Service Plan provides that
the Trust may make  service fee  payments to the  Principal  Underwriter,  Eaton
Vance  Distributors,  Inc., a subsidiary of Eaton Vance  Management,  Authorized
Firms or other  persons in amounts not  exceeding  0.25% of the Trust's  average
daily net assets for any fiscal year. The Trustees have  implemented the Service
plan by  authorizing  the Fund to make  quarterly  service  fee  payments to the
Principal  Underwriter  and  Authorized  Firms in amounts not expected to exceed
0.25% of that  portion of the  Trust's  average  daily net assets for any fiscal
year which is  attributable to shares of the Trust sold on or after May 22, 1989
by such  persons and  remaining  outstanding  for at least twelve  months.  Such
payments are made for personal  services  and/or the  maintenance of shareholder
accounts.  Pursuant to the Plan, the Trust made  provisions of $57,103 under the
Plan to the Principal  Underwriter  and  Authorized  Firms during the six months
ended March 31, 1995.                                                           

------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
(6) LINE OF CREDIT                                                              
The  Trust  participates  with  other  funds  managed  by EVM in a $120  million
unsecured line of credit agreement with a bank. The line of credit consists of a
$20  million  committed  facility  and a $100  million  discretionary  facility.
Borrowings  will be made by the  Trust  solely to  facilitate  the  handling  of
unusual and/or  unanticipated short term cash requirements.  Interest is charged
to each fund  based on its  borrowings  at an amount  above  either  the  bank's
adjusted certificate of deposit rate, a variable adjusted certificate of deposit
rate,  or a federal  funds  effective  rate.  In addition,  a fee computed at an
annual rate of 1/4 of 1% on the $20 million committed  facility and on the daily
unused portion of the $100 million discretionary facility is allocated among the
participating  funds  at the end of each  quarter.  The  Trust  did not have any
significant borrowings or allocated fees during the period.                     

------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
(7) FEDERAL INCOME TAX BASIS OF INVESTMENTS                                     
The cost and unrealized  depreciation/appreciation  in value of the  investments

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS     
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To the Trustees and Shareholders of                                             
Eaton Vance Income Fund of Boston:                                              

     We have audited the  accompanying  statement of assets and  liabilities  of
Eaton Vance Income Fund of Boston,  including the  investment  portfolio,  as of
March 31,  1995,  the related  statement of  operations  for the six months then
ended, the statements of changes in net assets for the six months then ended and
for the year ended September 30, 1994, and the financial  highlights for the six
months  ended March 31, 1995 and for each of the five years in the period  ended
September 30, 1994. These financial  statements and financial highlights are the
responsibility of the Trust's  management.  Our  responsibility is to express an
opinion on these  financial  statements  and financial  highlights  based on our
audits.                                                                         

     We conducted  our audits in accordance  with  generally  accepted  auditing
standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable  assurance  about  whether the  financial  statements  and  financial
highlights are free of material misstatement.  An audit includes examining, on a
test basis,  evidence  supporting  the amounts and  disclosures in the financial
statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of March
31,  1995 by  correspondence  with the  custodian  and  brokers.  An audit  also
includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made
by  management,   as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall   financial   statement
presentation.  We believe  that our audits  provide a  reasonable  basis for our
opinion.                                                                        

     In our opinion,  the financial statements and financial highlights referred
to above present fairly,  in all material  respects,  the financial  position of
Eaton  Vance  Income  Fund of Boston as of March 31,  1995,  the  results of its
operations for the six months then ended,  the changes in its net assets for the
six  months  then  ended and for the year  ended  September  30,  1994,  and the
financial highlights for the six months ended March 31, 1995 and for each of the
five years in the period ended  September 30, 1994, in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles.

o   None of such information about you (or former customers) will be disclosed

IMPORTANT NOTICE
 REGARDING DELIVERY OF
 SHAREHOLDER DOCUMENTS

The Securities and Exchange Commission permits funds to deliver only one copy of
shareholder documents, including prospectuses, proxy statements and shareholder 
reports, to fund investors with multiple accounts at the same residential or    
post office box address. This practice is often called "householding" and it    
helps eliminate duplicate mailings to shareholders.                             

Eaton Vance, or your financial adviser, may household the mailing of your       
documents indefinitely unless you instruct Eaton Vance, or your financial       
adviser, otherwise.                                                             

If you would prefer that your Eaton Vance documents not be householded, please  
contact Eaton Vance at 1-800-262-1122, or contact your financial adviser.       

Your instructions that householding not apply to delivery of your Eaton Vance   
documents will be effective within 30 days of receipt by Eaton Vance or your    
financial adviser.                                                              

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
From time to time, funds are required to vote proxies related to the securities 
held by the funds. The Eaton Vance Funds or their underlying Portfolios vote    
proxies according to a set of policies and procedures approved by the Funds' and
Portfolios' Boards. You may obtain a description of these policies and          
procedures without charge, upon request, by calling 1-800-262-1122. This        
description is also available on the Securities and Exchange Commission's       
website at http://www.sec.gov.

Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Emerging Markets Fund as of June 30, 2004
LETTER TO SHAREHOLDERS                                                          

[Photo of Michael W. Weilheimer President]                                      

We are pleased to welcome shareholders of Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Emerging      
Markets Fund with this annual shareholder report. The Fund's Institutional      
(Class I) shares had a total return of 38.49% during the year ended June 30,
2004.(1) That return was the result of an increase in net asset value (NAV) per 
share to $17.34 on June 30, 2004 from $13.09 on June 30, 2003. Additional       
information about the Fund's performance (including after-tax performance)      
appears on page 6.                                                              

By comparison, the S&P/International Finance Corp. Investable Emerging Market   
Index - an unmanaged index of common stocks traded in the emerging markets and  
available to foreign investors - had a total return of 35.12% for the same      
period.(2)                                                                      

THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY PROVIDED A LIFT TO THE EMERGING MARKETS DURING THE 
FISCAL YEAR...                                                                  

With the global economy gaining renewed momentum in late 2003 and early 2004,   
many emerging markets turned in robust performances. The rally was sparked by an
uptrend in worldwide industrial activity and a rise in capital spending. This   
trend notably benefited exporters of machinery and technology-related products. 
The continued economic surge in China and India was an especially strong        
catalyst for growth in Asia. Meanwhile, oil exporting nations benefited from the
dramatic rise in oil prices.                                                    

While the economic tide appeared to have turned positive, geopolitical trends   
remained a concern to emerging market investors. The conflict in Iraq, the      
ongoing threat of terrorism and concerns over corporate property rights in      
Russia tempered investors' enthusiasm, as the fiscal year drew to a close.      
Investors also watched for rising interest rates, which could impact the        
availability of capital, the lifeblood of economic expansion.                   

DIVERSIFICATION AMONG EMERGING MARKETS IN A TAX-MANAGED APPROACH...             

The past year has demonstrated the compelling opportunities that can be found in
the emerging markets. But as impressive as the year's returns have been, the    
impact of taxes on one's investment remains an important consideration. A fund's
tax-management can be a critical determinant to its long-term investment        
success.                                                                        

History has shown that a disciplined investment process and a focus on after-tax
returns has been a time-tested investment approach. In the following pages,     
portfolio manager Cliff Quisenberry of Parametric Portfolio Associates discusses
the Fund's approach and its activities over the past year.                      

Sincerely,

An interview with Cliff Quisenberry, Director of Research and Product           
Development, Parametric Portfolio Associates and Portfolio Manager of           
Tax-Managed Emerging Markets Fund.                                              

Q:  Cliff, how would you characterize the investment climate for the emerging   
markets in recent months?                                               

A:  Recent months have seen the apparent culmination of a rally phase in the    
   emerging markets, a rally that began in April 2003 and ended in April 2004.
  Since then, we've seen the beginning of a new phase in the cycle, in which
 returns have been more modest, as emerging markets face the challenges of
risinginterest rates, rising oil prices and renewed fears of world      
  instability. While the recovery in world economic growth has benefited the
emerging markets and long-term prospects remain sound, these markets are
    keenly sensitive to a rise in the cost of capital. In addition, there is the
 risk that rising oil prices may threaten the recovery we have seen in the
developed economies and thus impact emerging economies via exports.     

Q:  How were the Fund's investments weighted among the emerging markets?        

A:  The Fund utilizes a disciplined structure with regard to country weighting  
and sector weighting within countries. The Fund's regional weightings at
June 30, 2004 as a percentage of net assets were Asia, at 29.6%; Latin  
 America, at 21.1%; Europe, at 19.9%; and Middle East/Africa, at 18.2%.(2)

The Fund's largest country weightings were South Africa, Mexico, Brazil,
South Korea, and Russia. From an industry perspective, we maintained an 
    exposure across a broad range of major economic sectors, with an emphasis on
industrial companies, consumer-related companies, financial services    
providers and energy companies.                                         

Q:  How would you evaluate the Fund's performance during the year?              

A:  The Fund has performed well, generally in line with expectations at this    
 phase of the cycle. In the year ended June 30, 2004, the Fund had a total
return of 38.49%,(1) outperforming its benchmark, the S&P/International 
  Finance Corp. Investable Emerging Market Index, which returned 35.12%. The
Fund also outperformed the Morgan Stanley Capital International Emerging
   Markets Free Index, a major emerging markets index, which returned 33.14%.*

Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Emerging Markets Fund as of June 30, 2004
MANAGEMENT DISCUSSION CONT'D                                                    

The Fund's outperformance relative to its benchmark was especially noteworthy in
the closing months of the fiscal year, as the emerging market rally began to    
flag. This was not surprising, given the Fund's more diverse approach to country
allocation. This country structure emphasizes smaller markets that have tended  
to lag their larger counterparts in the beginning phase of a rally, but which   
have often outperformed as the rally loses its momentum, as it has in recent    
months.                                                                         

Q:  What countries were particularly additive to performance during the period? 

A:  During the year ending June 30, 2004, the Fund outperformed its benchmark by
   337 basis points (3.37%).* The Fund's overweights relative to the benchmark
in the Eastern European countries, such as Hungary, Poland and Czech    
    Republic, contributed to this outperformance. Those markets were some of the
   best performers among all emerging markets in the period, as they benefited
 from their entrance into the European Union in May 2004. In addition, the
   Fund benefited from its exposure to the Middle Eastern/African countries of
  Egypt, Ghana and Botswana, which outperformed the overall emerging markets
benchmark in that period.                                               

Q:  Were there any countries that did not perform quite as well for the Fund?   

A:  Yes. The Fund's relative returns were hampered by its exposure to Argentina,
    Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. While all of these countries posted
positive returns, they underperformed the emerging markets as a whole.  

Q:  You indicated that the Fund's exposure to smaller country markets resisted  
    the emerging market correction later in the period. Could you expand on that
thought?                                                                

A:  Yes. In periods of weakness, the Fund's broader, more balanced structure has
often provided relative stability when compared to its capitalization-  
weighted benchmark, which is more heavily concentrated in a handful of  
larger emerging market countries. These larger markets have tended to   
   correlate more to developed markets like the U.S. and have followed them as
they hit the downward cycle of a rally. On the other hand, the Fund     
    emphasizes smaller emerging countries, which historically have not only been
less correlated to major developed markets, but have also tended to move
more independently than their larger counterparts. This can provide     
    additional diversification that can help dampen volatility in a down market.

   Emerging markets have had an impressive run in the four quarters leading up
  to the second quarter of 2004, and thus, we expected such weakness in this
quarter.                                                                

Q:  Your primary focus at Parametric is managing investments with tax           
considerations in mind. Could you discuss that issue?                   

A:  Tax management is an important and explicit part of the investment process  
  in this Fund. We utilize tax lot accounting in the Fund to try to minimize
gains or maximize losses when selling positions driven by our investment
process or to fund withdrawals.

In addition, we often identify and sell security lots with unrealized losses in 
order to "harvest" realized losses, while making offsetting purchases in other  
securities to maintain exposure to a country or sector. This type of tax        
management has allowed the Fund to avoid distributing realized capital gains    
historically and has provided a loss carryforward that can help reduce future   
realized gains that might otherwise be distributed.

* Source: Thomson Financial; Bloomberg. Investment operations commenced 6/30/98.
The Fund's performance prior to February 6, 2004 is that of its predecessor, the
PIMCO PPA Tax-Efficient Structured Emerging Markets Fund. Past performance is no
guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will         
fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their   
original cost.                                                                  

The performance chart above compares the Fund's total return with that of a     
broadbased securities market index. The lines on the chart represent the total  
returns of $250,000 hypothetical investments in the Fund and the                
S&P/International Finance Corp. Investable Emerging Market Index - a broad-based
index of common stocks traded in the emerging markets and available to foreign  
investors. The graph and performance table do not reflect the deduction of taxes
that a shareholder would pay on Fund distributions or the redemption of Fund    
shares. Class I/Institutional shares are subject to a 1% fee when they are      
purchased, exchanged or redeemed. The Index's total returns do not reflect any  
commissions or expenses that would have been incurred if an investor            
individually purchased or sold the securities represented in the Index. It is   
not possible to invest directly in an Index.                                    

** SEC returns reflect the 1% purchase and 1% redemption fee for Class I shares.
Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Returns are historical and  
are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value with all 
distributions reinvested. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to
market volatility, the Fund's current performance may be lower or higher than   
the quoted return. Fund performance during certain periods reflects the strong  
stock market performance and/or the strong performance of stocks held during    
those periods. This performance is not typical and may not be repeated. For

After-Tax Performance                                                           
as of June 30, 2004                                                             

The tables below set forth the pre-tax and after-tax performance for the Fund.  
After-tax performance reflects the impact of federal income taxes on Fund       
distributions of dividends and capital gains, as well as capital gains taxes on 
the sale of Fund shares, while pre-tax performance does not. Because the        
objective of the Fund is to provide long-term, after-tax returns to             
shareholders, it is important for investors to know the effect of taxes on the  
Fund's return.

February 6, 2004 is that of its predecessor, the PIMCO PPA Tax-Efficient        
Structured Emerging Markets Fund.                                               

After-tax returns are calculated using the highest historical individual federal
income tax rate and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual  
after-tax returns depend on a shareholder's tax situation and may differ from   
those shown. After-tax returns are not relevant for shareholders who hold shares
in tax-deferred accounts or to shares held by non-taxable entities. Return After
Taxes on Distributions for a period may be the same as Return Before Taxes for  
that period because no distributions were paid during that period or because the
taxable portion of distributions made during the period was insignificant. Also,
Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sale of Fund Shares for a period may be 
greater than Return After Taxes on Distributions for the same period because of 
realized losses on the sale of Fund shares. The Fund's after-tax returns may    
also reflect foreign tax credits passed by the Fund to its shareholders.        

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Returns are historical and  
are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value with all 
distributions reinvested. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate  
so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original    
cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market volatility, 
the Fund's current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Fund

Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Emerging Markets Fund as of June 30, 2004
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                                   

1 Significant Accounting Policies                                               
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Emerging Markets Fund (the Fund) is a newly         
organized series of Eaton Vance Series Trust II (the Trust), a Massachusetts
business trust and is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940,  
as amended, as an open-end management investment company. The Fund's        
investment objective is to seek long-term, after-tax returns for its        
shareholders by investing in equity securities of companies located in      
emerging market countries, which are those considered to be developing. The 
financial statements of the Fund reflect the historical financial results of
the PIMCO PPA Tax-Efficient Structured Emerging Markets Fund (PIMCO PPA     
Fund) prior to its reorganization (see Note 9). The investment objective and
policies of the PIMCO PPA Fund were substantially similar to those of the   
Fund. The following is a summary of significant accounting policies of the  
Fund. The policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally   
accepted in the United States of America.                                   

A Investment Valuation -- Marketable securities that are listed on foreign  
or U.S. securities exchanges are valued at closing sale prices on the       
exchange where such securities are principally traded. Marketable securities
listed in the NASDAQ National Market System are valued at the NASDAQ        
official closing price. Unlisted or listed securities for which closing     
sales prices are not available are valued at the mean between the latest bid
and asked prices or in the case of preferred equity securities that are not 
listed or traded in the over-the-counter market, by an independent pricing  
service. An option is valued at the last sale price as quoted on the        
principal exchange or board of trade on which such option or contract is    
traded, or in the absence of a sale, at the mean between the last bid and   
asked prices. Futures positions on securities or currencies are generally   
valued at closing settlement prices. Short-term debt securities with a      
remaining maturity of 60 days or less are valued at amortized cost, which   
approximates value. Other fixed income and debt securities, including listed
securities and securities for which price quotations are available, will    
normally be valued on the basis of valuations furnished by a pricing        
service.                                                                    

The daily valuation of foreign securities generally is determined as of the 
close of trading on the principal exchange on which such securities trade.  
Events occurring after the close of trading on foreign exchanges may result 
in adjustments to the valuation of foreign securities to more accurately    
reflect their fair value as of the close of regular trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange. The Fund may rely on an independent fair valuation service  
in adjusting the valuations of foreign securities. Foreign securities and   
currencies are valued in U.S. dollars, based on foreign currency exchange   
rate quotations supplied by an independent quotation service. Investments   
held by the Fund for which valuations or market quotations are unavailable  
are valued at fair value using methods determined in good faith by or at the
direction of the Trustees considering relevant factors, data and information
including the market value of freely tradable securities of the same class  
in the principal market on which such securities are normally traded.       

B Income -- Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date for         
dividends received in cash and/or securities. However, if the ex-dividend   
date has passed, certain dividends from foreign securities are recorded as  
the Fund is informed of the ex-dividend date. Interest income is recorded on
the basis of interest accrued, adjusted for amortization of premium or      
accretion of discount.                                                      

C Federal Taxes -- The Fund's policy is to comply with the provisions of the
Internal Revenue Code applicable to regulated investment companies and to   
distribute to shareholders each year all of its taxable income, including   
any net realized gain on investments. Accordingly, no provision for federal 
income or excise tax is necessary. Withholding taxes on foreign dividends   
have been provided for in accordance with the Fund's understanding of the   
applicable countries' tax rules and rates. At June 30, 2004, the Fund, for  
federal income tax purposes, had a capital loss carryover of $27,903,371,   
which will reduce the Fund's taxable income arising from future net realized
gain on investments, if any, to the extent permitted by the Internal Revenue
Code, and thus will reduce the amount of distributions to shareholders which
would otherwise be necessary to relieve the Fund of any liability for       
federal income or excise tax. Such capital loss carryover will expire June
30, 2012 ($362,373), June 30, 2011 ($2,856,200), June 30, 2010 ($4,652,533),
June 30, 2009 ($10,513,006), June 30, 2008 ($7,893,990) and June 30, 2007   
($1,625,269). Additionally, at June 30, 2004, the Fund had net capital      
losses of $422,733 attributable to security transactions incurred after     
October 31, 2003. These capital losses are treated as arising on the first  
day of the Fund's taxable year ended June 30, 2005.                         

In addition to the requirements of the Internal Revenue Code, the Fund may  
also be subject to capital gains taxes in certain countries in which it     
invests. In determining the daily net asset value, the Fund estimates the   
accrual for capital gains taxes, if any, based on the unrealized            
appreciation on certain Fund securities and the related tax rates. At June
30, 2004, the Fund had an accrual for capital gains taxes of $572,517, of   
which $396,608 is included in the change in net unrealized appreciation     
(depreciation) on investments in the Statement of Operations. Capital gains 
taxes paid are included in net realized gain (loss) on investments in the   
Statement of Operations and were none for the year ended June 30, 2004.     

The Fund is subject to a  Contribucao Provisoria sobre Movimentacoes        
Financeiras ("CPMF") tax which is applied to foreign exchange transactions  
representing capital inflows or outflows to the Brazilian market for certain
securities. The CPMF tax has been included in the net realized gain (loss)  
on investments.                                                             

D Expenses --  Expenses of the Trust that are not readily identifiable to a 
specific fund are allocated taking into consideration, among other things,  
the nature and type of expense and relative size of the funds.              

E Foreign Currency Translation -- Investment valuations, other assets, and  
liabilities initially expressed in foreign currencies are converted each    
business day into U.S. dollars based upon current exchange rates. Purchases 
and sales of foreign investment securities and income and expenses are      
converted into U.S. dollars based upon currency exchange rates prevailing on
the respective dates of such transactions. Recognized gains or losses on    
investment transactions attributable to changes in foreign currency exchange
rates are recorded for financial statement purposes as net realized gains   
and losses on investments. That portion of unrealized gains and losses on   
investments that results from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange     
rates is not separately disclosed.                                          

F Forward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts -- The Fund may enter into    
forward foreign currency exchange contracts for the purchase or sale of a   
specific foreign currency at a fixed price on a future date. Risks may arise
upon entering these contracts from the potential inability of counterparties
to meet the terms of their contracts and from movements in the value of a   
foreign currency relative to the U.S. dollar. The Fund will enter into      
forward contracts for hedging purposes. The forward foreign currency        
exchange contracts are adjusted by the daily exchange rate of the underlying
currency and any gains or losses are recorded for financial statement       
purposes as unrealized until such time as the contracts have been closed or 
offset.                                                                     

G Purchase and Redemption Fees -- The Fund imposes a fee equal to 1% of the 
net asset value of shares purchased, exchanged or redeemed to defray the    
Fund's investment transaction costs. The fee is deducted from the amount    
invested or redeemed and is reflected by the Fund as an increase to paid-in 
capital. Shares acquired through the reinvestment of dividends and capital  
gains distributions and shares redeemed that were acquired prior to July 1,
1998 are not subject to the fee.                                            

H Repurchase Agreements -- Under the terms of a repurchase agreement, the   
Fund's custodian takes possession of an underlying collateral security, the 
market value of which is at all times at least equal to the principal,      
including accrued interest, of the repurchase transaction. In the event of  
default or bankruptcy by the other party to the agreement, realization and/ 
or retention of the collateral by the Fund may be delayed or limited.       

I Indemnifications -- Under the Trust's organizational documents, its       
officers and Trustees may be indemnified against certain liabilities and    
expenses arising out of the performance of their duties to the Fund and     
shareholders are indemnified against personal liability for obligations of  
the Trust. Additionally, in the normal course of business, the Fund enters  
into agreements with service providers that may contain indemnification     
clauses. The Fund's maximum exposure under these arrangements is unknown as 
this would involve future claims that may be made against the Fund that have
not yet occurred.                                                           

J Other -- Investment transactions are accounted for on a trade date basis. 
Realized gains and losses are computed based on the specific identification 
of the securities sold.                                                     

K Use of Estimates -- The preparation of the financial statements in        
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United      
States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the    
financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expense during  
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.     

2 Distributions to Shareholders                                                 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is the present policy of the Fund to make (a) at least one distribution  
annually of all or substantially all of its net investment income, and (b)  
at least one distribution annually of all or substantially all of its       
realized capital gains. Shareholders may reinvest all distributions in      
additional shares of the Fund at the net asset value as of the ex-dividend  
date. Distributions are paid in the form of additional shares or, at the    
election of the shareholder, in cash. The Fund distinguishes between        
distributions on a tax basis and a financial reporting basis. Accounting    
principles generally accepted in the United States of America require that  
only distributions in excess of tax basis earnings and profits be reported  
in the financial statements as a return of capital.                         

The tax character of the distributions declared for the years ended June 30,
2004 and June 30, 2003 was as follows:                                      

                   Year Ended June 30,
                    ------------------------
                   2004           2003
--------------------------------------------------------------              
Distributions declared from:                                                
--------------------------------------------------------------              
Ordinary Income                      $6,945,881     $1,000,443              
--------------------------------------------------------------              

During the year ended June 30, 2004 distributions in excess of net          
investment income were decreased by $1,775,065, and accumulated net realized
loss on investments was increased by $1,581,015 primarily due to differences
between book and tax accounting for Passive Foreign Investment Companies.   
This change had no effect on the net assets or the net asset value per      
share.                                                                      

At June 30, 2004, the components of distributable earnings (accumulated     
losses) on a tax basis were as follows:                                     

Undistributed ordinary income                                $  1,081,352   
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
Capital loss carryforward/post-October loss                  $(28,326,104)  
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

The temporary differences between book and tax basis distributable earnings 
(accumulated losses) are primarily due to Passive Foreign Investment        
Companies and wash sales.                                                   

3 Shares of Beneficial Interest

The Fund's Declaration of Trust permits the Trustees to issue an unlimited  
number of full and fractional shares of beneficial interest (without par    
value). Transactions in Fund shares were as follows:

Under the terms of its investment advisory agreement with Eaton Vance       
Management (EVM), the Fund pays EVM a monthly advisory fee equal to an      
annual rate of 0.45% of the Fund's average daily net assets. Prior to       
February 6, 2004, the PIMCO PPA Fund paid an advisory fee to PIMCO Advisors 
Fund Management LLC (PIMCO Advisors) equal to the same annual rate. For the 
year ended June 30, 2004, the advisory fee amounted to $681,305, of which   
$295,404 was earned by EVM. Pursuant to a sub-advisory agreement, EVM (and  
PIMCO Advisors prior to February 6, 2004) pays a monthly sub-advisory fee to
Parametric Portfolio Associates, an indirect, majority-owned subsidiary of  
EVM equal to an annual rate of 0.35% of the Fund's average daily net assets.

EVM also serves as administrator to the Fund and receives from the Fund a   
monthly administration fee equal to an annual rate of 0.50% of the Fund's   
average daily net assets. The administration fee covers most third party    
expenses, excluding taxes, interest, extraordinary expenses and prior to    
February 6, 2004, Trustees' fees. Prior to February 6, 2004, the PIMCO PPA  
Fund paid an administration fee to PIMCO Advisors equal to the same annual  
rate. For the year ended June 30, 2004, the Fund paid $756,499 for          
administrative services of which $328,226 was earned by EVM.                

Effective February 6, 2004, EVM also serves as the sub-transfer agent to the
Fund, at no additional cost to the Fund.                                    

Certain officers and Trustees' of the Fund are officers of EVM or Parametric
Portfolio Associates.

7 Risks Associated with Foreign Investments                                     
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Investing in securities issued by companies whose principal business        
activities are outside the United States may involve significant risks not  
present in domestic investments. For example, there is generally less       
publicly available information about foreign companies, particularly those  
not subject to the disclosure and reporting requirements of the U.S.        
securities laws. Foreign issuers are generally not bound by uniform         
accounting, auditing, and financial reporting requirements and standards of 
practice comparable to those applicable to domestic issuers. Investments in 
foreign securities also involve the risk of possible adverse changes in     
investment or exchange control regulations, expropriation or confiscatory   
taxation, limitation on the removal of funds or other assets of the Fund,   
political or financial instability or diplomatic and other developments     
which could affect such investments. Foreign stock markets, while growing in
volume and sophistication, are generally not as developed as those in the   
United States, and securities of some foreign issuers (particularly those in
developing countries) may be less liquid and more volatile than securities  
of comparable U.S. companies. In general, there is less overall governmental
supervision and regulation of foreign securities markets, broker-dealers,   
and issuers than in the United States.                                      

8 Financial Instruments                                                         
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Fund may trade in financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk in  
the normal course of its investing activities to assist in managing exposure
to various market risks. These financial instruments include forward foreign
currency exchange contracts and futures contracts and may involve, to a     
varying degree, elements of risk in excess of the amounts recognized for    
financial statement purposes. The notional or contractual amounts of these  
instruments represent the investment the Fund has in particular classes of  
financial instruments and does not necessarily represent the amounts        
potentially subject to risk. The measurement of the risks associated with   
these instruments is meaningful only when all related and offsetting        
transactions are considered. At June 30, 2004, there were no obligations    
outstanding under these financial instruments.                              

9 Reorganization                                                                
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On February 6, 2004, the Fund acquired the net assets of the PIMCO PPA Fund,
a series of PIMCO Funds: Multi-Manager Series pursuant to a plan of         
reorganization approved by its shareholders. Prior to this acquisition, the 
Fund had not yet commenced operations. The acquisition was accomplished by a
tax-free exchange of shares of the Fund in an amount equal to the           
outstanding shares of the PIMCO PPA Fund.

Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Emerging Markets Fund as of June 30, 2004
REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM                         

To the Trustees and Shareholders of Eaton Vance Tax-Managed Emerging Markets    
Fund:                                                                           
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities,           
including the portfolio of investments, and the related statements of           
operations and of changes in net assets and the financial highlights present    
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Eaton Vance Tax-    
Managed Emerging Markets Fund, a series of Eaton Vance Series Trust II (the     
"Fund"), successor to the PIMCO PPA Tax-Efficient Structured Emerging Markets   
Fund, at June 30, 2004, and the results of its operations, the changes in its   
net assets and the financial highlights for each of the periods indicated, in   
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States   
of America. These financial statements and financial highlights (hereafter      
referred to as "financial statements") are the responsibility of the Fund's     
management; our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial      
statements based on our audits. We conducted our audits of these financial      
statements in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting    
Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan and       
perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial    
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on   
a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial  
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates  
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement              
presentation. We believe that our audits, which included confirmation of        
securities at June 30, 2004 by correspondence with the custodian and brokers,   
provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

FEDERAL TAX INFORMATION (Unaudited)                                             

The Form 1099-DIV you receive in January 2005 will show the tax status of all   
distributions paid to your account in calendar 2004. Shareholders are advised   
to consult their own tax advisor with respect to the tax consequences of their  
investment in the Fund. As required by the Internal Revenue Code regulations,   
shareholders must be notified within 60 days of the Fund's fiscal year end      
regarding the status of qualified dividend income for individuals, the          
dividends received deduction for corporations, and the foreign tax credit.      

QUALIFIED DIVIDEND INCOME. The Fund designates approximately $2,343,640, or up  
to the maximum amount of such dividends allowable pursuant to the Internal      
Revenue Code, as qualified dividend income eligible for the reduced tax rate    
of 15%.                                                                         

DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION. Corporate shareholders are generally entitled to  
take the dividends received deduction on the portion of the Fund's dividend     
distribution that qualifies under tax law. For the Fund's fiscal 2004 ordinary  
income dividends, 0.67% qualifies for the corporate dividends received          
deduction.

Audit Related Fees(1)    $0             $0              $0            $0

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------   

(1) Audit-related fees consist of the aggregate fees billed for assurance and   
    related services that are reasonably related to the performance of the audit
of financial statements and are not reported under the category of audit
fees.

services provided by the principal accountant other than audit,         
audit-related, and tax services.                                        

*   On February 6, 2004, the PIMCO PPA Tax-Efficient Structured Emerging Markets
Fund, a series of PIMCO Funds: Multi-Manager Series (the "PIMCO Fund"), 
   merged into the Fund. The Fund was formed for the purpose of continuing the
investment program of the PIMCO Fund.                                   

(e)(1) The registrant's audit committee has adopted policies and procedures     
relating to the pre-approval of services provided by the registrant's principal 
accountant (the "Pre-Approval Policies"). The Pre-Approval Policies establish a 
framework intended to assist the audit committee in the proper discharge of its 
pre-approval responsibilities. As a general matter, the Pre-Approval Policies   
(i) specify certain types of audit, audit-related, tax, and other services      
determined to be pre-approved by the audit committee; and (ii) delineate        
specific procedures governing the mechanics of the pre-approval process,        
including the approval and monitoring of audit and non-audit service fees.      
Unless a service is specifically pre-approved under the Pre-Approval Policies,  
it must be separately pre-approved by the audit committee.                      

The Pre-Approval Policies and the types of audit and non-audit services         
pre-approved therein must be reviewed and ratified by the registrant's audit    
committee at least annually. The registrant's audit committee maintains full    
responsibility for the appointment, compensation, and oversight of the work of  
the registrant's principal accountant.                                          

(e)(2) No services described in paragraphs (b)-(d) above were approved by the   
registrant's audit committee pursuant to the "de minimis exception" set forth in
Rule 2-01(c)(7)(i)(C) of Regulation S-X.                                        

(f) Not applicable.                                                             

(g) The following table presents (i) the aggregate non-audit fees (i.e., fees   
for audit-related, tax, and other services) billed for services rendered to all 
of the Series in the Trust by each Series's respective principal accountant     
(either PWC or D&T) for the last two fiscal years of each Series; and (ii) the  
aggregate non-audit fees (i.e., fees for audit-related, tax, and other services)
billed for services rendered to the Eaton Vance organization by PWC for the last
two fiscal years of each Series.                                                

Fiscal Years                                                                    
Ended              9/30/02          66/30/03*         9/30/03           6/30/04

Registrant(1)      $13,175          $1,102            $9,450            $12,500 

Eaton Vance(2)     $0               $0                $0                $4,490  

(1) Includes all of the Series in the Trust.                                    

(2) Various subsidiaries of Eaton Vance Corp. act in either an investment       
advisory and/or service provider capacity with respect to the Series.   

*   On February 6, 2004, the PIMCO PPA Tax-Efficient Structured Emerging Markets
Fund, a series of PIMCO Funds: Multi-Manager Series (the "PIMCO Fund"), 
   merged into the Fund. The Fund was formed for the purpose of continuing the
investment program of the PIMCO Fund.                                   

(h) The registrant's audit committee has considered whether the provision by the
registrant's principal accountants of non-audit services to the registrant's    
investment adviser and any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common   
control with the adviser that provides ongoing services to the registrant that  
were not pre-approved pursuant to Rule 2-01(c)(7)(ii) of Regulation S-X is      
compatible with maintaining the principal accountants' independence.

Effective February 9, 2004, the Governance Committee of the Board of Trustees   
formalized the procedures by which a Fund's shareholders may recommend nominees 
to the registrant's Board of Trustees. The Governance Committee shall, when     
identifying candidates for the position of Independent Trustee, consider any    
such candidate recommended by a shareholder of a Fund if such recommendation    
contains sufficient background information concerning the candidate, and is     
received in a sufficiently timely manner (and in any event no later than the    
date specified for receipt of shareholder proposals in any applicable proxy     
statement with respect to a Fund). Shareholders shall be directed to address any
such recommendations to the attention of the Governance Committee, c/o the      
Secretary of the Fund.                                                          

ITEM 10. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

principal financial officer that the effectiveness of the registrant's current  
disclosure controls and procedures (such disclosure controls and procedures     
having been evaluated within 90 days of the date of this filing) provide        
reasonable assurance that the information required to be disclosed by the       
registrant has been recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
period specified in the Commission's rules and forms and that the information   
required to be disclosed by the registrant has been accumulated and communicated
to the registrant's principal executive officer and principal financial officer 
in order to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.               

(b) There have been no changes in the registrant's internal controls over       
financial reporting during the period that has materially affected, or is       
reasonably likely to materially affect the registrant's internal control over   
financial reporting.

3These shares are not available for new investments.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

About Risks: An imbalance in supply and demand in the income market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. As interest rates rise, the value of certain income investments is likely to decline. Fund performance is sensitive to stock market volatility. A Fund’s ability to utilize various tax-managed techniques may be curtailed or eliminated in the future by tax legislation or regulation. No Fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a Fund. The funds may engage in other investment practices that may involve additional risks and you should review a Fund prospectus for a complete description.

* These Funds have recently experienced negative performance. For the Fund’s performance as of the most recent month-end, please refer to our Performance page. Based on risk-adjusted returns. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Eaton Vance offers other mutual funds that are not listed here and that do not have similar performance records. Please consult with your financial advisor before investing.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.
