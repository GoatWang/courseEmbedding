Building on the Hillsboro, Oregon, campus



1994: acquired Cadis, Aachen, Germany. Through this acquisition Synopsys got the communication systems and DSP design tool suit named COSSAP. COSSAP stood for Communication System Simulation and Application Processor. Synopsys carried out various communication (predominantly wireless modems) design and consulting activities using this tool (and later the evolved new tool Co-centric System Studio). The Cadis group was a spin-off development initiative from Institute for Integrated Signal Processing Systems (ISS), RWTH Aachen, spearheaded by Professor Heinrich Meyr[4] and Professor Gerd Ascheid.[5] COSSAP was a competing product to SPW[6] from Cadence (now maintained and enhanced by Coware).[7] Synopsys stopped support on COSSAP since 2003 and promoted the enhanced tool Concentric System Studio.
1997: acquired EPIC Design Technology Inc., USA
1997: acquired Viewlogic Systems, Inc., USA
1998: acquired Systems Science, Inc.
June 6, 2002: merger with Avanti Corporation, USA. Avanti was founded when several ex-Cadence employees bought the startup ArcSys, which had previously merged with ISS, gaining Avanti its DRC/LVS tool Hercules (including 3D silicon structure modeling), then bought Compass Design Automation, which had fully integrated IC Design Flow and ASIC Libraries, especially its place and route tool, which Avanti reworked to create Saturn and Apollo II; and it also bought TMA which brought their pioneering TCAD and Proteus Optical proximity correction tools. This was, by far, Synopsys' most significant and controversial acquisition. At the time Avanti was the #4 company in the EDA industry, and was struggling with a major lawsuit from Cadence for software theft.[8]

ARC International PLC was the designer of ARC (Argonaut RISC Core) embedded processors, which were widely used in SoC devices for IoT, storage, digital home, mobile, and automotive applications. ARC processors have been licensed by more than 200 companies and are shipped in more than 1.5 Billion products per year.[39] ARC International was acquired by Synopsys in 2010.
The roots of ARC International date back to the early 1990s. The company was founded by Jez San to build upon the 3D accelerator technology previously developed for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System by a division of Argonaut Software. This forerunner to the ARC was originally called the Mario (Mathematical, Argonaut, Rotation & I/O) chip and later dubbed the Super FX. It went on to sell millions, at the time outselling ARM or any other RISC core.[40]
[41]
Following the success of the Super FX, its designers were split from the main company to a subsidiary called Argonaut Technology Ltd (ATL). The design was renamed to ARC and marketed as a general-purpose configurable microprocessor. Later, ATL spun off as a separate company, ARC International. In 1995 Bob Terwilliger took over as ARC's first CEO. He created the company licensing strategy, commercialized the product including the acquisition of Metaware, VAutomation and Precise Software. He raised $50 million pre-IPO and took the company public in September 2000, raising an additional $250 million.
A list of notable events following:

September 21, 2000, ARC listed on the London Stock Exchange as ARK.[42]
June 17, 2002, ARC took over three companies, MetaWare, VAutomation, and Precise Software Technologies [43] but later parts were sold off to other companies.
April 2007, ARC acquired Teja Technologies of San Jose, California, a specialist in heterogeneous multiprocessor software.[44][45]
June 14, 2007, ARC acquired Tenison Design Automation of Cambridge, UK, a provider of software tools used to help develop system-on-chip (SoC) designs.[46][47]
September 23, 2007, ARC acquired Alarity Corporation of St. Petersburg, Russia, that specializes in codec software, firmware, and advanced multimedia architectures.[48][49][50]
February 11, 2008, ARC acquired Sonic Focus, a specialist developer of audio enhancement technology for digital sound.[51]
July 29, 2009, ARC confirmed they were in discussions with a third party regarding an offer for the company.
August 18, 2009, Virage Logic Announces Intent to Acquire ARC International'.[52]
September 15, 2009, Virage Logic Declares Offer to Acquire ARC International Unconditional in All Respects.[53]
November 5, 2009, Virage Logic completes acquisition of ARC International.[54]
June 10, 2010, Synopsys declares offer to acquire Virage Logic including ARC.[55]
September 2, 2010, Synopsys completes acquisition of Virage Logic[56]

Since 2006 Clarified Networks has in particular concentrated in developing the collaborative focus in their products and currently refers to itself as a provider of Collaborative Network Analysis tools. Practical applications for Clarified Networks' tools are for example Traffic Auditing, troubleshooting and malware analysis.
Products[edit]
Clarified Networks provides a wide set of different situation awareness tools,[60] including:
Virtual Situation Room (VSRoom) provides unified, real-time views to the information provided by your monitoring systems. With VSRoom you will be able to collect, visualize and share monitoring data collected from your critical infrastructure. It provides beautiful situation overviews of complex data for decision makers and first line operation centers.
AbuseHelper is an open framework for collecting and sharing intelligence on suspected malicious activity. Clarified Networks is the lead developer and community contributor of AbuseHelper.
Network Analyzer is the tool of choice for collaborative analysis and visualization of complex networks. The analyzer helps you in collaborative troubleshooting, traffic audits and network documentation based on real traffic.
History[edit]
The research and development for Clarified Networks' tools began in 2002 and continued for four years in the Oulu University Secure Programming Group (OUSPG) before Clarified Networks spun off from the research group in 2006.
The company entered the Venture Cup competition that year, and was one of the finalists.[61]
In 2007, the founders of Clarified Networks also were awarded for their VMware Applicance called HowNetWorks.[62][63]

Building on the Hillsboro, Oregon, campus



1994: acquired Cadis, Aachen, Germany. Through this acquisition Synopsys got the communication systems and DSP design tool suit named COSSAP. COSSAP stood for Communication System Simulation and Application Processor. Synopsys carried out various communication (predominantly wireless modems) design and consulting activities using this tool (and later the evolved new tool Co-centric System Studio). The Cadis group was a spin-off development initiative from Institute for Integrated Signal Processing Systems (ISS), RWTH Aachen, spearheaded by Professor Heinrich Meyr[4] and Professor Gerd Ascheid.[5] COSSAP was a competing product to SPW[6] from Cadence (now maintained and enhanced by Coware).[7] Synopsys stopped support on COSSAP since 2003 and promoted the enhanced tool Concentric System Studio.
1997: acquired EPIC Design Technology Inc., USA
1997: acquired Viewlogic Systems, Inc., USA
1998: acquired Systems Science, Inc.
June 6, 2002: merger with Avanti Corporation, USA. Avanti was founded when several ex-Cadence employees bought the startup ArcSys, which had previously merged with ISS, gaining Avanti its DRC/LVS tool Hercules (including 3D silicon structure modeling), then bought Compass Design Automation, which had fully integrated IC Design Flow and ASIC Libraries, especially its place and route tool, which Avanti reworked to create Saturn and Apollo II; and it also bought TMA which brought their pioneering TCAD and Proteus Optical proximity correction tools. This was, by far, Synopsys' most significant and controversial acquisition. At the time Avanti was the #4 company in the EDA industry, and was struggling with a major lawsuit from Cadence for software theft.[8]

ARC International PLC was the designer of ARC (Argonaut RISC Core) embedded processors, which were widely used in SoC devices for IoT, storage, digital home, mobile, and automotive applications. ARC processors have been licensed by more than 200 companies and are shipped in more than 1.5 Billion products per year.[39] ARC International was acquired by Synopsys in 2010.
The roots of ARC International date back to the early 1990s. The company was founded by Jez San to build upon the 3D accelerator technology previously developed for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System by a division of Argonaut Software. This forerunner to the ARC was originally called the Mario (Mathematical, Argonaut, Rotation & I/O) chip and later dubbed the Super FX. It went on to sell millions, at the time outselling ARM or any other RISC core.[40]
[41]
Following the success of the Super FX, its designers were split from the main company to a subsidiary called Argonaut Technology Ltd (ATL). The design was renamed to ARC and marketed as a general-purpose configurable microprocessor. Later, ATL spun off as a separate company, ARC International. In 1995 Bob Terwilliger took over as ARC's first CEO. He created the company licensing strategy, commercialized the product including the acquisition of Metaware, VAutomation and Precise Software. He raised $50 million pre-IPO and took the company public in September 2000, raising an additional $250 million.
A list of notable events following:

September 21, 2000, ARC listed on the London Stock Exchange as ARK.[42]
June 17, 2002, ARC took over three companies, MetaWare, VAutomation, and Precise Software Technologies [43] but later parts were sold off to other companies.
April 2007, ARC acquired Teja Technologies of San Jose, California, a specialist in heterogeneous multiprocessor software.[44][45]
June 14, 2007, ARC acquired Tenison Design Automation of Cambridge, UK, a provider of software tools used to help develop system-on-chip (SoC) designs.[46][47]
September 23, 2007, ARC acquired Alarity Corporation of St. Petersburg, Russia, that specializes in codec software, firmware, and advanced multimedia architectures.[48][49][50]
February 11, 2008, ARC acquired Sonic Focus, a specialist developer of audio enhancement technology for digital sound.[51]
July 29, 2009, ARC confirmed they were in discussions with a third party regarding an offer for the company.
August 18, 2009, Virage Logic Announces Intent to Acquire ARC International'.[52]
September 15, 2009, Virage Logic Declares Offer to Acquire ARC International Unconditional in All Respects.[53]
November 5, 2009, Virage Logic completes acquisition of ARC International.[54]
June 10, 2010, Synopsys declares offer to acquire Virage Logic including ARC.[55]
September 2, 2010, Synopsys completes acquisition of Virage Logic[56]

Avanti Corporation[edit]
Avanti Corporation (the 'i' in "Avanti" is upside down, so it is also often seen as Avant!) was an electronic design automation company, purchased by Synopsys in 2002 (see wikt:avanti for the meaning of the word).
Clarified Networks[edit]
Clarified Networks is a company that is headquartered in Oulu, Finland. The company was acquired by Codenomicon in 2011, but continues to operate as a separate company under the Codenomicon Group.[57]
The company is most famous for producing visualizations of security incidents, for example the patching of DNS cache poisoning attacks[58] and Botnet[59] traffic.
Since 2006 Clarified Networks has in particular concentrated in developing the collaborative focus in their products and currently refers to itself as a provider of Collaborative Network Analysis tools. Practical applications for Clarified Networks' tools are for example Traffic Auditing, troubleshooting and malware analysis.
Products[edit]
Clarified Networks provides a wide set of different situation awareness tools,[60] including:
Virtual Situation Room (VSRoom) provides unified, real-time views to the information provided by your monitoring systems. With VSRoom you will be able to collect, visualize and share monitoring data collected from your critical infrastructure. It provides beautiful situation overviews of complex data for decision makers and first line operation centers.
AbuseHelper is an open framework for collecting and sharing intelligence on suspected malicious activity. Clarified Networks is the lead developer and community contributor of AbuseHelper.
Network Analyzer is the tool of choice for collaborative analysis and visualization of complex networks. The analyzer helps you in collaborative troubleshooting, traffic audits and network documentation based on real traffic.
History[edit]
The research and development for Clarified Networks' tools began in 2002 and continued for four years in the Oulu University Secure Programming Group (OUSPG) before Clarified Networks spun off from the research group in 2006.
The company entered the Venture Cup competition that year, and was one of the finalists.[61]
In 2007, the founders of Clarified Networks also were awarded for their VMware Applicance called HowNetWorks.[62][63]
In 2011, Company was acquired by Codenomicon.

Building on the Hillsboro, Oregon, campus



1994: acquired Cadis, Aachen, Germany. Through this acquisition Synopsys got the communication systems and DSP design tool suit named COSSAP. COSSAP stood for Communication System Simulation and Application Processor. Synopsys carried out various communication (predominantly wireless modems) design and consulting activities using this tool (and later the evolved new tool Co-centric System Studio). The Cadis group was a spin-off development initiative from Institute for Integrated Signal Processing Systems (ISS), RWTH Aachen, spearheaded by Professor Heinrich Meyr[4] and Professor Gerd Ascheid.[5] COSSAP was a competing product to SPW[6] from Cadence (now maintained and enhanced by Coware).[7] Synopsys stopped support on COSSAP since 2003 and promoted the enhanced tool Concentric System Studio.
1997: acquired EPIC Design Technology Inc., USA
1997: acquired Viewlogic Systems, Inc., USA
1998: acquired Systems Science, Inc.
June 6, 2002: merger with Avanti Corporation, USA. Avanti was founded when several ex-Cadence employees bought the startup ArcSys, which had previously merged with ISS, gaining Avanti its DRC/LVS tool Hercules (including 3D silicon structure modeling), then bought Compass Design Automation, which had fully integrated IC Design Flow and ASIC Libraries, especially its place and route tool, which Avanti reworked to create Saturn and Apollo II; and it also bought TMA which brought their pioneering TCAD and Proteus Optical proximity correction tools. This was, by far, Synopsys' most significant and controversial acquisition. At the time Avanti was the #4 company in the EDA industry, and was struggling with a major lawsuit from Cadence for software theft.[8]

ARC International PLC was the designer of ARC (Argonaut RISC Core) embedded processors, which were widely used in SoC devices for IoT, storage, digital home, mobile, and automotive applications. ARC processors have been licensed by more than 200 companies and are shipped in more than 1.5 Billion products per year.[39] ARC International was acquired by Synopsys in 2010.
The roots of ARC International date back to the early 1990s. The company was founded by Jez San to build upon the 3D accelerator technology previously developed for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System by a division of Argonaut Software. This forerunner to the ARC was originally called the Mario (Mathematical, Argonaut, Rotation & I/O) chip and later dubbed the Super FX. It went on to sell millions, at the time outselling ARM or any other RISC core.[40]
[41]
Following the success of the Super FX, its designers were split from the main company to a subsidiary called Argonaut Technology Ltd (ATL). The design was renamed to ARC and marketed as a general-purpose configurable microprocessor. Later, ATL spun off as a separate company, ARC International. In 1995 Bob Terwilliger took over as ARC's first CEO. He created the company licensing strategy, commercialized the product including the acquisition of Metaware, VAutomation and Precise Software. He raised $50 million pre-IPO and took the company public in September 2000, raising an additional $250 million.
A list of notable events following:

September 21, 2000, ARC listed on the London Stock Exchange as ARK.[42]
June 17, 2002, ARC took over three companies, MetaWare, VAutomation, and Precise Software Technologies [43] but later parts were sold off to other companies.
April 2007, ARC acquired Teja Technologies of San Jose, California, a specialist in heterogeneous multiprocessor software.[44][45]
June 14, 2007, ARC acquired Tenison Design Automation of Cambridge, UK, a provider of software tools used to help develop system-on-chip (SoC) designs.[46][47]
September 23, 2007, ARC acquired Alarity Corporation of St. Petersburg, Russia, that specializes in codec software, firmware, and advanced multimedia architectures.[48][49][50]
February 11, 2008, ARC acquired Sonic Focus, a specialist developer of audio enhancement technology for digital sound.[51]
July 29, 2009, ARC confirmed they were in discussions with a third party regarding an offer for the company.
August 18, 2009, Virage Logic Announces Intent to Acquire ARC International'.[52]
September 15, 2009, Virage Logic Declares Offer to Acquire ARC International Unconditional in All Respects.[53]
November 5, 2009, Virage Logic completes acquisition of ARC International.[54]
June 10, 2010, Synopsys declares offer to acquire Virage Logic including ARC.[55]
September 2, 2010, Synopsys completes acquisition of Virage Logic[56]

Avanti Corporation[edit]
Avanti Corporation (the 'i' in "Avanti" is upside down, so it is also often seen as Avant!) was an electronic design automation company, purchased by Synopsys in 2002 (see wikt:avanti for the meaning of the word).
Clarified Networks[edit]
Clarified Networks is a company that is headquartered in Oulu, Finland. The company was acquired by Codenomicon in 2011, but continues to operate as a separate company under the Codenomicon Group.[57]
The company is most famous for producing visualizations of security incidents, for example the patching of DNS cache poisoning attacks[58] and Botnet[59] traffic.
Since 2006 Clarified Networks has in particular concentrated in developing the collaborative focus in their products and currently refers to itself as a provider of Collaborative Network Analysis tools. Practical applications for Clarified Networks' tools are for example Traffic Auditing, troubleshooting and malware analysis.
Products[edit]
Clarified Networks provides a wide set of different situation awareness tools,[60] including:
Virtual Situation Room (VSRoom) provides unified, real-time views to the information provided by your monitoring systems. With VSRoom you will be able to collect, visualize and share monitoring data collected from your critical infrastructure. It provides beautiful situation overviews of complex data for decision makers and first line operation centers.
AbuseHelper is an open framework for collecting and sharing intelligence on suspected malicious activity. Clarified Networks is the lead developer and community contributor of AbuseHelper.
Network Analyzer is the tool of choice for collaborative analysis and visualization of complex networks. The analyzer helps you in collaborative troubleshooting, traffic audits and network documentation based on real traffic.
History[edit]
The research and development for Clarified Networks' tools began in 2002 and continued for four years in the Oulu University Secure Programming Group (OUSPG) before Clarified Networks spun off from the research group in 2006.
The company entered the Venture Cup competition that year, and was one of the finalists.[61]
In 2007, the founders of Clarified Networks also were awarded for their VMware Applicance called HowNetWorks.[62][63]
In 2011, Company was acquired by Codenomicon.

Building on the Hillsboro, Oregon, campus



1994: acquired Cadis, Aachen, Germany. Through this acquisition Synopsys got the communication systems and DSP design tool suit named COSSAP. COSSAP stood for Communication System Simulation and Application Processor. Synopsys carried out various communication (predominantly wireless modems) design and consulting activities using this tool (and later the evolved new tool Co-centric System Studio). The Cadis group was a spin-off development initiative from Institute for Integrated Signal Processing Systems (ISS), RWTH Aachen, spearheaded by Professor Heinrich Meyr[4] and Professor Gerd Ascheid.[5] COSSAP was a competing product to SPW[6] from Cadence (now maintained and enhanced by Coware).[7] Synopsys stopped support on COSSAP since 2003 and promoted the enhanced tool Concentric System Studio.
1997: acquired EPIC Design Technology Inc., USA
1997: acquired Viewlogic Systems, Inc., USA
1998: acquired Systems Science, Inc.
June 6, 2002: merger with Avanti Corporation, USA. Avanti was founded when several ex-Cadence employees bought the startup ArcSys, which had previously merged with ISS, gaining Avanti its DRC/LVS tool Hercules (including 3D silicon structure modeling), then bought Compass Design Automation, which had fully integrated IC Design Flow and ASIC Libraries, especially its place and route tool, which Avanti reworked to create Saturn and Apollo II; and it also bought TMA which brought their pioneering TCAD and Proteus Optical proximity correction tools. This was, by far, Synopsys' most significant and controversial acquisition. At the time Avanti was the #4 company in the EDA industry, and was struggling with a major lawsuit from Cadence for software theft.[8]

ARC International PLC was the designer of ARC (Argonaut RISC Core) embedded processors, which were widely used in SoC devices for IoT, storage, digital home, mobile, and automotive applications. ARC processors have been licensed by more than 200 companies and are shipped in more than 1.5 Billion products per year.[39] ARC International was acquired by Synopsys in 2010.
The roots of ARC International date back to the early 1990s. The company was founded by Jez San to build upon the 3D accelerator technology previously developed for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System by a division of Argonaut Software. This forerunner to the ARC was originally called the Mario (Mathematical, Argonaut, Rotation & I/O) chip and later dubbed the Super FX. It went on to sell millions, at the time outselling ARM or any other RISC core.[40]
[41]
Following the success of the Super FX, its designers were split from the main company to a subsidiary called Argonaut Technology Ltd (ATL). The design was renamed to ARC and marketed as a general-purpose configurable microprocessor. Later, ATL spun off as a separate company, ARC International. In 1995 Bob Terwilliger took over as ARC's first CEO. He created the company licensing strategy, commercialized the product including the acquisition of Metaware, VAutomation and Precise Software. He raised $50 million pre-IPO and took the company public in September 2000, raising an additional $250 million.
A list of notable events following:

September 21, 2000, ARC listed on the London Stock Exchange as ARK.[42]
June 17, 2002, ARC took over three companies, MetaWare, VAutomation, and Precise Software Technologies [43] but later parts were sold off to other companies.
April 2007, ARC acquired Teja Technologies of San Jose, California, a specialist in heterogeneous multiprocessor software.[44][45]
June 14, 2007, ARC acquired Tenison Design Automation of Cambridge, UK, a provider of software tools used to help develop system-on-chip (SoC) designs.[46][47]
September 23, 2007, ARC acquired Alarity Corporation of St. Petersburg, Russia, that specializes in codec software, firmware, and advanced multimedia architectures.[48][49][50]
February 11, 2008, ARC acquired Sonic Focus, a specialist developer of audio enhancement technology for digital sound.[51]
July 29, 2009, ARC confirmed they were in discussions with a third party regarding an offer for the company.
August 18, 2009, Virage Logic Announces Intent to Acquire ARC International'.[52]
September 15, 2009, Virage Logic Declares Offer to Acquire ARC International Unconditional in All Respects.[53]
November 5, 2009, Virage Logic completes acquisition of ARC International.[54]
June 10, 2010, Synopsys declares offer to acquire Virage Logic including ARC.[55]
September 2, 2010, Synopsys completes acquisition of Virage Logic[56]

Avanti Corporation[edit]
Avanti Corporation (the 'i' in "Avanti" is upside down, so it is also often seen as Avant!) was an electronic design automation company, purchased by Synopsys in 2002 (see wikt:avanti for the meaning of the word).
Clarified Networks[edit]
Clarified Networks is a company that is headquartered in Oulu, Finland. The company was acquired by Codenomicon in 2011, but continues to operate as a separate company under the Codenomicon Group.[57]
The company is most famous for producing visualizations of security incidents, for example the patching of DNS cache poisoning attacks[58] and Botnet[59] traffic.
Since 2006 Clarified Networks has in particular concentrated in developing the collaborative focus in their products and currently refers to itself as a provider of Collaborative Network Analysis tools. Practical applications for Clarified Networks' tools are for example Traffic Auditing, troubleshooting and malware analysis.
Products[edit]
Clarified Networks provides a wide set of different situation awareness tools,[60] including:
Virtual Situation Room (VSRoom) provides unified, real-time views to the information provided by your monitoring systems. With VSRoom you will be able to collect, visualize and share monitoring data collected from your critical infrastructure. It provides beautiful situation overviews of complex data for decision makers and first line operation centers.
AbuseHelper is an open framework for collecting and sharing intelligence on suspected malicious activity. Clarified Networks is the lead developer and community contributor of AbuseHelper.
Network Analyzer is the tool of choice for collaborative analysis and visualization of complex networks. The analyzer helps you in collaborative troubleshooting, traffic audits and network documentation based on real traffic.
History[edit]
The research and development for Clarified Networks' tools began in 2002 and continued for four years in the Oulu University Secure Programming Group (OUSPG) before Clarified Networks spun off from the research group in 2006.
The company entered the Venture Cup competition that year, and was one of the finalists.[61]
In 2007, the founders of Clarified Networks also were awarded for their VMware Applicance called HowNetWorks.[62][63]
In 2011, Company was acquired by Codenomicon.

History[edit]
Founded in 1986 by Aart J. de Geus and engineers from General Electric's Microelectronics Center in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, Synopsys was first established as "Optimal Solutions" with a charter to develop and market synthesis technology developed by the team at General Electric.
Acquisitions, mergers, spinoffs[edit]





This article is in a list format that may be better presented using prose. You can help by converting this article to prose, if appropriate. Editing help is available. (April 2017)






Building on the Hillsboro, Oregon, campus



1994: acquired Cadis, Aachen, Germany. Through this acquisition Synopsys got the communication systems and DSP design tool suit named COSSAP. COSSAP stood for Communication System Simulation and Application Processor. Synopsys carried out various communication (predominantly wireless modems) design and consulting activities using this tool (and later the evolved new tool Co-centric System Studio). The Cadis group was a spin-off development initiative from Institute for Integrated Signal Processing Systems (ISS), RWTH Aachen, spearheaded by Professor Heinrich Meyr[4] and Professor Gerd Ascheid.[5] COSSAP was a competing product to SPW[6] from Cadence (now maintained and enhanced by Coware).[7] Synopsys stopped support on COSSAP since 2003 and promoted the enhanced tool Concentric System Studio.
1997: acquired EPIC Design Technology Inc., USA
1997: acquired Viewlogic Systems, Inc., USA
1998: acquired Systems Science, Inc.
June 6, 2002: merger with Avanti Corporation, USA. Avanti was founded when several ex-Cadence employees bought the startup ArcSys, which had previously merged with ISS, gaining Avanti its DRC/LVS tool Hercules (including 3D silicon structure modeling), then bought Compass Design Automation, which had fully integrated IC Design Flow and ASIC Libraries, especially its place and route tool, which Avanti reworked to create Saturn and Apollo II; and it also bought TMA which brought their pioneering TCAD and Proteus Optical proximity correction tools. This was, by far, Synopsys' most significant and controversial acquisition. At the time Avanti was the #4 company in the EDA industry, and was struggling with a major lawsuit from Cadence for software theft.[8]

ARC International PLC was the designer of ARC (Argonaut RISC Core) embedded processors, which were widely used in SoC devices for IoT, storage, digital home, mobile, and automotive applications. ARC processors have been licensed by more than 200 companies and are shipped in more than 1.5 Billion products per year.[39] ARC International was acquired by Synopsys in 2010.
The roots of ARC International date back to the early 1990s. The company was founded by Jez San to build upon the 3D accelerator technology previously developed for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System by a division of Argonaut Software. This forerunner to the ARC was originally called the Mario (Mathematical, Argonaut, Rotation & I/O) chip and later dubbed the Super FX. It went on to sell millions, at the time outselling ARM or any other RISC core.[40]
[41]
Following the success of the Super FX, its designers were split from the main company to a subsidiary called Argonaut Technology Ltd (ATL). The design was renamed to ARC and marketed as a general-purpose configurable microprocessor. Later, ATL spun off as a separate company, ARC International. In 1995 Bob Terwilliger took over as ARC's first CEO. He created the company licensing strategy, commercialized the product including the acquisition of Metaware, VAutomation and Precise Software. He raised $50 million pre-IPO and took the company public in September 2000, raising an additional $250 million.
A list of notable events following:

September 21, 2000, ARC listed on the London Stock Exchange as ARK.[42]
June 17, 2002, ARC took over three companies, MetaWare, VAutomation, and Precise Software Technologies [43] but later parts were sold off to other companies.
April 2007, ARC acquired Teja Technologies of San Jose, California, a specialist in heterogeneous multiprocessor software.[44][45]
June 14, 2007, ARC acquired Tenison Design Automation of Cambridge, UK, a provider of software tools used to help develop system-on-chip (SoC) designs.[46][47]
September 23, 2007, ARC acquired Alarity Corporation of St. Petersburg, Russia, that specializes in codec software, firmware, and advanced multimedia architectures.[48][49][50]
February 11, 2008, ARC acquired Sonic Focus, a specialist developer of audio enhancement technology for digital sound.[51]
July 29, 2009, ARC confirmed they were in discussions with a third party regarding an offer for the company.
August 18, 2009, Virage Logic Announces Intent to Acquire ARC International'.[52]
September 15, 2009, Virage Logic Declares Offer to Acquire ARC International Unconditional in All Respects.[53]
November 5, 2009, Virage Logic completes acquisition of ARC International.[54]
June 10, 2010, Synopsys declares offer to acquire Virage Logic including ARC.[55]
September 2, 2010, Synopsys completes acquisition of Virage Logic[56]

Avanti Corporation[edit]
Avanti Corporation (the 'i' in "Avanti" is upside down, so it is also often seen as Avant!) was an electronic design automation company, purchased by Synopsys in 2002 (see wikt:avanti for the meaning of the word).
Clarified Networks[edit]
Clarified Networks is a company that is headquartered in Oulu, Finland. The company was acquired by Codenomicon in 2011, but continues to operate as a separate company under the Codenomicon Group.[57]
The company is most famous for producing visualizations of security incidents, for example the patching of DNS cache poisoning attacks[58] and Botnet[59] traffic.
Since 2006 Clarified Networks has in particular concentrated in developing the collaborative focus in their products and currently refers to itself as a provider of Collaborative Network Analysis tools. Practical applications for Clarified Networks' tools are for example Traffic Auditing, troubleshooting and malware analysis.
Products[edit]
Clarified Networks provides a wide set of different situation awareness tools,[60] including:
Virtual Situation Room (VSRoom) provides unified, real-time views to the information provided by your monitoring systems. With VSRoom you will be able to collect, visualize and share monitoring data collected from your critical infrastructure.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Verifying your recruitment by Synopsys



Fraudulent recruiting tactics are increasingly common. Synopsys takes the hiring process very seriously―we value our candidates’ time and have official procedures in place that protect your privacy.
If you have received communication from a person who:

Uses an email domain other than synopsys.com
Interviews you online and/or via text/instant message
Provides you a job requisition number that cannot be verified on the Synopsys.com Careers Page
Asks for your bank account information so he/she can deposit a check

This is not a legitimate Synopsys recruiter or hiring manager.
Our recruiters never ask candidates to disclose bank account information during the interview process. To verify that the communication is legitimate, please send an email to staffing@synopsys.com.

ANSYS and Synopsys to Partner in Accelerating Robust Design Optimization for Next Generation High-Performance Computing, Mobile and Automotive Products









ANSYS and Synopsys to Partner in Accelerating Robust Design Optimization for Next Generation High-Performance Computing, Mobile and Automotive Products
Exclusive product integration to combine power and reliability signoff solution with physical implementation solution for in-design analysis to spur future smart product development
PITTSBURGH,  PA and MOUNTAIN VIEW, CA, June 19, 2017 – ANSYS (NASDAQ:  ANSS) and Synopsys (NASDAQ: SNPS) will enable customers to accelerate the next  generation of high-performance computing, mobile and automotive products thanks  to a new partnership that will tightly integrate ANSYS’ power  integrity and reliability signoff technologies with Synopsys’ physical implementation solution for in-design usage.
Developers of  innovative, cost-effective and reliable smart products need to quickly optimize, validate and signoff their designs. While designers have been using ANSYS and  Synopsys tools in combination for years, the integrated solution will  enable mutual customers to apply power integrity and reliability signoff technologies earlier in the design flow – empowering them to deliver innovative, high-performance and reliable  products faster, while reducing power, area and cost.
The integration of ANSYS’ industry-leading platform for chip power and reliability signoff, ANSYS® RedHawk™, with Synopsys’ best-in-class place-and-route solutions, Synopsys IC  Compiler™ II, will provide users earlier signoff accuracy within the Synopsys  design environment. This integration  will enable rapid design exploration, design weakness detection, optimization  and thermal-aware reliability through increased functionality within the  place-and-route environment. The in-design power integrity and reliability  signoff-driven flow will eliminate late design changes and ensure consistency  with final chip-package-system signoff analyses with RedHawk.
“This  partnership is a continued step in Synopsys’ strategy to bring more physical  and signoff technologies earlier in the design flow within our Synopsys Digital  Design Platform,” said Sassine Ghazi, senior vice president and co-general  manager, Design Group at Synopsys. “Partnering with ANSYS enables Synopsys to  quickly deliver a reliability and thermal-driven design flow that is critical for designing the next generation of semiconductors.”
Synopsys and ANSYS will also provide a feedback loop between the two-gold standard solutions, Synopsys PrimeTime® and ANSYS RedHawk. Voltage-aware timing analysis can be performed rapidly to  avoid additional guard-banding and design margining. 
“As  the industry moves to more and more complex chips, signoff-driven rail analysis needs to be available sooner in the physical design flow just like timing and design  rule checking,” said John Lee, general manager at ANSYS. “We believe partnering  with Synopsys to bring our signoff technology into the Synopsys In-Design  approach is the right way to accomplish this objective.”
“TSMC  collaborates with our EDA partners on silicon design solutions to enable our customers to achieve competitive performance, power and area for their next  generation electronic products,” said Suk Lee, TSMC senior director, Design  Infrastructure Marketing Division. “This industry collaboration between Synopsys and ANSYS provides an opportunity for them to take the collaboration a step further by enabling reliability and thermal-driven physical design built on the industry’s popular physical implementation and signoff solutions.”
“ARM has been a long-time user of both Synopsys and ANSYS technologies, which have helped in the development of some of the most sophisticated CPU cores available in the market,” said Hobson Bullman, vice president and general manager, TSG, ARM. “This announced partnership will enable our semiconductor partners to  optimize our IP within their SoC designs earlier in the flow allowing more time  to focus on reliable, robust and energy efficient designs.”
"Both  Synopsys and ANSYS have been strong collaboration partners with MediaTek to manage increasing manufacturing complexity and to deliver designs on schedule  while realizing aggressive performance, power and area goals," said SA Hwang, general manager of Design Technology, MediaTek. “We  believe this new partnership between Synopsys and ANSYS will enable MediaTek  engineers to accelerate their pace of innovation while achieving further power,  performance and area optimizations.”
ANSYS and  Synopsys will be featured at the Design Automation Conference in booth 647 and  booth 147 respectively, from June 18-22 in Austin, Texas.

"The technological demands at the heart of embedded vision applications, in the neural network, require solutions that deliver the combination of high precision and performance with low power and area use," said Toshi Torihara, vice president at Morpho US, Inc. "The unique combination of the vector DSPs and programmable CNN engine in the DesignWare EV6x Vision Processor enables developers to implement vision functionality in their embedded devices with much higher performance efficiency than CPU- and GPU-based alternatives." 
The DesignWare EV6x Processor family integrates scalar, vector DSP and CNN processing units for highly accurate and fast vision processing. The EV6x supports any convolutional neural network, including popular networks such as AlexNet, VGG16, GoogLeNet, Yolo, Faster R-CNN, SqueezeNet and ResNet. Designers can run CNN graphs originally trained for 32-bit floating point hardware on the EV6x's 12-bit CNN engine, significantly reducing the power and area of their designs while maintaining the same levels of detection accuracy. The engine delivers power efficiency of up to 2,000 GMACs/sec/W when implemented in 16-nm FinFET process technologies (worst-case conditions). The EV6x's CNN hardware also supports neural networks trained for 8-bit precision to take advantage of the lower memory bandwidth and power requirements of these graph types.
To simplify software application development, the EV6x processors are supported by a comprehensive suite of tools and software. The latest release of the DesignWare ARC® MetaWare EV Development Toolkit includes a CNN mapping tool that analyzes neural networks trained using popular frameworks like Caffe and Tensorflow, and automatically generates the executable for the programmable CNN engine. For maximum flexibility and future-proofing, the tool can also distribute computations between the vision CPU and CNN resources to support new and emerging neural network algorithms as well as customer-specific CNN layers. Combined with software development tools based on OpenVX™, OpenCV and OpenCL C embedded vision standards, the MetaWare EV Development Toolkit offers a full suite of tools needed to accelerate embedded software development.
"As high-performance neural networks become more prevalent in artificial intelligence applications, designers require both the hardware technology and software tools to deliver their vision-enabled SoCs on schedule," said John Koeter, vice president of marketing for IP at Synopsys. "With the performance and feature enhancements to the silicon-proven EV6x Vision Processors, designers can more efficiently design and deploy machine learning-based applications with the performance and power efficiency necessary to differentiate in their markets."
Availability & Resources
The DesignWare EV61, EV62 and EV64 processors with enhanced optional CNN engine are scheduled to be available in August 2017. The MetaWare EV Development Toolkit is available now. Support for the TensorFlow framework in the Toolkit's CNN mapping tool is scheduled to be available in October 2017.

Building on the Hillsboro, Oregon, campus



1994: acquired Cadis, Aachen, Germany. Through this acquisition Synopsys got the communication systems and DSP design tool suit named COSSAP. COSSAP stood for Communication System Simulation and Application Processor. Synopsys carried out various communication (predominantly wireless modems) design and consulting activities using this tool (and later the evolved new tool Co-centric System Studio). The Cadis group was a spin-off development initiative from Institute for Integrated Signal Processing Systems (ISS), RWTH Aachen, spearheaded by Professor Heinrich Meyr[4] and Professor Gerd Ascheid.[5] COSSAP was a competing product to SPW[6] from Cadence (now maintained and enhanced by Coware).[7] Synopsys stopped support on COSSAP since 2003 and promoted the enhanced tool Concentric System Studio.
1997: acquired EPIC Design Technology Inc., USA
1997: acquired Viewlogic Systems, Inc., USA
1998: acquired Systems Science, Inc.
June 6, 2002: merger with Avanti Corporation, USA. Avanti was founded when several ex-Cadence employees bought the startup ArcSys, which had previously merged with ISS, gaining Avanti its DRC/LVS tool Hercules (including 3D silicon structure modeling), then bought Compass Design Automation, which had fully integrated IC Design Flow and ASIC Libraries, especially its place and route tool, which Avanti reworked to create Saturn and Apollo II; and it also bought TMA which brought their pioneering TCAD and Proteus Optical proximity correction tools. This was, by far, Synopsys' most significant and controversial acquisition. At the time Avanti was the #4 company in the EDA industry, and was struggling with a major lawsuit from Cadence for software theft.[8]

ARC International PLC was the designer of ARC (Argonaut RISC Core) embedded processors, which were widely used in SoC devices for IoT, storage, digital home, mobile, and automotive applications. ARC processors have been licensed by more than 200 companies and are shipped in more than 1.5 Billion products per year.[39] ARC International was acquired by Synopsys in 2010.
The roots of ARC International date back to the early 1990s. The company was founded by Jez San to build upon the 3D accelerator technology previously developed for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System by a division of Argonaut Software. This forerunner to the ARC was originally called the Mario (Mathematical, Argonaut, Rotation & I/O) chip and later dubbed the Super FX. It went on to sell millions, at the time outselling ARM or any other RISC core.[40]
[41]
Following the success of the Super FX, its designers were split from the main company to a subsidiary called Argonaut Technology Ltd (ATL). The design was renamed to ARC and marketed as a general-purpose configurable microprocessor. Later, ATL spun off as a separate company, ARC International. In 1995 Bob Terwilliger took over as ARC's first CEO. He created the company licensing strategy, commercialized the product including the acquisition of Metaware, VAutomation and Precise Software. He raised $50 million pre-IPO and took the company public in September 2000, raising an additional $250 million.
A list of notable events following:

September 21, 2000, ARC listed on the London Stock Exchange as ARK.[42]
June 17, 2002, ARC took over three companies, MetaWare, VAutomation, and Precise Software Technologies [43] but later parts were sold off to other companies.
April 2007, ARC acquired Teja Technologies of San Jose, California, a specialist in heterogeneous multiprocessor software.[44][45]
June 14, 2007, ARC acquired Tenison Design Automation of Cambridge, UK, a provider of software tools used to help develop system-on-chip (SoC) designs.[46][47]
September 23, 2007, ARC acquired Alarity Corporation of St. Petersburg, Russia, that specializes in codec software, firmware, and advanced multimedia architectures.[48][49][50]
February 11, 2008, ARC acquired Sonic Focus, a specialist developer of audio enhancement technology for digital sound.[51]
July 29, 2009, ARC confirmed they were in discussions with a third party regarding an offer for the company.
August 18, 2009, Virage Logic Announces Intent to Acquire ARC International'.[52]
September 15, 2009, Virage Logic Declares Offer to Acquire ARC International Unconditional in All Respects.[53]
November 5, 2009, Virage Logic completes acquisition of ARC International.[54]
June 10, 2010, Synopsys declares offer to acquire Virage Logic including ARC.[55]
September 2, 2010, Synopsys completes acquisition of Virage Logic[56]

Since 2006 Clarified Networks has in particular concentrated in developing the collaborative focus in their products and currently refers to itself as a provider of Collaborative Network Analysis tools. Practical applications for Clarified Networks' tools are for example Traffic Auditing, troubleshooting and malware analysis.
Products[edit]
Clarified Networks provides a wide set of different situation awareness tools,[60] including:
Virtual Situation Room (VSRoom) provides unified, real-time views to the information provided by your monitoring systems. With VSRoom you will be able to collect, visualize and share monitoring data collected from your critical infrastructure. It provides beautiful situation overviews of complex data for decision makers and first line operation centers.
AbuseHelper is an open framework for collecting and sharing intelligence on suspected malicious activity. Clarified Networks is the lead developer and community contributor of AbuseHelper.
Network Analyzer is the tool of choice for collaborative analysis and visualization of complex networks. The analyzer helps you in collaborative troubleshooting, traffic audits and network documentation based on real traffic.
History[edit]
The research and development for Clarified Networks' tools began in 2002 and continued for four years in the Oulu University Secure Programming Group (OUSPG) before Clarified Networks spun off from the research group in 2006.
The company entered the Venture Cup competition that year, and was one of the finalists.[61]
In 2007, the founders of Clarified Networks also were awarded for their VMware Applicance called HowNetWorks.[62][63]

Building on the Hillsboro, Oregon, campus



1994: acquired Cadis, Aachen, Germany. Through this acquisition Synopsys got the communication systems and DSP design tool suit named COSSAP. COSSAP stood for Communication System Simulation and Application Processor. Synopsys carried out various communication (predominantly wireless modems) design and consulting activities using this tool (and later the evolved new tool Co-centric System Studio). The Cadis group was a spin-off development initiative from Institute for Integrated Signal Processing Systems (ISS), RWTH Aachen, spearheaded by Professor Heinrich Meyr[4] and Professor Gerd Ascheid.[5] COSSAP was a competing product to SPW[6] from Cadence (now maintained and enhanced by Coware).[7] Synopsys stopped support on COSSAP since 2003 and promoted the enhanced tool Concentric System Studio.
1997: acquired EPIC Design Technology Inc., USA
1997: acquired Viewlogic Systems, Inc., USA
1998: acquired Systems Science, Inc.
June 6, 2002: merger with Avanti Corporation, USA. Avanti was founded when several ex-Cadence employees bought the startup ArcSys, which had previously merged with ISS, gaining Avanti its DRC/LVS tool Hercules (including 3D silicon structure modeling), then bought Compass Design Automation, which had fully integrated IC Design Flow and ASIC Libraries, especially its place and route tool, which Avanti reworked to create Saturn and Apollo II; and it also bought TMA which brought their pioneering TCAD and Proteus Optical proximity correction tools. This was, by far, Synopsys' most significant and controversial acquisition. At the time Avanti was the #4 company in the EDA industry, and was struggling with a major lawsuit from Cadence for software theft.[8]

ARC International PLC was the designer of ARC (Argonaut RISC Core) embedded processors, which were widely used in SoC devices for IoT, storage, digital home, mobile, and automotive applications. ARC processors have been licensed by more than 200 companies and are shipped in more than 1.5 Billion products per year.[39] ARC International was acquired by Synopsys in 2010.
The roots of ARC International date back to the early 1990s. The company was founded by Jez San to build upon the 3D accelerator technology previously developed for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System by a division of Argonaut Software. This forerunner to the ARC was originally called the Mario (Mathematical, Argonaut, Rotation & I/O) chip and later dubbed the Super FX. It went on to sell millions, at the time outselling ARM or any other RISC core.[40]
[41]
Following the success of the Super FX, its designers were split from the main company to a subsidiary called Argonaut Technology Ltd (ATL). The design was renamed to ARC and marketed as a general-purpose configurable microprocessor. Later, ATL spun off as a separate company, ARC International. In 1995 Bob Terwilliger took over as ARC's first CEO. He created the company licensing strategy, commercialized the product including the acquisition of Metaware, VAutomation and Precise Software. He raised $50 million pre-IPO and took the company public in September 2000, raising an additional $250 million.
A list of notable events following:

September 21, 2000, ARC listed on the London Stock Exchange as ARK.[42]
June 17, 2002, ARC took over three companies, MetaWare, VAutomation, and Precise Software Technologies [43] but later parts were sold off to other companies.
April 2007, ARC acquired Teja Technologies of San Jose, California, a specialist in heterogeneous multiprocessor software.[44][45]
June 14, 2007, ARC acquired Tenison Design Automation of Cambridge, UK, a provider of software tools used to help develop system-on-chip (SoC) designs.[46][47]
September 23, 2007, ARC acquired Alarity Corporation of St. Petersburg, Russia, that specializes in codec software, firmware, and advanced multimedia architectures.[48][49][50]
February 11, 2008, ARC acquired Sonic Focus, a specialist developer of audio enhancement technology for digital sound.[51]
July 29, 2009, ARC confirmed they were in discussions with a third party regarding an offer for the company.
August 18, 2009, Virage Logic Announces Intent to Acquire ARC International'.[52]
September 15, 2009, Virage Logic Declares Offer to Acquire ARC International Unconditional in All Respects.[53]
November 5, 2009, Virage Logic completes acquisition of ARC International.[54]
June 10, 2010, Synopsys declares offer to acquire Virage Logic including ARC.[55]
September 2, 2010, Synopsys completes acquisition of Virage Logic[56]

Avanti Corporation[edit]
Avanti Corporation (the 'i' in "Avanti" is upside down, so it is also often seen as Avant!) was an electronic design automation company, purchased by Synopsys in 2002 (see wikt:avanti for the meaning of the word).
Clarified Networks[edit]
Clarified Networks is a company that is headquartered in Oulu, Finland. The company was acquired by Codenomicon in 2011, but continues to operate as a separate company under the Codenomicon Group.[57]
The company is most famous for producing visualizations of security incidents, for example the patching of DNS cache poisoning attacks[58] and Botnet[59] traffic.
Since 2006 Clarified Networks has in particular concentrated in developing the collaborative focus in their products and currently refers to itself as a provider of Collaborative Network Analysis tools. Practical applications for Clarified Networks' tools are for example Traffic Auditing, troubleshooting and malware analysis.
Products[edit]
Clarified Networks provides a wide set of different situation awareness tools,[60] including:
Virtual Situation Room (VSRoom) provides unified, real-time views to the information provided by your monitoring systems. With VSRoom you will be able to collect, visualize and share monitoring data collected from your critical infrastructure. It provides beautiful situation overviews of complex data for decision makers and first line operation centers.
AbuseHelper is an open framework for collecting and sharing intelligence on suspected malicious activity. Clarified Networks is the lead developer and community contributor of AbuseHelper.
Network Analyzer is the tool of choice for collaborative analysis and visualization of complex networks. The analyzer helps you in collaborative troubleshooting, traffic audits and network documentation based on real traffic.
History[edit]
The research and development for Clarified Networks' tools began in 2002 and continued for four years in the Oulu University Secure Programming Group (OUSPG) before Clarified Networks spun off from the research group in 2006.
The company entered the Venture Cup competition that year, and was one of the finalists.[61]
In 2007, the founders of Clarified Networks also were awarded for their VMware Applicance called HowNetWorks.[62][63]
In 2011, Company was acquired by Codenomicon.

Novas Software (often referred to as "Novas") was a company founded in 1996 by Dr. Paul Huang to address the ongoing problem of debugging chip designs. Novas was purchased by Taiwan-based EDA company SpringSoft in May 2008. Prior to its purchase, Novas was partly owned by SpringSoft, which developed the underlying debug technology.[69] Until 2008, Novas grew to employ over 50 people with office locations across the world, headquartered in San Jose, California. SpringSoft and Novas was acquired by Synopsys in 2012.
Novas offered debugging and visibility enhancement products that cut down on verification time. Novas' main product offerings included the Debussy Debug System, Verdi Automated Debug System and the Siloti family of Visibility Enhancement products. A 2006 study found Novas Software to be the sixth most-used EDA vendor.[70] Along with this, Novas Software topped the user satisfaction ratings with 100% of respondents in Europe, 83% in North America & 69% in Asia saying they were either "very" or "somewhat" satisfied.[71] This distinction was also awarded to Novas Software for the four years prior to 2006.

History[edit]
Founded in 1986 by Aart J. de Geus and engineers from General Electric's Microelectronics Center in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, Synopsys was first established as "Optimal Solutions" with a charter to develop and market synthesis technology developed by the team at General Electric.
Acquisitions, mergers, spinoffs[edit]





This article is in a list format that may be better presented using prose. You can help by converting this article to prose, if appropriate. Editing help is available. (April 2017)






Building on the Hillsboro, Oregon, campus



1994: acquired Cadis, Aachen, Germany. Through this acquisition Synopsys got the communication systems and DSP design tool suit named COSSAP. COSSAP stood for Communication System Simulation and Application Processor. Synopsys carried out various communication (predominantly wireless modems) design and consulting activities using this tool (and later the evolved new tool Co-centric System Studio). The Cadis group was a spin-off development initiative from Institute for Integrated Signal Processing Systems (ISS), RWTH Aachen, spearheaded by Professor Heinrich Meyr[4] and Professor Gerd Ascheid.[5] COSSAP was a competing product to SPW[6] from Cadence (now maintained and enhanced by Coware).[7] Synopsys stopped support on COSSAP since 2003 and promoted the enhanced tool Concentric System Studio.
1997: acquired EPIC Design Technology Inc., USA
1997: acquired Viewlogic Systems, Inc., USA
1998: acquired Systems Science, Inc.
June 6, 2002: merger with Avanti Corporation, USA. Avanti was founded when several ex-Cadence employees bought the startup ArcSys, which had previously merged with ISS, gaining Avanti its DRC/LVS tool Hercules (including 3D silicon structure modeling), then bought Compass Design Automation, which had fully integrated IC Design Flow and ASIC Libraries, especially its place and route tool, which Avanti reworked to create Saturn and Apollo II; and it also bought TMA which brought their pioneering TCAD and Proteus Optical proximity correction tools. This was, by far, Synopsys' most significant and controversial acquisition. At the time Avanti was the #4 company in the EDA industry, and was struggling with a major lawsuit from Cadence for software theft.[8]

ARC International PLC was the designer of ARC (Argonaut RISC Core) embedded processors, which were widely used in SoC devices for IoT, storage, digital home, mobile, and automotive applications. ARC processors have been licensed by more than 200 companies and are shipped in more than 1.5 Billion products per year.[39] ARC International was acquired by Synopsys in 2010.
The roots of ARC International date back to the early 1990s. The company was founded by Jez San to build upon the 3D accelerator technology previously developed for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System by a division of Argonaut Software. This forerunner to the ARC was originally called the Mario (Mathematical, Argonaut, Rotation & I/O) chip and later dubbed the Super FX. It went on to sell millions, at the time outselling ARM or any other RISC core.[40]
[41]
Following the success of the Super FX, its designers were split from the main company to a subsidiary called Argonaut Technology Ltd (ATL). The design was renamed to ARC and marketed as a general-purpose configurable microprocessor. Later, ATL spun off as a separate company, ARC International. In 1995 Bob Terwilliger took over as ARC's first CEO. He created the company licensing strategy, commercialized the product including the acquisition of Metaware, VAutomation and Precise Software. He raised $50 million pre-IPO and took the company public in September 2000, raising an additional $250 million.
A list of notable events following:

September 21, 2000, ARC listed on the London Stock Exchange as ARK.[42]
June 17, 2002, ARC took over three companies, MetaWare, VAutomation, and Precise Software Technologies [43] but later parts were sold off to other companies.
April 2007, ARC acquired Teja Technologies of San Jose, California, a specialist in heterogeneous multiprocessor software.[44][45]
June 14, 2007, ARC acquired Tenison Design Automation of Cambridge, UK, a provider of software tools used to help develop system-on-chip (SoC) designs.[46][47]
September 23, 2007, ARC acquired Alarity Corporation of St. Petersburg, Russia, that specializes in codec software, firmware, and advanced multimedia architectures.[48][49][50]
February 11, 2008, ARC acquired Sonic Focus, a specialist developer of audio enhancement technology for digital sound.[51]
July 29, 2009, ARC confirmed they were in discussions with a third party regarding an offer for the company.
August 18, 2009, Virage Logic Announces Intent to Acquire ARC International'.[52]
September 15, 2009, Virage Logic Declares Offer to Acquire ARC International Unconditional in All Respects.[53]
November 5, 2009, Virage Logic completes acquisition of ARC International.[54]
June 10, 2010, Synopsys declares offer to acquire Virage Logic including ARC.[55]
September 2, 2010, Synopsys completes acquisition of Virage Logic[56]

Avanti Corporation[edit]
Avanti Corporation (the 'i' in "Avanti" is upside down, so it is also often seen as Avant!) was an electronic design automation company, purchased by Synopsys in 2002 (see wikt:avanti for the meaning of the word).
Clarified Networks[edit]
Clarified Networks is a company that is headquartered in Oulu, Finland. The company was acquired by Codenomicon in 2011, but continues to operate as a separate company under the Codenomicon Group.[57]
The company is most famous for producing visualizations of security incidents, for example the patching of DNS cache poisoning attacks[58] and Botnet[59] traffic.
Since 2006 Clarified Networks has in particular concentrated in developing the collaborative focus in their products and currently refers to itself as a provider of Collaborative Network Analysis tools. Practical applications for Clarified Networks' tools are for example Traffic Auditing, troubleshooting and malware analysis.
Products[edit]

For example, the Reduce Tolerance Sensitivity control (SAB, for Sensitivity As Built) allows direct optimization of the as-built RMS wavefront error, reducing the impact of tolerances on final system performance.
                                                        













CODE V Glass Expert: Optimized Glass Selection



 

CODE V's Glass Expert uses a unique algorithm developed by Synopsys optical engineers to make the iterative design task of glass selection faster and easier. Glass Expert automatically chooses the best set of real glasses for a lens design that provides superior color correction (including the effects of secondary color), while considering factors such as glass transmission, cost, and weight. In this video, members of Synopsys' Optical Solutions Group, along with John Tamkin of Imaging Insights, LLC, discuss how Glass Expert can help CODE V users select an optimal, practical set of glasses in a fraction of the time it would take to choose them manually.
                                                        













CODE V Asphere Expert: Cost-Effective Use of Aspheres



 


CODE V's Asphere Expert uses a unique algorithm developed by Synopsys optical engineers to analyze the characteristics of an existing lens system and then recommend optimal asphere locations to enhance system performance. In this video, members of Synopsys' Optical Solutions Group explain how Asphere Expert can save optical designers time in prefabrication as well as control costs during fabrication.
