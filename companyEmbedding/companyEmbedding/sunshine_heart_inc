Sunshine Heart: Ain't No Sunshine When Your Money Is Gone - CHF Solutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHFS) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Sunshine Heart: Ain't No Sunshine When Your Money Is GoneJan.27.17 | About: CHF Solutions, (CHFS) Looking For Diogenes Biotech, mid-cap, research analyst, dividend investingSummaryThis is a company with a long history of burning through cash with no visible results being obtained.Its initial medical product has been placed on hold for further development due to their cash position.The company is currently operating with a new business model based on a purchased product they obtained for $5.0 million.The stock price is not sustainable at the current level.Investment Thesis: In 1971, Bill Withers recorded his song "Ain't No Sunshine." The song quickly reached platinum sales. At the time, Withers was working for an aerospace company in southern California. His day job was making toilet seats for 747 airplanes. The following information is about a company that has been in operation for many years, but as of late they have taken the company in a new direction. The product they were working on all this time, they haven't been successful in getting approved by the FDA. Based on my research and reviewing the history and background, it is my opinion that current or potential investors should not consider it a viable company for any investment dollars. If one opts for being a contrarian to my opinion, you might be flushing your money down the complete apparatus Withers was involved with in 1971. My opinion has no negative consideration for the management of this company. My opinion relates only to the product the company initially was developing when the company was created, and now the recently acquired product where they want to redirect their business model. The name of the company is Sunshine Heart, Inc. (SSH). Company Background: Sunshine is based in the Minneapolis suburb of Eden Prairie, Minnesota. The company was formed to work on developing a medical device to treat moderate to severe heart failure conditions. Heart disease is the major cause of death in our country, so new and innovative treatment options are needed. The product that Sunshine was developing is known as the C-Pulse Assist System that works as a counter-pulsation in the heart. This simply means their system involved placing a cuff around the outside of the aorta, where the assist system would inflate and deflate the cuff, thus impacting the rhythm with the natural heartbeat. It was Sunshine's management belief that by applying a "secondary pulse" this would increase the heart's function in a person suffering from a condition were optimal functioning of their heart was declining.
 It was hoped that the C-Pulse would assist the heart's function in areas like oxygenated blood flowing to blood vessels, and the heart muscle would be improved. Basically, a diseased heart would not have to work as hard in the process of pumping blood through the body. If this could be accomplished it was felt this would also impact heart symptoms like shortness of breath, dizziness, fluid retention, and a patient's ability to do normal day-to-day activities. The following two illustrations show how the C-Pulse System would look when implanted into a patient's body. Note in both pictures how the cuff is placed around the body's major artery, the aorta. Then notice the second lead wire placed over the left ventricle, the pumping chamber for the heart. This was to allow the heart to beat and then the cuff would inflate, creating a "second pulse" of blood flow. 

 

 (Illustrations shared by Sunshine) However, the best laid plans don't always turn out to provide the desired results, and when applied to the area of medical science and product development, the preclinical work can face an extraordinary number of problems. When you read about a clinical trial in a peer journal, you need to pay close attention to the safety section discussion. My belief is that you don't want to see the opening sentence stating: "In general, the implant was safe..." Having an implant placed on your main artery with another lead wire placed on your left ventricle and then having someone describe this as "generally" safe doesn't give me a particularly good feeling toward my willingness for having this procedure done.
 My further reluctance was enhanced when I saw the clinic trial involving 32 patients being screened for study inclusion; 20 were confirmed eligible and implanted and 12 were considered as screen failures. Then from the 20 actual trial patients I note that 3 patients died within 6 months of the implant. Even when one considers the fact that these patients were suffering this debilitating and deadly disease, the nature and cause of death by one of these patients is very troubling, in my opinion. This patient developed a procedure-related sternal wound infection with the presence of Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus aureus-MRSA. The infection was not resolved after several months of treatment. It was then discovered that a fistula was attached from the sternum to the device cuffed to the aorta. The patient was taken into surgery, however, during the procedure the individual suffered atrial and aortic tears. In further documentation, the trial results reflected the composite device -related adverse event rate through 6 months, was 50%. The major cause being exit site infection rates of 40%. Current Strategic Realignment of the Company: On August 8, 2016, Sunshine announced they had acquired the Aquadex product line from an indirect subsidiary of Baxter International (NYSE:BAX). This product serves as a temporary ultrafiltration treatment for fluid build-up where normal diuretic therapy hadn't resolved the patient's issue and hospitalization is required. This need is usually associated with pre-opt and post-opt procedures for heart failure events. Sunshine purchased this product by paying Baxter $4.0 million in cash, and 1.0 million shares of Sunshine stock. If anyone wants to know the exact amount of the valuation attached to this purchase they might note at the time of the deal, Sunshine's stock was trading for less than $1.00. For simplicity, let's say Baxter got $4.0 million in cash and stock valued at $1.0 million for a total of $5.0 million being the valuation for the deal.
 On September 29 th, 2016, Sunshine announced a strategic realignment of the company where they would focus all the company's resources on the Aquadex FlexFlow®System. This decision is further clarified where they announced they were pausing clinical evaluations for the neuromodulation technology. Based on these actions they anticipated they could cut their cash burn from $2.0 million per month from the fourth quarter of 2015, to a targeted cash burn rate of $800,000.00 per month in the recently closed fourth quarter, 2016. Basically, they are hoping to cut their cash burn rate by 60% on a monthly basis. How has the market reacted to this redirection in the company? The stock closed today, January 26 th, 2017 at $6.65, up $0.85 or 14.66%. The trading volume for this date-873,604 shares. So, from the purchase date of the Aquadex product on August 8 th, 2016, when the stock was trading for less than a dollar. Great news - the stock is up more than 6x! Not exactly. On January 12, 2017, where the stock traded as low as $0.26 per share they announced a 30-1 reverse split. The stock opened the next day at $8.96 and has traded as high as $11.03 in the interim. The outstanding number of shares is now a rather minuscule 800,000 shares, simply meaning that today the entire outstanding number of shares were traded. Reality Status: Why would a company's stock jump 14% today? Especially when they are cutting their operating expense budget by 60%, issuing secondary stock on a constant basis, and this being based on a product that Baxter International basically gave them considering the total valuation of the deal was a mere $5.0 million. In the announcement of the purchase, Sunshine projected they would attain a fourth quarter 2016 annualized run-rate for the Aquadex business of $5.0 million and a fourth quarter 2017 annualized revenue run-rate of $10.0 million. This is what I would label as irrational exuberance! When you consider that Sunshine purchased the product on August 5, 2016, and in their Q3, 2016, SEC filings, they reported they generated Aquadex revenue totaling $484,000. If one applied this revenue rate over the full 3 rd quarter, this would have generated approximately $640,000 in gross revenue. When applying this current capture rate to a full calendar year, this would generate about $2,560,000 in gross revenue.
 Now consider their 60% cut in operating expenses to $800,000 a month, this means they will have operating expenses totaling $9,600,000 that needs to be covered by gross revenues of less than $3,000,000. At the end of Q3, 2016, they reported cash on hand totaled $792,000. After the end of Q3, 2016, on October 3rd, they announce a secondary offering that netted them $3,600,000. Based on this they would have held a total of $4,392,000 in operating cash. Based on the proposed burn rate of $800,000 per month, this would imply that at the end of January, 2017, their cash position would be -- ($4,392,000 minus $3,320,000 leaving a net of $1,192,000). Simply meaning they will deplete their cash by the end of February to $392,000. Therefore, one should expect another dilution soon. It is simply my opinion the lofty $6.00 valuation is merely smoke and mirrors! My Investing Opinion If my projections are close to being the reality for Aquadex revenues reinventing this company, after years and millions of dollars spent for a product they have placed on hold for future clinical trials, I would not be a purchaser of their stock. As for my normal caveat, I personally don't invest any of my investment dollars in short positions, whether by shorting the common stock or having put options. With margin accounts needed for one to short a stock, in my opinion, this is a foolish endeavor for the investor that isn't aware of the ability for day traders controlling the direction of a stock on a daily basis. Today's example of the entire number of outstanding shares having been traded with an increase in share prices by nearly 15%, merely verifies this issue. So be cautious with any trades, long or short! One should do their own personal due diligence that incorporates the criteria you personally apply in making your investment decisions. My comments are strictly my opinion based on my interpretation of available data. My input should merely be used as a starting point for your review and decision. But if I might paraphrase the first line of Wither's "Ain't No Sunshine" - Ain't no sunshine when your money is gone!
 Good luck with your future investing decisions.

Sunshine Heart Inc (NASDAQ:SSH): Looking Forward Is Key

Sunshine Heart Inc (NASDAQ:SSH) is a tricky one. The company just effected a reverse split, a split that was pretty much unavoidable, but which has caused a rift among shareholders nonetheless, and this split has come against a backdrop of some pretty underhand transactions with an employee owned investment fund called Sabby Management, LLC.
Things are pretty opaque from a capital structure perspective, and as usual in this sort of situation, sentiment is taking a hit on the back of this opacity. On the other side of the coin, however, Sunshine Heart has what looks to be a very effective cardiovascular asset, which targets an area of considerable unmet need, and – if new management is to be believed – (the company) is currently in a pivotal phase, the other side of which is consistently growing revenues.
Here is our take.
By way of a bit of background, prior to mid-2016, the company was focused on the development of a heart failure device called C-Pulse. The device looked promising, but in order to get it to commercialization in the US, Sunshine Heart would require millions of dollars and a large amount of investor patience as it pushed the device through trials.
At the end of 2015, the then-CEO resigned, and a guy called John Erb took over as interim. A few months later, in March 2016, his role was made permanent.
Fast forward to August, and the company announced it had acquired a heart failure device from Baxter International Inc (NYSE:BAX), by way of an acquisition of the latter’s Aquadex product line. It was a $5 million acquisition, so not a bank breaker, but Sunshine Heart’s PPS failed to respond. Finally, in its most recent conference call (third quarter, 2016), management announced that it was to stop the development of C-Pulse (reportedly, temporarily, but for how long, we don’t know) in order to focus on the commercialization of Aquadex. This inflicted a blow to the company’s market cap.

Since then, some clarity has hit press regarding the above mentioned Sabby group acquiring the equivalent of 72% underlying equity in Sunshine Heart through two preferred stock offers in July and October 2016, and the company – as already discussed – has undertaken a 1:30 reverse.
What this one comes down to now is whether shareholders have faith in management’s belief that the dropping of the development product in favor of the commercialization of the approved asset is the right move. For us, it probably is. With so much uncertainty surrounding capital structure and liquidity, if there is one thing that Sunshine Heart needs right now, it is some degree of stability. An uninterrupted focus on fleshing out top line is the only real way to bring this stability to the table, and it seems that therein lies the justification for the decision. Additionally, if the company was to continue its C-Pulse development efforts, shareholders would have likely ended up getting diluted to an even higher degree than they currently are being, on the back of the numerous capital raises that a clinical development program in this sort of target indication necessitates.
Financials aren’t great right now, and we are probably going to see some degree of dilution near-term anyway. Cash in hand came in at just short of $800,000 at September 30, and this won’t be enough to carry the company through anywhere near FY 2017. With that said, Sunshine Heart was able to report revenues for the first time in over a year during the third quarter, reported at $543,000, which should take the edge off cash burn going forward.
Bottom line here is that there still remains a high degree of uncertainty surrounding the stock, but the reverse split was unavoidable, and it is now a case of investors regrouping around what is essentially a fresh entity and basing valuation on the medium-term sales prospects of Baxter’s unloaded Aquadex line.
Applying this logic, we think there’s growth on offer at Sunshine’s current price.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

08/08/2016 | Press release | Distributed by Public on 08/08/2016 03:45
Sunshine Heart Announces Strategic Acquisition of Aquadex Product Line from Baxter and a new credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank








        EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn., Aug. 08, 2016 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Sunshine Heart, Inc. (NASDAQ:SSH) announced it has acquired the Aquadex product line from an indirect subsidiary of Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX), a global leader in the hospital products and dialysis markets. The Aquadex system is indicated for temporary (up to eight hours) ultrafiltration treatment of patients with fluid overload who have failed diuretic therapy, and extended (longer than 8 hours) ultrafiltration treatment of patients with fluid overload who have failed diuretic therapy and require hospitalization.
      

        'Aquadex is an important strategic investment, which allows Sunshine Heart to strengthen our presence in the heart failure market,' said John Erb, Sunshine's Chairman and CEO. 'We believe Aquadex is a valuable and highly complementary technology to our expanding heart failure product portfolio. There is a real need for fluid management in patients both before and following any kind of heart failure procedure. Aquadex is used to treat fluid overload in congestive heart failure patients and can help reduce the length of stay while in the hospital and the number of hospital visits in total.'
      

        Under the terms of the agreement, Baxter received $4.0 million in cash and 1.0 million shares of Sunshine Heart common stock. 'This is a financially attractive transaction as well,' said Mr. Erb. 'We expect this product line to be accretive in the first year with a relatively quick payback period. We plan to strategically leverage our current team of clinical specialists to directly support the existing base of Aquadex customers.'
      

        In connection with the acquisition of this product line, the Company repaid all amounts outstanding under its existing debt facility with Silicon Valley Bank and entered into a new $5.0 million facility to finance future working capital needs. Advances under the facility are subject to various conditions precedent, including compliance with financial covenants, which the Company does not currently meet. 'This strategic acquisition will allow Sunshine Heart to further drive important advancements to heart failure treatment,' said Ben Johnson, Managing Director of Silicon Valley Bank. 'We're excited to provide the financing to support the company as it matures to the next phase of development.' 
      

Rx Only. All treatments must be administered by a healthcare provider, under physician prescription, both of whom having received training in extracorporeal therapies
