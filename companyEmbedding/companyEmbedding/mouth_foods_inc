How to Strengthen and Protect Your Enamel
















How to Strengthen and Protect Your Enamel
Enamel is the hard, outer layer that protects the tooth’s crown. It is also your body's first line of defense against tooth decay. Aside from regular dental checkups every 6 months, here are some ways you can care for and protect your enamel as part of a good oral hygiene routine.






5 Ways to Keep Your Teeth Strong




























Brush your teeth with Pronamel® and a soft-bristled toothbrush
Pronamel® is specially designed to help strengthen tooth enamel and protect it against the effects of acid erosion. Be sure to brush twice a day and use a soft-bristled toothbrush to help reduce enamel wear.


























Floss regularly
It’s important to floss regularly to help remove plaque from the areas between your teeth where your toothbrush can’t reach. This helps keep your teeth and gums healthy.


























Try not to brush your teeth immediately after meals
Wait 30 minutes before brushing your teeth after a meal and use Pronamel® toothpaste to give your teeth extra protection against the effects of everyday acids.


























Drink acidic beverages through a straw
Drinking through a straw helps push the liquid to the back of your mouth, and away from your teeth.


























Hydrate with water
Drinking water helps rinse away dietary acids and is especially important if you have low saliva volume. Saliva helps to neutralize acidity and remineralize tooth enamel, so if you aren’t producing enough, your risk of acid erosion increases.

The Team

EXECUTIVE TEAM
Craig Kanarick, Co-Founder and Chairman
For the past 20 years, Craig has cooked up things in roles including prep cook intern at Babbo but he is best known as Co-Founder and Chief Strategic Officer of Razorfish, which, founded in 1995, was one of the first web development agencies of its kind, and pioneered Razorfish's media and entertainment division, where he helped create books, films, TV shows, albums and websites. He then co-founded Studio Red at Rockwell Group and served as digital strategy advisor to firms like Samsung, Blockbuster, Apple and RecordSetter.com. He lives close to the Union Square Greenmarket in NYC with his wife, son and daughter. Craig's mother's water broke while watching Julia Child on television. 
Sam Murray, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer
Sam has gallons of experience in operations, business development, client service and sales and marketing, much of it at FPI Topcraft, the injection molding business that he ran for over 20 years, after graduating summa cum laude from SUNY Albany. Sam lives in NYC with his wife and two daughters. He is also a competitive runner and has competed in the last three New York City Marathons. And he actually likes eating Chia seeds.
Nancy Kruger Cohen, Co-founder and Chief Creative Officer
Nancy was art director of Metropolis, ESPN Magazine, Details and New Woman, then created ad campaigns at Carlson + Partners for Ralph Lauren brands including Polo Sport, RL GIRL (a tween ‘magalog’), and the launch of American Living. Just prior to Mouth, she wrote for publications including The New York Times Magazine. Though Nancy didn't know Craig when they were classmates at University of Pennsylvania, they were equally obsessed with cornbread and jam from the Le Bus food truck. She lives in Brooklyn with her husband and two daughters.

The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.

You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.

How to Strengthen and Protect Your Enamel
















How to Strengthen and Protect Your Enamel
Enamel is the hard, outer layer that protects the tooth’s crown. It is also your body's first line of defense against tooth decay. Aside from regular dental checkups every 6 months, here are some ways you can care for and protect your enamel as part of a good oral hygiene routine.






5 Ways to Keep Your Teeth Strong




























Brush your teeth with Pronamel® and a soft-bristled toothbrush
Pronamel® is specially designed to help strengthen tooth enamel and protect it against the effects of acid erosion. Be sure to brush twice a day and use a soft-bristled toothbrush to help reduce enamel wear.


























Floss regularly
It’s important to floss regularly to help remove plaque from the areas between your teeth where your toothbrush can’t reach. This helps keep your teeth and gums healthy.


























Try not to brush your teeth immediately after meals
Wait 30 minutes before brushing your teeth after a meal and use Pronamel® toothpaste to give your teeth extra protection against the effects of everyday acids.


























Drink acidic beverages through a straw
Drinking through a straw helps push the liquid to the back of your mouth, and away from your teeth.


























Hydrate with water
Drinking water helps rinse away dietary acids and is especially important if you have low saliva volume. Saliva helps to neutralize acidity and remineralize tooth enamel, so if you aren’t producing enough, your risk of acid erosion increases.

Produce
Our produce is a sight to behold. It's like we got it from Central Casting: a visual feast of color, variety and sparkling freshness piled high for your pleasure and convenience. Cue the credits.



Meat & Poultry
If you’re looking for “natural meat,” we’re looking out for you, because that term only means no additives in the finished product. We go further with great-tasting meat from animals raised with no antibiotics, ever, and no added hormones*. Plus, our farmer and rancher partners follow strict standards for farm-animal welfare. And we’ve got you covered when it comes to local, grass-fed and organic, too.



Seafood
Our Seafood Department is the top reason many shoppers give for coming to our stores. Not only will you find a wide selection of fresh and frozen, high-quality seafood, we source only from sustainable fisheries and responsible farms. You can shop with confidence, and our fishmongers are ready with a smile.

Add Share Button To Marquee Box:  Produce
Our produce is a sight to behold. It's the first thing you see when you come into one of our stores: a visual feast of color, variety and sparkling freshness piled high for your pleasure and convenience.
The quality of produce at our stores is simply second to none. Our produce buyers, based in all regions of the country, maintain relationships with our local growers and our field inspectors are on the road 52 weeks a year seeking out the best of the best.
Organic produce is a mainstay for us. Early on, we committed to offering as much organic produce as available because we believe organic farming supports a healthy environment. Fresh fruits and vegetables grown without the use of long-lasting chemical pesticides and fertilizers will always have a prominent place on our shelves.
We feature local produce in season. While the definition of local varies by region of the country, it generally means one day’s drive away or less, and it's usually much less. Ask a produce team member where your store’s local produce comes from and when your favorite items will be in season.
We know that you like to know where your food comes from, so we display the origin of every piece of produce we sell. To meet customer demand, we do our best to offer the highestquality fruits and vegetables year-round, so we use our experience and relationships with growers from around the world to obtain the best of what's "in season" in other parts of the world.
Devotion to quality and service is a daily mantra in every one of our produce departments. That's why you can find just about anything you want there, from the humble to the exotic, from bananas to Buddha's hand (in season, of course!). Come in and explore. You're bound to find something delicious.

Saliva Stimulating Spray - Dry Mouth / Xerostomia

Dry Mouth / Xerostomia 
 

        
Affects 3 Out of 10 Adults in the United States

             Dry mouth and it's numerous causes 

 

                                                           
Dry mouth is a discomfort that may have many causes. Among them are the 
following:
 

                                                           
Prescription drugs and over the counter remedies can produce a side effect 
in the 

                                                           
form of dry mouth, drugs such as for high blood pressure, 
antihistamines, muscle relaxants,


                                                          
anti-diarrheas,  
decongestants and many others.
 

                                                           
Health conditions can also be a cause for dry mouth condition. Diseases that 
are likely 

                                                           
to cause dry mouth are: Sjogren's Syndrome, Lupus, Diabetes, 
Alzheimer's, HIV/AIDS,

                                                           
Stroke and Parkinson's 
disease.
 
                                                           
Medical treatments, such as chemotherapyand radiation can also affect 
the nature of 
                                                           
saliva and the amount produced.
 
                                                           
Aging and its metabolic changes is another factor that may be likely to 
reduce the
                                                           
production of saliva.
 
                                                           
To a lesser degree, every day habits such as using tobacco 
products, caffeine and 
                                                           
alcohol consumption, including mouthwashes. 
 
 



                                              

Myths and Misconceptions about relieving dry mouth:

                                        

       
            
Sucking on candies or
sweets.
 This damages the teeth and adds needless sugars 


                                                           
and extra calories. 
     
    

                                      
 
            
 Drinking liquids excessively. 
 This does not stimulate saliva.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
