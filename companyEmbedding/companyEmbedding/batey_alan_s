An Interview With GM Interim CMO Alan Batey
6 
by GM Authority Staff  — Aug 7, 2012  











Sponsored Links





Last week’s widely-publicized and surprising departure of GM Chief Marketing Officer Joel Ewanick is understood to have been the result of several high-profile controversial decisions, including the discontinuation of Facebook ads days ahead of the social media company’s IPO, withdrawal from Super Bowl advertising, and the sponsorship of two U.K. soccer teams. But all that is now history, as GM has appointed an interim CMO and is continuing with the execution of the strategies set out by Ewanick.
Conveniently, the folks at Car & Driver have recently interviewed Alan Batey, the interim chief of marketing whose primary role is the VP of sales and service. The 30-year GM vet first started at Vauxhall in the U.K. and has since worked for the automaker in Germany, Dubai, Korea, and Australia.
During the interview, Batey confirms that there will be no change in marketing direction and sheds light on several other interesting items, including the reasoning for the decision to not advertise during next year’s Super Bowl as it relates to the new sponsorships of Machester United and Liverpool, the lag between the company’s products and public perception, and the automaker’s opportunities in the BRIC markets, among other things. Here’s the transcript of the C&D interview:
C/D: Can you confirm what’s in the newspapers—GM isn’t changing marketing strategies?
Alan Batey: That’s right. There’s no change in direction.
C/D: So still no Super Bowl?
Alan Batey: Here in the U.S., we have 100-percent unaided awareness of Chevrolet and other GM brands. We don’t necessarily need to be present there, and remember that the Chevrolet brand is still a huge sponsor of other sports, like baseball.
C/D: What needs to be done for Chevrolet ads and marketing in the U.S., then?
Alan Batey: I’ll be honest: In the past, our brand was weakened. Product was just not the most competitive. Now, the product really is competitive. But the brand is still not at the strength it needs to be. There’s a lag between perception and where our products actually are.
C/D: This is sounding a lot like something we would have heard a decade ago from Bob Lutz and others, that there’s a perception gap GM has to overcome. How are you going to succeed where others didn’t?
Alan Batey: I’m a big believer in facts. When we went from the Cobalt to the Cruze, we made a quantum leap. We’re marketing some fantastic products now.
C/D: So why is GM paying hundreds of millions of dollars to put Chevrolet on the jerseys and stadiums of English soccer teams Manchester United and Liverpool? Chevy is outranked even by SEAT in U.K. sales—and SEAT’s sales are so bad, VW wants to kill it.
Alan Batey: Manchester United and Liverpool are two of the most popular sports teams in the world, and they’re on TV screens everywhere. This is a powerful global platform for the Chevrolet brand to raise awareness in places we’re not as known. So this really isn’t Alan Bateyout the U.K.
C/D: If the idea is to expand Chevrolet as a global brand, like VW or Toyota, what Alan Bateyout Opel and Daewoo and Holden, which rebadge and sell many Chevy models in markets where the Chevy brand does not exist?
Alan Batey: We’re really looking at places that will grow, especially the so-called BRIC [Brazil, Russia, India, and China] countries. These are opportunities for Chevrolet, and from a marketing standpoint, places where there is less unaided awareness Alan Bateyout the brand. Sport is a great way to reach out to these markets.
The GM Authority Take
The fact that GM isn’t changing the direction of its marketing operations may be proof positive that the strategy set forth by Ewanick holds water, and that something outside the man’s on-the-job performance was the reason for his resignation. In fact, the decision to substitute next year’s Super Bowl advertisements with the sponsorships of two European football teams makes that much more sense once one realized the colossal opportunity the Chevrolet brand faces in growth markets such as Brazil, Russia, India, and China.
But we do find Batey’s elusive answer to the Opel/Holden/Daewoo question rather troubling, as GM does not seem to have a clear strategy of Chevrolet in the markets where Opel (and Vauxhall) are sold. And the longer it remains this way, the worse for GM.

I’m not sure that interview told us anything new.  The information that everyone wants is what actions – specifically – led to the firing of Joel Ewanick. There is a story there, particularly if GM is officially “staying the course” with Ewanick’s decisions and direction.
I’m still not convinced that the boffo deal with Manchester United & Liverpool makes that much sense for the BRIC countries. And while those franchises are extremely popular (or hated) throughout the UK and Europe, I think that kind of money may have been better spent through alternative forms of advertising or sponsorship.
Then there is the brand confusion and what will happen to Opel/Vauxhall and Holden in Europe. I had hoped that Opel would move upmarket – closer to Buick – and Chevy would handle the lower end and extra capacity at Opel would be shifted to Chevrolet. But that’s not going to happen either.  It still looks like Opel and Chevy are gunning for the same lower end of the market. Why? And where all this leaves Holden in the European mix is anyone’s guess.  What next? Maybe GM will just rename Holden to Chevrolet and throw away 100 years of brand equity in Australia. 
I also think that skipping the Super Bowl is a mistake for the US market. Viewers are expecting Chevrolet to participate just because it always does. And with the introduction of the new Silverado you’d think the SB would be the perfect venue.
I feel sorry for Alan Batey — it’s got to be a high stress position with a target on his back. Something bad went down and he is expected to soothe the ruffled feathers of pissed off managers. Who knows what the powers that be want changed or want him to do? What internal goals or targets does he need to hit?  I wish him luck.

G.M. President's Next Challenge: Getting Young Urbanites to Buy Trax Mini SUV
'We Don't Look at Everything Through TV Advertising'


	By  

Michael McCarthy.
	

	
	
 Published on April 18, 2014. 









		Alan Batey 
 	








Most Popular






 


Alan Batey, General Motors' president-North America, is one of those marketers who fills the room.
With his big laugh and "hail-fellow-well-met" persona, he's the type of guy who could talk a bird out of a tree. During a media scrum at the New York International Auto Show this week, he joked that he and the media pack surrounding him should take the conversation to the bar.
But Mr. Batey is facing a tricky advertising challenge -- selling an SUV to young city dwellers.
During an auto show event, Mr. Bates announced that Chevy will launch a small SUV in the U.S. called Trax. Describing the vehicle as "designed for urban adventures," Mr. Batey said he'll aim Trax at "urban pioneers looking to discover the city." To help grab these tech-savvy consumers,Trax will feature, among other things, a wireless hotspot that allows up to seven people to use their wireless devices at the same time.



		Chevy Trax 
 	

But it might need more than that to lure urban millennials. Research indicates many of the young, city-dwelling hipsters Mr. Batey wants to target prefer taking the bus, subway or bike to get around town. When they need cars, they opt for car-sharing services like Zipcar and Enterprise CarShare to avoid the expense and hassle of owning and parking a car.
Advertising Age asked Mr. Batey how he'll pull it off. He was also pressed on whether GM will address the ignition-switch recall in its advertising and marketing. And how the British-born soccer fan feels about Chevy's Bowtie logo finally going on the front of Manchester United jerseys later this year.
Excerpts:
Ad Age: Young hipsters don't buy a lot of cars. Why are you marketing Trax at this tough crowd of consumers and how do you reach them?
Mr. Batey: They are buying cars. Clearly, when you're doing marketing positioning, you build out from the persona of the customer you're leaning into. They're out there. People like to drive these crossover-type vehicles. This is a great segment. . . . We don't look at everything through TV advertising. When we launched the Sonic here in the U.S., we didn't do any TV advertising at all. Everything we did was in the digital space. We had huge success. As you know, Sonic is No. 1 or No. 2, month in, month out, in the small car segment. [Chevy's Global CMO] Tim Mahoney is here tonight. We're planning the [Trax] launch as we speak. We're not going to be just traditional. We really want to lean into these people using all the digital uses we can.










Ad Age: Despite several months of controversy, GM has yet to address the ignition-switch recall controversy in its advertising. We haven't seen the full-page ads companies typically employ in these situations. Instead, Mary Barra is leading GM's response through written/video statements and testimony before Congress. Will this change?
Mr. Batey: At this moment in time, we've said everything we can about the recalls. We are obviously extremely sorry about what happened. We've told everybody we're going to do this full investigation, using the best people we can, to go where the facts are.
Ad Age: But should you address it in your advertising?
Mr. Batey: At this moment in time, there's no need to. What we've got is a good balance. We've put the facts out there. People understand the facts. They're visiting our showrooms and they're buying our vehicles as evidenced by the fact that we outpaced the industry last month. ... Recalls are part of our industry. It's a big recall. But there was also one of our competitors [Toyota] last week announced a huge global recall. So they're part of our business.
Ad Age: Is GM finally breathing easier over Chevy's highly criticized $600 million sponsorship of Manchester United now that the Bowtie will finally go on the front of jerseys this season?
Mr. Batey: This is about unaided awareness around the world. Soccer is a global sport. So we're excited about it happening. We have some big ideas we're going to execute. We announced a game at the Big House in Michigan. Sold it out in 48 hours. It will be one of the largest soccer crowds in the U.S (Editor's note: ManU will play Real Madrid at the University of Michigan's Michigan Stadium on Aug. 2.)



We'll use [the ManU sponsorship] everywhere. We'll use it in China and Asia. But I think it's also going to be great here in the U.S. ... [Soccer's] one of the most popular sports for male and female children. That's going to continue to grow. So I believe soccer is going to be one of the really huge sports in the U.S. And it doesn't get bigger than Manchester United.
Ad Age: Will Chevy advertise during World Cup?
Mr. Batey: We're not an official sponsor. Like the Olympics, only those brands that official sponsors are allowed to use the logo and be the official sponsor. But having Manchester United in your portfolio, if you want, puts you in there. Even though you're not directly linked.
Ad Age: What do you think of the huge reaction to Cadillac's controversial "Poolside" commercial?
Mr. Batey: It's getting a lot of attention. I like that. That's how you break through. If people are talking about it, that's good news.

GM's Interim CMO Alan Batey Talks About Chevy's 'New Road'
Carmaker Dumps 'Chevy Runs Deep' Tagline for 'Find New Roads'


	By  

Rupal Parekh.
	

	
	
 Published on January 08, 2013. 







Since its founding in 1911 in Motor City, Chevrolet has gone from being as American as apple pie to a global brand that 's selling some 4 million cars and trucks in more than 140 markets. That evolution means the patriotic messaging used to sell the brand to consumers in the past -- slogans such as "See the USA in Your Chevrolet," "Heartbeat of  America," "An American Revolution," and, its most recent rally cry, "Chevy Runs Deep" -- won't resonate with a huge segment of  the market anymore. 

So parent company General Motors Co. today announced a new tagline for the brand: "Find New Roads."


"Chevy Runs Deep," the previous tagline was ushered in by  former CMO Joel Ewanick and U.S. agency Goodby Silverstein & Partners. Mr. Ewanick brought in the Omnicom shop after he tossed aside longtime Campbell-Ewald and Publicis, and they unveiled the tag during the World Series in 2010. GM was immediately met with wide criticism from car buffs who claimed that  "Chevy Runs Deep" lacked substance, with Jalopnik going so far as to call it as the "worst slogan ever."



Jeff  Goodby, one of  the partners at Goodby, came to the tagline's defense, predicting that  it would eventually have legs. Despite continued criticism and a global review, GM said in October of  2011 that  it was sticking by  its choice. But a year later, amid slips in market share and following the ouster of  Mr. Ewanick, GM was openly announcing the possibility of  axing it.



"We might transition," Chris Perry, Chevrolet's VP-marketing, told Ad Age  sibling publication Automotive News in October of  2012. 









That became definite today, with GM's announcement of  "Find New Roads." It will be used to market nearly 20 new or revamped vehicles around the world, and it will also be used as an internal mantra. The new positioning, which was developed by  Chevy's agency of  record, Detroit-based Commonwealth, marks the second major change under interim CMO Alan Batey, who stepped in to replace Mr. Ewanick in July. (Commonwealth is  an Omnicom and Interpublic joint venture composed of  executives from Omnicom's Goodby, Silverstein & Partners and Interpublic's McCann Erickson.)




Burying "Chevy Runs Deep" comes at a time when General Motors is  focused on markets like India and Russia, and market share for its largest brand, Chevy, has been slipping. It's also been cutting marketing spending. Domestically, GM spent $1.18 billion during the first three quarters of  2012 compared with $1.30 billion during the same period in 2011 -- a 9.3% decline, according to Kantar Media. The marketing spending on Chevy for the first nine months of  2012 was $663 million, down from $746 million, an 11% decline, according to Kantar Media





		Alan Batey 
 	



So how long can we expect "Find New Roads" to stay intact? Mr. Batey has asked Mary Barra and Ed Welburn, GM's heads of  product development and design, respectively, to help with making the theme a part of  company culture going forward. Unlike those taglines that  have come and gone, he predicts this one will stick around for at least a decade.


Ad Age : When "Chevy Runs Deep" was launched, it was met with criticism, but GM asked for the public to be patient and said that  they'd see it was a campaign that  would ultimately resonate and convey the passion of  the brand's fans. Does this mean the critics were right?


Mr. Batey: What I would say is  that  it was a campaign that  was developed and implemented around the time of  our centennial. When you have a centennial you have an opportunity to look back on your history. ... [Chevy] has a rich history and I think the campaign -- and all the results track this out -- did well at that  point in time. Now we are taking it on the global stage to the next level. We are the fastest-growing major vehicle brand in the world today and have 20 new launches around the world in 2013. "Find New Roads" is  more than a tagline, and in fact, I would say, for it to be successful, we have to create internal alignment. We want "Find New Roads" to become for all of  us our North Star -- something that  inspires us and builds around that  spirit of  ingenuity.


Ad Age : What makes you confident that  "Find New Roads" works more meaningfully and works on a global level?


Mr. Batey: We have been working on this for the last five or six months hand in hand with Commonwealth, our global agency. From day one, we've been looking at this from a global perspective. We know it creates a lot of  meaning and is  also very flexible. You can think of  two vehicles, in very different spaces, perhaps a Volt and a heavy duty truck [and it applies to both]. We also think it translates into the services we provide our customers; it gives us an opportunity to surprise and delight our customers.


Ad Age : You say this is  meant not just to be a tagline but an internal mantra as much as an external one. What are you doing to get those working at GM at all levels, in all positions to rally behind the positioning?


Mr. Batey: We have a meeting with our senior execs which will take place next week [during the Detroit auto show]. It gives us a great chance to speak with all of  our senior execs around the world [about the new approach]. They'll obviously take that  back to their teams. I'll also be doing somewhat of  our a world tour to ensure consistency. It will start toward the end of  February.


Ad Age : After having such a strong presence in previous years, what will it be like to sit on the sidelines for the Super Bowl this year? Do still you think that  was the right decision?


Mr. Batey: It definitely was the right decision. We had success with the Super Bowl in the past, and if you use it correctly it can be a great platform. Stay posted and you'll see some of  the innovative things we're going to in the future.


Ad Age : You recently moved Silverado duties to Leo Burnett, aligning all truck advertising under the Publicis agency. Now this announcement about the tagline changes. Can we expect you to undertake more ad changes in 2013?


Mr. Batey: No. Those really were the two big ones we needed to put in place to make sure we have a successful 2013 when we have 20 new-product launches around the world for Chevy.


Ad Age : So you are happy with the way that  the Commonwealth structure -- which has been an unprecedented partnership between competing ad companies -- is  working for General Motors?


Mr. Batey: Yeah, I really am. We came together on this global effort at the same time. We previously had not operated as a brand on a global level. We have got some great global learnings. I'm feeling good about where we are right now ... I'm very excited.


Ad Age : It's been a busy few months for you since you've made the transition to the CMO role. How have you found it?


Mr. Batey: If I take you back to when I took this role on in the July time frame, I stressed it wasn't about one person but a team. We have got great people and I've really enjoyed it. It's been a fantastic time. We always new that  looking into 2013 it would be an incredibly busy time.



Ad Age : What can we expect with regards to the search for a permanent CMO?



Mr. Batey: As I sit here today, we're still looking at our options and haven't gotten anything to announce yet.
