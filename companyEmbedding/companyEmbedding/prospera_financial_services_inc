Our Vision
Our vision is to continuously exceed client expectations and improve our service offering to our existing clientele. We will grow our community of client families that appreciate and benefit from our independence, and our dynamic innovative processes.
We are grateful for the trusted introductions we receive from our existing client families―this is the community we envision helping as we create long-term relationships for years and generations to come. These introductions are primarily with the people they care about―their friends, families, and colleagues. Out of respect for our current clients, we only accept a limited number of new clients each year.
Our Values
Kutzen Financial is committed to providing unbiased, conflict-free advice and high-touch service that helps our clients organize, grow, and protect their wealth according to their values.  We have structurally built Kutzen Financial Partners from the ground up to be true to this independence.
As genuinely independent fee-based financial advisors, we believe in first and foremost educating our clients on options for developing a sensible wealth plan. We place great importance in helping our clients understand the attributes and detriments of each of these options as there is no perfect investment. This education allows us to develop a plan that is right for you while removing advisor bias regarding any of these options.

Prospera Financial exists to serve independent business owners. We are a new breed of independent broker dealer where the advisor calls the shots, individuals define their own brand of success and the highest level of service is the standard.












In all our years in this business, we have never had the pleasure of dealing with a team like Prospera that has gone above and beyond in helping us assist our clients. We are used to the normal “I don’t know.”, “I don’t have time.” or “You can contact…”. All of the people at Prospera have been absolutely wonderful, helpful and responsive to all of our requests. Prospera truly has an amazing group of people and there are other firms out there that could take a lesson from them.
