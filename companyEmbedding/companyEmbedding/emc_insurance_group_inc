Stockholder Information






EMC Insurance Group Inc.
 

EMC Insurance Group Inc. (EMCI) is a publicly held holding company that 
			generates results from property and casualty insurance and reinsurance through subsidiary companies. EMCI’s common stock trades on the NASDAQ Global Select Market tier of the NASDAQ Stock Market under the symbol “EMCI.”
EMCI’s business is generated in conjunction with the 
			operations of its parent corporation, Employers Mutual Casualty Company (EMCC), which is a mutual insurance company. The companies operate collectively under the trade name 
			EMC Insurance Companies.

Business Model for EMC Insurance Companies
EMC focuses on the sale of property and casualty insurance to small and midsize businesses, as well as some larger accounts and personal lines. Products and services are offered through independent insurance agents who are supported by a network of local EMC branch offices. One or more of EMC Insurance Companies’ affiliates and subsidiaries are licensed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia; however, EMC actively markets insurance products in 41 states.

Organizational Structure
Employers Mutual Casualty Company (EMCC) owns approximately 56 percent of EMCI’s outstanding common stock; the remaining 44 percent is owned by public shareholders. EMCI has no employees of its own; however, the parent organization, EMCC, employs more than 2,100 people countrywide. EMCC was established in 1911 and is headquartered in Des Moines, Iowa. EMCI was formed in 1974 and became publicly held in 1982.

Intercompany Pool
EMCI results reflect slightly more than 35 percent of EMC Insurance Companies’ financial results. All of the property and casualty insurance companies affiliated with EMC Insurance Companies participate in the 
			Intercompany Pooling Arrangement (except for EMC Reinsurance Company). Each company participating in the pool transfers its direct insurance business to the pool and, in exchange, receives a designated percentage of the pool’s underwriting results. EMCI affiliated companies receive a 30 percent share of the pool, plus 100 percent of the results from EMC Reinsurance Company (EMC Re). EMC Re’s results are generated 
			through a 100% quota share agreement with EMCC and the direct 
			writing of German reinsurance business. EMCC's assumed reinsurance 
			business is generated from the brokerage market and as an owner and participant in the Mutual Reinsurance Bureau.
For a complete description of EMC Insurance Companies’ financial results, refer to 
			Financial Results under About EMC.

Payment/Billing Options
EMC Insurance Companies offers several convenient ways to pay insurance premiums:

Electronic funds transfer*
Online credit card or checking account payment*
Payment by phone
Payment by mail
Payment through your insurance agent


Account Billing Plan
EMC's account billing plan* is similar to how credit card statements work. We bill you for individual insurance policies just as a credit card company bills you for purchases made at individual retail and service stores. Then we apply your payment on your monthly balance to your account, not to individual insurance policies—the same way a credit card company applies your payment to your monthly balance, not to individual purchases.
Flexible Payments
				With the account billing plan, you may pay the minimum monthly amount 
		due, the full account balance or any amount in between. If you pay more 
		than the minimum due, we apply the difference as a credit to your 
		account. You won’t receive another bill until the credit in your account 
		is not enough to pay the minimum amount due.
Payment Schedule
				We issue your statement at least 20 days before the payment is due. To continue your policies in force, you need to pay at least the minimum amount due. If we receive less than the minimum due, all the policies in your account could be canceled. If your policies are not canceled for the non-payment, the full account balance may be required on future billings.

Electronic Funds Transfer
With electronic funds transfer, your payment is automatically deducted from your bank account each time your premium is due. No checks to write. No postage to pay. No need to worry about forgetting to make your payment.
Each payment appears on your bank statement for easy record keeping. When you use electronic funds transfer, you avoid transaction charges that are applied to monthly billings when you pay by check 
		or credit card.
To sign up for electronic funds transfer:

Download, print off, fill out and sign the Policyholder Authorization for Electronic Funds Transfer
Attach a voided check or savings account slip
Mail the Authorization Agreement and voided check or savings slip to your insurance agent

Be sure to pay the current amount due on your policy and any additional invoices you receive. This will ensure that your coverage is continued until your electronic fund payments begin.
Back to top

Online Payment
If you are not set up for electronic funds transfer and need to make sure your insurance payment arrives on time, you can use your 
		credit card (Visa®, MasterCard®, Discover® or American Express®) or checking account to pay your bill online. All you need is your EMC account number and the ZIP code shown on your billing statement. Enter your payment through our website:
Make Online Payment Now
Payment must be entered on the website by 6:45 p.m. CT, Monday-Friday (excluding holidays), to be credited to your account the same day.
The same transaction fees that apply to mailed payments are applied to each online payment. A payment entered on the website 
		is applied to your credit card or taken from your checking account the 
		following business day.
For website assistance, contact IT Support between 6 a.m. and 6 p.m. CT, Monday-Friday (excluding holidays).
Phone: 515-345-2294
		Toll Free: 877-249-0581
		Email: ITSupport@EMCIns.com
If you get voice mail, please leave a number where you can be reached.
If you have billing questions, contact your independent insurance agent.
Back to top

Payment by Phone
To make a payment by phone, call 855-404-9076 and respond to the automated prompts. You can choose to pay by checking account, savings account or credit card.
Pay-by-phone is available to all direct-billed policyholders for standard invoices, as well as audits. Accounts currently registered for electronic funds transfer (automatic payments) are not eligible.
Back to top

Payment by Mail
You can always pay by mail; however, if the bill is not paid in full, 
		a transaction fee will be charged on each payment. Mail your payment along with the bottom portion of your invoice to:
EMC Insurance Companies
		P.O. Box 219225
				Kansas City, MO 64121-9225
Back to top
* Electronic funds transfer and online credit card and checking account payment are available to business insurance policyholders in the states where EMC has business and the District of Columbia and are not available in Alaska, Hawaii, Florida and New York. 





Need to Pay Your Bill?
EMC offers convenient online payment by credit card or checking account. All you need is your EMC account number and ZIP code.

First Quarter Ended March 31, 2017

        Net Income Per Share - $0.32Non-GAAP Operating Income Per Share1 - $0.34Net Realized Investment Losses Per Share - $0.02Catastrophe and Storm Losses Per Share - $0.41GAAP Combined Ratio - 100.5 percent
Reaffirming 2017 Non-GAAP Operating Income Guidance - $1.35 to $1.55 per share
DES MOINES, Iowa, May  05, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- EMC Insurance Group Inc. (NASDAQ:EMCI) (the "Company"), today reported net income of $6.8 million ($0.32 per share) for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $14.7 million ($0.70 per share) for the first quarter of 2016. The majority of this decline is attributed to a record level of first quarter catastrophe and storm losses and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in net investment income.
Non-GAAP operating income, which excludes realized investment gains/losses from net income, totaled $7.2 million ($0.34 per share) for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $15.4 million ($0.74 per share) for the first quarter of 2016.
Catastrophe and storm losses totaled a record $13.4 million ($0.41 per share after tax) in the first quarter of 2017, compared to $6.2 million ($0.19 per share after tax) in the first quarter of 2016. No recoveries were made under the property and casualty insurance segment's 2017 January 1 through June 30 excess of loss reinsurance treaty. Approximately $10.2 million of retention remains under this treaty, meaning catastrophe and storm losses will be capped at $10.2 million in the second quarter, unless the $24.0 million limit of protection is exceeded. First quarter catastrophe and storm losses accounted for 9.3 percentage points of the combined ratio, which is well above the Company's most recent 10-year average of 6.1 percentage points for this period, and the 4.3 percentage points experienced in the first quarter of 2016. On a segment basis, catastrophe and storm losses for the first quarter of 2017 amounted to $9.8 million ($0.30 per share after tax) in the property and casualty insurance segment, and $3.6 million ($0.11 per share after tax) in the reinsurance segment.
"Like many in the industry, first quarter results were significantly impacted by higher than anticipated catastrophe and storm losses," stated President and Chief Executive Officer Bruce G. Kelley. "While no recoveries have been made under the property and casualty insurance segment's intercompany reinsurance treaty covering the first half of the year, we are further into the retention amount than anticipated, which means second quarter catastrophe and storm losses will likely be capped at approximately the same level as the catastrophe and storm losses incurred in the first quarter. Based on this expectation, we are reaffirming our earnings guidance for the year."
In the property and casualty insurance segment, the underlying loss and settlement expense ratio, which excludes the impact of catastrophe and storm losses and development on prior years' reserves, increased 8.8 percentage points to 65.3 percent from 56.5 percent in the first quarter of 2016. This increase does not reflect a decline in the performance of the underlying book of business, as the underlying loss and settlement expense ratio has been relatively consistent since the implementation of the new bulk reserving methodology in the third quarter of 2016. Rather, the increase is attributed to a change in how bulk reserves are allocated to the various accident years under the new bulk reserving methodology, which makes it difficult to compare the first quarter underlying loss and settlement expense ratios in 2017 and 2016.
The prior bulk reserving methodology was focused on maintaining a consistent level of overall reserve adequacy. Bulk reserves were determined in total, and a separate process was used to allocate the bulk reserves to the various accident years. The implied ultimate accident year loss ratios produced by this allocation process were not explicitly determined, which, based upon a recently completed analysis of first quarter results, allowed seasonal or other fluctuations in the underlying case loss reserves to impact the underlying loss and settlement expense ratio.
Under the new bulk reserving methodology, the underlying loss and settlement expense ratio is determined by the explicit accident year ultimate loss ratios established by management. Because of this change in methodology, quarterly underlying loss and settlement expense ratios are expected to be more consistent throughout the year than they were under the prior methodology.
The Company experienced a large increase in favorable development on prior years' reserves during the first quarter of 2017, totaling $14.9 million ($0.46 per share after tax) compared to $7.8 million ($0.24 per share after tax) in the first quarter of 2016, which helped limit the increase in the loss and settlement expense ratio.
The Company's GAAP combined ratio was 100.5 percent in the first quarter of 2017, compared to 92.7 percent in the first quarter of 2016.
Premiums earned increased 1.2 percent to $144.5 million for the first quarter of 2017, from $142.7 million in the first quarter of 2016. In the property and casualty insurance segment, premiums earned increased 2.9 percent. The majority of the increase is attributed to an increase in retained policies in the commercial lines of business, small rate level increases on commercial lines renewal business and growth in insured exposures. In the reinsurance segment, premiums earned decreased 4.5 percent due primarily to a decline in the pro rata line of business stemming from the Mutual Reinsurance Bureau underwriting association's withdrawal from non-standard automobile business, partially offset by an increase in the excess of loss line of business.  
Large losses are defined as reported current accident year losses greater than $500,000 for the EMC Insurance Companies' pool, excluding catastrophe and storm losses. Under the property and casualty insurance segment's prior bulk reserving methodology, large losses had a direct impact on earnings. Under the new bulk reserving methodology, large losses are taken into consideration when establishing the current accident quarter/year ultimate estimates of losses, but there is no longer a direct relationship between large losses and earnings. As a result, beginning in the third quarter of 2016, large losses are no longer being reported separately.
Net investment income declined 10.0 percent to $11.0 million for the first quarter of 2017, from $12.2 million in the first quarter of 2016. Net investment income for the first quarter of 2016 included approximately $480,000 of special dividends. Excluding this amount, net investment income declined 6.3 percent due primarily to increased amortization of fixed maturity securities.
Net realized investment losses totaled $627,000 ($0.02 per share after tax) for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $1.1 million ($0.04 per share after tax) for the first quarter of 2016. Included in net realized investment losses reported for the first quarters of 2017 and 2016 are $2.3 million and $1.9 million, respectively, of realized investment losses attributed to a decline in the carrying value of a limited partnership that helps protect the Company from a sudden and significant decline in the value of its equity portfolio (the equity tail-risk hedging strategy).
At March 31, 2017, consolidated assets totaled $1.6 billion, including $1.5 billion in the investment portfolio, and stockholders' equity totaled $564.3 million, an increase of 2.0 percent from December 31, 2016. Book value of the Company's stock increased 1.9 percent to $26.57 per share from $26.07 per share at December 31, 2016. Book value excluding accumulated other comprehensive income was relatively flat at $24.01 per share at March 31, 2017, compared to $23.90 per share at December 31, 2016.
Based on results for the first quarter of 2017 and management's expectations for the remainder of the year, management is reaffirming its 2017 non-GAAP operating income guidance in the range of $1.35 to $1.55 per share. This guidance is based on a projected GAAP combined ratio of 100.1 percent for the year and a decline in investment income in the low- to mid-single digits, with nominal changes to the other assumptions utilized in the projection.
The Company will hold an earnings teleconference call at noon Eastern time on Friday, May 5, 2017 to allow securities analysts, stockholders and other interested parties the opportunity to hear management discuss the Company's results for the first quarter, as well as its expectations for the remainder of 2017.

The webcast will be archived and available for replay for approximately 90 days following the earnings call.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking StatementsThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 provides issuers the opportunity to make cautionary statements regarding forward-looking statements. Accordingly, any forward-looking statement contained in this report is based on management's current beliefs, assumptions and expectations of the Company's future performance, taking into account all information currently available to management. These beliefs, assumptions and expectations can change as the result of many possible events or factors, not all of which are known to management. If a change occurs, the Company's business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, plans and objectives may vary materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements.
The risks and uncertainties that may affect the actual results of the Company include, but are not limited to, the following:

catastrophic events and the occurrence of significant severe weather conditions;
the adequacy of loss and settlement expense reserves;
state and federal legislation and regulations;
changes in the property and casualty insurance industry, interest rates or the performance of financial markets and the general economy;
rating agency actions;
"other-than-temporary" investment impairment losses; and
other risks and uncertainties inherent to the Company's business, including those discussed under the heading "Risk Factors" in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Management intends to identify forward-looking statements when using the words "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "project," or similar expressions. Undue reliance should not be placed on these forward-looking statements. The Company disclaims any obligation to update such statements or to announce publicly the results of any revisions that it may make to any forward-looking statements to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statements.
Definition of Non-GAAP Information and Reconciliation to Comparable GAAP MeasuresThe Company prepares its public financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). Management uses certain non-GAAP financial measures for evaluating the Company's performance. One of the primary non-GAAP financial measures utilized by management for evaluating the Company's performance is operating income. Management's operating income guidance is also considered a non-GAAP financial measure.

1
Non-GAAP Operating income: Non-GAAP operating income is calculated by excluding net realized investment gains/losses (defined as realized investment gains and losses after applicable federal and state income taxes) from net income. While realized investment gains/losses are integral to the Company's insurance operations over the long term, the decision to realize investment gains or losses in any particular period is subject to changing market conditions and management's discretion, and is independent of the Company's insurance operations. The Company's calculation of non-GAAP operating income may differ from similar measures used by other companies, so investors should exercise caution when comparing the Company's measure of non-GAAP operating income to the measure used by other companies.
Management believes non-GAAP operating income is useful to investors because it illustrates the performance of the Company's normal, ongoing operations, which is important in understanding and evaluating the Company's financial condition and results of operations. While this measure is consistent with measures utilized by investors and analysts to evaluate performance, it is not intended as a substitute for the GAAP financial measure of net income. Therefore, the Company has provided the following reconciliations of the GAAP financial measures of net income and net income per share, to the non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP operating income and non-GAAP operating income per share.

Industry MetricsPremiums written: Premiums written is an industry metric used in statutory accounting to quantify the amount of insurance sold during a specified reporting period. Management analyzes trends in premiums written to assess business efforts, and uses it as a financial measure for goal setting and determining a portion of employee and senior management awards and compensation. Premiums earned, used in both statutory and GAAP accounting, is the recognition of the portion of premiums written directly related to the expired portion of an insurance policy for a given reporting period. The unexpired portion of premiums written is referred to as unearned premiums, and represents the portion of premiums written that would be returned to a policyholder upon cancellation of a policy.

Underlying loss and settlement expense ratio: The loss and settlement expense ratio is the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of losses and settlement expenses incurred to premiums earned, which management uses to measure the underwriting profitability of the Company's insurance business. The underlying loss and settlement expense ratio represents the loss and settlement expense ratio, excluding the impact of catastrophe and storm losses and development on prior years' reserves, which management uses as an indicator of the Company's underwriting discipline and underwriting profitability for the current accident year.

*Large losses are defined as reported current accident year losses greater than $500 for the EMC Insurance Companies' pool, excluding catastrophe and storm losses. Under the property and casualty insurance segment's prior bulk reserving methodology, large losses had a direct impact on earnings. Under the new bulk reserving methodology implemented during the third quarter of 2016, large losses are taken into consideration when establishing the current accident quarter/year ultimate estimates of losses, but there is no longer a direct relationship between large losses and earnings. As a result, it is no longer meaningful to report large losses separately.
