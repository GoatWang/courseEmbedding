Job Details
               Company Size: $10 mil to less than $25 mil - Employee Range: 500 to less than 1,000. Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School is a four-year comprehensive high school with an enrollment that reflects the diversity of our nation. Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School strives to be a harmonious educational community committed to excellence in developing each member's potential. Within our environment, we consider students to be valued individuals, with unique aptitudes, attitudes, interests and needs. Our comprehensive high school fosters each individual's potential by providing programs and opportunities for academic, emotional, creative, physical, and social growth. Continuing education is a priority in our school community where a well-educated staff models the benefits of life-long learning. Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School offers students a curriculum of substance and courses that require students to complete serious and relevant work. Teachers use instructional strategies that engage students and include them in the learning process. The high school supports a climate that values teaching and learning, a climate in which academics are honored and distractions that interfere with teaching and learning are not tolerated. We believe the educational process ultimately depends upon the combined efforts of administration, faculty, students, parents, and the community-at-large. We believe continuous evaluation is needed to assure that our resources are used wisely. At Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School, we are committed to the district's mission of "educating every student to become a confident and caring life-long learner who can communicate and contribute positively to the rapidly changing world. The district, in cooperation with the community, will provide an academic environment which values excellence, initiative, and diversity.". Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School has an incredibly rich tradition of individual and team success in athletics. Currently, we offer twenty-five different sports (including Cheerleading) with most participating at a varsity and junior varsity level. Freshmen level sports are offered for boys and girls soccer, football, boys and girls basketball, baseball, and softball. Athletics has been able to flourish due to a strong relationship and even stronger partnership among the athletes, coaches, administration, parents, and the community. We all share the commonly held belief that the authentic experiences offered by athletic competition will be an extension of classroom learning. Moreover, we all believe that our positive character will is displayed through the adversity of athletics. We continue to have strong support for the athletic programs at Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School. We have nearly nine hundred athletes in our sports program and are consistently encouraging more students to be a part of a team by becoming team managers or statisticians. We also encourage teachers who are not coaching to attend contests and become involved in the support system for athletics. Our continued goal is to have a strong presence of academics in athletics encouraging, coaches to have academic progress reports, study halls, and policies for additional academic help. We want our students to understand that success in athletics and academics is a life-long experience and lesson. Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School is a member of the New Jersey State Interscholastic Athletic Association (NJSIAA). We are also a part of the Union County Interscholastic Athletic Conference, and Union County Conference. Each of the aforementioned groups as well as our Board of Education and Scotch Plains-Fanwood High School create the policies, rules, and regulations for athletics. The rules and regulations of our athletic contests are governed by the NJSIAA and National Federation of High School Sports and often differ from collegiate or professional sports. All of the organizations that we are a part of stress the fundamentals of fair play and strong sportsmanship. We ask all of our spectators to let the athletes play, the coaches coach, and the officials officiate.
