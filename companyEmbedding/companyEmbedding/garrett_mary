I was a student at Ball State and got to know Mary,first while visiting my siblings in Schmidt-Wilson and then while living in Wilson (1991-1994). Mary was the kindest,sweetest woman and one of the most dedicated,hardest-working individuals I ever met. She always worried about us students and she always did her best to cheer us up if we were down or stressed. She was a truly remarkable woman and I'll always remember her fondly.
