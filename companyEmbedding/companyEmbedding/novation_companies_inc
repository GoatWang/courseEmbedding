History[edit]
Novation Companies, Inc., (NOVC) was founded as NovaStar Financial, Inc., a Kansas City-based residential mortgage company, in 1996. Through its subsidiaries, NovaStar Mortgage, Inc., and NovaStar Home Mortgage, Inc., it originated, securitized and serviced residential loans.
During a 10-year period, NovaStar Mortgage originated more than $40 billion in mortgage loans and NovaStar Home had more than 400 branches located nationwide. The fast and significant success took the company to nearly 5,000 employees at one point. The company went public a mere 10 months after opening its doors.
From 2003 to 2006, the total number of subprime loans issued in the U.S. increased by 17 percent. However, NovaStar’s business model proved unsustainable for the long term as more and more people defaulted on loans. NovaStar's business model is considered one of the primary factors that led to the credit crisis of 2008.
NovaStar rode the economic storm to its low, and exited the mortgage lending business completely by 2008. The company’s stock price dropped from nearly $70 a share to under $1 and was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange by 2008. The employee base shrank to approximately 20.
However, through perseverance, NovaStar survived one of the most significant economic downturns of our time as well as paid all of its secured bank lenders. It exited the crisis with a seasoned group of founders and leaders who had learned important lessons during the last decade: How to set up a better business model that will not collapse the market completely but still be profitable. In addition, the company has significant realized and unrealized federal tax losses, allowing it to mitigate income taxes on profits for many years to come.
Leaders were convinced that if they could navigate NovaStar through that storm, they could take their lessons learned and help other entrepreneurs grow and scale their businesses; defer taxes and do it all over again. With the self-induced collapse in 2008, they began reinventing NovaStar based on their core competencies: the ability to scale businesses and improve execution of an original concept. Since then they have acquired four companies – StreetLinks, Advent Financial Services, IVR Central (renamed CorvisaCloud) and Mango Moving.
This reinvention prompted the company to change its name to Novation Companies, Inc., in order to reflect the leadership team’s vision for the future and to get away from the bad taste that Novastar left its investors. [1] This name represents the ability to innovate in order to bring new technology-enabled services to market.
Novation leaders are attracted to technology-enabled service businesses with a differentiated value proposition for their customers. They focus about finding companies that are founded on great ideas but need to improve execution in order to grow. Following the Romney Bain Capital model of helping people, they assume operational control and support the companies with technology, sales/marketing and training services that a typical entrepreneur could not access.[1]
Other than CorvisaCloud, Novation has either sold or otherwise liquidated all of its operating subsidiaries. Currently, Novation is focused solely on developing the business of CorvisaCloud.
Subsidiaries (Current and Former)[edit]
Corvisa Cloud
Corvisa Cloud, LLC is located in Milwaukee and offers cloud-based IVR, ACD and call center solutions. By leveraging cloud-based technology, CorvisaCloud removes the upfront costs and overhead associated with onsite IVR solutions, offering infinite and immediate scalability at a fraction of previous costs. Solutions are available for both small business and enterprise-level customers, and can either augment or replace current call center operations.

StreetLinks Lender Solutions
StreetLinks LLC, dba StreetLinks Lender Solutions, offers a suite of appraisal/valuation solutions for mortgage industry professionals nationwide.
StreetLinks was Novation’s first and largest subsidiary. It grew from 15 employees to more than 600 after being acquired by Novation. In 2009, StreetLinks had significant increases in both revenue and net income over the previous year.
On April 16, 2014, the Company and non-controlling members of StreetLinks entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Assurant Services, LLC, a subsidiary of Assurant, Inc., pursuant to which Assurant purchased 100% of the outstanding membership units of StreetLinks in exchange for $60.0 million paid in cash at closing and up to $12.0 million in post-closing (consideration contingent upon the total revenue of StreetLinks in fiscal years 2015 and 2016). The sale closed on April 16, 2014. [2]

Advent Financial Services
Advent Financial Services, LLC provided financial settlement services for income tax preparation businesses and access to tailored banking accounts, small-dollar banking products and related services to meet the needs of low- and moderate-income-level individuals.
On August 18, 2014, Advent sold certain intellectual property, software, and customer data to Santa Barbara Tax Products Group, LLC. Also on August 18, 2014, the Company announced that it was conducting an orderly winding-down of Advent’s remaining business and operations.

Corvisa Services
Corvisa Services LLC is based in Milwaukee and provides software development, technology, marketing and training services to the Novation group of companies.

Mango Moving
Mango Moving LLC offered long-distance moving and nationwide moving storage, as well as à la carte long-distance moving. Novation acquired Mango in 2011.
Due to continued capital demands and difficulties generating positive cash flows or earnings, effective February 27, 2013, the Company committed to a plan to abandon the operations of Mango, which comprised the Company's entire Logistics segment. The run-off operations of Mango ceased during the first quarter of 2013, and the Company will not have any significant continuing involvement in Mango.
The End of NovaStar's Mortgage Lending[edit]
NovaStar originated and serviced "nonconforming" residential loans to borrowers who generally did not qualify for conventional mortgages.
NovaStar retained interests in the nonconforming loans it originated and purchased through its mortgage securities investment portfolio and was taxed as a real estate investment trust. Exposed by the subprime mortgage crisis, NovaStar ceased lending operations at the end of 2007.[2]
Its four operating units were mortgage portfolio management, mortgage lending, loan servicing and branch operations. It no longer originates mortgages, and all servicing rights were sold to Saxon Mortgage Services, Inc.
Legal Action[edit]
In 2006, forty shareholders in NovaStar sued ten Wall Street prime brokers, claiming a scheme to manipulate the companies' stock by allowing naked short selling.[3]
On March 20, 2007, the law office of Howard G Smith initiated a class action suit on behalf of investors against certain executive officers of NovaStar for inflating the stock price by deceptively reporting the company's financials. On April 2, 2007, the law office of Keller Rohrback initiated a class action suit on behalf of NovaStar 401(k) plan members on similar grounds. A third class action concerning NovaStar's charging of yield spread premium fees, fees paid by the lender to the broker which has come under notable criticism, is set to go to trial in May 2007.[4] On June 21, 2007, NovaStar's residential lending unit paid out $5.1 million to settle this lawsuit that accused it of charging higher rates because of hidden fees paid to mortgage brokers. The company did not admit wrongdoing.[5] This settlement, as in many of this type,allowed the officers to pay a small percent of what they earned in profit in order to keep the majority of the profits for any perceived wrongdoing. Because Novastar is not required to admit wrongdoing it of course did not. The S-P split is the term for the hidden fees which are believed to have taken place in other states other than Washington state where the class action was filed.
On September 12, 2008, a petition for involuntary bankruptcy was filed against subsidiary NovaStar Mortgage Inc. by its financial backers after the company repeatedly failed to pay interest on loans. NovaStar Financial announced that it intends to contest the petition on all available grounds, stating that should the petition be carried out it "would likely cause NFI to seek the protection of applicable bankruptcy laws."[6][7] NovaStar paid 2 million to American Interbanc to have the involuntary bankruptcy removed from the lawsuit filed in 2002 that charged Novastar with false advertising and unfair competition.
On November 7, 2008, a lawsuit was filed on behalf of purchasers of NovaStar Home Equity Loan Asset-Backed Certificates who bought them following the May 25, 2006 Registration Statement. It alleged misstatements and omissions about the backing of the securities that materially affected their value.[3]

History[edit]
Novation Companies, Inc., (NOVC) was founded as NovaStar Financial, Inc., a Kansas City-based residential mortgage company, in 1996. Through its subsidiaries, NovaStar Mortgage, Inc., and NovaStar Home Mortgage, Inc., it originated, securitized and serviced residential loans.
During a 10-year period, NovaStar Mortgage originated more than $40 billion in mortgage loans and NovaStar Home had more than 400 branches located nationwide. The fast and significant success took the company to nearly 5,000 employees at one point. The company went public a mere 10 months after opening its doors.
From 2003 to 2006, the total number of subprime loans issued in the U.S. increased by 17 percent. However, NovaStar’s business model proved unsustainable for the long term as more and more people defaulted on loans. NovaStar's business model is considered one of the primary factors that led to the credit crisis of 2008.
NovaStar rode the economic storm to its low, and exited the mortgage lending business completely by 2008. The company’s stock price dropped from nearly $70 a share to under $1 and was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange by 2008. The employee base shrank to approximately 20.
However, through perseverance, NovaStar survived one of the most significant economic downturns of our time as well as paid all of its secured bank lenders. It exited the crisis with a seasoned group of founders and leaders who had learned important lessons during the last decade: How to set up a better business model that will not collapse the market completely but still be profitable. In addition, the company has significant realized and unrealized federal tax losses, allowing it to mitigate income taxes on profits for many years to come.
Leaders were convinced that if they could navigate NovaStar through that storm, they could take their lessons learned and help other entrepreneurs grow and scale their businesses; defer taxes and do it all over again. With the self-induced collapse in 2008, they began reinventing NovaStar based on their core competencies: the ability to scale businesses and improve execution of an original concept. Since then they have acquired four companies – StreetLinks, Advent Financial Services, IVR Central (renamed CorvisaCloud) and Mango Moving.
This reinvention prompted the company to change its name to Novation Companies, Inc., in order to reflect the leadership team’s vision for the future and to get away from the bad taste that Novastar left its investors. [1] This name represents the ability to innovate in order to bring new technology-enabled services to market.
Novation leaders are attracted to technology-enabled service businesses with a differentiated value proposition for their customers. They focus about finding companies that are founded on great ideas but need to improve execution in order to grow. Following the Romney Bain Capital model of helping people, they assume operational control and support the companies with technology, sales/marketing and training services that a typical entrepreneur could not access.[1]
Other than CorvisaCloud, Novation has either sold or otherwise liquidated all of its operating subsidiaries. Currently, Novation is focused solely on developing the business of CorvisaCloud.
Subsidiaries (Current and Former)[edit]
Corvisa Cloud
Corvisa Cloud, LLC is located in Milwaukee and offers cloud-based IVR, ACD and call center solutions. By leveraging cloud-based technology, CorvisaCloud removes the upfront costs and overhead associated with onsite IVR solutions, offering infinite and immediate scalability at a fraction of previous costs. Solutions are available for both small business and enterprise-level customers, and can either augment or replace current call center operations.

StreetLinks Lender Solutions
StreetLinks LLC, dba StreetLinks Lender Solutions, offers a suite of appraisal/valuation solutions for mortgage industry professionals nationwide.
StreetLinks was Novation’s first and largest subsidiary. It grew from 15 employees to more than 600 after being acquired by Novation. In 2009, StreetLinks had significant increases in both revenue and net income over the previous year.
On April 16, 2014, the Company and non-controlling members of StreetLinks entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Assurant Services, LLC, a subsidiary of Assurant, Inc., pursuant to which Assurant purchased 100% of the outstanding membership units of StreetLinks in exchange for $60.0 million paid in cash at closing and up to $12.0 million in post-closing (consideration contingent upon the total revenue of StreetLinks in fiscal years 2015 and 2016). The sale closed on April 16, 2014. [2]

Advent Financial Services
Advent Financial Services, LLC provided financial settlement services for income tax preparation businesses and access to tailored banking accounts, small-dollar banking products and related services to meet the needs of low- and moderate-income-level individuals.
On August 18, 2014, Advent sold certain intellectual property, software, and customer data to Santa Barbara Tax Products Group, LLC. Also on August 18, 2014, the Company announced that it was conducting an orderly winding-down of Advent’s remaining business and operations.

Corvisa Services
Corvisa Services LLC is based in Milwaukee and provides software development, technology, marketing and training services to the Novation group of companies.

Mango Moving
Mango Moving LLC offered long-distance moving and nationwide moving storage, as well as à la carte long-distance moving. Novation acquired Mango in 2011.
Due to continued capital demands and difficulties generating positive cash flows or earnings, effective February 27, 2013, the Company committed to a plan to abandon the operations of Mango, which comprised the Company's entire Logistics segment. The run-off operations of Mango ceased during the first quarter of 2013, and the Company will not have any significant continuing involvement in Mango.
The End of NovaStar's Mortgage Lending[edit]
NovaStar originated and serviced "nonconforming" residential loans to borrowers who generally did not qualify for conventional mortgages.
NovaStar retained interests in the nonconforming loans it originated and purchased through its mortgage securities investment portfolio and was taxed as a real estate investment trust. Exposed by the subprime mortgage crisis, NovaStar ceased lending operations at the end of 2007.[2]
Its four operating units were mortgage portfolio management, mortgage lending, loan servicing and branch operations. It no longer originates mortgages, and all servicing rights were sold to Saxon Mortgage Services, Inc.
Legal Action[edit]
In 2006, forty shareholders in NovaStar sued ten Wall Street prime brokers, claiming a scheme to manipulate the companies' stock by allowing naked short selling.[3]
On March 20, 2007, the law office of Howard G Smith initiated a class action suit on behalf of investors against certain executive officers of NovaStar for inflating the stock price by deceptively reporting the company's financials. On April 2, 2007, the law office of Keller Rohrback initiated a class action suit on behalf of NovaStar 401(k) plan members on similar grounds. A third class action concerning NovaStar's charging of yield spread premium fees, fees paid by the lender to the broker which has come under notable criticism, is set to go to trial in May 2007.[4] On June 21, 2007, NovaStar's residential lending unit paid out $5.1 million to settle this lawsuit that accused it of charging higher rates because of hidden fees paid to mortgage brokers. The company did not admit wrongdoing.[5] This settlement, as in many of this type,allowed the officers to pay a small percent of what they earned in profit in order to keep the majority of the profits for any perceived wrongdoing. Because Novastar is not required to admit wrongdoing it of course did not. The S-P split is the term for the hidden fees which are believed to have taken place in other states other than Washington state where the class action was filed.
On September 12, 2008, a petition for involuntary bankruptcy was filed against subsidiary NovaStar Mortgage Inc. by its financial backers after the company repeatedly failed to pay interest on loans. NovaStar Financial announced that it intends to contest the petition on all available grounds, stating that should the petition be carried out it "would likely cause NFI to seek the protection of applicable bankruptcy laws."[6][7] NovaStar paid 2 million to American Interbanc to have the involuntary bankruptcy removed from the lawsuit filed in 2002 that charged Novastar with false advertising and unfair competition.
On November 7, 2008, a lawsuit was filed on behalf of purchasers of NovaStar Home Equity Loan Asset-Backed Certificates who bought them following the May 25, 2006 Registration Statement. It alleged misstatements and omissions about the backing of the securities that materially affected their value.[3]

History[edit]
Novation Companies, Inc., (NOVC) was founded as NovaStar Financial, Inc., a Kansas City-based residential mortgage company, in 1996. Through its subsidiaries, NovaStar Mortgage, Inc., and NovaStar Home Mortgage, Inc., it originated, securitized and serviced residential loans.
During a 10-year period, NovaStar Mortgage originated more than $40 billion in mortgage loans and NovaStar Home had more than 400 branches located nationwide. The fast and significant success took the company to nearly 5,000 employees at one point. The company went public a mere 10 months after opening its doors.
From 2003 to 2006, the total number of subprime loans issued in the U.S. increased by 17 percent. However, NovaStar’s business model proved unsustainable for the long term as more and more people defaulted on loans. NovaStar's business model is considered one of the primary factors that led to the credit crisis of 2008.
NovaStar rode the economic storm to its low, and exited the mortgage lending business completely by 2008. The company’s stock price dropped from nearly $70 a share to under $1 and was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange by 2008. The employee base shrank to approximately 20.
However, through perseverance, NovaStar survived one of the most significant economic downturns of our time as well as paid all of its secured bank lenders. It exited the crisis with a seasoned group of founders and leaders who had learned important lessons during the last decade: How to set up a better business model that will not collapse the market completely but still be profitable. In addition, the company has significant realized and unrealized federal tax losses, allowing it to mitigate income taxes on profits for many years to come.
Leaders were convinced that if they could navigate NovaStar through that storm, they could take their lessons learned and help other entrepreneurs grow and scale their businesses; defer taxes and do it all over again. With the self-induced collapse in 2008, they began reinventing NovaStar based on their core competencies: the ability to scale businesses and improve execution of an original concept. Since then they have acquired four companies – StreetLinks, Advent Financial Services, IVR Central (renamed CorvisaCloud) and Mango Moving.
This reinvention prompted the company to change its name to Novation Companies, Inc., in order to reflect the leadership team’s vision for the future and to get away from the bad taste that Novastar left its investors. [1] This name represents the ability to innovate in order to bring new technology-enabled services to market.
Novation leaders are attracted to technology-enabled service businesses with a differentiated value proposition for their customers. They focus about finding companies that are founded on great ideas but need to improve execution in order to grow. Following the Romney Bain Capital model of helping people, they assume operational control and support the companies with technology, sales/marketing and training services that a typical entrepreneur could not access.[1]
Other than CorvisaCloud, Novation has either sold or otherwise liquidated all of its operating subsidiaries. Currently, Novation is focused solely on developing the business of CorvisaCloud.
Subsidiaries (Current and Former)[edit]
Corvisa Cloud
Corvisa Cloud, LLC is located in Milwaukee and offers cloud-based IVR, ACD and call center solutions. By leveraging cloud-based technology, CorvisaCloud removes the upfront costs and overhead associated with onsite IVR solutions, offering infinite and immediate scalability at a fraction of previous costs. Solutions are available for both small business and enterprise-level customers, and can either augment or replace current call center operations.

StreetLinks Lender Solutions
StreetLinks LLC, dba StreetLinks Lender Solutions, offers a suite of appraisal/valuation solutions for mortgage industry professionals nationwide.
StreetLinks was Novation’s first and largest subsidiary. It grew from 15 employees to more than 600 after being acquired by Novation. In 2009, StreetLinks had significant increases in both revenue and net income over the previous year.
On April 16, 2014, the Company and non-controlling members of StreetLinks entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Assurant Services, LLC, a subsidiary of Assurant, Inc., pursuant to which Assurant purchased 100% of the outstanding membership units of StreetLinks in exchange for $60.0 million paid in cash at closing and up to $12.0 million in post-closing (consideration contingent upon the total revenue of StreetLinks in fiscal years 2015 and 2016). The sale closed on April 16, 2014. [2]

Advent Financial Services
Advent Financial Services, LLC provided financial settlement services for income tax preparation businesses and access to tailored banking accounts, small-dollar banking products and related services to meet the needs of low- and moderate-income-level individuals.
On August 18, 2014, Advent sold certain intellectual property, software, and customer data to Santa Barbara Tax Products Group, LLC. Also on August 18, 2014, the Company announced that it was conducting an orderly winding-down of Advent’s remaining business and operations.

Corvisa Services
Corvisa Services LLC is based in Milwaukee and provides software development, technology, marketing and training services to the Novation group of companies.

Mango Moving
Mango Moving LLC offered long-distance moving and nationwide moving storage, as well as à la carte long-distance moving. Novation acquired Mango in 2011.
Due to continued capital demands and difficulties generating positive cash flows or earnings, effective February 27, 2013, the Company committed to a plan to abandon the operations of Mango, which comprised the Company's entire Logistics segment. The run-off operations of Mango ceased during the first quarter of 2013, and the Company will not have any significant continuing involvement in Mango.
The End of NovaStar's Mortgage Lending[edit]
NovaStar originated and serviced "nonconforming" residential loans to borrowers who generally did not qualify for conventional mortgages.
NovaStar retained interests in the nonconforming loans it originated and purchased through its mortgage securities investment portfolio and was taxed as a real estate investment trust. Exposed by the subprime mortgage crisis, NovaStar ceased lending operations at the end of 2007.[2]
Its four operating units were mortgage portfolio management, mortgage lending, loan servicing and branch operations. It no longer originates mortgages, and all servicing rights were sold to Saxon Mortgage Services, Inc.
Legal Action[edit]
In 2006, forty shareholders in NovaStar sued ten Wall Street prime brokers, claiming a scheme to manipulate the companies' stock by allowing naked short selling.[3]
On March 20, 2007, the law office of Howard G Smith initiated a class action suit on behalf of investors against certain executive officers of NovaStar for inflating the stock price by deceptively reporting the company's financials. On April 2, 2007, the law office of Keller Rohrback initiated a class action suit on behalf of NovaStar 401(k) plan members on similar grounds. A third class action concerning NovaStar's charging of yield spread premium fees, fees paid by the lender to the broker which has come under notable criticism, is set to go to trial in May 2007.[4] On June 21, 2007, NovaStar's residential lending unit paid out $5.1 million to settle this lawsuit that accused it of charging higher rates because of hidden fees paid to mortgage brokers. The company did not admit wrongdoing.[5] This settlement, as in many of this type,allowed the officers to pay a small percent of what they earned in profit in order to keep the majority of the profits for any perceived wrongdoing. Because Novastar is not required to admit wrongdoing it of course did not. The S-P split is the term for the hidden fees which are believed to have taken place in other states other than Washington state where the class action was filed.
On September 12, 2008, a petition for involuntary bankruptcy was filed against subsidiary NovaStar Mortgage Inc. by its financial backers after the company repeatedly failed to pay interest on loans. NovaStar Financial announced that it intends to contest the petition on all available grounds, stating that should the petition be carried out it "would likely cause NFI to seek the protection of applicable bankruptcy laws."[6][7] NovaStar paid 2 million to American Interbanc to have the involuntary bankruptcy removed from the lawsuit filed in 2002 that charged Novastar with false advertising and unfair competition.
On November 7, 2008, a lawsuit was filed on behalf of purchasers of NovaStar Home Equity Loan Asset-Backed Certificates who bought them following the May 25, 2006 Registration Statement. It alleged misstatements and omissions about the backing of the securities that materially affected their value.[3]

KANSAS CITY, Mo., July 20, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Novation Companies, Inc. (OTCQB: NOVC) ("Novation" or the "Company") announced today that it and certain of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions for chapter 11 business reorganization in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Maryland (Baltimore Division).  Novation's board of directors unanimously determined that a chapter 11 reorganization is in the best interest of the Company and its stakeholders. The process allows Novation and its subsidiaries to continue normal business operations while restructuring the Company's finances and contractual obligations.








Novation has significant liquid assets and net operating losses that the Company expects to preserve during the chapter 11 process. The Company has engaged a financial advisor to review financial and strategic alternatives. The Company and the advisor are working to acquire a profitable operating business in order to maximize its return to all creditors and stakeholders. The Company will seek to restructure its obligations or have its obligations, primarily those under its senior unsecured notes, reinstated. The Company also intends to vigorously defend and seek to determine the claims asserted in existing lawsuits for which the Company and its subsidiaries believe they have meritorious defenses. The Company will honor all post-petition obligations during chapter 11 in the ordinary course, including obligations to employees.
Novation will file monthly operating reports with the bankruptcy court and continue to file quarterly and annual reports with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").
The Company and its board of directors are being advised by Oberon Securities, LLC, Olshan Frome Wolosky LLP and Shapiro Sher Guinot & Sandler, P.A.
About Novation Companies, Inc.Novation Companies, Inc. is in the process of implementing its strategy to acquire operating businesses or making other investments that generate taxable earnings.  As of the date of this press release, the Company has not yet identified any specific acquisition targets.  Novation trades on the OTCQB market of the OTC Markets Group, Inc. under the symbol NOVC.  For more information, please visit www.novationcompanies.com or email ir@novationcompanies.com.

CorvisaCloud Secures $30 Million in Funding
Milwaukee, Wis. – April 23, 2014 – Cloud-based communications provider, CorvisaCloud, LLC., today announced that it has secured $30 million in funding from parent company Novation Companies, Inc. (OTCQB: NOVC). The additional capital will be devoted to expanding CorvisaCloud's sales, marketing and operational development efforts and potential acquisitions. The funds will also be used to accelerate product development and customer acquisition of CorvisaCloud's CorvisaOne™ contact center software products and platform.
			
"CorvisaCloud is experiencing strong momentum in the cloud contact center arena and as a result, we believe the time is now to take this company to the next level," said Lance Anderson, CEO, Novation Companies. "The additional funds will drive substantial enterprise value while helping propel operations and allowing us to look at potential acquisitions. We look forward to accelerating CorvisaCloud's initial success and building upon its increasing roster of globally recognizable brand name clients."
			
"This infusion of capital from Novation arrives at the perfect time as we make our mark in the cloud communications space," said CorvisaCloud President Matt Lautz. "Novation clearly recognizes the significant market opportunity and this additional funding is a great vote of confidence in CorvisaCloud's vision, value and future."
			
Businesses of all sizes are increasingly migrating their IT operations to the cloud. Contact centers are a key part of customer service, but powering and maintaining legacy systems is expensive and the data can be difficult to collect and manage. According to DMG Consulting's Cloud-Based Contact Center Infrastructure Market Report, more than 62% of organizations were using some type of cloud-based contact center solution as part of their operation in September 2013, and approximately half (45.6%) of the organizations that are not yet using cloud-based contact center solutions are planning to move in this direction in the next 18 months.
			
Founded in 2011, CorvisaCloud offers a cloud-based communications suite, including inbound and outbound contact center solutions, business phone systems (PBX) and robust platform customization options. Its cloud-based solutions remove the upfront costs and high maintenance associated with on-premise legacy solutions, offering immediate scalability and broader flexibility.
			

			CorvisaCloud's products have helped businesses of all sizes gain operational efficiencies, improve customer service and lower costs. Companies such as Direct Buy and Heartland Payment Systems use CorvisaCloud's technology to streamline workflow and deliver the best customer experience possible.
			

About CorvisaCloud
		CorvisaCloud brings customer success to the heart of every business interaction through our cloud-based communications software platform and consulting services. We help businesses work smarter, save money, and make customers happier…and with our passion for service, we make getting there an enjoyable experience.

Launch
Our range of grid instruments and controllers for launching clips and controlling your filters, effects and instruments in Ableton Live, or any other major music software. All our Launch products can be chained together, and integrate seamlessly with Ableton Live without any setup, so you can just plug them in and start playing.
View Range





















Circuit
Circuit is designed to inspire. Two Novation polysynths and a four-part drum machine, combined with an intuitive grid-based sequencer in a standalone box that will have you making electronic music in minutes. Hit some pads, tweak the knobs and your track will start to emerge, all locked in time and key. Play around with effects, patterns and sounds in real time, to produce your track, brimming with fat grooves and beats.
View Circuit





















Synths
Nobody does synthesisers like we do. We're the guys behind Bass Station and Supernova. Our design consultant is Chris Huggett, the man who designed OSCar and WASP. Synth heritage doesn't come richer than ours. Add to that our 23 years of innovation and expertise, and you've got the modern Novation synth range.
View Range





















Keys
Our keyboards range from simple and portable mini keyboards with handfuls of handy knobs, to advanced professional controllers with huge arrays of touch-sensitive controls and ultra-responsive, expressive keyboards. They all integrate immediately with Ableton Live, and any other major music software, to give you the exact level of control you need to enhance your creativity.
View Range





















Accessories
We offer a whole range of officially branded gig bags and lightweight cases for your synths and controllers. They are the ideal way to protect and transport your gear, laptop and anything else you like to carry around. Plus, because they are specifically designed for your gear, you know they offer the best possible fit and protection.
View Range





















Software
All our apps and software come free with any Novation product, but you can also purchase them separately through our web store. From making and remixing music on your mobile devices, to instantly mapping your DAW parameters to your hardware controls, they all integrate with your gear to create unique and portable workstations.
View Range





















Blocs Wave
Blocs Wave is a new music creation app for iPad and iPhone. It makes starting new musical ideas quick, and easy. Instantly combine professional sounds, tweak them to make them unique, and record in your own new sounds.

History[edit]
Novation Companies, Inc., (NOVC) was founded as NovaStar Financial, Inc., a Kansas City-based residential mortgage company, in 1996. Through its subsidiaries, NovaStar Mortgage, Inc., and NovaStar Home Mortgage, Inc., it originated, securitized and serviced residential loans.
During a 10-year period, NovaStar Mortgage originated more than $40 billion in mortgage loans and NovaStar Home had more than 400 branches located nationwide. The fast and significant success took the company to nearly 5,000 employees at one point. The company went public a mere 10 months after opening its doors.
From 2003 to 2006, the total number of subprime loans issued in the U.S. increased by 17 percent. However, NovaStar’s business model proved unsustainable for the long term as more and more people defaulted on loans. NovaStar's business model is considered one of the primary factors that led to the credit crisis of 2008.
NovaStar rode the economic storm to its low, and exited the mortgage lending business completely by 2008. The company’s stock price dropped from nearly $70 a share to under $1 and was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange by 2008. The employee base shrank to approximately 20.
However, through perseverance, NovaStar survived one of the most significant economic downturns of our time as well as paid all of its secured bank lenders. It exited the crisis with a seasoned group of founders and leaders who had learned important lessons during the last decade: How to set up a better business model that will not collapse the market completely but still be profitable. In addition, the company has significant realized and unrealized federal tax losses, allowing it to mitigate income taxes on profits for many years to come.
Leaders were convinced that if they could navigate NovaStar through that storm, they could take their lessons learned and help other entrepreneurs grow and scale their businesses; defer taxes and do it all over again. With the self-induced collapse in 2008, they began reinventing NovaStar based on their core competencies: the ability to scale businesses and improve execution of an original concept. Since then they have acquired four companies – StreetLinks, Advent Financial Services, IVR Central (renamed CorvisaCloud) and Mango Moving.
This reinvention prompted the company to change its name to Novation Companies, Inc., in order to reflect the leadership team’s vision for the future and to get away from the bad taste that Novastar left its investors. [1] This name represents the ability to innovate in order to bring new technology-enabled services to market.
Novation leaders are attracted to technology-enabled service businesses with a differentiated value proposition for their customers. They focus about finding companies that are founded on great ideas but need to improve execution in order to grow. Following the Romney Bain Capital model of helping people, they assume operational control and support the companies with technology, sales/marketing and training services that a typical entrepreneur could not access.[1]
Other than CorvisaCloud, Novation has either sold or otherwise liquidated all of its operating subsidiaries. Currently, Novation is focused solely on developing the business of CorvisaCloud.
Subsidiaries (Current and Former)[edit]
Corvisa Cloud
Corvisa Cloud, LLC is located in Milwaukee and offers cloud-based IVR, ACD and call center solutions. By leveraging cloud-based technology, CorvisaCloud removes the upfront costs and overhead associated with onsite IVR solutions, offering infinite and immediate scalability at a fraction of previous costs. Solutions are available for both small business and enterprise-level customers, and can either augment or replace current call center operations.

StreetLinks Lender Solutions
StreetLinks LLC, dba StreetLinks Lender Solutions, offers a suite of appraisal/valuation solutions for mortgage industry professionals nationwide.
StreetLinks was Novation’s first and largest subsidiary. It grew from 15 employees to more than 600 after being acquired by Novation. In 2009, StreetLinks had significant increases in both revenue and net income over the previous year.
On April 16, 2014, the Company and non-controlling members of StreetLinks entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Assurant Services, LLC, a subsidiary of Assurant, Inc., pursuant to which Assurant purchased 100% of the outstanding membership units of StreetLinks in exchange for $60.0 million paid in cash at closing and up to $12.0 million in post-closing (consideration contingent upon the total revenue of StreetLinks in fiscal years 2015 and 2016). The sale closed on April 16, 2014. [2]

Advent Financial Services
Advent Financial Services, LLC provided financial settlement services for income tax preparation businesses and access to tailored banking accounts, small-dollar banking products and related services to meet the needs of low- and moderate-income-level individuals.
On August 18, 2014, Advent sold certain intellectual property, software, and customer data to Santa Barbara Tax Products Group, LLC. Also on August 18, 2014, the Company announced that it was conducting an orderly winding-down of Advent’s remaining business and operations.

Corvisa Services
Corvisa Services LLC is based in Milwaukee and provides software development, technology, marketing and training services to the Novation group of companies.

Mango Moving
Mango Moving LLC offered long-distance moving and nationwide moving storage, as well as à la carte long-distance moving. Novation acquired Mango in 2011.
Due to continued capital demands and difficulties generating positive cash flows or earnings, effective February 27, 2013, the Company committed to a plan to abandon the operations of Mango, which comprised the Company's entire Logistics segment. The run-off operations of Mango ceased during the first quarter of 2013, and the Company will not have any significant continuing involvement in Mango.
The End of NovaStar's Mortgage Lending[edit]
NovaStar originated and serviced "nonconforming" residential loans to borrowers who generally did not qualify for conventional mortgages.
NovaStar retained interests in the nonconforming loans it originated and purchased through its mortgage securities investment portfolio and was taxed as a real estate investment trust. Exposed by the subprime mortgage crisis, NovaStar ceased lending operations at the end of 2007.[2]
Its four operating units were mortgage portfolio management, mortgage lending, loan servicing and branch operations. It no longer originates mortgages, and all servicing rights were sold to Saxon Mortgage Services, Inc.
Legal Action[edit]
In 2006, forty shareholders in NovaStar sued ten Wall Street prime brokers, claiming a scheme to manipulate the companies' stock by allowing naked short selling.[3]
On March 20, 2007, the law office of Howard G Smith initiated a class action suit on behalf of investors against certain executive officers of NovaStar for inflating the stock price by deceptively reporting the company's financials. On April 2, 2007, the law office of Keller Rohrback initiated a class action suit on behalf of NovaStar 401(k) plan members on similar grounds. A third class action concerning NovaStar's charging of yield spread premium fees, fees paid by the lender to the broker which has come under notable criticism, is set to go to trial in May 2007.[4] On June 21, 2007, NovaStar's residential lending unit paid out $5.1 million to settle this lawsuit that accused it of charging higher rates because of hidden fees paid to mortgage brokers. The company did not admit wrongdoing.[5] This settlement, as in many of this type,allowed the officers to pay a small percent of what they earned in profit in order to keep the majority of the profits for any perceived wrongdoing. Because Novastar is not required to admit wrongdoing it of course did not. The S-P split is the term for the hidden fees which are believed to have taken place in other states other than Washington state where the class action was filed.
On September 12, 2008, a petition for involuntary bankruptcy was filed against subsidiary NovaStar Mortgage Inc. by its financial backers after the company repeatedly failed to pay interest on loans. NovaStar Financial announced that it intends to contest the petition on all available grounds, stating that should the petition be carried out it "would likely cause NFI to seek the protection of applicable bankruptcy laws."[6][7] NovaStar paid 2 million to American Interbanc to have the involuntary bankruptcy removed from the lawsuit filed in 2002 that charged Novastar with false advertising and unfair competition.
On November 7, 2008, a lawsuit was filed on behalf of purchasers of NovaStar Home Equity Loan Asset-Backed Certificates who bought them following the May 25, 2006 Registration Statement. It alleged misstatements and omissions about the backing of the securities that materially affected their value.[3]

History[edit]
Novation Companies, Inc., (NOVC) was founded as NovaStar Financial, Inc., a Kansas City-based residential mortgage company, in 1996. Through its subsidiaries, NovaStar Mortgage, Inc., and NovaStar Home Mortgage, Inc., it originated, securitized and serviced residential loans.
During a 10-year period, NovaStar Mortgage originated more than $40 billion in mortgage loans and NovaStar Home had more than 400 branches located nationwide. The fast and significant success took the company to nearly 5,000 employees at one point. The company went public a mere 10 months after opening its doors.
From 2003 to 2006, the total number of subprime loans issued in the U.S. increased by 17 percent. However, NovaStar’s business model proved unsustainable for the long term as more and more people defaulted on loans. NovaStar's business model is considered one of the primary factors that led to the credit crisis of 2008.
NovaStar rode the economic storm to its low, and exited the mortgage lending business completely by 2008. The company’s stock price dropped from nearly $70 a share to under $1 and was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange by 2008. The employee base shrank to approximately 20.
However, through perseverance, NovaStar survived one of the most significant economic downturns of our time as well as paid all of its secured bank lenders. It exited the crisis with a seasoned group of founders and leaders who had learned important lessons during the last decade: How to set up a better business model that will not collapse the market completely but still be profitable. In addition, the company has significant realized and unrealized federal tax losses, allowing it to mitigate income taxes on profits for many years to come.
Leaders were convinced that if they could navigate NovaStar through that storm, they could take their lessons learned and help other entrepreneurs grow and scale their businesses; defer taxes and do it all over again. With the self-induced collapse in 2008, they began reinventing NovaStar based on their core competencies: the ability to scale businesses and improve execution of an original concept. Since then they have acquired four companies – StreetLinks, Advent Financial Services, IVR Central (renamed CorvisaCloud) and Mango Moving.
This reinvention prompted the company to change its name to Novation Companies, Inc., in order to reflect the leadership team’s vision for the future and to get away from the bad taste that Novastar left its investors. [1] This name represents the ability to innovate in order to bring new technology-enabled services to market.
Novation leaders are attracted to technology-enabled service businesses with a differentiated value proposition for their customers. They focus about finding companies that are founded on great ideas but need to improve execution in order to grow. Following the Romney Bain Capital model of helping people, they assume operational control and support the companies with technology, sales/marketing and training services that a typical entrepreneur could not access.[1]
Other than CorvisaCloud, Novation has either sold or otherwise liquidated all of its operating subsidiaries. Currently, Novation is focused solely on developing the business of CorvisaCloud.
Subsidiaries (Current and Former)[edit]
Corvisa Cloud
Corvisa Cloud, LLC is located in Milwaukee and offers cloud-based IVR, ACD and call center solutions. By leveraging cloud-based technology, CorvisaCloud removes the upfront costs and overhead associated with onsite IVR solutions, offering infinite and immediate scalability at a fraction of previous costs. Solutions are available for both small business and enterprise-level customers, and can either augment or replace current call center operations.

StreetLinks Lender Solutions
StreetLinks LLC, dba StreetLinks Lender Solutions, offers a suite of appraisal/valuation solutions for mortgage industry professionals nationwide.
StreetLinks was Novation’s first and largest subsidiary. It grew from 15 employees to more than 600 after being acquired by Novation. In 2009, StreetLinks had significant increases in both revenue and net income over the previous year.
On April 16, 2014, the Company and non-controlling members of StreetLinks entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Assurant Services, LLC, a subsidiary of Assurant, Inc., pursuant to which Assurant purchased 100% of the outstanding membership units of StreetLinks in exchange for $60.0 million paid in cash at closing and up to $12.0 million in post-closing (consideration contingent upon the total revenue of StreetLinks in fiscal years 2015 and 2016). The sale closed on April 16, 2014. [2]

Advent Financial Services
Advent Financial Services, LLC provided financial settlement services for income tax preparation businesses and access to tailored banking accounts, small-dollar banking products and related services to meet the needs of low- and moderate-income-level individuals.
On August 18, 2014, Advent sold certain intellectual property, software, and customer data to Santa Barbara Tax Products Group, LLC. Also on August 18, 2014, the Company announced that it was conducting an orderly winding-down of Advent’s remaining business and operations.

Corvisa Services
Corvisa Services LLC is based in Milwaukee and provides software development, technology, marketing and training services to the Novation group of companies.

Mango Moving
Mango Moving LLC offered long-distance moving and nationwide moving storage, as well as à la carte long-distance moving. Novation acquired Mango in 2011.
Due to continued capital demands and difficulties generating positive cash flows or earnings, effective February 27, 2013, the Company committed to a plan to abandon the operations of Mango, which comprised the Company's entire Logistics segment. The run-off operations of Mango ceased during the first quarter of 2013, and the Company will not have any significant continuing involvement in Mango.
The End of NovaStar's Mortgage Lending[edit]
NovaStar originated and serviced "nonconforming" residential loans to borrowers who generally did not qualify for conventional mortgages.
NovaStar retained interests in the nonconforming loans it originated and purchased through its mortgage securities investment portfolio and was taxed as a real estate investment trust. Exposed by the subprime mortgage crisis, NovaStar ceased lending operations at the end of 2007.[2]
Its four operating units were mortgage portfolio management, mortgage lending, loan servicing and branch operations. It no longer originates mortgages, and all servicing rights were sold to Saxon Mortgage Services, Inc.
Legal Action[edit]
In 2006, forty shareholders in NovaStar sued ten Wall Street prime brokers, claiming a scheme to manipulate the companies' stock by allowing naked short selling.[3]
On March 20, 2007, the law office of Howard G Smith initiated a class action suit on behalf of investors against certain executive officers of NovaStar for inflating the stock price by deceptively reporting the company's financials. On April 2, 2007, the law office of Keller Rohrback initiated a class action suit on behalf of NovaStar 401(k) plan members on similar grounds. A third class action concerning NovaStar's charging of yield spread premium fees, fees paid by the lender to the broker which has come under notable criticism, is set to go to trial in May 2007.[4] On June 21, 2007, NovaStar's residential lending unit paid out $5.1 million to settle this lawsuit that accused it of charging higher rates because of hidden fees paid to mortgage brokers. The company did not admit wrongdoing.[5] This settlement, as in many of this type,allowed the officers to pay a small percent of what they earned in profit in order to keep the majority of the profits for any perceived wrongdoing. Because Novastar is not required to admit wrongdoing it of course did not. The S-P split is the term for the hidden fees which are believed to have taken place in other states other than Washington state where the class action was filed.
On September 12, 2008, a petition for involuntary bankruptcy was filed against subsidiary NovaStar Mortgage Inc. by its financial backers after the company repeatedly failed to pay interest on loans. NovaStar Financial announced that it intends to contest the petition on all available grounds, stating that should the petition be carried out it "would likely cause NFI to seek the protection of applicable bankruptcy laws."[6][7] NovaStar paid 2 million to American Interbanc to have the involuntary bankruptcy removed from the lawsuit filed in 2002 that charged Novastar with false advertising and unfair competition.
On November 7, 2008, a lawsuit was filed on behalf of purchasers of NovaStar Home Equity Loan Asset-Backed Certificates who bought them following the May 25, 2006 Registration Statement. It alleged misstatements and omissions about the backing of the securities that materially affected their value.[3]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
