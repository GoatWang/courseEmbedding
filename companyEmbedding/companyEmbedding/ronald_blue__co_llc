 What’s your “Why?” 

Every organization has a What, a How, and a Why. Our What is wealth management services. Our How is through experienced financial advisors building relationships and applying tools such as proprietary financial planning software, investment vehicles, and tax planning strategies. But it’s our Why that sets us apart from other wealth management firms. Why is what motivates us to get out of bed in the morning – it’s our reason, cause, and purpose for what we do. 
We are not simply a financial planning, investment management, or estate planning firm. We believe we do all of those things with excellence, but we are essentially a financial peace of mind firm. And we firmly believe that when our clients live with peace of mind about money – without conflict, anxiety, or fear – their lives are richer and more fulfilling. They can envision and act on their Why.
The vision of helping people seek and live their Why was one of the cornerstones on which Ron Blue established the company in 1979. Ron felt challenged and called to help people become better stewards of their money and have a better relationship with money by using not just technical expertise, but biblical wisdom as well. For over 35 years, many of our clients have come to us, and stay with us, because they are attracted to our uncommon approach to wealth management. Read more about how we integrate biblical wisdom into our counsel. 




 
 
We have our own success story – people with a vision and a mission. Learn more about how our founders shaped us into the firm we are today.  
 
























Our executive leadership team includes individuals who have been with the firm since its early days, helping shape Ronald Blue & Co. into the one of the largest fee-only independent wealth management firms in the country.

Your life well spent.

What constitutes a life well spent? Is it riches or enrichment? Is it your prosperity or the legacy of your posterity? Who measures your life well spent – you, or others in your life? Is there a point where faith and finances intersect in a life well spent?
These questions inform the essence of who we are and what we do.  As one of the largest, fee-only independent wealth management firms in the United States, Ronald Blue & Co. provides comprehensive financial strategies based on biblical wisdom, with one goal: empower our clients to live enriched lives.

Believing that biblical wisdom is the best guide for making wise financial decisions, we strive to help you achieve both the financial goals and the financial peace of mind to live your life well spent.



Our advisors in 13 offices around the country provide a full complement of services – financial planning, investment management, estate and trust planning, tax planning and business services, and philanthropic counsel. From our beginning more than three decades ago, we have built relationships of trust with our clients, speaking to some of the most financially intimate areas of their lives.
Founded in 1979, we offer fee-only financial advisory services and today have more than $7 billion of client assets under management/advisement and serve 6,800 clients. Our ultimate goal is helping our clients realize their life well spent.

Financial Planning



















Overview
Retirement
Philanthropic Counsel
Tax
Estate & Trust
















Through financial planning, we help you define your goals and help to get you from where you are today to where you want to be.

Life is full of choices – how we spend our time, how we manage our resources, and what goals and activities we choose to pursue. The decisions we make reflect our values and priorities and have a ripple effect in other areas of our life. Experience has taught us that today’s decisions have lifetime implications. We believe the longer range your perspective, the better your decision-making, and in life, there are no independent decisions. Using biblical principles, our comprehensive financial planning approach clarifies decision making and focuses on leaving a legacy of financial, social and spiritual capital. Our objective is to ensure that your decisions accurately reflect your values and help you achieve your financial goals. 


Combining vision and action, a financial plan includes everything from short-term cash flow planning based on the “five uses of money” to long-term retirement planning, from minimizing debt proactively to understanding the tax consequences of various decisions, from funding your child’s education to determining how much insurance you might need. Our comprehensive process includes using BluePrint, our proprietary and multidisciplinary financial planning software, to thoroughly understand the components of your financial picture and life. By understanding how all the components integrate with each other, we can work toward sound decisions, wise stewardship, and a road map to your desired destination: an enriched life. 
















Insight
“No” to surprises. “Yes” to financial peace of mind.
Here’s how our advisors can help you with your financial planning.
Watch Video


















Are you ready for retirement? More importantly, are you asking the right questions about retirement?

Retirement planning is much more than a magic number that answers the question “How much is enough?” It’s a process of you and your advisor working together to make sure you’re asking the right questions: Should I retire? How will I continue to provide for my family? What will I do next? How does retiring help me fulfill God’s purpose in my life? How will I determine what my next chapter is?
The Bible is virtually silent on the concept of retirement, and makes no mention of ceasing work at age 60 or 65. As you approach retirement, don’t look at it as an end. Rather, look at it as a beginning. It is the start of the next phase in your service in God’s kingdom. With proper planning and wise stewardship, you may become financially free to use your talents and abilities to fulfill God’s next purposes for your life, even after your primary career is completed.
In a robust economy, many investors mistakenly believe that strong investment returns will continue, and that there is no need to plan or save for a leaner future. On the other hand, some investors are so aggressive when it comes to retirement savings that they rob themselves – and their families – of opportunities to enjoy life and be generous toward others.


Neither extreme is healthy – and neither reflects wise stewardship, an important component of financial planning. The two primary tools for saving for your retirement – qualified retirement plans, which may be available through your employer, and individual retirement accounts (IRAs) – each offer a tax incentive for saving.
These alternatives offer significant advantages that your advisor will consider in the financial planning process. A thorough review of all of your available options, along with projections for reaching financial independence, can provide you with:

Resources to help identify the best time to retire
Confidence that your investments may be sufficient for your lifetime 
Financial peace of mind regarding “how much is enough” 
The specific steps needed to reach your goal of retirement 
A strategy to use your savings in a tax efficient manner 
A plan to live life to its fullest during your retirement years 
An understanding of how inflation, investment return, and lifestyle decisions impact your projected retirement time frame 

















Perspective
The plans of the diligent lead surely to advantage.
Proverbs 21:5


















"We make a living by what we get. We make a life by what we Give!"  ~  Winston Churchill

One of the key benefits of having a comprehensive and strategic financial plan is to be able to give generously. Helping clients with their plans for giving has been a central tenet of Ronald Blue & Co. since our inception – in fact, because we have always considered it a focus of our services, we’ve attracted many like-minded clients, who have given hundreds of millions of dollars to philanthropic causes. They give in the true spirit of sharing and experience the message of wisdom found in the biblical principle that guides us: Giving is key to becoming free from the power of money over our lives.


Generous giving needs a strategic plan, not just knowledge of the tax laws that govern “deductions.” With wise philanthropic counsel, your giving plan can help you: 

Realize a deeper personal satisfaction from making a difference 

    Gain a thorough understanding of the financial implications of giving 

    Understand the strategies for giving assets in addition to giving cash 

    Coordinate a giving strategy with your financial plan 

    Feel confident that you are giving in a tax efficient manner 

    Prioritize your passions and goals for philanthropy 
Most importantly, we can help you benefit from the freedom and personal joy that giving generously brings to bear on the giver.
    

















Perspective
“Generosity and financial freedom are inextricably linked. If you want to replace fear, guilt and frustration with freedom, confidence and joy, you have to hold your treasures – your money, your possessions, your time and talents – with an open hand."  – Ron Blue, “Generous Living”
 Our advisors describe how they can help you with your heart’s desire to be generous.

It’s not what you earn that counts, but what you keep after taxes.

With all of the tax laws and legislative changes, how do you successfully navigate the complex, always changing and confusing tax system? More importantly, how do you best take advantage of these changing laws in order to improve your financial stewardship and accomplish your goals?
Benjamin Franklin once said that “nothing is certain but death and taxes.” Despite yearly tax bills, most individuals think about taxes only when they are filing their return. “After-the-fact” tax planning is often too late to take advantage of certain tax deductions, credits, and other tax planning strategies. Unlike tax preparation, tax planning is a year-round process.
Tax planning should be an important part of your financial plan. But simply lowering or avoiding taxes should never drive or be the centerpiece of your financial plan. Instead, consider tax reduction efforts in light of your overall goals for investing, debt reduction, estate distribution, and charitable giving.


By paying attention to your taxes year-round instead of just at tax-preparation time, we can help you make the most of tax planning strategies. Our tax planning process can provide you with many benefits: 

Short and long-term tax projections 
Confidence that your taxes are being  reviewed 
Analysis that your tax withholdings or estimated tax payments are sufficient 
Tax savings opportunities through income shifting, deferment, deduction planning and other timing strategies
Estimation of marginal and effective tax rates, and federal and state tax liabilities 
Understanding of the tax consequences of financial and life decisions 
Working along side your tax preparer to ensure that your tax planning goals are being met 
Referral to Ronald Blue & Co. CPAs and Consultants for tax preparation services, if you don’t currently have a tax preparer
    






















"The legacy of our posterity . . . is determined to a large degree by the decisions we make today." ~ Russ Crosson

Estate Planning is not just planning for death. It also includes building an estate during your lifetime, and then ensuring that the assets in your estate are stewarded in a manner that meets your goals and objectives and passed to your beneficiaries in a thoughtful way.  It allows you the opportunity to preserve and control the purpose and distribution of your wealth during life and at death.

Estate planning is a process, not an event. Over time, many things in your life will change – values, goals, assets, and relationships. In many ways, estate planning is also a high form of family leadership. Guided and assisted by your Ronald Blue & Co. advisor, you can create the strategy for an estate and legacy plan that is designed to empower subsequent generations and reflect your values and principles.



A core service and expertise of our firm, the estate planning process can provide you with many benefits:

A plan to distribute your wealth according to your most important goals, all within the broad context of personal and family needs
Assurance that your beneficiaries will be cared for by the people you choose
A charitable giving strategy and tactics for design, implementation, and administration of the strategy
Tax-efficiency in distributing your assets
A plan that is reviewed and adjusted as beneficiaries, assets, goals, circumstances, tax laws, and legislation change, if desired
Alignment of your legal documents (provided by your attorney) with your goals and wishes to help your family organize and settle your estate

In line with our other services that reflect who we are as a company, we use a biblical perspective in estate planning. Read more about it here.
















Perspective
"You can’t leave character in a trust account.  You can’t write your values into the will.  You can’t book traits like courage, honesty, and compassion in a safe-deposit box.  What we need is a plan – a long-term strategy to convey our convictions to the next generations."

- Tim Kimmel

We believe the primary objective for investors is achieving the goals in their financial plans – because a financial plan is about so much more than just numbers.  At Ronald Blue & Co., managing investments is more about increasing the probability of your meeting your goals, rather than competing against random benchmarks.


As part of your overall financial plan, we start with understanding your personal needs and timeframe: What are the resources with which you’ve been entrusted? How do you want to steward them? Where do you want to go? At what points in the future will you need those resources for where you’re going? These are important questions, because when you arrive at those points in the future, you want to be sure the resources are available to fund those goals. 


We use a disciplined process for making investment decisions: our philosophy is reflected in our proprietary Principled Reasoning® approach and our strategy is reflected in our time-based portfolios – all to help you reach the desired end result: Your vision for the future. 
We are also a firm committed to transparency and finding an investment plan designed to help you meet your goals within the constraints of available resources, income potential, risk tolerance and other factors. Our “open architecture plus” approach to selecting investment solutions takes advantage of both “off the shelf” solutions in the investment marketplace and customized solutions designed for our clients.  And although we exclusively recommend external investment solutions, Ronald Blue & Co. has never accepted commissions from these investment product companies – and never will.
















We believe that investing plays an important role in the overall stewardship process to help you provide for your family, do good works, and be generous.

For nearly 35 years, Ronald Blue & Co. has helped thousands of clients who are seeking to achieve financial peace of mind and meet their financial goals by applying technical expertise and biblical principles. After the 2008 financial crisis, concerns over slow economic growth, fiscal deficits, and unprecedented central bank monetary policy highlighted the need for an investment decision-making process that helps to create financial peace of mind and assists in meeting clients’ financial goals in this new economic environment. As a result, we saw an opportunity to integrate our principles more systematically into our investment process with the goal of building more resilient investment portfolios. This pioneering effort resulted in an investment decision-making framework known as Principled Reasoning®.


Principled Reasoning combines a deep understanding of timeless biblical truths, sound knowledge of economies and investments, rigorous global research, and an in-depth evaluation of risk dynamics. Rooted in six time-tested principles, this framework evaluates the investment landscape based on the economic environment, growth, and valuation factors.




Environment. The Principles of Uncertainty and Instability inform us how to manage risk in various economic environments and reinforce the value of saving.

Growth. The Principles of Human Productivity and Leadership & Governance help us answer the questions of how and where growth will more likely occur.

Valuation. The Principle of Inherent Value helps us analyze the price of various asset types to build a more disciplined approach to portfolio allocation.


Principled Reasoning creates a more confident decision-making environment for investing, as we rely on a set of core principles and an unwavering process with a focus on one primary goal: helping to increase the probability of achieving your goals.
Read the full whitepaper of Principled Reasoning here.
Watch our series of videos on the six principles of Principled Reasoning.























The most important question we ask you when considering investment management as part of your financial plan is: What is the purpose for your wealth and when will you need it?  We believe appropriate investment allocations are best derived from a clear understanding of when the assets will be needed. Matching investments to capital needs – how much money is needed and when – is key to achieving your goals. For example, it is generally not in your best interest to invest in highly volatile assets when you have a short-term need for funds, but it may be appropriate for longer term investing goals.




Depending on the time frame of your cash flow needs, we selectively recommend the following building blocks in constructing investment portfolios:

Stocks to provide growth, because it is the only asset class proven to outpace inflation over time
Bonds to preserve assets and protect against volatility
Hedge assets to provide protection from inflation and currency destabilization


We realize your assets will be used in a variety of ways over time, so we not only think about how to increase returns, but also focus on managing the risks that may hinder you from achieving a minimum acceptable return.

Ronald Blue & Co.’s Investment Policy Committee (IPC), chaired by Deborah Kimery, is a diverse team of senior management and seasoned investment and economic professionals responsible for setting the investment policy for the firm’s clients and monitoring all of the investment strategies for both policy and philosophical adherence.

Together, the IPC and ISG work to construct and implement portfolio strategies designed to increase the probability of success of meeting our clients’ financial planning goals.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for RONA (TSE:RON) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

 What’s your “Why?” 

Every organization has a What, a How, and a Why. Our What is wealth management services. Our How is through experienced financial advisors building relationships and applying tools such as proprietary financial planning software, investment vehicles, and tax planning strategies. But it’s our Why that sets us apart from other wealth management firms. Why is what motivates us to get out of bed in the morning – it’s our reason, cause, and purpose for what we do. 
We are not simply a financial planning, investment management, or estate planning firm. We believe we do all of those things with excellence, but we are essentially a financial peace of mind firm. And we firmly believe that when our clients live with peace of mind about money – without conflict, anxiety, or fear – their lives are richer and more fulfilling. They can envision and act on their Why.
The vision of helping people seek and live their Why was one of the cornerstones on which Ron Blue established the company in 1979. Ron felt challenged and called to help people become better stewards of their money and have a better relationship with money by using not just technical expertise, but biblical wisdom as well. For over 35 years, many of our clients have come to us, and stay with us, because they are attracted to our uncommon approach to wealth management. Read more about how we integrate biblical wisdom into our counsel. 




 
 
We have our own success story – people with a vision and a mission. Learn more about how our founders shaped us into the firm we are today.  
 
























Our executive leadership team includes individuals who have been with the firm since its early days, helping shape Ronald Blue & Co. into the one of the largest fee-only independent wealth management firms in the country.

What constitutes a life well spent? Is it riches or enrichment? Is it your prosperity or the legacy of your posterity? Who measures your life well spent – you, or others in your life? Is there a point where faith and finances intersect in a life well spent?
These questions inform the essence of who we are and what we do.  As one of the largest, fee-only independent wealth management firms in the United States, Ronald Blue & Co. provides comprehensive financial strategies based on biblical wisdom, with one goal: empower our clients to live enriched lives.

Believing that biblical wisdom is the best guide for making wise financial decisions, we strive to help you achieve both the financial goals and the financial peace of mind to live your life well spent.



Our advisors in 13 offices around the country provide a full complement of services – financial planning, investment management, estate and trust planning, tax planning and business services, and philanthropic counsel. From our beginning more than three decades ago, we have built relationships of trust with our clients, speaking to some of the most financially intimate areas of their lives.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

It's amazing what three letters can do.
Adding "Inc." or "LLC" to your business' name is more than a good look. It protects your personal assets, creates tax advantages, and much more.

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
