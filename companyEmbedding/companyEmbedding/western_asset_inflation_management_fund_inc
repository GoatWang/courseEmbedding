Our Philosophy - Portfolio Management





Long-term fundamental value

Markets often misprice securities. Prices deviate from fundamental fair value, but over time, they adjust to reflect inflation, credit quality fundamentals and liquidity conditions. Consistently investing in undervalued securities can deliver superior investment returns.
                    
We can systematically identify mispricings. We believe we can identify and capitalize on markets and securities that are priced below fundamental fair value. We do this through disciplined and rigorous analysis, comparing prices to the fundamental fair values estimated by our macroeconomic and credit research teams around the globe.
                    
                    
Our portfolios emphasize our highest convictions. The greater the difference between our view of fair value and markets' pricing, the bigger the potential value opportunity. The greater the degree of confidence in our view of fundamentals, the greater the emphasis of the strategies in our portfolios.
                    




Multiple diversified strategies

We seek diversified sources of returns. Our objective is to meet or exceed our investors' performance objectives within their tolerances for risk. We seek to diversify investments and add value across interest rate duration, yield curve, sector allocation, security selection, country and currency strategies.  We deploy multiple diversified strategies that benefit in different environments so no one strategy dominates performance, helping to dampen volatility.

Western Asset Inflation Management Fund Inc. Announces Results of Annual Meeting: Shareholders Elect Directors and Vote Against Merger Recommendation Proposal
Stockhouse.com – Western Asset Inflation Management Fund Inc. (NYSE: IMF) announced today the results of the annual meeting of shareholders held on February 28, 2011. Shareholders voted at that meeting to elect Directors of the Fund (Proposal No. 1) and voted against a shareholder proposal recommending a merger of the Fund with an open-end fund (Proposal No. 2).
Jeswald W. Salacuse and Dr. Riordan Roett were elected as Class III Directors of Western Asset Inflation Management Fund Inc. by owners of the Fund’s common stock to hold office until the annual meeting of shareholders in the year 2014 or thereafter when respective successors are duly elected and qualified (Proposal No. 1).
Also considered by shareholders at the annual meeting was an advisory proposal (Proposal No. 2) to merge the Fund with an existing open-end mutual fund, Legg Mason Western Asset Global Inflation Management Fund. Of the 5,138,537 votes cast for Proposal No. 2, 75.44% voted against the proposal and 23.31% voted to approve the proposal.
ISS Proxy Advisory Services, a leading independent proxy voting and corporate governance firm, recommended shareholders vote “against” this proposal as recommended by the Fund’s Board of Directors. In making its recommendation, ISS stated “While approval of the shareholder proposal would eliminate the discount at which the fund’s shares trade, this is not proper justification to convert the fund to an open-end fund. The costs associated with converting the fund, in addition to the potential risks to long-term shareholder value, outweigh the potential benefits of the conversion.” Additionally, ISS noted that “The Fund has experienced success in reducing the discount from net asset value.”
Western Asset Inflation Management Fund Inc. is a non-diversified, closed-end management investment company managed by Legg Mason Partners Fund Advisor, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Legg Mason, Inc., and is sub-advised by Western Asset Management Company, an affiliate of the investment manager.

		What I Should Know 
Before Investing




Fixed-income securities involve interest rate, credit, inflation, and reinvestment risks; and possible loss of principal. As interest rates rise, the value of fixed-income securities falls. Derivatives, such as options and futures, can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses, and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance. Leverage may increase volatility and possibility of loss.  Periods of deflation may adversely affect the Fund's NAV. International investments are subject to special risks, including currency fluctuations and social, economic and political uncertainties, which could increase volatility. Asset-backed, mortgage-backed or mortgage-related securities are subject to prepayment and extension risks.

 Performance 






Performance








IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: The performance shown represents past performance. Past performance is no guarantee of future results and current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Principal value and investment returns will fluctuate, and investors' shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. For performance data including the effects of sales charges, Class A and A2 shares reflect the deduction of a maximum front-end sales charge of 4.25%. Class C1 shares have no initial or contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC), but are subject to a 12b-1 fee. One-year returns for Class C shares reflect a CDSC of 1.0%. Total return figures are based on the NAV per share applied to shareholder subscriptions and redemptions, which may differ from the NAV per share disclosed in Fund shareholder reports. Performance would have been lower if fees had not been waived in various periods.
Different minimums may apply to clients of certain service agents. See the Fund's prospectus for additional information.
An investor cannot invest directly in an index. Unmanaged index returns do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges.


Net Asset Value (NAV): An investment option’s net asset value (“NAV”) per unit or unit price is calculated by dividing the value of its net assets by the total number of units outstanding. 


Effective June 1, 2017, the Fund changed its security pricing methodology to now use the mean value of the bid and ask prices (of underlying fund holdings) to calculate the NAV. Funds may show a one-time increase of the NAV, which is due to this change in pricing methodology.
























Morningstar proprietary ratings are based on risk-adjusted returns and are subject to change every month. The Overall Morningstar Rating is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. A 4- or 5-star rating does not necessarily imply that a fund achieved positive results for the period. For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Share classes have a common portfolio and different expense structures.














**Gross expenses are the Fund's total annual operating expenses for the share class(es) shown.  Net expenses for Class(es) A, C, C1, FI & R reflect contractual fee waivers and/or reimbursements, where these reductions reduce the Fund's gross expenses, which cannot be terminated prior to Dec 31, 2018 without Board consent.  For Class(es) I & IS, there are currently no fee waivers in effect, so gross and net expenses are identical.

 Characteristics 






characteristics












Weighted Average Life (WAL) is the average number of years for which each dollar of unpaid principal on a loan or mortgage remains outstanding. Once calculated, WAL tells how many years it will take to pay half of the outstanding principal. 


Effective duration is a duration calculation for bonds with embedded options. Effective duration takes into account that expected cash flows will fluctuate as interest rates change. Duration measures the sensitivity of price (the value of principal) of a fixed-income investment to a change in interest rates. The higher the duration number, the more sensitive a fixed-income investment will be to interest rate changes.


Credit quality is a measure of a bond issuer's ability to repay interest and principal in a timely manner. The credit ratings shown are based on each portfolio security's rating as provided by Standard and Poor's, Moody's Investors Service and/or Fitch Ratings, Ltd. and typically range from AAA (highest) to D (lowest), or an equivalent and/or similar rating. For this purpose, when two or more of the agencies have assigned differing ratings to a security, the highest rating is used. Securities that are unrated by all three agencies are reflected as such. The credit quality of the investments in the Fund's portfolio does not apply to the stability or safety of the Fund. These ratings are updated monthly and may change over time. Please note, the Fund itself has not been rated by an independent rating agency.

 Holdings 






Holdings








IMPORTANT HOLDINGS INFORMATION: Portfolio holdings are based on total portfolio, and are subject to change at any time. Holdings are provided for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Any negative allocations or allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to unsettled trade activities.
Derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance.

Western Asset Inflation Management Fund Inc. Portfolio Composition As Of December 31, 2013






Business Wire




Feb 6, 2014 8:00 AM EST













 




























































  Western Asset Inflation Management Fund Inc. (NYSE: IMF) announces its portfolio composition as of December 31, 2013.  Investment Objective: The Fund’s primary investment objective is total return. Current income is a secondary objective.      Portfolio Composition*:                 Asset Allocation         Inflation-Linked    79.1%      Investment Grade Corporate Bonds    9.7%      Emerging Market Debt    8.4%      Sovereign Debt Local Currency   3.2%      Sovereign Debt External Currency   2.7%      Corporates External Currency   2.6%      Mortgage-Backed Securities    1.4%      High Yield Corporate Bonds    0.7%      Government    0.1%      Cash & Other Securities    0.6%               Credit Quality Allocation**        AAA   80.4%     AA   0.3%     A   7.7%     BBB   8.9%     BB   1.7%     B   0.4%     CCC   0.2%     Not Rated   0.6%              Average Life (years)   6.4      Effective Duration (years)   5.7      Average Coupon (%)   2.2              Portfolio Statistics:                Inception Date   May 25, 2004      Inception Price   $20.00      Total Assets***   $150,599,492      Net Assets   $125,860,930      Loans****   0.00%      Preferred Shares****   0.00%      Reverse Repos****   16.31%              Market Price    $16.93      NAV    $17.82     (Daily NAV is available on market quotation systems using the symbol XIMFX.)          Distribution Rate           $0.0500 per share      Frequency Monthly       (Declared quarterly, paid monthly)         *   Portfolio holdings and weightings are historical and are presented here for informational purposes only. They are subject to change at any time. Negative allocations and allocations in excess of 100%, if any, are primarily due to the Fund's unsettled trade activity.     **   Credit quality is a measure of a bond issuer's ability to repay interest and principal in a timely manner. The credit ratings shown are based on each portfolio security’s rating as provided by Standard and Poor’s, Moody’s Investors Service and/or Fitch Ratings, Ltd. and typically range from AAA (highest) to D (lowest), or an equivalent and/or similar rating. For this purpose, when two or more of the agencies have assigned differing ratings to a security, the highest rating is used. Securities that are unrated by all three agencies are reflected as such. The credit quality of the investments in the Fund's portfolio does not apply to the stability or safety of the Fund. These ratings are updated monthly and may change over time. Please note, the Fund itself has not been rated by an independent rating agency.     ***   The difference between total assets and net assets, if any, is due primarily to the Fund’s use of borrowings; net assets do not include borrowings. The Fund may employ leverage in the form of loans, preferred stock, reverse repurchase agreements and/or other instruments. When the Fund engages in transactions that have a leveraging effect on the Fund’s portfolio, the value of the Fund will be more volatile and all other risks will tend to be compounded.     ****   Percentages are based on total assets.      Western Asset Inflation Management Fund Inc., a non-diversified closed-end investment management company traded on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “IMF”, is advised by Legg Mason Partners Fund Advisor, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Legg Mason, Inc., and is sub-advised by Western Asset Management Company, an affiliate of the advisor.

What should I know before investing?
Fixed income securities involve interest rate, credit, inflation and reinvestment risks; and possible loss of principal. As interest rates rise, the value of fixed income securities falls. State-specific funds are more vulnerable to unfavorable developments in that particular state and its municipalities than are funds that invest in securities of many states. An investor may be subject to the federal Alternative Minimum Tax, and state and local taxes may apply. Capital gains, if any, are fully taxable. High-yield bonds possess greater price volatility, illiquidity and possibility of default.








IMPORTANT INFORMATION: All investments involve risk, including loss of principal. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please see each product’s web page for specific details regarding investment objective, risks, performance and other important information. Review this information carefully before you make any investment decision.
Carefully consider a fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing. Please view the prospectus or summary prospectus for this and other information. Read it carefully.
FINANCIAL ADVISORS: Please note that not all share classes may be available for sale at your firm. Please call the Legg Mason Sales Desk 1-800-822-5544 or your Legg Mason Sales contact for more information.
An investment in a money market fund is neither insured nor guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although a money market fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.
Diversification does not guarantee a profit or protect against loss.
