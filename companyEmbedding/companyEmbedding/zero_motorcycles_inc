Bypass the Ordinary


The Zero DS combines innovation with passion to deliver the world’s most versatile electric motorcycle. Designed to be agile in the dirt and quick on the street, the Zero DS represents a new kind of freedom.


Blast down a gravel road or a dusty trail. When you’re ready, stealthily pass from the wild to the civilized as you arrive at your destination. The Zero DS is tough when you demand it and distinguished when required. Choose from the Power Tank or Charge Tank accessories to extend your range or take advantage of three times faster charging.




Propelled by the most advanced technology in the industry, the Zero DS is a fully electric motorcycle that can handle any surface you throw at it. Overcoming obstacles and maintaining control is effortless due to its direct-drive powertrain and fully adjustable suspension. Under technical riding conditions, Zero’s revolutionary Z-Force® motor delivers astonishing responsiveness with the twist of your wrist. As with Zero’s entire model line, the Zero DS offers a liberating ownership experience with its maintenance-free powertrain, penny-per-mile “fuel” cost and powerful acceleration.

The Road Ahead


Imagine instant torque and power from a standstill. Imagine smooth acceleration as you throttle out of turns. Then, imagine never needing to stop at a gas station or being burdened with any scheduled powertrain maintenance. Pure. Powerful. Electric…and available now.


Developed to aggressively take on urban environments while encouraging occasional detours to your favorite stretch of twisties, the Zero S integrates revolutionary technology with innovative design and premium equipment. The result is a motorcycle with breathtaking performance, a sophisticated appearance and refined ride characteristics.




Featuring Zero Motorcycles’ Z-Force® motor and power pack, the Zero S pulls hard to speeds above 90 mph and offers a city range of up to 202 miles with the optional Power Tank accessory. Or, take advantage of public charging stations and get back on the road three times faster with the new Charge Tank accessory.


Whether stealthily accelerating onto the highway or through a series of turns, the Zero S is uniquely designed to deliver a thrilling sensation unlike any other on the road today. Are you ready?

	“The Zero S introduced me to a whole new level of smooth.” – Motorcyclist
 
	“Zero offers a glimpse into a future where gasoline engines feel frankly archaic.” – Gizmag

Do Anything. Ride Anywhere.


You’ve never experienced power and freedom like this. All those things you wished you could get away with...they just became possible. It is said, “Absolute power corrupts absolutely.” Just in case you find this to be true, hit the eco-switch...or don’t.


Delivering a nearly instantaneous 78 ft-lb of torque and weighing less than 300 lb, the Zero FX takes any type of riding to bold new levels. Stealthily ride at any hour of the day or night, on a motorcycle that distills riding into its most basic and adrenaline-pumping elements.




Tempting you to ride on any terrain that crosses your path, the Zero FX chassis hails from Zero Motorcycles’ championship-winning off-road heritage and features the most advanced Z-Force® technology yet.


Equipped with a maintenance-free powertrain, belt drive and optional fully modular power pack system, no riding time is wasted and each mile ridden only costs around a penny in electricity.

Model history[edit]
The Zero S began shipping in volume in 2010, the first model year to include the Agni Motor,[1][2] at which time the DS, a dual-sport model based on the S chassis became available. The XU, a smaller street bike with a removable battery, based on the same chassis as the Zero dirtbikes was produced from 2011 to 2013.
In 2012, Zero introduced the ZF9 Power Pack with the Zero S & DS models making them the first production electric motorcycles that can exceed an EPA-estimated 100 miles on a single charge.
In 2013 the Zero S and DS were completely redesigned.[3] The battery capacity was increased to 11.4kWh, and a new brushless permanent magnet AC motor was introduced. In 2013 the Zero FX dual-sport model with modular removable power packs was introduced. CHAdeMO fast charging was also available on 2013 models.[4][5][6]
In 2014 the optional 2.8kWh "Power Tank" became available.[7][8][9] 2014 also saw the addition of the Zero SR to the range, a higher performance version of the Zero S, incorporating more powerful controller electrics and a motor with higher temperature magnets.[10]
The 2015 models had battery pack size increased to 12.5kWh, for a total possible maximum capacity of 15.3kWh including the optional Power Tank. Also introduced in 2015 were standard ABS brakes and Showa suspension. CHAdeMO fast charging was eliminated as an option, leaving instead an optional quick charger accessory at added cost.
In 2016, Zero announced the DSR and FXS models. The DSR is based on the DS, but with the more powerful motor from the SR. The FXS is a supermoto version of the FX. Additional changes for the model year include the availability of a "Charge Tank" accessory, which is an on-board Level 2 charging system compatible with the J1772 plug. Battery pack size improved again to 13.0kWh (3.3kWh per FX power pack), for a total possible maximum capacity of 15.9kWh including the optional Power Tank. The air-cooled motors on the SR, DSR, and FXS were revised to reduce heat produced during high output.[11][12][13][14]
For 2017, all models have the interior-permanent-magnet (IPM) motor. All models also received a larger capacity controller which provides an increase in maximum torque and horsepower output, up to 116 ft/lbs on the SR and DSR models. All models but the S ZF13.0 (Already Installed) receive a wider, high-torque carbon fiber reinforced belt. Other changes for 2017 include a locking tank box and more durable paint on S/DS/SR/DSR models, and the ability for owners to update their bike's firmware through the mobile app.
Zero Motorcycles also produces a line of electric motorcycles for police, authority, and military use.[15] The fleet motorcycles are based upon the company’s standard models but outfitted with equipment such as police lights, sirens, crash bars, and storage accessories.
The company recently published a history on its website to celebrate its 10th anniversary.
Powertrain[edit]
Zero's Lithium-ion power packs and motors were developed in-house, and are branded under the names "Z-Force" and "ZF". The power pack uses a cell configuration that operates at 102 volts. The motorcycles' propulsion is provided by a single electric, air-cooled, brushless, permanent-magnet 3-phase AC motor.[16][17][18] The motor is directly coupled to the rear wheel by a belt or – optionally on the Zero FX – a chain. A controller manages the power delivery and comes in 420-amp, 550-amp, 660-amp, and 775-amp sizes depending on the year and model.
Racing Use[edit]
Zero Motorcycles has had success racing at Pikes Peak. Zero has won the production electric motorcycle class in 2013, 2014, and 2015.[19][20] In 2014 a Zero FX was the first production electric motorcycle to break the 12 minute mark.[21]
In 2012, Brandon Miller set a Bonneville Land Speed Record on a Zero S ZF6 model.[22] He achieved an average speed of 101.652 mph over a one-mile course. This beat the previous record for modified production motorcycles weighing less than 150 kilograms by over 23 mph.
Zero Motorcycles hosted an endurance racing event for electric motorcycles on April 4–5, 2009, called the 24 Hours of Electricross. This event was the largest electric motorcycle race to date.[23] The 10 teams competed on Zero X electric motocross bikes.[24] Team HotChalk set a Guinness world record for the furthest distance traveled on an all-electric off-road motorcycle in 24 hours at just over 500 miles.[25]
Racers have used Zero Motorcycles against gasoline motorcycles in a number of other forms of racing, including flat-track,[26] hare scrambles,[27] supermoto,[28] and supercross.[29]
Competitors[edit]
Zero's main competitor is the Victory Empulse[30][31][32] (formerly Brammo),[33] but current and upcoming models from Lightning, Energica, and Alta Motors will compete with Zero's product lineup as well.[34][35][36] Some of the larger OEMs have also released electric concepts and prototypes such as the Harley-Davidson LiveWire electric concept,[37][38] and Yamaha's PES1 and PED1 (recently updated to the PES2 and PED2 concepts).[39][40]
Criticism[edit]
Zero Motorcycles have the same inherent advantages and disadvantages as most electric vehicles, but in particular have been criticized for lack of range and slow charging capabilities[41][42][43] - which make long-distance touring use difficult compared to their combustion engine counterparts.[44] Detractors also point out a comparatively high price compared to equivalent conventional motorcycles.[45][46]

Do Anything. Ride Anywhere.


You’ve never experienced power and freedom like this. All those things you wished you could get away with...they just became possible. It is said, “Absolute power corrupts absolutely.” Just in case you find this to be true, hit the eco-switch...or don’t.


Delivering a nearly instantaneous 78 ft-lb of torque and weighing less than 300 lb, the Zero FX takes any type of riding to bold new levels. Stealthily ride at any hour of the day or night, on a motorcycle that distills riding into its most basic and adrenaline-pumping elements.




Tempting you to ride on any terrain that crosses your path, the Zero FX chassis hails from Zero Motorcycles’ championship-winning off-road heritage and features the most advanced Z-Force® technology yet.


Equipped with a maintenance-free powertrain, belt drive and optional fully modular power pack system, no riding time is wasted and each mile ridden only costs around a penny in electricity.

Zero Motorcycles Inc. is an American manufacturer of electric motorcycles. Formerly called Electricross, it was started in 2006 by Neal Saiki, a former NASA engineer, in Santa Cruz, California. The company is now located nearby in Scotts Valley.
Zero makes a line of 100% electric motorcycles including the Zero S, SR, and FXS (street), and the Zero DS, DSR, and FX (dual-sport).

Model history[edit]
The Zero S began shipping in volume in 2010, the first model year to include the Agni Motor,[1][2] at which time the DS, a dual-sport model based on the S chassis became available. The XU, a smaller street bike with a removable battery, based on the same chassis as the Zero dirtbikes was produced from 2011 to 2013.
In 2012, Zero introduced the ZF9 Power Pack with the Zero S & DS models making them the first production electric motorcycles that can exceed an EPA-estimated 100 miles on a single charge.
In 2013 the Zero S and DS were completely redesigned.[3] The battery capacity was increased to 11.4kWh, and a new brushless permanent magnet AC motor was introduced. In 2013 the Zero FX dual-sport model with modular removable power packs was introduced. CHAdeMO fast charging was also available on 2013 models.[4][5][6]
In 2014 the optional 2.8kWh "Power Tank" became available.[7][8][9] 2014 also saw the addition of the Zero SR to the range, a higher performance version of the Zero S, incorporating more powerful controller electrics and a motor with higher temperature magnets.[10]
The 2015 models had battery pack size increased to 12.5kWh, for a total possible maximum capacity of 15.3kWh including the optional Power Tank. Also introduced in 2015 were standard ABS brakes and Showa suspension. CHAdeMO fast charging was eliminated as an option, leaving instead an optional quick charger accessory at added cost.
In 2016, Zero announced the DSR and FXS models. The DSR is based on the DS, but with the more powerful motor from the SR. The FXS is a supermoto version of the FX. Additional changes for the model year include the availability of a "Charge Tank" accessory, which is an on-board Level 2 charging system compatible with the J1772 plug. Battery pack size improved again to 13.0kWh (3.3kWh per FX power pack), for a total possible maximum capacity of 15.9kWh including the optional Power Tank. The air-cooled motors on the SR, DSR, and FXS were revised to reduce heat produced during high output.[11][12][13][14]
For 2017, all models have the interior-permanent-magnet (IPM) motor. All models also received a larger capacity controller which provides an increase in maximum torque and horsepower output, up to 116 ft/lbs on the SR and DSR models. All models but the S ZF13.0 (Already Installed) receive a wider, high-torque carbon fiber reinforced belt. Other changes for 2017 include a locking tank box and more durable paint on S/DS/SR/DSR models, and the ability for owners to update their bike's firmware through the mobile app.
Zero Motorcycles also produces a line of electric motorcycles for police, authority, and military use.[15] The fleet motorcycles are based upon the company’s standard models but outfitted with equipment such as police lights, sirens, crash bars, and storage accessories.
The company recently published a history on its website to celebrate its 10th anniversary.
Powertrain[edit]
Zero's Lithium-ion power packs and motors were developed in-house, and are branded under the names "Z-Force" and "ZF". The power pack uses a cell configuration that operates at 102 volts. The motorcycles' propulsion is provided by a single electric, air-cooled, brushless, permanent-magnet 3-phase AC motor.[16][17][18] The motor is directly coupled to the rear wheel by a belt or – optionally on the Zero FX – a chain. A controller manages the power delivery and comes in 420-amp, 550-amp, 660-amp, and 775-amp sizes depending on the year and model.
Racing Use[edit]
Zero Motorcycles has had success racing at Pikes Peak. Zero has won the production electric motorcycle class in 2013, 2014, and 2015.[19][20] In 2014 a Zero FX was the first production electric motorcycle to break the 12 minute mark.[21]
In 2012, Brandon Miller set a Bonneville Land Speed Record on a Zero S ZF6 model.[22] He achieved an average speed of 101.652 mph over a one-mile course. This beat the previous record for modified production motorcycles weighing less than 150 kilograms by over 23 mph.
Zero Motorcycles hosted an endurance racing event for electric motorcycles on April 4–5, 2009, called the 24 Hours of Electricross. This event was the largest electric motorcycle race to date.[23] The 10 teams competed on Zero X electric motocross bikes.[24] Team HotChalk set a Guinness world record for the furthest distance traveled on an all-electric off-road motorcycle in 24 hours at just over 500 miles.[25]
Racers have used Zero Motorcycles against gasoline motorcycles in a number of other forms of racing, including flat-track,[26] hare scrambles,[27] supermoto,[28] and supercross.[29]
Competitors[edit]
Zero's main competitor is the Victory Empulse[30][31][32] (formerly Brammo),[33] but current and upcoming models from Lightning, Energica, and Alta Motors will compete with Zero's product lineup as well.[34][35][36] Some of the larger OEMs have also released electric concepts and prototypes such as the Harley-Davidson LiveWire electric concept,[37][38] and Yamaha's PES1 and PED1 (recently updated to the PES2 and PED2 concepts).[39][40]
Criticism[edit]
Zero Motorcycles have the same inherent advantages and disadvantages as most electric vehicles, but in particular have been criticized for lack of range and slow charging capabilities[41][42][43] - which make long-distance touring use difficult compared to their combustion engine counterparts.[44] Detractors also point out a comparatively high price compared to equivalent conventional motorcycles.[45][46]

Zero Motorcycles Inc. is an American manufacturer of electric motorcycles. Formerly called Electricross, it was started in 2006 by Neal Saiki, a former NASA engineer, in Santa Cruz, California. The company is now located nearby in Scotts Valley.
Zero makes a line of 100% electric motorcycles including the Zero S, SR, and FXS (street), and the Zero DS, DSR, and FX (dual-sport).

Model history[edit]
The Zero S began shipping in volume in 2010, the first model year to include the Agni Motor,[1][2] at which time the DS, a dual-sport model based on the S chassis became available. The XU, a smaller street bike with a removable battery, based on the same chassis as the Zero dirtbikes was produced from 2011 to 2013.
In 2012, Zero introduced the ZF9 Power Pack with the Zero S & DS models making them the first production electric motorcycles that can exceed an EPA-estimated 100 miles on a single charge.
In 2013 the Zero S and DS were completely redesigned.[3] The battery capacity was increased to 11.4kWh, and a new brushless permanent magnet AC motor was introduced. In 2013 the Zero FX dual-sport model with modular removable power packs was introduced. CHAdeMO fast charging was also available on 2013 models.[4][5][6]
In 2014 the optional 2.8kWh "Power Tank" became available.[7][8][9] 2014 also saw the addition of the Zero SR to the range, a higher performance version of the Zero S, incorporating more powerful controller electrics and a motor with higher temperature magnets.[10]
The 2015 models had battery pack size increased to 12.5kWh, for a total possible maximum capacity of 15.3kWh including the optional Power Tank. Also introduced in 2015 were standard ABS brakes and Showa suspension. CHAdeMO fast charging was eliminated as an option, leaving instead an optional quick charger accessory at added cost.
In 2016, Zero announced the DSR and FXS models. The DSR is based on the DS, but with the more powerful motor from the SR. The FXS is a supermoto version of the FX. Additional changes for the model year include the availability of a "Charge Tank" accessory, which is an on-board Level 2 charging system compatible with the J1772 plug. Battery pack size improved again to 13.0kWh (3.3kWh per FX power pack), for a total possible maximum capacity of 15.9kWh including the optional Power Tank. The air-cooled motors on the SR, DSR, and FXS were revised to reduce heat produced during high output.[11][12][13][14]
For 2017, all models have the interior-permanent-magnet (IPM) motor. All models also received a larger capacity controller which provides an increase in maximum torque and horsepower output, up to 116 ft/lbs on the SR and DSR models. All models but the S ZF13.0 (Already Installed) receive a wider, high-torque carbon fiber reinforced belt. Other changes for 2017 include a locking tank box and more durable paint on S/DS/SR/DSR models, and the ability for owners to update their bike's firmware through the mobile app.
Zero Motorcycles also produces a line of electric motorcycles for police, authority, and military use.[15] The fleet motorcycles are based upon the company’s standard models but outfitted with equipment such as police lights, sirens, crash bars, and storage accessories.
The company recently published a history on its website to celebrate its 10th anniversary.
Powertrain[edit]
Zero's Lithium-ion power packs and motors were developed in-house, and are branded under the names "Z-Force" and "ZF". The power pack uses a cell configuration that operates at 102 volts. The motorcycles' propulsion is provided by a single electric, air-cooled, brushless, permanent-magnet 3-phase AC motor.[16][17][18] The motor is directly coupled to the rear wheel by a belt or – optionally on the Zero FX – a chain. A controller manages the power delivery and comes in 420-amp, 550-amp, 660-amp, and 775-amp sizes depending on the year and model.
Racing Use[edit]
Zero Motorcycles has had success racing at Pikes Peak. Zero has won the production electric motorcycle class in 2013, 2014, and 2015.[19][20] In 2014 a Zero FX was the first production electric motorcycle to break the 12 minute mark.[21]
In 2012, Brandon Miller set a Bonneville Land Speed Record on a Zero S ZF6 model.[22] He achieved an average speed of 101.652 mph over a one-mile course. This beat the previous record for modified production motorcycles weighing less than 150 kilograms by over 23 mph.
Zero Motorcycles hosted an endurance racing event for electric motorcycles on April 4–5, 2009, called the 24 Hours of Electricross. This event was the largest electric motorcycle race to date.[23] The 10 teams competed on Zero X electric motocross bikes.[24] Team HotChalk set a Guinness world record for the furthest distance traveled on an all-electric off-road motorcycle in 24 hours at just over 500 miles.[25]
Racers have used Zero Motorcycles against gasoline motorcycles in a number of other forms of racing, including flat-track,[26] hare scrambles,[27] supermoto,[28] and supercross.[29]
Competitors[edit]
Zero's main competitor is the Victory Empulse[30][31][32] (formerly Brammo),[33] but current and upcoming models from Lightning, Energica, and Alta Motors will compete with Zero's product lineup as well.[34][35][36] Some of the larger OEMs have also released electric concepts and prototypes such as the Harley-Davidson LiveWire electric concept,[37][38] and Yamaha's PES1 and PED1 (recently updated to the PES2 and PED2 concepts).[39][40]
Criticism[edit]
Zero Motorcycles have the same inherent advantages and disadvantages as most electric vehicles, but in particular have been criticized for lack of range and slow charging capabilities[41][42][43] - which make long-distance touring use difficult compared to their combustion engine counterparts.[44] Detractors also point out a comparatively high price compared to equivalent conventional motorcycles.[45][46]

Z-Force electric motor and lithium-Ion battery


Zero Motorcycles Inc. is an American manufacturer of electric motorcycles. Formerly called Electricross, it was started in 2006 by Neal Saiki, a former NASA engineer, in Santa Cruz, California. The company is now located nearby in Scotts Valley.
Zero makes a line of 100% electric motorcycles including the Zero S, SR, and FXS (street), and the Zero DS, DSR, and FX (dual-sport).

Model history[edit]
The Zero S began shipping in volume in 2010, the first model year to include the Agni Motor,[1][2] at which time the DS, a dual-sport model based on the S chassis became available. The XU, a smaller street bike with a removable battery, based on the same chassis as the Zero dirtbikes was produced from 2011 to 2013.
In 2012, Zero introduced the ZF9 Power Pack with the Zero S & DS models making them the first production electric motorcycles that can exceed an EPA-estimated 100 miles on a single charge.
In 2013 the Zero S and DS were completely redesigned.[3] The battery capacity was increased to 11.4kWh, and a new brushless permanent magnet AC motor was introduced. In 2013 the Zero FX dual-sport model with modular removable power packs was introduced. CHAdeMO fast charging was also available on 2013 models.[4][5][6]
In 2014 the optional 2.8kWh "Power Tank" became available.[7][8][9] 2014 also saw the addition of the Zero SR to the range, a higher performance version of the Zero S, incorporating more powerful controller electrics and a motor with higher temperature magnets.[10]
The 2015 models had battery pack size increased to 12.5kWh, for a total possible maximum capacity of 15.3kWh including the optional Power Tank. Also introduced in 2015 were standard ABS brakes and Showa suspension. CHAdeMO fast charging was eliminated as an option, leaving instead an optional quick charger accessory at added cost.
In 2016, Zero announced the DSR and FXS models. The DSR is based on the DS, but with the more powerful motor from the SR. The FXS is a supermoto version of the FX. Additional changes for the model year include the availability of a "Charge Tank" accessory, which is an on-board Level 2 charging system compatible with the J1772 plug. Battery pack size improved again to 13.0kWh (3.3kWh per FX power pack), for a total possible maximum capacity of 15.9kWh including the optional Power Tank. The air-cooled motors on the SR, DSR, and FXS were revised to reduce heat produced during high output.[11][12][13][14]
For 2017, all models have the interior-permanent-magnet (IPM) motor. All models also received a larger capacity controller which provides an increase in maximum torque and horsepower output, up to 116 ft/lbs on the SR and DSR models. All models but the S ZF13.0 (Already Installed) receive a wider, high-torque carbon fiber reinforced belt. Other changes for 2017 include a locking tank box and more durable paint on S/DS/SR/DSR models, and the ability for owners to update their bike's firmware through the mobile app.
Zero Motorcycles also produces a line of electric motorcycles for police, authority, and military use.[15] The fleet motorcycles are based upon the company’s standard models but outfitted with equipment such as police lights, sirens, crash bars, and storage accessories.
The company recently published a history on its website to celebrate its 10th anniversary.
Powertrain[edit]
Zero's Lithium-ion power packs and motors were developed in-house, and are branded under the names "Z-Force" and "ZF". The power pack uses a cell configuration that operates at 102 volts. The motorcycles' propulsion is provided by a single electric, air-cooled, brushless, permanent-magnet 3-phase AC motor.[16][17][18] The motor is directly coupled to the rear wheel by a belt or – optionally on the Zero FX – a chain. A controller manages the power delivery and comes in 420-amp, 550-amp, 660-amp, and 775-amp sizes depending on the year and model.
Racing Use[edit]
Zero Motorcycles has had success racing at Pikes Peak. Zero has won the production electric motorcycle class in 2013, 2014, and 2015.[19][20] In 2014 a Zero FX was the first production electric motorcycle to break the 12 minute mark.[21]
In 2012, Brandon Miller set a Bonneville Land Speed Record on a Zero S ZF6 model.[22] He achieved an average speed of 101.652 mph over a one-mile course. This beat the previous record for modified production motorcycles weighing less than 150 kilograms by over 23 mph.
Zero Motorcycles hosted an endurance racing event for electric motorcycles on April 4–5, 2009, called the 24 Hours of Electricross. This event was the largest electric motorcycle race to date.[23] The 10 teams competed on Zero X electric motocross bikes.[24] Team HotChalk set a Guinness world record for the furthest distance traveled on an all-electric off-road motorcycle in 24 hours at just over 500 miles.[25]
Racers have used Zero Motorcycles against gasoline motorcycles in a number of other forms of racing, including flat-track,[26] hare scrambles,[27] supermoto,[28] and supercross.[29]
Competitors[edit]
Zero's main competitor is the Victory Empulse[30][31][32] (formerly Brammo),[33] but current and upcoming models from Lightning, Energica, and Alta Motors will compete with Zero's product lineup as well.[34][35][36] Some of the larger OEMs have also released electric concepts and prototypes such as the Harley-Davidson LiveWire electric concept,[37][38] and Yamaha's PES1 and PED1 (recently updated to the PES2 and PED2 concepts).[39][40]
Criticism[edit]
Zero Motorcycles have the same inherent advantages and disadvantages as most electric vehicles, but in particular have been criticized for lack of range and slow charging capabilities[41][42][43] - which make long-distance touring use difficult compared to their combustion engine counterparts.[44] Detractors also point out a comparatively high price compared to equivalent conventional motorcycles.[45][46]

Massive torque. More power.Greater acceleration.


Massive torque. Stunning acceleration. Instantaneous response. The Zero SR amps-up performance with a higher output (775 amp) controller and high temperature motor magnets. The result is a stunning 116 ft-lb of torque, more than any 1,000cc sport bike. With arm-stretching acceleration and higher sustained top speeds, the Zero SR leaves gas-powered competition in the dust.

Model history[edit]
The Zero S began shipping in volume in 2010, the first model year to include the Agni Motor,[1][2] at which time the DS, a dual-sport model based on the S chassis became available. The XU, a smaller street bike with a removable battery, based on the same chassis as the Zero dirtbikes was produced from 2011 to 2013.
In 2012, Zero introduced the ZF9 Power Pack with the Zero S & DS models making them the first production electric motorcycles that can exceed an EPA-estimated 100 miles on a single charge.
In 2013 the Zero S and DS were completely redesigned.[3] The battery capacity was increased to 11.4kWh, and a new brushless permanent magnet AC motor was introduced. In 2013 the Zero FX dual-sport model with modular removable power packs was introduced. CHAdeMO fast charging was also available on 2013 models.[4][5][6]
In 2014 the optional 2.8kWh "Power Tank" became available.[7][8][9] 2014 also saw the addition of the Zero SR to the range, a higher performance version of the Zero S, incorporating more powerful controller electrics and a motor with higher temperature magnets.[10]
The 2015 models had battery pack size increased to 12.5kWh, for a total possible maximum capacity of 15.3kWh including the optional Power Tank. Also introduced in 2015 were standard ABS brakes and Showa suspension. CHAdeMO fast charging was eliminated as an option, leaving instead an optional quick charger accessory at added cost.
In 2016, Zero announced the DSR and FXS models. The DSR is based on the DS, but with the more powerful motor from the SR. The FXS is a supermoto version of the FX. Additional changes for the model year include the availability of a "Charge Tank" accessory, which is an on-board Level 2 charging system compatible with the J1772 plug. Battery pack size improved again to 13.0kWh (3.3kWh per FX power pack), for a total possible maximum capacity of 15.9kWh including the optional Power Tank. The air-cooled motors on the SR, DSR, and FXS were revised to reduce heat produced during high output.[11][12][13][14]
For 2017, all models have the interior-permanent-magnet (IPM) motor. All models also received a larger capacity controller which provides an increase in maximum torque and horsepower output, up to 116 ft/lbs on the SR and DSR models. All models but the S ZF13.0 (Already Installed) receive a wider, high-torque carbon fiber reinforced belt. Other changes for 2017 include a locking tank box and more durable paint on S/DS/SR/DSR models, and the ability for owners to update their bike's firmware through the mobile app.
Zero Motorcycles also produces a line of electric motorcycles for police, authority, and military use.[15] The fleet motorcycles are based upon the company’s standard models but outfitted with equipment such as police lights, sirens, crash bars, and storage accessories.
The company recently published a history on its website to celebrate its 10th anniversary.
Powertrain[edit]
Zero's Lithium-ion power packs and motors were developed in-house, and are branded under the names "Z-Force" and "ZF". The power pack uses a cell configuration that operates at 102 volts. The motorcycles' propulsion is provided by a single electric, air-cooled, brushless, permanent-magnet 3-phase AC motor.[16][17][18] The motor is directly coupled to the rear wheel by a belt or – optionally on the Zero FX – a chain. A controller manages the power delivery and comes in 420-amp, 550-amp, 660-amp, and 775-amp sizes depending on the year and model.
Racing Use[edit]
Zero Motorcycles has had success racing at Pikes Peak. Zero has won the production electric motorcycle class in 2013, 2014, and 2015.[19][20] In 2014 a Zero FX was the first production electric motorcycle to break the 12 minute mark.[21]
In 2012, Brandon Miller set a Bonneville Land Speed Record on a Zero S ZF6 model.[22] He achieved an average speed of 101.652 mph over a one-mile course. This beat the previous record for modified production motorcycles weighing less than 150 kilograms by over 23 mph.
Zero Motorcycles hosted an endurance racing event for electric motorcycles on April 4–5, 2009, called the 24 Hours of Electricross. This event was the largest electric motorcycle race to date.[23] The 10 teams competed on Zero X electric motocross bikes.[24] Team HotChalk set a Guinness world record for the furthest distance traveled on an all-electric off-road motorcycle in 24 hours at just over 500 miles.[25]
Racers have used Zero Motorcycles against gasoline motorcycles in a number of other forms of racing, including flat-track,[26] hare scrambles,[27] supermoto,[28] and supercross.[29]
Competitors[edit]
Zero's main competitor is the Victory Empulse[30][31][32] (formerly Brammo),[33] but current and upcoming models from Lightning, Energica, and Alta Motors will compete with Zero's product lineup as well.[34][35][36] Some of the larger OEMs have also released electric concepts and prototypes such as the Harley-Davidson LiveWire electric concept,[37][38] and Yamaha's PES1 and PED1 (recently updated to the PES2 and PED2 concepts).[39][40]
Criticism[edit]
Zero Motorcycles have the same inherent advantages and disadvantages as most electric vehicles, but in particular have been criticized for lack of range and slow charging capabilities[41][42][43] - which make long-distance touring use difficult compared to their combustion engine counterparts.[44] Detractors also point out a comparatively high price compared to equivalent conventional motorcycles.[45][46]

Bypass the Ordinary


The Zero DS combines innovation with passion to deliver the world’s most versatile electric motorcycle. Designed to be agile in the dirt and quick on the street, the Zero DS represents a new kind of freedom.


Blast down a gravel road or a dusty trail. When you’re ready, stealthily pass from the wild to the civilized as you arrive at your destination. The Zero DS is tough when you demand it and distinguished when required. Choose from the Power Tank or Charge Tank accessories to extend your range or take advantage of three times faster charging.




Propelled by the most advanced technology in the industry, the Zero DS is a fully electric motorcycle that can handle any surface you throw at it. Overcoming obstacles and maintaining control is effortless due to its direct-drive powertrain and fully adjustable suspension. Under technical riding conditions, Zero’s revolutionary Z-Force® motor delivers astonishing responsiveness with the twist of your wrist. As with Zero’s entire model line, the Zero DS offers a liberating ownership experience with its maintenance-free powertrain, penny-per-mile “fuel” cost and powerful acceleration.

Massive torque. More power.Greater acceleration.


Massive torque. Stunning acceleration. Instantaneous response. The Zero SR amps-up performance with a higher output (775 amp) controller and high temperature motor magnets. The result is a stunning 116 ft-lb of torque, more than any 1,000cc sport bike. With arm-stretching acceleration and higher sustained top speeds, the Zero SR leaves gas-powered competition in the dust.

Powerful versatility116 ft-lb of torque


The Zero DSR is an amped-up version of the Zero DS, bringing unprecedented levels of power and torque to the world’s most versatile electric motorcycle. For the dual sport rider demanding more, the Zero DSR delivers 43% more torque and 17% more power. A 775 amp controller is paired with a Z-Force® motor that contains higher temperature magnets to ensure better performance during extended durations at higher speeds. The result is exhilarating acceleration and even greater prowess off-road.




With 116 ft-lb of torque on demand, the Zero DSR may be civilized but is by no means subdued. With custom-tuned Showa suspension and Bosch ABS, it is equally at home on pavement and dirt. The Zero DSR is more than ready for maximum adventure…whether it’s in the city or places beyond.

Government Auctions Grow Up
In the mood for a  bargain? Check out the action on auction sites specializing in government  surplus property. There are things here you'll never see on eBay. 
            By  Karen Schwartz 

            December 22,  2003

  In  the market for a nearly new power boat? How about 20 acres in New Mexico or a Rolex wristwatch? Or perhaps  you're interested in 10 cartons of Chinese medicinal sliced orchid stems or a  slightly used strip club in Baltimore.  All of these items, and thousands more, are available for purchase at a growing  number of Web-based auction sites specializing in government surplus, seized,  abandoned, and forfeited products and property. 
            Government auctions of the "Going, Going,  Gone" variety have been around for years, and many still flourish. But the  growing use of the Internet as an auction medium, combined with general  dissatisfaction at the travel, expense, and effort involved in staging and  attending land-based auctions, has led to the growth of the government  Web-auction model. 
 Government agencies of all types, from the U.S.  Treasury and U.S.  Marshals Service to individual counties, have come to rely on private  government auction sites as an efficient way to dispose of billions of dollars  of equipment and property quickly, with higher returns than they could realize  by selling on their own. Numerous entrepreneurs are happy to oblige while  grabbing a piece of the lucrative business--a business that yields returns 25%  to 200% higher than traditional auction methods, according to Bill Angrick, CEO  of Government Liquidation LLC, a subsidiary of Liquidity Services Inc. And  buyers, both individual buyers and small businesses, see Internet-based  government auctions as a great way to get bargain-basement prices on a variety  of new and used items. 
            Not only is there a steady stream of products to  sell via Internet auction, but entrepreneurs need very little in the way of  startup costs and expertise. "Anyone with common sense and some form of  capitalization can get into this," says Louis Columbus, a senior analyst  at AMR Research Inc. 
To succeed when competing against dozens or  hundreds of similar sites, however, expertise in dealing with the government,  as well as state-of-the-art technology and a unique business model, play key  roles, some say. 
            Few Web-based government auction houses run  bare-bones operations, similar to eBay, that simply bring buyers and sellers  together. Those that succeed must have a more robust model of some sort,  something that appeals to both buyer and seller. GovLiquidation.com, for  example, handles the entire asset sale process for its government  customers--everything from warehousing and logistics, customer service, and  buyer transportation to funds collection, documentation handling, and enforcing  unique terms and conditions. Because of its high-touch business model, the site  charges a 20%-to-50% commission using a consignment model, depending on  services rendered. Angrick considers his site to be a success, noting that  auctions have seen as many as 46,000 bids from 1,700 individual bidders in a  48-hour period. 
 Bid4Assets Inc., a Silver Spring, Md., government-auction  house, uses the eBay model, never taking ownership of property. Customers visit  Bid4Assets.com to gather information about products and properties. But unlike  eBay, the site works like a live auctioneer. "The hammer doesn't come down  until the bidding stops," says CEO Richard Hayman. Bid4Assets also  provides some value-added services, such as product promotion and customer  service for both buyers and sellers, and works on commission. 
 GovernmentAuctions.org, a subsidiary of Cyweb  Holdings Inc., employs yet another business model. The site acts as a  clearinghouse for local, state, and federal auctions. Customers pay $39.95 per  year to access the listings, which currently consist of about 1,600 live and  online government auctions. Once they find items they want, they visit the  individual auction sites to carry out the bid process, explains president Ian  Aronovich. 
 Another differentiating factor for these sites  is the technology, which, while it may seem simple, can be quite sophisticated.  GovernmentAuctions.org, for example, developed a homegrown system based on  Active Server Pages, a Microsoft SQL 2000 database, some JavaScript, and  VeriSign Inc.'s SSL encryption. The site is managed partly by an outside source  and partly internally. GovLiquidation.com also developed its platform in-house  at a cost of $5 million to ensure complete control. The site consists of  several applications used to receive, manage, sell, track, and audit its  clients' inventory and users while stressing security. The system mines about  25 million records daily, Angrick says.
Caveat Emptor
            Russ Fritz, a small-business man in Jacksonville,   Fla., has had good luck buying  from government auction sites. Fritz, president of Omega Enterprises, a vehicle  remarketer, procures many of his vehicles from sites like these. 
  "You can get some great deals if you know  what you're doing," he says. "I bought a lot of 2,000 ammunition cans  for 15 cents per can and sold them for $4 per can. So for a $300 investment,  plus time and shipping, I made $8,000." He was able to salvage another  recent purchase, a truck with a blown motor he bought for $104, by installing  another engine. "It ran fine, and I got a deal," he says. 






Surplus Finds

Here's a list of some government-surplus auction sites 

                        ·  GovLiquidation.com

                        ·  GovernmentAuctions.org

                        ·  Esurplus.com

                        ·  PoliceAuctions.com









Fritz is site-agnostic, preferring instead to  follow the deals. In addition to visiting GovernmentAuctions.org, he has  purchased equipment from sites like E.surplus.com, and PoliceAuctions.com,  handled by Vortal Group Inc. 
            Although government auction sites can yield good  deals, it helps to have had experience in the auction world, says Mike  Bagherian, president of Tazz Construction Inc., a small business in Rockville, Md. 
  "You have to be somewhat of a gambler, and  you have to be liquid," he says. "There are times when I sweat it a  little." 
            But Bagherian says nerves of steel can pay off.  Not only has he bought tools for his business at 70% less than he would have  paid at a local hardware store, but he has even ventured out to buy items for  himself. He procured his latest purchase, a late-model Mercedes with about  7,000 miles, for about 40% less than he would have paid at a dealership. 
            There are even times, he says, when the  unexpected can occur. A recent purchase of 80 acres in Mexico yielded  a call from behemoth Conoco Oil, requesting permission to drill for oil on the  property. The company offered Bagherian a paltry $5,000, a price he turned  down, at least for now. 
In many cases, experience with the auction process can really pay off.  Bagherian recently was tempted to buy a property in Jackson City, Miss., with a  new warehouse for less than $100,000--a great deal, on the surface. "But I  started calling around, and I found unpaid back taxes and toxic soil in the  area. I also found that four other people had looked at the property and  rejected it," he says. In the end, Bagherian took a pass, but checked back  with the site and learned that someone had purchased it soon afterward. 
 
Happy Bidding!

Zero Motorcycles Inc. is an American manufacturer of electric motorcycles. Formerly called Electricross, it was started in 2006 by Neal Saiki, a former NASA engineer, in Santa Cruz, California. The company is now located nearby in Scotts Valley.
Zero makes a line of 100% electric motorcycles including the Zero S, SR, and FXS (street), and the Zero DS, DSR, and FX (dual-sport).

Model history[edit]
The Zero S began shipping in volume in 2010, the first model year to include the Agni Motor,[1][2] at which time the DS, a dual-sport model based on the S chassis became available. The XU, a smaller street bike with a removable battery, based on the same chassis as the Zero dirtbikes was produced from 2011 to 2013.
In 2012, Zero introduced the ZF9 Power Pack with the Zero S & DS models making them the first production electric motorcycles that can exceed an EPA-estimated 100 miles on a single charge.
In 2013 the Zero S and DS were completely redesigned.[3] The battery capacity was increased to 11.4kWh, and a new brushless permanent magnet AC motor was introduced. In 2013 the Zero FX dual-sport model with modular removable power packs was introduced. CHAdeMO fast charging was also available on 2013 models.[4][5][6]
In 2014 the optional 2.8kWh "Power Tank" became available.[7][8][9] 2014 also saw the addition of the Zero SR to the range, a higher performance version of the Zero S, incorporating more powerful controller electrics and a motor with higher temperature magnets.[10]
The 2015 models had battery pack size increased to 12.5kWh, for a total possible maximum capacity of 15.3kWh including the optional Power Tank. Also introduced in 2015 were standard ABS brakes and Showa suspension. CHAdeMO fast charging was eliminated as an option, leaving instead an optional quick charger accessory at added cost.
In 2016, Zero announced the DSR and FXS models. The DSR is based on the DS, but with the more powerful motor from the SR. The FXS is a supermoto version of the FX. Additional changes for the model year include the availability of a "Charge Tank" accessory, which is an on-board Level 2 charging system compatible with the J1772 plug. Battery pack size improved again to 13.0kWh (3.3kWh per FX power pack), for a total possible maximum capacity of 15.9kWh including the optional Power Tank. The air-cooled motors on the SR, DSR, and FXS were revised to reduce heat produced during high output.[11][12][13][14]
For 2017, all models have the interior-permanent-magnet (IPM) motor. All models also received a larger capacity controller which provides an increase in maximum torque and horsepower output, up to 116 ft/lbs on the SR and DSR models. All models but the S ZF13.0 (Already Installed) receive a wider, high-torque carbon fiber reinforced belt. Other changes for 2017 include a locking tank box and more durable paint on S/DS/SR/DSR models, and the ability for owners to update their bike's firmware through the mobile app.
Zero Motorcycles also produces a line of electric motorcycles for police, authority, and military use.[15] The fleet motorcycles are based upon the company’s standard models but outfitted with equipment such as police lights, sirens, crash bars, and storage accessories.
The company recently published a history on its website to celebrate its 10th anniversary.
Powertrain[edit]
Zero's Lithium-ion power packs and motors were developed in-house, and are branded under the names "Z-Force" and "ZF". The power pack uses a cell configuration that operates at 102 volts. The motorcycles' propulsion is provided by a single electric, air-cooled, brushless, permanent-magnet 3-phase AC motor.[16][17][18] The motor is directly coupled to the rear wheel by a belt or – optionally on the Zero FX – a chain. A controller manages the power delivery and comes in 420-amp, 550-amp, 660-amp, and 775-amp sizes depending on the year and model.
Racing Use[edit]
Zero Motorcycles has had success racing at Pikes Peak. Zero has won the production electric motorcycle class in 2013, 2014, and 2015.[19][20] In 2014 a Zero FX was the first production electric motorcycle to break the 12 minute mark.[21]
In 2012, Brandon Miller set a Bonneville Land Speed Record on a Zero S ZF6 model.[22] He achieved an average speed of 101.652 mph over a one-mile course. This beat the previous record for modified production motorcycles weighing less than 150 kilograms by over 23 mph.
Zero Motorcycles hosted an endurance racing event for electric motorcycles on April 4–5, 2009, called the 24 Hours of Electricross. This event was the largest electric motorcycle race to date.[23] The 10 teams competed on Zero X electric motocross bikes.[24] Team HotChalk set a Guinness world record for the furthest distance traveled on an all-electric off-road motorcycle in 24 hours at just over 500 miles.[25]
Racers have used Zero Motorcycles against gasoline motorcycles in a number of other forms of racing, including flat-track,[26] hare scrambles,[27] supermoto,[28] and supercross.[29]
Competitors[edit]
Zero's main competitor is the Victory Empulse[30][31][32] (formerly Brammo),[33] but current and upcoming models from Lightning, Energica, and Alta Motors will compete with Zero's product lineup as well.[34][35][36] Some of the larger OEMs have also released electric concepts and prototypes such as the Harley-Davidson LiveWire electric concept,[37][38] and Yamaha's PES1 and PED1 (recently updated to the PES2 and PED2 concepts).[39][40]
Criticism[edit]
Zero Motorcycles have the same inherent advantages and disadvantages as most electric vehicles, but in particular have been criticized for lack of range and slow charging capabilities[41][42][43] - which make long-distance touring use difficult compared to their combustion engine counterparts.[44] Detractors also point out a comparatively high price compared to equivalent conventional motorcycles.[45][46]

GOVERNMENT 
                    SEIZED VEHICLES
The 
                    United States incarcerated 2,166,260 persons over the past twelve 
                    months. This total represents persons held in: 

• Federal 
                      and State Prisons 1,361,258
• Territorial 
                      Prisons 16,206

In 
                        a great number of these cases, vehicles and other property were seized 
                        by the US Government and are being dispensed to the public through 
                        Sheriff Auctions. The US Government does not have the facilities 
                    to store, maintain, upkeep, or use the vehicles and other property 
                    seized from convicted felons, so by law it must dispose of the vehicles 
                    and property at public auction, with buyers sometimes paying as little

2012 Zero Motorcycles Inc. Zero S ZF6 Options, Equipment, and Prices



 
Select 2012 Zero Motorcycles Inc. Zero S ZF6 Options




            A new product for 2012, the Zero S is a two-wheeled vehicle created to push performance limits of electric power. For 2012, the street-oriented Zero S touts itself as the first mass-produced electric motorcycle capable traveling 100 miles on a single charge. A new brushless electric motor and revised Z-Force power packs are credited for making the 2012 Zero S a better performer. Able to travel up to 114 miles under city riding conditions, the ZF9 model of the 2012 Zero S is fitted with a 9.0-kilowatt hour lithium-ion power pack. The 2012 Zero S ZF6 version with a shorter-range 6.0-kilowatt hour power pack is also available for a lower price. Maximum range for the 2012 Zero in the ZF6 configuration is 76 miles. Top speed of the 2012 Zero S motorcycle is rated at 88 miles per hour. Riding on 17-inch wheels, the 2012 Zero S electric motorcycle’s suspension and full disc braking is in place to insure street travel remains fun as well as safe.
