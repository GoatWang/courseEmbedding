 A LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN
[PHOTO]                                                                         

Dear Client:                                                                    

What a difference six months can make. At the end of 1994, we reported
that both stocks and bonds declined in value for the year -- a somewhat rare    
phenomenon. Now I'm pleased to say that for the first six months of 1995,       
the story is reversed -- in general, stocks and bonds generated strong          
returns. In each case, specific economic and financial developments             
triggered changes in investor psychology and sharp upward swings in the         
financial markets. The only underachievers were cash and money market           
investments.                                                                    

Bolstered by declining interest rates, moderate inflation, and slower 
economic growth, bonds posted double-digit returns in the first half of         
1995, more than recovering from the declines of 1994.                           

Lower interest rates and relatively low inflation also had a positive   
effect on stocks. The attractiveness of stocks was further enhanced by          
strong corporate earnings, a weak U.S. dollar, and continued efforts by         
corporate America to improve productivity and efficiency. These factors sparked 
continued stock buying by individuals through equity mutual funds. In the first 
six months of the year ending June 30, 1995, the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock    
Index (S&P 500), an unmanaged index of common stocks, rose more than 20%.       

The steep rise in the stock and bond markets this year demonstrates   
the value of taking a long-term approach to investing and of not reacting to    
short-term market activity. Many investors who abandoned their long-term        
investments in 1994 and early 1995 lost money, because they sold at market      
lows. However, those who stuck with their investments during last year's        
rough periods were rewarded in 1995.                                            

It would be unrealistic to think that the financial markets will      
continue to rise without some adjustment. No one knows when the markets may     
stage a correction. But as we have stressed so often, we urge you to            
recognize that market fluctuations are a normal part of the investment          
cycle. We encourage you to take a long-term perspective when making             
investment decisions, to diversify your investments, and to review them         
periodically to make sure they are in line with your objectives and             
financial goals.                                                                

At Allmerica the investment philosophy of our managers remains intact 
during market advances and declines. Our investment decisions are based on      
long-term economic and business fundamentals. We seek securities that are       
attractively priced and that have the potential to provide investors with       
solid returns over the long-term.                                               

On Behalf of the Board of Directors,                                            

/s/ John F. O'Brien

The five year performance figures above assume the subaccounts existence     
prior to the product's inception.  The performance figures shown do not      
reflect the cost of insurance because the cost can vary with an insured's age
and health, among other factors.  An example showing the percentage of a     
premium that cost of insurance can represent is included next to the         
performance chart.                                                           

Performance numbers in this report are historic and are not indicative of    
future results. The investment return and principal value of an              
investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may   
be worth more or less than their original cost.

OVERVIEW 

1990-1991: Economic recession                                                   
in the United States. A deep depression                                         
affects much of the former Soviet bloc                                          
countries.                                                                      

1992: U.S. economy continues its                                                
slow recovery. Larger companies                                                 
downsize while smaller firms thrive.                                            

1993: A year of low regional interest                                           
rates and strong growth in the emerging                                         
markets.                                                                        

1994: Federal Reserve Board raises                                              
interest rates six times stalling equity                                        
markets.                                                                        

  The U.S. equity markets posted a strong advance during the first half of
1995. Investors reacted positively to preliminary economic and inflationary     
news which indicated that the Federal Reserve Board's series of interest rate   
hikes had slowed the economy and subdued inflationary pressures. In addition    
to the favorable economic reports, the U.S. equity markets were bolstered by    
the strong first quarter corporate earnings reports, large cash inflows from    
both retail and institutional investors, and a rally in the fixed income        
markets. U.S. investors were rewarded as the leading U.S. markets set record    
highs during the six-month period, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average        
crossing the 4600 level, and the S&P 500 Index, an unmanaged index of common    
stocks, gaining more than 20% over the six-month period ending June 30, 1995.   
The tremendous bull market was fueled largely by technology stocks, with the    
semiconductor sector producing extraordinary gains as the demand for PCs and    
the Pentium chip drove industry and individual company earnings. The            
financial sector, especially bank stocks, also contributed to the strong        
market advance, as these stocks benefited from lower interest rates and the     
trend towards consolidation.                                                    

The international markets, in aggregate, turned in only modest        
performance during the first half of the year. The Morgan Stanley Capital       
Index of European, Australian and Far East stocks

(MSCI EAFE) gained 2.76% for the six-month period. Japan's economic woes were   
largely responsible for the sluggish results. Trade tensions with the United    
States, the ineffectiveness of the Japanese government in dealing with the      
banking crisis, and forecasts for slow economic growth kept the Japanese market 
depressed. The Morgan Stanley Capital Index of Japan (MSCI Japan) LOST 8.2%     
from December 31, 1994 to June 30, 1995. The decrease in the value of the       
dollar versus the yen was also detrimental to Japan's market because as the     
value of the dollar declines, U.S. products and services gain a price           
advantage over foreign competition.                                             

  International equity mutual funds slightly outpaced the MSCI EAFE Index,
with a 2.90% return over the six-month period, as reported by Morningstar.      
Investment portfolios with a heavy European focus fared well, while funds       
with a large emphasis in Japan and Latin America struggled. Mexico has still    
not recovered from the devastation it experienced in the latter part of 1994    
and early 1995. However, investors are once again starting to return to         
Mexico as economic indicators signal some success in dealing with the           
financial crisis.                                                               

Ahead may be more volatile times in the international arena, as a     
slowdown in the U.S. markets could have negative effects throughout the         
foreign markets.

Many foreign stock markets got off to a weak start in 1995. During the
first quarter, foreign stock prices fluctuated as concerns about inflation,     
interest rates, and political instability dominated market sentiment. At the    
end of March, the German Bundesbank lowered interest rates and France,          
Switzerland, and the Netherlands followed. Lower interest rates led to market   
rallies in many countries during the second quarter. The strong growth of the   
U.S. stock market combined with a weak dollar also had a positive effect on     
many countries, particularly those in the Far East (excluding Japan) whose      
currencies are linked to the U.S. dollar. Due to Bank of Ireland's view that    
the dollar is undervalued, a conservative strategy has been implemented.        

For the six-month period ending June 30, 1995, the Portfolio          
significantly outperformed the Morgan Stanley EAFE Index. Interest rate         
declines benefited a number of stocks in the Portfolio, particularly those of   
finance companies sensitive to interest rate moves. Impressive earnings         
reported by pharmaceutical companies led management to refocus on this          
sector. As investors purchased pharmaceutical stocks, cyclical stocks became    
less attractive. While the cyclical stocks in the Portfolio underperformed,     
they maintained their strong economic fundamentals, therefore, the              
Portfolio's management intends to keep them in the Portfolio.                   

  Most Continental European markets rallied during the second quarter. The
market in the United Kingdom was strong due to better-than-expected corporate   
earnings and a rise in takeover activity. Of the major European markets,        
France provided the poorest return. This was attributed to the government's     
efforts to combat high unemployment and an escalating budget deficit.           

The weakness in the Pacific Rim markets continued into early 1995.    
However, once fears about the Mexican economic crisis subsided and U.S.         
interest rates declined, most Pacific Rim markets rebounded. Portfolio          
management's strategy in the Pacific Rim emphasized consumer stocks, which      
generated strong gains during the period.                                       

Several factors contributed to a decline in Japanese stocks: the Kobe 
earthquake, appreciation of the yen and negative reaction to the Government's   
stimulus package. Fortunately, the Portfolio had a small position in Japanese   
stocks.                                                                         

Going forward, the Portfolio's management will continue to emphasize  
stocks of medium and large international companies whose potential for strong   
earnings is reflected in their market valuations.

DELAWARE INTERNATIONAL EQUITY SERIES 

During the first six months of 1995, international equity markets were
quite volatile. Earlier in the year, problems caused by the devaluation of      
the Mexican peso prompted South American stocks and emerging markets in         
general to stumble. The International Equity Series Portfolio had little        
exposure to these regions, with only small positions in Indonesia and the       
Philippines.                                                                    

Delaware International continues to believe that the Japanese equity  
market offers little growth potential relative to investment opportunities      
found elsewhere in the world. Although the Portfolio's management continues     
to invest in Japanese securities, the Portfolio holds less Japanese             
investments, as a percentage of assets, than its benchmark, the Morgan Stanley  
EAFE Index. Going forward, the Portfolio will continue to focus on export       
companies that are positioned to benefit from the expected fall of the yen.     
The Portfolio will also focus on small and mid-sized Japanese companies that    
offer good value.                                                               

Over the last six months, the Portfolio's underweighted position in   
Japan, a limited exposure to emerging markets, and the continued emphasis on    
the core world markets helped boost returns. The Portfolio outpaced the EAFE    
Index in spite of its risk-averse nature. The Portfolio's management will       
continue to implement its strict disciplines to help reduce volatility,         
preserve purchasing power and deliver competitive returns. Delaware             
International will: 1) focus on income, as income can be just as important to   
equity investments as it is to fixed income investments; 2) perform inflation   
analysis to help preserve purchasing power; 3) address the effect of currency   
fluctuations, as changes in currency can add or subtract substantially from     
investment returns and 4) apply consistent disciplines across markets by        
comparing U.S. dollar inflation-adjusted values for each security under         
consideration.

FIDELITY'S VIPF OVERSEAS PORTFOLIO 

 During the first six months of 1995, Fidelity's VIPF Overseas Portfolio
performance topped that of the Morgan Stanley EAFE Index. The keys to its       
positive performance were selected investments in Japan and Europe. In          
addition, the Portfolio benefited from new investments in emerging markets.     

 While European markets have fared relatively well, emerging markets and
Japan have not. Japan was affected by a number of factors including the         
Barings debacle, the Kobe earthquake and the subway gas attack. The Japanese    
market also was hurt by the strength of the yen versus the dollar. On the       
heels of Mexico's devaluation of the peso in late 1994, emerging markets also   
struggled, although Mexican stocks look like they have "bottomed out" and are   
on the rebound.                                                                 

 The Portfolio is underweighted in Japanese investments, relative to the
EAFE Index, with much of the Japanese emphasis in technology stocks such as     
Toshiba and Hitachi, and other manufacturers and exporters that are poised to   
take advantage of economic activity both in Japan and globally. While U.S.      
technology stocks have fared well over the last few months, it has been a       
weak sector in Japan, therefore valuations and future growth possibilities      
are attractive.                                                                 

The Portfolio invests heavily in European stocks, mainly in the       
financial and consumer non-durable area, as well as interest rate sensitive     
stocks. European stocks have rallied lately, mainly on the strength of the      
technology sector. The Portfolio added investments in cyclical stocks such as   
auto stocks Volvo and Peugeot, and Michelin, a tire company. These stocks       
recently declined in price and have become a good value.                        

 Fidelity believes that any worldwide recession will be shallow and that
growth will resume. Going forward, they will continue to look for               
opportunities in markets that appear to have excellent value.

 T. ROWE PRICE'S INTERNATIONAL STOCK PORTFOLIO

  International equity markets performed stronger in the second quarter of
1995 than in the first, with most markets posting positive gains. T. Rowe       
Price's International Stock Portfolio finished the first six months of the      
year ahead of the Morgan Stanley EAFE Index. The Portfolio's geographic focus   
did not significantly change over the last six months, maintaining a heavy      
emphasis on the European markets with only selective investments in Japan.      

In Europe, economies continued to recover and strengthen -- an        
environment which benefited the Portfolio's heavy European orientation.         
Meanwhile, markets in the Far East (excluding Japan) and Latin America were     
boosted by more stable interest rates in the U.S. The Japanese stock market     
continued its downward trend, as trade disputes with the U.S. heated up. The    
broad selling of Japanese stocks further spurred negative sentiment among       
investors. Despite this difficult environment, Rowe Price-Fleming               
International, Inc. believes Japan will still remain a strong force over the    
long-term. Therefore, the Portfolio's management will focus on areas of the     
Japanese market which they expect to benefit when the economy inevitably        
recovers. They will also seek international companies that make excellent       
products but have lost their competitive position due to the strong yen.        
These companies suffer when the yen becomes more expensive compared to the      
U.S. dollar and the demand for cheaper U.S. goods and services increase. The    
Portfolio's management expects this trend to moderate, making these companies   
more attractive.                                                                

 Looking forward, the continued recovery in Europe along with the return
of confidence in Latin American investments, and the continued expansion of     
already strong economies in the Far East (excluding Japan) markets, will most   
likely help drive Portfolio returns higher during the second half of 1995.      
Rowe Price-Fleming will continue to use fundamental research from more than     
110 on-site global analysts to provide investors with a highly diversified      
international stock portfolio committed to long-term stability and              
performance.

 SELECT AGGRESSIVE GROWTH FUND

  The equity markets soared during the first half of 1995 as an unexpected
bond rally and a declining dollar led market indices to record highs. The large 
capitalization stock sector led the way for most of the first six months of     
the year, significantly outperforming the small- and mid-capitalization         
sectors. A narrow band of stocks fueled the market increase, with the largest   
100 companies in the S&P 500 Index, producing 72% of the total return.          
Technology stocks, bolstered by increased demand for U.S. products, led the     
drive, followed by financial services and energy stocks. Smaller stocks,        
which the Portfolio tends to invest in, advanced later in the period,           
producing excellent gains in the month of June. As a result, the Portfolio      
performed well in the first half of the year, outperforming its benchmark,      
the Russell 2000 Index. The Portfolio's management emphasized the technology    
and producer/manufacturing sectors with the semiconductor and software          
industries, and the metals and paper industries leading their respective        
sectors. The Portfolio's heavy emphasis on technology stocks and                
producer/manufacturing stocks proved to be an effective strategy as the         
majority of the Portfolio's gains came from investments in these two            
industries.                                                                     

Nicholas-Applegate's outlook for growth stocks remains very optimistic
for the next six to twelve months. The Portfolio should benefit if, as          
anticipated, corporate profitability levels continue to rise and corporate      
earnings continue to increase. Although small-cap stocks have lagged the        
market so far this year, eventually the market should realize the earnings      
power that is being generated by the smaller-cap stocks and reward investors.

SELECT CAPITAL APPRECIATION FUND 

   During the first six months of 1995, U.S. stocks staged a powerful rally.
Spurred by declining interest rates and strong corporate profits, U.S. stocks   
rose 20.2% as measured by the S&P 500 Index, an unmanaged index of common       
stocks. Although the Portfolio's inception occurred four months into the        
period, Janus Capital Corporation was able to catch much of the market's        
rally.                                                                          

Generally, returns on the stocks of large, multinational companies    
outpaced those of medium-size and small companies. Because multinational        
companies derive a significant portion of their revenues from foreign sales,    
these companies benefited greatly from the decline in the U.S. dollar.          

During the six-month period that ended June 30, 1995, financial stocks
were strong performers. Because financial stocks are sensitive to               
interest-rate moves, they generally perform well in a declining interest rate   
environment. During the Portfolio's first two months, it benefited from a       
number of individual holdings in the financial sector, including World          
Acceptance Corporation, a consumer finance company, and Insignia Financial      
Group, the largest U.S. property manager. Other additions to the Portfolio      
during the period included: R. P. Scherer, a developer of drug delivery         
systems, and Minerals Technology, a producer of chemicals used in paper         
making. The Portfolio intentionally avoided technology stocks due to their      
volatility and high prices. However, these stocks were excellent performers     
during the period, and the Portfolio's underweighting in this area hurt         
performance.                                                                    

Looking ahead, Janus believes that moderate economic growth, lower    
interest rates and low inflation should provide a favorable environment for     
growth stocks during the second half of 1995.

SMALL CAP VALUE FUND 

After several years of lagging behind small-company stocks, the top   
performing stocks during the first half of 1995 were large-company blue chip    
stocks and the stocks of selected multinational corporations. Recession fears   
and the decline of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies were            
instrumental in boosting the prices of large-company stocks. As economic        
growth slowed and recession concerns grew, investors sought the quality that    
large, established companies tend to provide. Because blue chip companies and   
multinational companies derive a large portion of their revenues from           
overseas markets, these companies benefited greatly from the decline in the     
U.S. dollar.                                                                    

Among small-company stocks, technology companies made the strongest   
gains. Technology stocks rose more than 28% during the first six months of      
1995. Because of its value orientation, the Small Cap Value Fund was            
underweighted in technology stocks, which significantly affected its            
investment performance. Also contributing to the Portfolio's                    
underperformance, was the fact that investor sentiment during the period did    
not favor sectors such as manufacturing and automotive, in which the            
Portfolio was heavily invested. While individual companies in the Portfolio     
continued to produce strong operating results, their industry sectors tend to   
be sensitive to economic cycles and to interest-rate fluctuations, both of      
which are strong contributors to investor's sentiment.                          

Going forward, Portfolio management is confident that small-company   
stocks should begin to regain strength. They believe small-cap stocks are       
more attractively priced than large-cap stocks. In addition, an interest rate   
decline may provide a boost to the economy and to the interest-rate sensitive   
sectors in which a large portion of the Portfolio's assets are invested.

SELECT GROWTH FUND 

Economic activity slowed during the first half of 1995, after         
accelerating through much of 1993 and 1994. As the economy slowed, interest     
rates fell and set the stage for a "soft landing". However, corporate           
profits remain robust. The combination of lower interest rates and strong       
corporate profits during the first six months of 1995 results in an exploding   
stock market that reached new highs.                                            

Since the Portfolio invests in companies with above average growth    
rates, this rally benefited the Portfolio and resulted in exceptional returns   
during the last few months of the period.  During the first few months of the   
year there was strong evidence that the economy was headed for a slowdown.      
In response, investors moved their assets from cyclical stocks to larger        
capitalization growth stocks. This pushed the growth indices higher. However,   
this movement of assets into large capitalization stocks caused prices to       
rise. As demand increased, stock prices were bid up and investors then began    
seeking investments with faster growth rates.                                   

With the strong worldwide demand for U.S. products, the technology    
sector realized exceptional gains during the period. With 21% of its assets     
invested in technology stocks, the Portfolio benefited from this emphasis.      
Financial services companies, representing approximately 12% of the             
Portfolio, also helped boost investment returns as these stocks did well in     
an environment of declining interest rates. In an effort to diversify, the      
Portfolio's management allocated investments among a broad range of other       
industries, including communications, retail and healthcare. In addition,       
the Portfolio maintained smaller investments in industries such as aerospace,   
energy, entertainment, and specialty chemicals.                                 

  Looking ahead, Provident Investment Counsel is encouraged by a favorable

GROWTH FUND 

For the first six months of 1995, strong corporate profits, declining 
interest rates, and moderate inflation fueled a powerful advance in U.S.        
stocks. The S&P 500 Stock Index posted its largest six-month gain since the     
October 1990-March 1991 period.                                                 

During the first six months of 1995, Miller, Anderson & Sherrerd (MAS)
lagged slightly behind the S&P 500 Index. This underperformance was due         
primarily to MAS' conservative investment strategy. MAS allocated the           
Portfolio's investments among a number of sectors, including technology,        
utilities, health care, consumer nondurables, and basic industries, many of     
which benefited from the market rally. However, the Portfolio also maintained   
a relatively high cash position, and, since cash underperformed other           
financial assets, it diluted the Portfolio's overall performance.               

 Bolstered by worldwide demand for U.S. products, technology stocks made
the strongest gains during the period. Included among the Portfolio's stock     
choices in the technology sector were Intel, Texas Instruments and Seagate      
Technologies, all of which rose significantly in value. While technology        
stocks represented the most aggressive portion of the Portfolio, investments    
in other economic sectors reflected more conservative and defensive stock       
picks. In the utilities sector, the Portfolio invested in Pacific Gas &         
Electric and Ohio Edison. Consumer nondurable stocks included Anheuser Busch    
and RJR Nabisco. In the basic industry category, the Portfolio added W.R.       
Grace, Scott Paper, and DuPont. Over the past several years, these basic        
industry companies have restructured and cut costs and have become more         
productive and competitive in the global economy.                               

Subsequently the Portfolio has reduced its position in financial      
services, heavy industry and transportation and increased its position in       
utilities and basic resources. These adjustments should bring the Portfolio     
more in line with its benchmark.                                                

Looking ahead, the Portfolio's management will maintain a conservative
investment approach positioning the Portfolio to take advantage of an           
anticipated volatile market.

FIDELITY'S VIPF GROWTH PORTFOLIO 

Fidelity's VIPF Growth Portfolio performed well during the six-month  
period ending June 30, 1995 as the Portfolio beat its benchmark, the S&P 500    
Index. The strong gains were primarily due to the fact that the economy has     
slowed and interest rates declined -- a perfect environment for growth stocks.  
Additionally, the Portfolio's investments in the technology sector paid off     
handsomely.                                                                     

As of June 30, 1995, roughly half of the Portfolio's assets were in   
technology stocks, which benefited from strong corporate and consumer demand.   
From PCs and software to semiconductors and networking, business is booming     
in the technology sector.                                                       

 The Portfolio's management boosted the Portfolio's stake in both Intel,
a manufacturer of microprocessors like the Pentium chip, and Micron             
Technology, a manufacturer of PC memory components. This fueled the             
Portfolio's performance as both stocks posted sizable gains for the period.     

In addition, the Portfolio's management reduced its healthcare stake  
from 7.7% of net assets on December 31, 1994 to 3.0% as of June 30, 1995.       
Fidelity decided to reduce investments in this sector once the Republicans      
took charge of Congress in January. This change cast a cloud over healthcare    
stocks as the new congressional leadership promised to re-examine programs      
like Medicare.                                                                  

In summary, Fidelity believes the Portfolio is well-positioned to     
benefit from a long-term positive market, although investors should expect      
some volatility due to the Portfolio's aggressive investments in technology     
companies.

SELECT GROWTH AND INCOME FUND 

 Over the last six months, the strength of corporate earnings, prospects
for lower interest rates, effective corporate restructuring, and a spate of     
mergers and takeovers fueled a strong advance of the U.S. stock markets. In     
addition, the rise in the S&P 500 Index has been magnified by the vigorous      
performance of global growth stocks. These stocks represent many of the         
largest stocks in the S&P 500 Index, and have significantly benefited from      
the decline in the dollar.                                                      

At the end of the period, the Portfolio achieved significant gains yet
trailed the strong advance of the S&P 500 Index, which was fueled by            
extraordinary gains from the technology sector. The Portfolio's relative        
underperformance can be attributed to its minimal exposure to the technology    
sector. Although the Portfolio maintains some exposure to this sector, it       
also contains other investments such as bonds, convertible stocks and           
specialized equities which are less affected by gains in the stock market.      
The Portfolio's management strategy is to protect capital by investing in       
companies that have strong proprietary products or services and have a          
special situation or new factor that has not yet been reflected in the stock    
price.                                                                          

Levin & Co. has a cautious view of the current market environment, due
to several adverse market conditions. The market moves over the first half of   
the year have been one directional. For example, since January there have       
only been two days of market decline in excess of 1%. Also, several sectors,    
including the technology sector, have already posted extraordinary gains and    
are currently trading at high valuations. The international environment,        
especially the weakness in the Japanese market, may trigger a negative effect   
on the U.S. equity markets.                                                     

Going forward, Levin & Co. seeks to reduce investments which are      
currently overvalued and reinvest in stocks selling at reasonable valuations    
with superior business prospects. In so doing, Levin & Co. seeks to             
construct a portfolio of more stable investments such as preferred stock,       
bonds and specialized equities that may sacrifice some upward potential to      
provide investors protection in the event of a market correction.

EQUITY INDEX FUND 

Bolstered by the success of the Federal Reserve's efforts to          
successfully engineer steady economic growth without inflation and the trend    
of positive corporate earnings, equity investors enjoyed a spectacularly        
rewarding first half of the year. The S&P 500 Index rose 20%, posting the       
largest six-month gain since the October 1990 -- March 1991 period. The         
Portfolio continued to maintain its primary objective of matching the total     
return of the S&P 500 Stock Index as closely as possible by investing in more   
than three-quarters of the Index's stocks. This rewarded investors as the       
Equity Index Fund earned returns in line with the S&P 500 for the six month     
period ending June 30, 1995.                                                    

Fueled by an increase in demand for U.S. products and services,       
technology stocks rallied during the period. Semiconductor stocks led this      
industry group, followed by a resurgence of casino stocks.                      

Major banks also helped the Portfolio to perform well during the first
half of the year. Because financial services stocks are sensitive to changes    
in interest rates, the lower interest rate environment boosted these stocks.    
Cyclical stocks, those that do well in periods of economic expansion, did not   
fare as well over the period. Others that did not benefit from the market       
rally were metal and mining, trucking and air freight, and health care stocks.  

  The next six to twelve months look bright. Allmerica Asset Management is
optimistic going forward as corporate earnings continue to show positive        
trends.

FIDELITY'S VIPF EQUITY-INCOME PORTFOLIO   

   Although Fidelity's VIPF Equity-Income Portfolio did well relative to its
peers, it trailed the S&P 500 Stock Index for the six-month period ending       
June 30, 1995 by a small margin. Because the recent stock market rally was      
led by only a few sectors, namely technology, financial services and            
large-cap stocks, relatively few stock funds topped the index. The market's     
strength was driven by Investors' belief that the Federal Reserve Board would   
manage the economy to a "soft landing," albeit slower economic growth and       
continued low inflation. These conditions are ideal for corporate profit        
growth and will provide fuel for continued increases in stock prices which      
should benefit the Portfolio.                                                   

Several of the Portfolio's largest holdings boosted returns late in the 
period. Highlights included Phillip Morris, where strong profit growth and      
free cash flow contributed to earnings; and Federal National Mortgage           
Association (Fannie Mae) whose stock price was set back last fall, but has      
since recovered as conditions in the secondary mortgage market have turned      
more favorable. IBM was another strong performer, as the company has            
succeeded in cutting costs. During the period, the Portfolio purchased a        
number of bank stocks along with other diversified financial services           
companies such as American Express and Fannie Mae. The increased emphasis on    
the financial sector has buoyed the Portfolio's returns because when interest   
rates fall, as they have done over the past few months, the markets usually     
rewards these stocks.                                                           

Risks of earnings shortfalls combined with generally high stock         
valuations could make navigating the market more difficult in the second half   
of 1995. In light of this, Fidelity plans to focus intensely on investing in    
companies that offer prospects for higher earnings through 1996 to enhance      
the Portfolio's value.

FIDELITY'S VIPF II ASSET MANAGER PORTFOLIO      

     Fidelity's VIPF II Asset Manager Portfolio performed well in the first half
of the year. However, since the Portfolio invests a portion of its assets in    
foreign stocks and bonds, and nearly all foreign markets trailed their          
domestic counterparts, the Portfolio's performance was disappointing.           
Japanese investments, which made up about 10% of the Portfolio's assets, hurt   
the Portfolio's performance the most.                                           

At the end of the six-month period, about 53% of the Portfolio's assets 
were in stocks, 32% bonds and 16% cash. This is a more aggressive allocation    
than six months ago when the Portfolio's asset allocation was 37% stocks, 37%   
bonds and 26% cash. Having so much of the Portfolio invested in bonds and       
cash early in the period also contributed to the Portfolio's sluggish           
performance. Foreign investments declined slightly during the period from 27%   
of the Portfolio's assets at the beginning of the period to about 25% on June   
30th.                                                                           

Many of the Portfolio's top holdings were domestic technology stocks,   
including the largest, IBM. The sharp advance of domestic technology stocks     
during the period enhanced the Portfolio's performance. Newer investments to    
the Portfolio include defense contractor Northrop Grumman, U.S. Surgical, a     
former high-flying medical-supply company currently undergoing restructuring,   
and W.R. Grace, which is refocusing on its core specialty-chemical business.    
All of these investments should provide future potential for the Portfolio.     

Approximately 50% of the Portfolio's fixed income investments were      
ten-year U.S. Treasury bonds. In the currently environment, these bonds seem    
to offer the best balance between yield and the potential for price gain.       
Because lower rated bonds tend not to perform as well as Investment Grade       
bonds when the economy is in a declining interest rate environment, Fidelity    
management has trimmed investments in these bonds.                              

 Looking forward, Fidelity will continue reducing the Portfolio's exposure
to U.S. stocks while adding more Japanese stocks, and other foreign stocks      
which look promising for the latter half of the year.

BOND MARKET                                                                     
OVERVIEW 

1992: Government and corporate bonds outperformed the stock market.             

1993: U.S. economy gains momentum. Consumer spending and installment debt       
increase.                                                                       

1994: Federal Reserve Board raises interest rates six times in an effort to     
slow down the economy and keep inflation in check.                              

The series of rate increases by the Federal Reserve Board throughout 1994,
had its desired effect in 1995. Economic growth slowed, inflation remained at   
a moderate level, long-term interest rates declined and bond prices rose. For   
the six month period ending June 30, 1995, the fixed income markets staged a    
powerful rally. The Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index returned 11.4% and     
the Lehman Brothers Government and Corporate Bond Index rose 11.8%.             

Corporate bonds were the best performing fixed income securities due to   
strong earnings growth, low interest rates and a narrowing in the difference    
in yields relative to Treasury securities. These positive factors encouraged    
corporations to issue new bonds.                                                

High-yield bonds, as indicated by the Salomon Brothers High-Yield Index,  
underperformed the investment-grade corporate sector. Because of concerns       
about the possibility of a recession, yields on these bonds rose significantly  
over yields on Treasury securities. High-yield bonds benefited from the         
relatively low level of new issuance.                                           

Mortgage-backed securities were the laggards during the period. Declining 
interest rates tend to have a negative effect on mortgage-backed securities.    
This is because homeowners who hold the mortgages backing these bonds view      
declining rates as an opportunity to refinance at lower rates.                  

The future bodes well for the fixed income markets as we should continue  
to experience moderate economic growth with declining interest rates and        
rising bond prices.

 FIDELITY'S VIPF HIGH INCOME PORTFOLIO

For the first half of the year, Fidelity's VIPF High Income Portfolio 
performed well versus its peer group, yet slightly trailed its benchmark, the   
Merrill Lynch High Yield Master Index.  The Portfolio's emphasis on B-rated     
bonds rather than Ba-rated bonds was the leading factor for the slight          
underperformance versus the Index.  That is, the Merrill Lynch High Yield       
Master Index contains a larger percentage of Ba-rated bonds which typically are 
more sensitive to changing interest rates, and therefore, benefited more from   
the recent decline in interest rates than B-rated bonds.                        

     On the positive side, the Portfolio's management found ample new investment
opportunities over the period.  PanAmSat Corp., a company which operates a      
satellite communications system, and Stratosphere Corp., a Las Vegas-based      
casino, were two new additions.  Both of these companies are promising          
investments.  In addition to their high 14.25% coupons, they pay additional     
interest based on a percentage of cash flow.  Other excellent performers over   
the period included Revlon and Big Flower Press, a large printer of advertising 
inserts, comics and television guides.  Revlon continued to benefit from        
restructuring and the successful launch of two key new products: Color Stay     
Lipstick and Age Defying Makeup.  The Portfolio's Revlon investment is          
concentrated in junior securities which are most sensitive to changes in credit 
quality, which has been a recent plus.  Big Flower Press was helped by the      
strong growth in advertising and the synergies gained from recent acquisitions. 

 On the downside, stocks within the restaurant sector did not perform as
well during the period due to competitive pressures and a slowing economy.  One 
of the Potrfolio's largest holdings, FlagStar, the largest franchisee of        
Hardees, suffered due to aggressive price promotions from the major burger      
chains.                                                                         

Over the next six months, Fidelity believes that the economy will be excellent  
for the high-yield bonds.  Slow economic growth and low inflation could allow   
many companies in the high-yield market to improve credit quality.

INVESTMENT GRADE INCOME FUND 

  The first six months of 1995 were an outstanding period for fixed-income
markets and for the Investment Grade Income Fund. This was due primarily to a   
slowdown in economic growth, declining interest rates and rising bond prices.   

The Investment Grade Income Fund performed well over the period. The  
Portfolio's performance can be attributed to its significant investment in      
corporate bonds and reduced exposure to mortgage-backed securities. In          
addition, its cash position was reduced from 24% to 2%.                         

Corporate bonds outperformed other fixed-income securities during the 
period. Their performance was affected by strong corporate profits, increased   
investor demand for bonds and a limited supply. Allmerica Asset Management      
found the most attractive corporate bond investment opportunities in areas      
that were undervalued including the airline, cable, media, oil and gas          
sectors.                                                                        

While corporate bonds made strong gains, mortgage-backed securities   
provided relatively weak returns. Allmerica Asset Management reduced the        
Portfolio's investments in mortgage-backed securities from approximately 29%    
of assets to 24%. They eliminated premium priced, newly-originated mortgages    
that it believed would be more susceptible to prepayments in a lower interest   
rate environment.                                                               

The Portfolio's management changed its interest-rate strategy from a  
defensive posture to a more positive stance. They also increased its average    
maturity and duration (the interest rate sensitivity of the Portfolio) by       
reducing the number of short-term securities in favor of intermediate-term      
securities. This change benefited the Portfolio as interest rates declined.     

Going forward, Allmerica Asset Management expects moderate economic   
growth and believes that interest rates will continue to decline. The           
Portfolio is positioned to take advantage of this type of investment            
environment as its cash position and exposure to interest rate fluctuations     
are minimal.

GOVERNMENT BOND FUND 

After six interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve Board during 
1994, a seventh rate increase was instituted in February of 1995. The Fed's     
decision to raise rates was prompted by climbing inflation indicators and       
consumer confidence measures which pointed towards continued positive           
economic conditions. As the first quarter of 1995 came to a close, economic     
indicators began to shift. Consumer spending responded to declining personal    
income growth more rapidly than expected and business inventories climbed. By   
May there were signs of a slowdown as the economy responded to the Fed's        
restrictive policy stance.                                                      

 For the six-month period ending June 30, 1995, the Government Bond Fund
lagged its benchmark, the Lehman Brothers Government Bond Index, due, in        
part, to a short-term interest rate strategy in which the Portfolio maintained  
a shorter average duration than usual. As interest rates declined during the    
second quarter of 1995, this shorter-term maturity strategy hurt performance.   
Also negatively affecting performance were the Portfolio's investments in       
mortgage-backed securities.                                                     

As interest rates declined in the second quarter, the Portfolio's     
exposure to mortgage-backed securities was reduced. Because lower interest      
rates prompt homeowners to prepay their mortgages, the Portfolio retained       
only those securities expected to have the least sensitivity to rising          
prepayments. In addition, higher yielding U.S. Government agency securities,    
such as FNMA and the Federal Home Loan Bank, were added to the Portfolio.       
Several asset-backed securities, such as MBNA Corporation, a credit card        
company, and Western Financial Trust, were purchased to provide the Portfolio   
with income stability and diversification.                                      

Allmerica Asset Management expects the Portfolio's performance to     
continue to improve in the second half of 1995. Its strategy is to maintain     
minimal cash levels, while focusing on consistent incremental income over       
that of Treasury securities.

OVERVIEW 

1981: Money market returns peak                                                 
at 14.71%.                                                                      

1992-1993: Federal Reserve eases                                                
interest rates to boost faltering economy.                                      

1994: Federal Reserve raises interest                                           
rates six times in an effort to slow the                                        
economy and keep inflation in check.                                            

Economic growth slowed dramatically during the six-month period ending
June 30, 1995. Strong year-end gross domestic product and final sales figures   
along with increasing employment prompted the Federal Reserve to tighten        
credit in February, 1994. However, just as the Fed acted, there were signs      
that the economy was slowing down. A decline in consumer spending and           
weakness in the housing and auto sectors indicated that the economy was         
cooling off.                                                                    

  As the economy slowed down, interest rates fell. This decline in general
interest rates combined with a stable Federal Funds rate resulted in an         
inverted yield curve. This situation occurs when rates available on short       
term securities are higher relative to intermediate term securities. As a       
result, investors channeled substantial assets into money market investments    
which reached a record level of $579.8 billion.                                 

 Looking forward, there is no clear consensus on what lies ahead. If the
economy falls off dramatically, the Federal Reserve may change course and       
lower interest rates to avoid an extended downturn.

MONEY MARKET FUND 

For the first six months of 1995 the Money Market Fund provided       
competitive returns to investors. In the first quarter, investors faced a       
volatile economic environment of continued strong economic growth with          
lurking inflationary worries. The upward trend in interest rates peaked when    
the Federal Reserve Board responded for the seventh time in a year by raising   
the Federal Funds rate to 6% from 5.5%. Then, in the second quarter, market     
expectations shifted as a series of weak economic indicators showed signs       
that the pace of economic growth had slowed. This stimulated a decline in       
interest rates. And, the decline in rates, combined with a stable Federal       
Funds rate resulted in an inverted yield curve with interest rates on           
short-term securities higher relative to intermediate-term securities. As a     
result, money market funds continued to attract substantial assets, reaching    
a record level of $579.8 billion.                                               

The Portfolio continued to focus on its three primary goals:          
preservation of capital, maintenance of liquidity, and protection of maximum    
current income for investors. The Portfolio's management emphasized high        
quality commercial paper and sought opportunities in other creditworthy         
short-term financial products.                                                  

Going forward, Allmerica Asset Management believes that a significant 
slowdown in economic growth without inflationary pressure will prompt the Fed   
to further lower rates. This, in turn, will cause short-term rates to fall.     
Portfolio management increased the average maturity of the portfolio in the     
second quarter, purchasing short-term corporate notes and bank certificates     
of deposit. This longer maturity structure has left the Portfolio               
well-positioned to benefit from a lower interest rate environment.

ALLMERICA INVESTMENT TRUST  
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS * JUNE 30, 1995 (UNAUDITED)   
1. ORGANIZATION                                                                 

Allmerica Investment Trust (the "Trust"), formerly SMA Investment Trust, is     
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as an open-end,
diversified management investment company established as a Massachusetts        
business trust for the purpose of providing a vehicle for the investment of     
assets of various separate accounts established by SMA Life Assurance Company, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of State Mutual Life Assurance Company of America       
("State Mutual"), or State Mutual Life Insurance Company (the "Companies"). As  
of the date of this report, the Trust offered twelve managed investment         
portfolios. The accompanying financial statements and financial highlights are  
those of the Select International Equity, Select Aggressive Growth, Select      
Capital Appreciation, Small Cap Value, Growth, Select Growth, Select Growth and 
Income, Equity Index, Investment Grade Income, Government Bond and Money Market 
Funds (individually, a "Portfolio," collectively, the "Portfolios").            

2. SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                              

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies which are in      
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles consistently followed  
by the Trust in the preparation of its financial statements.                    

SECURITY VALUATION: Securities which are traded on a recognized exchange  
(including securities traded through the National Market System) are valued at  
the last sale price on the securities exchange on which such securities are     
primarily traded or, if there were no sales that day, at the mean of the closing
bid and asked price. Over-the-counter securities that are not traded through the
National Market System are valued on the basis of the bid price at the close of 
business each day. Short-term investments that mature in 60 days or less are    
valued at amortized cost. Corporate debt securities and debt securities of the  
U.S. Government and its agencies (other than short-term investments) are valued 
by an independent pricing service approved by the Board of Trustees which       
utilizes market quotations and transactions, quotations from dealers and various
relationships among securities in determining value. If not valued by a pricing 
service, such securities are valued at prices obtained from independent brokers.
Investments with prices that cannot be readily obtained, if any, are carried at 
fair value as determined in good faith under consistently applied procedures    
established by and under the supervision of the Board of Trustees. The          
investments of the Money Market Fund are valued utilizing the amortized cost    
valuation method permitted in accordance with Rule 2a-7 under the Investment    
Company Act of 1940. This method involves valuing a portfolio security initially
at its cost and thereafter assuming a constant amortization to maturity of any  
discount or premium.                                                            

FORWARD FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS: The Select International Equity and   
Select Capital Appreciation Funds may enter into forward foreign currency       
contracts whereby the Portfolios agree to sell a specific currency at a         
specific price at a future date in an attempt to hedge against fluctuations     
in the value of the underlying currency of certain portfolio instruments.       
Forward foreign currency contracts are valued at the daily exchange rate of     
the underlying currency. Purchases and sales of forward foreign currency        
contracts having the same settlement date and broker are offset and presented   
on a net basis in the Statement of Assets and Liabilities. Gains or losses on   
the purchase or sale of forward foreign currency contracts having the same      
settlement date and broker are recognized on the date of offset, otherwise      
gains or losses are recognized on the settlement date.                          

66

ALLMERICA INVESTMENT TRUST  
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, CONTINUED (UNAUDITED)        

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION: Investment valuations, other assets and     
liabilities initially expressed as foreign currencies are converted each        
business day into U.S. dollars based upon current exchange rates.  Purchases and
sales of foreign investments and income and expenses are converted into U.S.    
dollars based upon exchange rates prevailing on the respective dates of such    
transactions.  That portion of unrealized gains or losses on investments due to 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates is not separately disclosed.    

SECURITY TRANSACTIONS AND INVESTMENT INCOME:  Security transactions are   
recorded on the trade date. Net realized gains and losses from security         
transactions are recorded on the basis of identified cost. Interest income is   
recorded on the accrual basis and consists of interest accrued and, if          
applicable, discount earned less premiums amortized. Dividend income is         
recorded on the ex-dividend date. Short-term gains of the Money Market Fund are 
included in interest income.                                                    

DISTRIBUTIONS TO SHAREHOLDERS: Dividends from net investment income are   
declared and reinvested daily for the Money Market Fund, declared and           
distributed quarterly for the Growth, Select Growth and Income, Equity Index,   
Investment Grade Income and Government Bond Funds, and annually for the         
Select International Equity, Select Aggressive Growth, Select Capital           
Appreciation, Small Cap Value and Select Growth Funds. All Portfolios with      
the exception of the Money Market Fund declare and distribute, if any, all      
net realized capital gains at least annually.                                   

 The amounts of income and capital gains to be distributed are determined in
accordance with income tax regulations. Such amounts may vary from income and   
gains recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. As
such, reclassifications are made to the Portfolio's capital accounts as         
necessary, so that they reflect income and gains available for distribution (or 
available capital loss carryforwards) under income tax regulations.             

FEDERAL INCOME TAXES: The Trust treats each Portfolio as a separate entity
for Federal income tax purposes. Each Portfolio intends to qualify each year    
as a "regulated investment company" under Subchapter M of the Internal          
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. By so qualifying, each Portfolio will not     
be subject to Federal income taxes to the extent it distributes all of its      
taxable income and net realized gains for the tax year ending December 31. In   
addition, by distributing during each calendar year substantially all of its    
net investment income, capital gains and certain other amounts, if any, each    
Portfolio will not be subject to Federal excise tax. Therefore, no Federal      
income tax provision is required. Withholding taxes on foreign dividend         
income and gains have been paid or provided for in accordance with the          
applicable country's tax rules and rates.                                       

EXPENSES: The Trust accounts separately for assets, liabilities and       
operations of each Portfolio. Expenses directly attributed to a Portfolio are   
charged to the Portfolio, while expenses which are attributable to more than    
one Portfolio of the Trust are allocated among the respective Portfolios.       

   FORWARD COMMITMENTS: Each Portfolio may from time to time purchase securities
on forward commitment basis. Debt securities are often issued on this basis. The
yield of such securities is fixed at the time a commitment to purchase is made, 
with actual payment and delivery of the security generally taking place 15 to 45
days later. During the period between purchase and settlement, typically no     
payment is made by a Portfolio and no interest accrues to the Portfolio. The    
market value of forward commitments may be more or less than the purchase price 
payable at settlement date.                                                     

                                                                          67

of First Data Corp., whereby TSSG performs administrative services for each     
of the Portfolios and is entitled to receive an administrative fee and          
certain out-of-pocket expenses.  The manager is solely responsible for the      
payment of the administrative fee to TSSG.                                      

In the event normal operating expenses of each Portfolio, excluding taxes,

Money Market Fund -0.60%), the Manager will bear such expenses directly or      
reduce its compensation from the Portfolios by the excess of the stated         
expense limitations. Expense limitations may be removed or revised without      
prior notice to existing shareholders. The Manager may voluntarily reimburse    
its fees and any expenses in excess of the expense limitations.

The Select International Equity Fund purchases securities of foreign issuers.   
Investing in such securities involves special risks not typically associated    
with investing in securities of U.S. issuers.  The risks include revaluation    
of currencies and future adverse political and economic developments.           
Moreover, securities of many foreign issuers and their markets may be less      
liquid and their prices more volatile than those of securities of comparable    
U.S. issuers.                                                                   

8. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS                                                        

Investing in financial instruments such as the sales of forward foreign currency
contracts involves risk in excess of the amounts reflected in the Statement of  
Assets and Liabilities.  The face or contract amounts reflect the extent of the 
involvement the Portfolio has in the instruments.  Risks associated with these  
instruments include an imperfect correlation between the movements in the price 
of the instruments and the price of the underlying securities and interest      
rates, an illiquid secondary market for the instruments or inability of         
counterparties to perform under the terms of the contract and changes in the    
value of currency relative to the U.S. dollar.  The Select International Equity 
Fund and the Select Capital Appreciation Fund enter into these contracts        
primarily as a means to remain fully invested and reduce transaction costs.     

                                                                    71

each Fund will have a specified
minimum number of Municipal
Securities holdings and will be subject
to percentage limitations on a Fund’s
total assets invested in Municipal
Securities of individual issuers, states
and sectors, as described above.
The proposed rule change is designed
to promote just and equitable principles
of trade and to protect investors and the
public interest in that the Exchange will
obtain a representation from the issuer
of the Shares that the NAV per Share
will be calculated daily and that the
NAV and the Disclosed Portfolio will be
made available to all market
participants at the same time. In
addition, a large amount of information
is publicly available regarding each
Fund and the Shares, thereby promoting
market transparency. Quotation and last
sale information for the Shares and
ETFs will be available via the CTA highspeed line, and from the national
securities exchange on which they are
listed. Prior to the commencement of
trading, the Exchange will inform its
Equity Trading Permit Holders in an
Information Bulletin of the special
characteristics and risks associated with
trading the Shares. Trading in Shares of
the Funds will be halted if the circuit
breaker parameters in NYSE Arca
Equities Rule 7.12 have been reached or
because of market conditions or for
reasons that, in the view of the
Exchange, make trading in the Shares
inadvisable. Trading in the Shares will
be subject to NYSE Arca Equities Rule
8.600(d)(2)(D), which sets forth
circumstances under which Shares of
the Funds may be halted. In addition, as
noted above, investors will have ready
access to information regarding the
Funds’ holdings, the IOPV, the
Disclosed Portfolio, and quotation and
last sale information for the Shares.
The proposed rule change is designed
to perfect the mechanism of a free and
open market and, in general, to protect
investors and the public interest in that
it will facilitate the listing and trading
of additional types of actively-managed
exchange-traded products that
principally hold municipal bonds and
that will enhance competition among
market participants, to the benefit of
investors and the marketplace. As noted
above, the Exchange has in place
surveillance procedures relating to
trading in the Shares and may obtain
information via ISG from other
exchanges that are members of ISG or
with which the Exchange has entered
into a comprehensive surveillance
sharing agreement. In addition, as noted
above, investors will have ready access
to information regarding each Fund’s
holdings, IOPV, Disclosed Portfolio, and

quotation and last sale information for
the Shares.
B. Self-Regulatory Organization’s
Statement on Burden on Competition
The Exchange does not believe that
the proposed rule change will impose
any burden on competition that is not
necessary or appropriate in furtherance
of the purpose of the Act. The Exchange
notes that the proposed rule change will
facilitate the listing and trading of
additional types of actively-managed
exchange-traded products that
principally hold municipal bonds and
that will enhance competition among
market participants, to the benefit of
investors and the marketplace.
C. Self-Regulatory Organization’s
Statement on Comments on the
Proposed Rule Change Received From
Members, Participants, or Others
No written comments were solicited
or received with respect to the proposed
rule change.
III. Date of Effectiveness of the
Proposed Rule Change and Timing for
Commission Action
Within 45 days of the date of
publication of this notice in the Federal
Register or within such longer period
up to 90 days (i) as the Commission may
designate if it finds such longer period
to be appropriate and publishes its
reasons for so finding or (ii) as to which
the self-regulatory organization
consents, the Commission will:
(A) By order approve or disapprove
the proposed rule change, or

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The
following is a summary of the
application. The complete application
may be obtained via the Commission’s
Web site by searching for the file
number, or for an Applicant using the
Company name box, at http://
www.sec.gov.search/search.htm, or by

Applicants’ Representations
1. Commonwealth is a life insurance
company engaged in the business of
writing individual and group annuity
contracts and life insurance policies.
Commonwealth was originally
organized under the laws of Delaware in
July 1974 and was subsequently redomiciled in the state of Massachusetts
effective December 31, 2002.
2. Prior to December 30, 2005,
Commonwealth (formerly Allmerica
Financial Life Insurance and Annuity
Company) was an indirect whollyowned subsidiary of The Hanover
Insurance Group (‘‘THG’’), formerly
Allmerica Financial Corporation. On
that date, THG completed the closing of
the sale of Commonwealth to The
Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (‘‘Goldman
Sachs’’). Effective September 1, 2006,
Commonwealth changed its name from
Allmerica Financial Life Insurance and

E:\FR\FM\03MYN1.SGM

03MYN1

20666

Federal Register / Vol. 82, No. 84 / Wednesday, May 3, 2017 / Notices

Annuity Company to Commonwealth
Annuity and Life Insurance Company.
Effective April 30, 2013, Goldman Sachs
completed the transfer of the common
stock of Commonwealth to Global
Atlantic (Fin) Company, which is a
wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of
Global Atlantic Financial Group
Limited. Effective January 2, 2014,
Forethought Services LLC acquired
ownership of 79% of the shares of
Commonwealth. Forethought Services
LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Forethought Financial Group, Inc.,
which in turn is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Global Atlantic (Fin)
Company. As of December 31, 2015,
Goldman Sachs owns a total of
approximately 22% of the outstanding
shares of Global Atlantic; and other
investors, none of whom own more than
9.9%, own the remaining 78% of the
outstanding ordinary shares.

3. Each of the Separate Accounts
meets the definition of ‘‘separate
account,’’ as defined in Section 2(a)(37)
of the 1940 Act and Rule 0–1(e)
thereunder. The Separate Accounts are
registered with the Commission under
the 1940 Act as unit investment trusts.
The assets of the Separate Accounts
support the Contracts and interests in
the Separate Accounts offered through
such Contracts. Commonwealth is the
legal owner of the assets in the Separate
Accounts. The Separate Accounts are
segmented into subaccounts, and each
subaccount invests in an underlying
registered open-end management
investment company or a series thereof.
A subaccount of one or more of the
Separate Accounts corresponds to each
of the Existing Portfolios. The business
and affairs of the Separate Accounts, as
unit investment trusts, are conducted by
Commonwealth, as depositor thereof.

4. The Contracts are each registered
under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the ‘‘1933 Act’’), on Form N–
4 or Form N–6, as applicable. Each of
the Contracts has particular fees,
charges, and investment options, as
described in the Contracts’ respective
registration statements.
5. The Contracts are individual or
group deferred variable annuity
contracts or variable life insurance
policies. As set forth in the prospectuses
for the Contracts, Commonwealth
reserves the right to substitute shares of
another registered investment company
for the shares of any registered
investment company already purchased
or to be purchased in the future by the
Separate Accounts.
6. Applicants propose, as set forth
below, to substitute shares of the
Replacement Portfolios for shares of the
Existing Portfolios (‘‘Substitutions’’):

its investment advisory affiliates, had
assets under supervision of
approximately $1.08 trillion. GSAM’s

10. The Applicants believe that the
Replacement Portfolios have investment
objectives, principal investment
strategies, and principle risks, as
described in their prospectuses, that are
substantially similar to, the
corresponding Existing Portfolios to
make those Replacement Portfolios
appropriate candidates as substitutes.
11. Information for each Existing
Portfolio and Replacement Portfolio,
including investment objectives,
principal investment strategies,
principal risks, and comparative
performance history, can be found in
the application.
12. Applicants state that in selecting
the Replacement Portfolios,
Commonwealth sought to simplify fund
lineups while reducing costs and
maintaining a high-quality menu of
investment options that would offer a
similar diversity of investment options
after the proposed Substitutions as is
currently available under the Contracts.
Contract owners with Contract value
allocated to the subaccounts of the
Existing Portfolios will have lower or
equal net annual operating expenses
immediately after the proposed
Substitutions as before the proposed
Substitutions. With respect to all of the
proposed Substitutions, the combined
management fee and Rule 12b–1 fees
paid by the Replacement Portfolio are
the same or lower than those of the
corresponding Existing Portfolio. The
application sets forth the fees and
expenses of each Existing Portfolio and
its corresponding Replacement Portfolio
in greater detail.
13. Applicants represent that as of the
Substitution Date (defined below), the
Separate Accounts will redeem shares of
the Existing Portfolios for cash or inkind. Redemption requests and
purchase orders will be placed
simultaneously so that Contract values
will remain fully invested at all times.
14. Each Substitution will be effected
at the relative net asset values of the
respective shares of the Replacement
Portfolios in conformity with Section
22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c–1
thereunder without the imposition of
any transfer or similar charges by the
Section 26 Applicants. The

PO 00000

Frm 00110

Fmt 4703

Sfmt 4703

Substitutions will be effected without
change in the amount or value of any
Contracts held by affected Contract
owners.2
15. Contract owners will not incur
any fees or charges as a result of the
proposed Substitutions. The obligations
of the Section 26 Applicants, and the
rights of the affected Contract owners,
under the Contracts of affected Contract
owners will not be altered in any way.
Commonwealth and/or its affiliates will
pay all expenses and transaction costs of
the Substitutions, including legal and
accounting expenses, any applicable
brokerage expenses and other fees and
expenses. No fees or charges will be
assessed to the affected Contract owners
to effect the Substitutions. The proposed
Substitutions will not cause the
Contract fees and charges currently
being paid by Contract owners to be
greater after the proposed Substitution
than before the proposed Substitution.
In addition, the Substitutions will in no
way alter the tax treatment of affected
Contract owners in connection with
their Contracts, and no tax liability will
arise for Contract owners as a result of
the Substitutions.
16. The Section 26 Applicants agree
that, for a period of two years following
the implementation of the proposed
Substitution (the ‘‘Substitution Date’’),
and for those Contracts with assets
allocated to the Existing Portfolio on the
Substitution Date, Commonwealth or an
affiliate thereof (other than the Trust)
will reimburse, on the last business day
of each fiscal quarter, the Contract
owners whose subaccounts invest in the
applicable Replacement Portfolio to the
extent that the Replacement Portfolio’s
net annual operating expenses (taking
into account fee waivers and expense
reimbursements) for such period
exceeds, on an annualized basis, the net
annual operating expenses of the
2 The Section 26 Applicants state that, because
the Substitutions will occur at relative net asset
value, and the fees and charges under the Contracts
will not change as a result of the Substitutions, the
benefits offered by the guarantees under the
Contracts will be the same immediately before and
after the Substitutions. The Section 26 Applicants
also state that what effect the Substitutions may
have on the value of the benefits offered by the
Contract guarantees would depend, among other
things, on the relative future performance of the
Existing Portfolios and Replacement Portfolios,
which the Section 26 Applicants cannot predict.
Nevertheless, the Section 26 Applicants note that at
the time of the Substitutions, the Contracts will
offer a comparable variety of investment options
with as broad a range of risk/return characteristics.

Existing Portfolio for the most recent
fiscal year preceding the date of the
most recently filed application.
Commonwealth will not increase the
Contract fees and charges that would
otherwise be assessed under the terms
of the Contracts for a period of at least
two years following the Substitution
Date.
17. From the date the Pre-Substitution
Notice (defined below) through 30 days
following the Substitution Date,
Contract owners may make at least one
transfer of Contract value from the
subaccount investing in an Existing
Portfolio (before the Substitution) or the
Replacement Portfolio (after the
Substitution) to any other available
subaccount under the Contract without
charge and without imposing any
transfer limitations. Further, on the
Substitution Date, Contract values
attributable to investments in each
Existing Portfolio will be transferred to
the corresponding Replacement
Portfolio without charge and without
being subject to any transfer limitations.
Moreover, Commonwealth will not
exercise any rights reserved under the
Contracts to impose restrictions on
transfers between the subaccounts
under the Contracts, including
limitations on the future number of
transfers, for a period beginning at least
30 days before the Substitution Date
through at least 30 days following the
Substitution Date.
18. At least 30 days prior to the
Substitution Date, Contract owners will
be notified via prospectus supplements
that the Section 26 Applicants received
or expect to receive Commission
approval of the applicable proposed
Substitutions and of the anticipated
Substitution Date (the ‘‘Pre-Substitution
Notice’’). Pre-Substitution Notices sent
to Contract owners will be filed with the
Commission pursuant to Rule 497 under
the 1940 Act. The Pre-Substitution
Notice will advise Contract owners that
from the date of the Pre-Substitution
Notice through the date 30 days after the
Substitutions, Contract owners may
make at least one transfer of Contract
value from the subaccounts investing in
the Existing Portfolios (before the
Substitutions) or the Replacement
Portfolios (after the Substitutions) to any
other available subaccount without
charge and without imposing any
transfer limitations. Among other
information, the notice will inform
affected Contract owners that that,
except as described in the disruptive
transfers or market timing provisions of
the relevant prospectus, Commonwealth
will not exercise any rights reserved
under the Contracts to impose
restrictions on transfers among the

subaccounts under the Contracts,
including limitations on the future
number of transfers, through at least 30
days after the Substitution Date.
Additionally, all affected Contract
owners will be sent prospectuses of the
applicable Replacement Portfolios at
least 30 days before the Substitution
Date.
19. In addition to the Supplements
distributed to the Contract owners,
within five business days after the
Substitution Date, Contract owners
whose assets are allocated to a
Replacement Portfolio as part of the
proposed Substitutions will be sent a
written notice (each, a ‘‘Confirmation’’)
informing them that the Substitutions
were carried out as previously notified.
The Confirmation also will restate the
information set forth in the PreSubstitution Notice. The Confirmation
will also reflect the values of the
Contract owner’s positions in the
Existing Portfolio before the
Substitution and the Replacement
Portfolio after the Substitution.
Legal Analysis
1. The Section 26 Applicants request
that the Commission issue an order
pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940
Act approving the proposed
Substitutions. Section 26(c) of the 1940
Act prohibits any depositor or trustee of
a unit investment trust that invests
exclusively in the securities of a single
issuer from substituting the securities of
another issuer without the approval of
the Commission. Section 26(c) provides
that such approval shall be granted by
order from the Commission if the
evidence establishes that the
substitution is consistent with the
protection of investors and the purposes
of the 1940 Act.
2. The Section 26 Applicants submit
that the Substitutions meet the
standards set forth in Section 26(c) and
that, if implemented, the Substitutions
would not raise any of the concerns that
Congress intended to address when the
1940 Act was amended to include this
provision. Applicants state that each
Substitution protects the Contract
owners who have Contract value
allocated to an Existing Portfolio by
providing Replacement Portfolios with
substantially similar investment
objectives, strategies, and risks, and
providing Contract owners with
investment options that would have
total and net annual operating expense
ratios that are lower than, or equal to,
their corresponding investment options
before the Substitutions.
3. Commonwealth has reserved the
right under the Contracts to substitute
shares of another underlying fund for

PO 00000

Frm 00111

Fmt 4703

Sfmt 4703

20669

one of the current funds offered as an
investment option under the Contracts.
The Contracts and the Contracts’
prospectuses disclose this right.
4. The Section 26 Applicants submit
that the ultimate effect of the proposed
Substitutions will be to streamline and
simplify the investment line-ups that
are available to Contract owners while
reducing expenses and continuing to
provide Contract owners with a wide
array of investment options. The Section
26 Applicants state that the proposed
Substitutions will not reduce in any
manner the nature or quality of the
available investment options and the
proposed Substitutions also will permit
Commonwealth to present information
to its Contract owners in a simpler and
more concise manner. The Section 26
Applicants also state it is anticipated
that after the proposed Substitutions,
Contract owners will be provided with
disclosure documents that contain a
simpler presentation of the available
investment options under the Contracts.
The Section 26 Applicants also assert
that the proposed Substitutions are not
of the type that Section 26 was designed
to prevent because they will not result
in costly forced redemption, nor will
they affect other aspects of the
Contracts. In addition, the proposed
Substitutions will not adversely affect
any features or riders under the
Contracts because none of the features
or riders have any investment
restrictions. Accordingly, no Contract
owner will involuntarily lose his or her
features or riders as a result of any
proposed Substitution. Moreover, the
Section 26 Applicants will offer
Contract owners the opportunity to
transfer amounts out of the affected
subaccounts without any cost or other
penalty (other than those necessary to
implement policies and procedures
designed to detect and deter disruptive
transfer and other ‘‘market timing’’
activity) that may otherwise have been
imposed for a period beginning on the
date of the Pre-Substitution Notice
(which supplement will be delivered to
the Contract owners at least thirty (30)
days before the Substitution Date) and
ending no earlier than thirty (30) days
after the Substitution Date. The
proposed Substitutions are also unlike
the type of substitution that Section
26(c) was designed to prevent in that the
Substitutions have no impact on other
aspects of the Contracts.
5. The Section 17 Applicants request
an order under Section 17(b) exempting
them from the provisions of Section
17(a) to the extent necessary to permit
the Section 17 Applicants to carry out
some or all of the proposed
Substitutions. The Section 17

E:\FR\FM\03MYN1.SGM

03MYN1

nlaroche on DSK30NT082PROD with NOTICES

20670

Federal Register / Vol. 82, No. 84 / Wednesday, May 3, 2017 / Notices

Applicants state that because the
proposed Substitutions may be effected,
in whole or in part, by means of in-kind
redemptions and purchases, the
proposed Substitutions may be deemed
to involve one or more purchases or
sales of securities or property between
affiliated persons.
6. Section 17(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, in
relevant part, prohibits any affiliated
person of a registered investment
company, or any affiliated person of
such person, acting as principal, from
knowingly selling any security or other
property to that company. Section
17(a)(2) of the 1940 Act generally
prohibits the persons described above,
acting as principals, from knowingly
purchasing any security or other
property from the registered investment
company.
7. The Section 17 Applicants state
that the proposed transactions may
involve a transfer of portfolio securities
by the Existing Portfolios to the Separate
Accounts. Immediately thereafter, the
Separate Accounts would purchase
shares of the Replacement Portfolios
with the portfolio securities received
from the Existing Portfolios.
Accordingly, the Section 17 Applicants
provide that to the extent
Commonwealth and the Existing
Portfolios, and Commonwealth and the
Replacement Portfolios, are deemed to
be affiliated persons of one another
under Section 2(a)(3) or Section 2(a)(9)
of the 1940 Act, it is conceivable that
this aspect of the proposed
Substitutions could be viewed as being
prohibited by Section 17(a).
Accordingly, the Section 17 Applicants
have determined to seek relief from
Section 17(a).
8. The Section 17 Applicants submit
that the terms of the proposed in-kind
purchases of shares of the Replacement
Portfolios by the Separate Accounts,
including the consideration to be paid
and received, as described in the
application, are reasonable and fair and
do not involve overreaching on the part
of any person concerned. The Section
17 Applicants submit that the terms of
the proposed in-kind transactions,
including the considered to be paid to
each Existing Portfolio and received by
each Replacement Portfolio involved,
are reasonable, fair and do not involve
overreaching principally because the
transactions will conform with all but
one of the conditions enumerated in
Rule 17a–7 under the 1940 Act. The
proposed transactions will take place at
relative net asset value in conformity
with the requirements of Section 22(c)
of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c–1
thereunder without the imposition of
any transfer or similar charges by the

VerDate Sep<11>2014

14:29 May 02, 2017

Jkt 241001

Section 26 Applicants. The
Substitutions will be effected without
change in the amount or value of any
Contract held by the affected Contract
owners. The Substitutions will in no
way alter the tax treatment of affected
Contract owners in connection with
their Contracts, and no tax liability will
arise for Contract owners as a result of
the Substitutions. The fees and charges
under the Contracts will not increase
because of the Substitutions. Even
though the Separate Accounts,
Commonwealth and the Trust may not
rely on Rule 17a–7, the Section 17
Applicants believe that the rule’s
conditions outline the type of
safeguards that result in transactions
that are fair and reasonable to registered
investment company participants and
preclude overreaching in connection
with an investment company by its
affiliated persons.
9. The Section 17 Applicants also
submit that the proposed in-kind
purchases by the Separate Accounts are
consistent with the policies of the Trust
and the Replacement Portfolios, as
provided in the Trust’s registration
statement and reports filed under the
1940 Act. Finally, the Section 17
Applicants submit that the proposed
Substitutions are consistent with the
general purposes of the 1940 Act.
Applicants’ Conditions
The Section 26 Applicants, and
Global Atlantic as applicable, agree that
any order granting the requested relief
will be subject to the following
conditions:
1. The Substitutions will not be
effected unless Commonwealth
determines that: (i) The Contracts allow
the substitution of shares of registered
open-end investment companies in the
manner contemplated by the
application; (ii) the Substitutions can be
consummated as described in the
application under applicable insurance
laws; and (iii) any regulatory
requirements in each jurisdiction where
the Contracts are qualified for sale have
been complied with to the extent
necessary to complete the Substitutions.
2. After the Substitution Date, Global
Atlantic will not change a sub-adviser,
add a new sub-adviser, or otherwise rely
on the Manager of Managers Order (as
defined in the application), or any
replacement order from the
Commission, with respect to any
Replacement Portfolio without first
obtaining shareholder approval of the
change in sub-adviser, the new subadviser, or the Replacement Portfolio’s
ability to rely on the Manager of
Managers Order, or any replacement
order from the Commission.

3. Commonwealth or an affiliate
thereof (other than the Trust) will pay
all expenses and transaction costs of the
Substitutions, including legal and
accounting expenses, any applicable
brokerage expenses and other fees and
expenses. No fees or charges will be
assessed to the affected Contract owners
to effect the Substitutions. The proposed
Substitutions will not cause the
Contract fees and charges currently
being paid by Contract owners to be
greater after the proposed Substitution
than before the proposed Substitution.
4. The Substitutions will be effected
at the relative net asset values of the
respective shares of the Replacement
Portfolios in conformity with Section
22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c–1
thereunder without the imposition of
any transfer or similar charges by the
Section 26 Applicants. The
Substitutions will be effected without
change in the amount or value of any
Contracts held by affected Contract
owners.
5. The Substitutions will in no way
alter the tax treatment of affected
Contract owners in connection with
their Contracts, and no tax liability will
arise for Contract owners as a result of
the Substitutions.
6. The obligations of the Section 26
Applicants, and the rights of the
affected Contract owners, under the
Contracts of affected Contract owners
will not be altered in any way.
7. Affected Contract owners will be
permitted to make at least one transfer
of Contract value from the subaccount
investing in the Existing Portfolio
(before the Substitution Date) or the
Replacement Portfolio (after the
Substitution Date) to any other available
investment option under the Contract
without charge for a period beginning at
least 30 days before the Substitution
Date through at least 30 days following
the Substitution Date. Except as
described in any market timing/shortterm trading provisions of the relevant
prospectus, the Section 26 Applicants
will not exercise any rights reserved
under the Contracts to impose
restrictions on transfers between the
subaccounts under the Contracts,
including limitations on the future
number of transfers, for a period
beginning at least 30 days before the
Substitution Date through at least 30
days following the Substitution Date.
8. All affected Contract owners will be
notified, at least 30 days before the
Substitution Date about: (i) The
intended Substitution of Existing
Portfolios with the Replacement
Portfolios; (ii) the intended Substitution
Date; and (iii) information with respect
to transfers as set forth in Condition 7

E:\FR\FM\03MYN1.SGM

Federal Register / Vol. 82, No. 84 / Wednesday, May 3, 2017 / Notices
above. In addition, the Section 26
Applicants will also deliver to affected
Contract owners, at least thirty days
before the Substitution Date, a
prospectus for each applicable
Replacement Portfolio.
9. The Section 26 Applicants will
deliver to each affected Contract owner
within five business days of the
Substitution Date a written confirmation
which will include: (i) A confirmation
that the Substitutions were carried out
as previously notified; (ii) a restatement
of the information set forth in the PreSubstitution Notice; and (iii) values of
the Contract owner’s positions in the
Existing Portfolio before the
Substitution and the Replacement
Portfolio after the Substitution.
10. For a period of two years
following the Substitution Date, for
Contract owners who were Contract
owners as of the Substitution Date,
Commonwealth or an affiliate thereof
(other than the Trust) will reimburse, on
the last business day of each fiscal
quarter, the Contract owners whose
subaccounts invest in the applicable
Replacement Portfolio to the extent that
the Replacement Portfolio’s net annual
operating expenses (taking into account
fee waivers and expense
reimbursements) for such period
exceeds, on an annualized basis, the net
annual operating expenses of the
Existing Portfolio for the most recent
fiscal year preceding the date of the
application. In addition, the Section 26
Applicants will not increase the
Contract fees and charges that would
otherwise be assessed under the terms
of the Contracts for a period of at least
two years following the Substitution
Date.

Investment Management, under delegated
authority.

Inc. (‘‘NYSE Arca’’), and NYSE
National, Inc. (‘‘NYSE National’’) (each
an ‘‘Exchange’’, collectively,

Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(‘‘Exchange Act’’),2 that the Securities
and Exchange Commission
(‘‘Commission’’) grant an exemption
pursuant to Section 36(a)(1) 3 of the

order grants each Exchange’s request for
exemptive relief, subject to the
satisfaction of certain conditions, which
are outlined below.
II. Application for Conditional

The Instructions to Form 1 define an
‘‘affiliate’’ as ‘‘[a]ny person that, directly
or indirectly, controls, is under common
control with, or is controlled by, the
national securities exchange . . .,
including any employees.’’ 8 The
Instructions to Form 1 define ‘‘control’’
as
The power, directly or indirectly, to direct
the management or policies of a company,
whether through ownership of securities, by
contract or otherwise. Any person that . . .
directly or indirectly has the right to vote
25% or more of a class of voting securities
or has the power to sell or direct the sale of
25% or more of a class of voting securities
. . . is presumed to control that entity.9

Each Exchange has requested that the
Commission grant it an exemption
pursuant to Section 36(a)(1) of the
Exchange Act, subject to the conditions
set forth below, with respect to its
‘‘Foreign Indirect Affiliates,’’ as defined
below, from the requirement under Rule
6a–2(b)(1) under the Exchange Act to
file the financial information required
by Exhibit D.
Each Exemption Request states that
the respective Exchange is a whollyowned subsidiary of NYSE Group, Inc.
(‘‘NYSE Group’’), a Delaware
corporation. Each Exemption Request
further states that NYSE Group is
wholly owned by NYSE Holdings LLC
(‘‘NYSE Holdings’’), a Delaware limited
liability company, which is wholly
owned by Intercontinental Exchange
Holdings, Inc. (‘‘ICE Holdings’’), a
Delaware corporation. In turn, ICE
Holdings is wholly owned by
Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. (‘‘Parent
Company’’), a Delaware corporation.
The Parent Company, through its
wholly-owned subsidiaries, owns a
large number of foreign entities, some of
which also own interests in other
foreign entities in excess of 25%.10 The
foreign entity affiliates and subsidiaries
of the Parent Company are referred to,
collectively, as the ‘‘Foreign Indirect
Affiliates.’’
Each Exchange states that, because of
the limited and indirect nature of its
7 Exhibit D to Form 1 requires that such financial
statements consist, at a minimum, of a balance
sheet and an income statement with such footnotes
and other disclosures necessary to avoid rendering
the financial statements misleading. Exhibit D
further provides that, if any affiliate or subsidiary
is required by another Commission rule to submit
annual financial statements, the exchange may
provide a statement to that effect, with a citation to
the other Commission rule, in lieu of the financial
statements required by Exhibit D.

Applicants' Representations

    1. Commonwealth is a life insurance company engaged in the business 
of writing individual and group annuity contracts and life insurance 
policies. Commonwealth was originally organized under the laws of 
Delaware in July 1974 and was subsequently re-domiciled in the state of 
Massachusetts effective December 31, 2002.
    2. Prior to December 30, 2005, Commonwealth (formerly Allmerica 
Financial Life Insurance and Annuity Company) was an indirect wholly-
owned subsidiary of The Hanover Insurance Group (``THG''), formerly 
Allmerica Financial Corporation. On that date, THG completed the 
closing of the sale of Commonwealth to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. 
(``Goldman Sachs''). Effective September 1, 2006, Commonwealth changed 
its name from Allmerica Financial Life Insurance and

[[Page 20666]]

Annuity Company to Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company. 
Effective April 30, 2013, Goldman Sachs completed the transfer of the 
common stock of Commonwealth to Global Atlantic (Fin) Company, which is 
a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Global Atlantic Financial Group 
Limited. Effective January 2, 2014, Forethought Services LLC acquired 
ownership of 79% of the shares of Commonwealth. Forethought Services 
LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Forethought Financial Group, Inc., 
which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Global Atlantic (Fin) 
Company. As of December 31, 2015, Goldman Sachs owns a total of 
approximately 22% of the outstanding shares of Global Atlantic; and 
other investors, none of whom own more than 9.9%, own the remaining 78% 
of the outstanding ordinary shares.
    3. Each of the Separate Accounts meets the definition of ``separate 
account,'' as defined in Section 2(a)(37) of the 1940 Act and Rule 0-
1(e) thereunder. The Separate Accounts are registered with the 
Commission under the 1940 Act as unit investment trusts. The assets of 
the Separate Accounts support the Contracts and interests in the 
Separate Accounts offered through such Contracts. Commonwealth is the 
legal owner of the assets in the Separate Accounts. The Separate 
Accounts are segmented into subaccounts, and each subaccount invests in 
an underlying registered open-end management investment company or a 
series thereof. A subaccount of one or more of the Separate Accounts 
corresponds to each of the Existing Portfolios. The business and 
affairs of the Separate Accounts, as unit investment trusts, are 
conducted by Commonwealth, as depositor thereof.
    4. The Contracts are each registered under the Securities Act of 
1933, as amended (the ``1933 Act''), on Form N-4 or Form N-6, as 
applicable. Each of the Contracts has particular fees, charges, and 
investment options, as described in the Contracts' respective 
registration statements.
    5. The Contracts are individual or group deferred variable annuity 
contracts or variable life insurance policies. As set forth in the 
prospectuses for the Contracts, Commonwealth reserves the right to 
substitute shares of another registered investment company for the 
shares of any registered investment company already purchased or to be 
purchased in the future by the Separate Accounts.
    6. Applicants propose, as set forth below, to substitute shares of 
the Replacement Portfolios for shares of the Existing Portfolios 
(``Substitutions''):

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    7. The Replacement Portfolios are all series of the Trust. The 
Trust is an insurance-dedicated Delaware statutory trust that was 
organized on June 17, 2013. The Trust is registered with the Commission 
as an open-end management investment company under the 1940 Act (File 
No. 811-22865) and its shares are registered under the 1933 Act (File 
No. 333-189870). The Trust is a series investment company and currently 
has 30 separate portfolios (each, a ``Global Atlantic Fund,'' and 
collectively, the ``Global Atlantic Funds''). The following 13 Global 
Atlantic Funds comprise the Replacement Portfolios: Global Atlantic 
BlackRock Allocation Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined 
Core Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined Growth Portfolio, 
Global Atlantic BlackRock International Core Portfolio, Global Atlantic 
BlackRock Disciplined Mid Cap Growth Portfolio, Global Atlantic 
BlackRock Small Cap Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock U.S. Core 
Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined Value Portfolio, 
Global Atlantic BlackRock High Yield Portfolio, Global Atlantic Goldman 
Sachs Core Fixed Income Portfolio, Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Global 
Equity Insights Portfolio, Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Large Cap 
Growth Insights Portfolio, and Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Mid Cap 
Value Insights Portfolio.
    8. Global Atlantic, an Indiana limited liability company and a 
registered investment adviser, serves as investment adviser for each of 
the Global Atlantic Funds pursuant to an investment advisory agreement 
between the Trust, on behalf of each Global Atlantic Fund, and Global 
Atlantic.
    9. Each Replacement Portfolio is sub-advised by BlackRock 
Investment Management, LLC (``BlackRock'') or Goldman Sachs Asset 
Management, L.P. (``GSAM''). BlackRock is a wholly owned subsidiary of 
BlackRock, Inc. BlackRock is a registered investment adviser and a 
commodity pool operator organized in Princeton, New Jersey. BlackRock, 
Inc. and its affiliates had approximately $4.64 trillion in assets 
under management as of December 31, 2015. BlackRock is located at 1 
University Square, Princeton, NJ 08536. GSAM is a wholly-owned 
subsidiary of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and an affiliate of Goldman 
Sachs. As of December 31, 2015, GSAM, including its investment advisory 
affiliates, had assets under supervision of approximately $1.08 
trillion. GSAM's principal offices are located at 200 West Street, New 
York, NY 20182.
    10. The Applicants believe that the Replacement Portfolios have 
investment objectives, principal investment strategies, and principle 
risks, as described in their prospectuses, that are substantially 
similar to, the corresponding Existing Portfolios to make those 
Replacement Portfolios appropriate candidates as substitutes.
    11. Information for each Existing Portfolio and Replacement 
Portfolio, including investment objectives, principal investment 
strategies, principal risks, and comparative performance history, can 
be found in the application.
    12. Applicants state that in selecting the Replacement Portfolios, 
Commonwealth sought to simplify fund lineups while reducing costs and 
maintaining a high-quality menu of investment options that would offer 
a similar diversity of investment options after the proposed 
Substitutions as is currently available under the Contracts. Contract 
owners with Contract value allocated to the subaccounts of the Existing 
Portfolios will have lower or equal net annual operating expenses 
immediately after the proposed Substitutions as before the proposed 
Substitutions. With respect to all of the proposed Substitutions, the 
combined management fee and Rule 12b-1 fees paid by the Replacement 
Portfolio are the same or lower than those of the corresponding 
Existing Portfolio. The application sets forth the fees and expenses of 
each Existing Portfolio and its corresponding Replacement Portfolio in 
greater detail.
    13. Applicants represent that as of the Substitution Date (defined 
below), the Separate Accounts will redeem shares of the Existing 
Portfolios for cash or in-kind. Redemption requests and purchase orders 
will be placed simultaneously so that Contract values will remain fully 
invested at all times.
    14. Each Substitution will be effected at the relative net asset 
values of the respective shares of the Replacement Portfolios in 
conformity with Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder 
without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the 
Section 26 Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without 
change in the amount or value of any Contracts held by affected 
Contract owners.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    \2\ The Section 26 Applicants state that, because the 
Substitutions will occur at relative net asset value, and the fees 
and charges under the Contracts will not change as a result of the 
Substitutions, the benefits offered by the guarantees under the 
Contracts will be the same immediately before and after the 
Substitutions. The Section 26 Applicants also state that what effect 
the Substitutions may have on the value of the benefits offered by 
the Contract guarantees would depend, among other things, on the 
relative future performance of the Existing Portfolios and 
Replacement Portfolios, which the Section 26 Applicants cannot 
predict. Nevertheless, the Section 26 Applicants note that at the 
time of the Substitutions, the Contracts will offer a comparable 
variety of investment options with as broad a range of risk/return 
characteristics.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    15. Contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result 
of the proposed Substitutions. The obligations of the Section 26 
Applicants, and the rights of the affected Contract owners, under the 
Contracts of affected Contract owners will not be altered in any way. 
Commonwealth and/or its affiliates will pay all expenses and 
transaction costs of the Substitutions, including legal and accounting 
expenses, any applicable brokerage expenses and other fees and 
expenses. No fees or charges will be assessed to the affected Contract 
owners to effect the Substitutions. The proposed Substitutions will not 
cause the Contract fees and charges currently being paid by Contract 
owners to be greater after the proposed Substitution than before the 
proposed Substitution. In addition, the Substitutions will in no way 
alter the tax treatment of affected Contract owners in connection with 
their Contracts, and no tax liability will arise for Contract owners as 
a result of the Substitutions.
    16. The Section 26 Applicants agree that, for a period of two years 
following the implementation of the proposed Substitution (the 
``Substitution Date''), and for those Contracts with assets allocated 
to the Existing Portfolio on the Substitution Date, Commonwealth or an 
affiliate thereof (other than the Trust) will reimburse, on the last 
business day of each fiscal quarter, the Contract owners whose 
subaccounts invest in the applicable Replacement Portfolio to the 
extent that the Replacement Portfolio's net annual operating expenses 
(taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) for such 
period exceeds, on an annualized basis, the net annual operating 
expenses of the

[[Page 20669]]

Existing Portfolio for the most recent fiscal year preceding the date 
of the most recently filed application. Commonwealth will not increase 
the Contract fees and charges that would otherwise be assessed under 
the terms of the Contracts for a period of at least two years following 
the Substitution Date.
    17. From the date the Pre-Substitution Notice (defined below) 
through 30 days following the Substitution Date, Contract owners may 
make at least one transfer of Contract value from the subaccount 
investing in an Existing Portfolio (before the Substitution) or the 
Replacement Portfolio (after the Substitution) to any other available 
subaccount under the Contract without charge and without imposing any 
transfer limitations. Further, on the Substitution Date, Contract 
values attributable to investments in each Existing Portfolio will be 
transferred to the corresponding Replacement Portfolio without charge 
and without being subject to any transfer limitations. Moreover, 
Commonwealth will not exercise any rights reserved under the Contracts 
to impose restrictions on transfers between the subaccounts under the 
Contracts, including limitations on the future number of transfers, for 
a period beginning at least 30 days before the Substitution Date 
through at least 30 days following the Substitution Date.
    18. At least 30 days prior to the Substitution Date, Contract 
owners will be notified via prospectus supplements that the Section 26 
Applicants received or expect to receive Commission approval of the 
applicable proposed Substitutions and of the anticipated Substitution 
Date (the ``Pre-Substitution Notice''). Pre-Substitution Notices sent 
to Contract owners will be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 
497 under the 1940 Act. The Pre-Substitution Notice will advise 
Contract owners that from the date of the Pre-Substitution Notice 
through the date 30 days after the Substitutions, Contract owners may 
make at least one transfer of Contract value from the subaccounts 
investing in the Existing Portfolios (before the Substitutions) or the 
Replacement Portfolios (after the Substitutions) to any other available 
subaccount without charge and without imposing any transfer 
limitations. Among other information, the notice will inform affected 
Contract owners that that, except as described in the disruptive 
transfers or market timing provisions of the relevant prospectus, 
Commonwealth will not exercise any rights reserved under the Contracts 
to impose restrictions on transfers among the subaccounts under the 
Contracts, including limitations on the future number of transfers, 
through at least 30 days after the Substitution Date. Additionally, all 
affected Contract owners will be sent prospectuses of the applicable 
Replacement Portfolios at least 30 days before the Substitution Date.
    19. In addition to the Supplements distributed to the Contract 
owners, within five business days after the Substitution Date, Contract 
owners whose assets are allocated to a Replacement Portfolio as part of 
the proposed Substitutions will be sent a written notice (each, a 
``Confirmation'') informing them that the Substitutions were carried 
out as previously notified. The Confirmation also will restate the 
information set forth in the Pre-Substitution Notice. The Confirmation 
will also reflect the values of the Contract owner's positions in the 
Existing Portfolio before the Substitution and the Replacement 
Portfolio after the Substitution.

Legal Analysis

    1. The Section 26 Applicants request that the Commission issue an 
order pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act approving the proposed 
Substitutions. Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act prohibits any depositor or 
trustee of a unit investment trust that invests exclusively in the 
securities of a single issuer from substituting the securities of 
another issuer without the approval of the Commission. Section 26(c) 
provides that such approval shall be granted by order from the 
Commission if the evidence establishes that the substitution is 
consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes of the 
1940 Act.
    2. The Section 26 Applicants submit that the Substitutions meet the 
standards set forth in Section 26(c) and that, if implemented, the 
Substitutions would not raise any of the concerns that Congress 
intended to address when the 1940 Act was amended to include this 
provision. Applicants state that each Substitution protects the 
Contract owners who have Contract value allocated to an Existing 
Portfolio by providing Replacement Portfolios with substantially 
similar investment objectives, strategies, and risks, and providing 
Contract owners with investment options that would have total and net 
annual operating expense ratios that are lower than, or equal to, their 
corresponding investment options before the Substitutions.
    3. Commonwealth has reserved the right under the Contracts to 
substitute shares of another underlying fund for one of the current 
funds offered as an investment option under the Contracts. The 
Contracts and the Contracts' prospectuses disclose this right.
    4. The Section 26 Applicants submit that the ultimate effect of the 
proposed Substitutions will be to streamline and simplify the 
investment line-ups that are available to Contract owners while 
reducing expenses and continuing to provide Contract owners with a wide 
array of investment options. The Section 26 Applicants state that the 
proposed Substitutions will not reduce in any manner the nature or 
quality of the available investment options and the proposed 
Substitutions also will permit Commonwealth to present information to 
its Contract owners in a simpler and more concise manner. The Section 
26 Applicants also state it is anticipated that after the proposed 
Substitutions, Contract owners will be provided with disclosure 
documents that contain a simpler presentation of the available 
investment options under the Contracts. The Section 26 Applicants also 
assert that the proposed Substitutions are not of the type that Section 
26 was designed to prevent because they will not result in costly 
forced redemption, nor will they affect other aspects of the Contracts. 
In addition, the proposed Substitutions will not adversely affect any 
features or riders under the Contracts because none of the features or 
riders have any investment restrictions. Accordingly, no Contract owner 
will involuntarily lose his or her features or riders as a result of 
any proposed Substitution. Moreover, the Section 26 Applicants will 
offer Contract owners the opportunity to transfer amounts out of the 
affected subaccounts without any cost or other penalty (other than 
those necessary to implement policies and procedures designed to detect 
and deter disruptive transfer and other ``market timing'' activity) 
that may otherwise have been imposed for a period beginning on the date 
of the Pre-Substitution Notice (which supplement will be delivered to 
the Contract owners at least thirty (30) days before the Substitution 
Date) and ending no earlier than thirty (30) days after the 
Substitution Date. The proposed Substitutions are also unlike the type 
of substitution that Section 26(c) was designed to prevent in that the 
Substitutions have no impact on other aspects of the Contracts.
    5. The Section 17 Applicants request an order under Section 17(b) 
exempting them from the provisions of Section 17(a) to the extent 
necessary to permit the Section 17 Applicants to carry out some or all 
of the proposed Substitutions. The Section 17

[[Page 20670]]

Applicants state that because the proposed Substitutions may be 
effected, in whole or in part, by means of in-kind redemptions and 
purchases, the proposed Substitutions may be deemed to involve one or 
more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliated 
persons.
    6. Section 17(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, in relevant part, prohibits 
any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any 
affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from knowingly 
selling any security or other property to that company. Section 
17(a)(2) of the 1940 Act generally prohibits the persons described 
above, acting as principals, from knowingly purchasing any security or 
other property from the registered investment company.
    7. The Section 17 Applicants state that the proposed transactions 
may involve a transfer of portfolio securities by the Existing 
Portfolios to the Separate Accounts. Immediately thereafter, the 
Separate Accounts would purchase shares of the Replacement Portfolios 
with the portfolio securities received from the Existing Portfolios. 
Accordingly, the Section 17 Applicants provide that to the extent 
Commonwealth and the Existing Portfolios, and Commonwealth and the 
Replacement Portfolios, are deemed to be affiliated persons of one 
another under Section 2(a)(3) or Section 2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act, it is 
conceivable that this aspect of the proposed Substitutions could be 
viewed as being prohibited by Section 17(a). Accordingly, the Section 
17 Applicants have determined to seek relief from Section 17(a).
    8. The Section 17 Applicants submit that the terms of the proposed 
in-kind purchases of shares of the Replacement Portfolios by the 
Separate Accounts, including the consideration to be paid and received, 
as described in the application, are reasonable and fair and do not 
involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned. The Section 
17 Applicants submit that the terms of the proposed in-kind 
transactions, including the considered to be paid to each Existing 
Portfolio and received by each Replacement Portfolio involved, are 
reasonable, fair and do not involve overreaching principally because 
the transactions will conform with all but one of the conditions 
enumerated in Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act. The proposed transactions 
will take place at relative net asset value in conformity with the 
requirements of Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder 
without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the 
Section 26 Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without 
change in the amount or value of any Contract held by the affected 
Contract owners. The Substitutions will in no way alter the tax 
treatment of affected Contract owners in connection with their 
Contracts, and no tax liability will arise for Contract owners as a 
result of the Substitutions. The fees and charges under the Contracts 
will not increase because of the Substitutions. Even though the 
Separate Accounts, Commonwealth and the Trust may not rely on Rule 17a-
7, the Section 17 Applicants believe that the rule's conditions outline 
the type of safeguards that result in transactions that are fair and 
reasonable to registered investment company participants and preclude 
overreaching in connection with an investment company by its affiliated 
persons.
    9. The Section 17 Applicants also submit that the proposed in-kind 
purchases by the Separate Accounts are consistent with the policies of 
the Trust and the Replacement Portfolios, as provided in the Trust's 
registration statement and reports filed under the 1940 Act. Finally, 
the Section 17 Applicants submit that the proposed Substitutions are 
consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act.

Applicants' Conditions

    The Section 26 Applicants, and Global Atlantic as applicable, agree 
that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the 
following conditions:
    1. The Substitutions will not be effected unless Commonwealth 
determines that: (i) The Contracts allow the substitution of shares of 
registered open-end investment companies in the manner contemplated by 
the application; (ii) the Substitutions can be consummated as described 
in the application under applicable insurance laws; and (iii) any 
regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction where the Contracts are 
qualified for sale have been complied with to the extent necessary to 
complete the Substitutions.
    2. After the Substitution Date, Global Atlantic will not change a 
sub-adviser, add a new sub-adviser, or otherwise rely on the Manager of 
Managers Order (as defined in the application), or any replacement 
order from the Commission, with respect to any Replacement Portfolio 
without first obtaining shareholder approval of the change in sub-
adviser, the new sub-adviser, or the Replacement Portfolio's ability to 
rely on the Manager of Managers Order, or any replacement order from 
the Commission.
    3. Commonwealth or an affiliate thereof (other than the Trust) will 
pay all expenses and transaction costs of the Substitutions, including 
legal and accounting expenses, any applicable brokerage expenses and 
other fees and expenses. No fees or charges will be assessed to the 
affected Contract owners to effect the Substitutions. The proposed 
Substitutions will not cause the Contract fees and charges currently 
being paid by Contract owners to be greater after the proposed 
Substitution than before the proposed Substitution.
    4. The Substitutions will be effected at the relative net asset 
values of the respective shares of the Replacement Portfolios in 
conformity with Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder 
without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the 
Section 26 Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without 
change in the amount or value of any Contracts held by affected 
Contract owners.
    5. The Substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of 
affected Contract owners in connection with their Contracts, and no tax 
liability will arise for Contract owners as a result of the 
Substitutions.
    6. The obligations of the Section 26 Applicants, and the rights of 
the affected Contract owners, under the Contracts of affected Contract 
owners will not be altered in any way.
    7. Affected Contract owners will be permitted to make at least one 
transfer of Contract value from the subaccount investing in the 
Existing Portfolio (before the Substitution Date) or the Replacement 
Portfolio (after the Substitution Date) to any other available 
investment option under the Contract without charge for a period 
beginning at least 30 days before the Substitution Date through at 
least 30 days following the Substitution Date. Except as described in 
any market timing/short-term trading provisions of the relevant 
prospectus, the Section 26 Applicants will not exercise any rights 
reserved under the Contracts to impose restrictions on transfers 
between the subaccounts under the Contracts, including limitations on 
the future number of transfers, for a period beginning at least 30 days 
before the Substitution Date through at least 30 days following the 
Substitution Date.
    8. All affected Contract owners will be notified, at least 30 days 
before the Substitution Date about: (i) The intended Substitution of 
Existing Portfolios with the Replacement Portfolios; (ii) the intended 
Substitution Date; and (iii) information with respect to transfers as 
set forth in Condition 7

[[Page 20671]]

above. In addition, the Section 26 Applicants will also deliver to 
affected Contract owners, at least thirty days before the Substitution 
Date, a prospectus for each applicable Replacement Portfolio.
    9. The Section 26 Applicants will deliver to each affected Contract 
owner within five business days of the Substitution Date a written 
confirmation which will include: (i) A confirmation that the 
Substitutions were carried out as previously notified; (ii) a 
restatement of the information set forth in the Pre-Substitution 
Notice; and (iii) values of the Contract owner's positions in the 
Existing Portfolio before the Substitution and the Replacement 
Portfolio after the Substitution.
    10. For a period of two years following the Substitution Date, for 
Contract owners who were Contract owners as of the Substitution Date, 
Commonwealth or an affiliate thereof (other than the Trust) will 
reimburse, on the last business day of each fiscal quarter, the 
Contract owners whose subaccounts invest in the applicable Replacement 
Portfolio to the extent that the Replacement Portfolio's net annual 
operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense 
reimbursements) for such period exceeds, on an annualized basis, the 
net annual operating expenses of the Existing Portfolio for the most 
recent fiscal year preceding the date of the application. In addition, 
the Section 26 Applicants will not increase the Contract fees and 
charges that would otherwise be assessed under the terms of the 
Contracts for a period of at least two years following the Substitution 
Date.

    For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, 
under delegated authority.
Eduardo A. Aleman,
Assistant Secretary.

Applicants' Representations
1. Commonwealth is a life insurance company engaged in the business of writing individual and group annuity contracts and life insurance policies. Commonwealth was originally organized under the laws of Delaware in July 1974 and was subsequently re-domiciled in the state of Massachusetts effective December 31, 2002.
2. Prior to December 30, 2005, Commonwealth (formerly Allmerica Financial Life Insurance and Annuity Company) was an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of The Hanover Insurance Group (“THG”), formerly Allmerica Financial Corporation. On that date, THG completed the closing of the sale of Commonwealth to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (“Goldman Sachs”). Effective September 1, 2006, Commonwealth changed its name from Allmerica Financial Life Insurance and Start Printed Page 20666Annuity Company to Commonwealth Annuity and Life Insurance Company. Effective April 30, 2013, Goldman Sachs completed the transfer of the common stock of Commonwealth to Global Atlantic (Fin) Company, which is a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of Global Atlantic Financial Group Limited. Effective January 2, 2014, Forethought Services LLC acquired ownership of 79% of the shares of Commonwealth. Forethought Services LLC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Forethought Financial Group, Inc., which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Global Atlantic (Fin) Company. As of December 31, 2015, Goldman Sachs owns a total of approximately 22% of the outstanding shares of Global Atlantic; and other investors, none of whom own more than 9.9%, own the remaining 78% of the outstanding ordinary shares.
3. Each of the Separate Accounts meets the definition of “separate account,” as defined in Section 2(a)(37) of the 1940 Act and Rule 0-1(e) thereunder. The Separate Accounts are registered with the Commission under the 1940 Act as unit investment trusts. The assets of the Separate Accounts support the Contracts and interests in the Separate Accounts offered through such Contracts. Commonwealth is the legal owner of the assets in the Separate Accounts. The Separate Accounts are segmented into subaccounts, and each subaccount invests in an underlying registered open-end management investment company or a series thereof. A subaccount of one or more of the Separate Accounts corresponds to each of the Existing Portfolios. The business and affairs of the Separate Accounts, as unit investment trusts, are conducted by Commonwealth, as depositor thereof.
4. The Contracts are each registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “1933 Act”), on Form N-4 or Form N-6, as applicable. Each of the Contracts has particular fees, charges, and investment options, as described in the Contracts' respective registration statements.
5. The Contracts are individual or group deferred variable annuity contracts or variable life insurance policies. As set forth in the prospectuses for the Contracts, Commonwealth reserves the right to substitute shares of another registered investment company for the shares of any registered investment company already purchased or to be purchased in the future by the Separate Accounts.
6. Applicants propose, as set forth below, to substitute shares of the Replacement Portfolios for shares of the Existing Portfolios (“Substitutions”):

7. The Replacement Portfolios are all series of the Trust. The Trust is an insurance-dedicated Delaware statutory trust that was organized on June 17, 2013. The Trust is registered with the Commission as an open-end management investment company under the 1940 Act (File No. 811-22865) and its shares are registered under the 1933 Act (File No. 333-189870). The Trust is a series investment company and currently has 30 separate portfolios (each, a “Global Atlantic Fund,” and collectively, the “Global Atlantic Funds”). The following 13 Global Atlantic Funds comprise the Replacement Portfolios: Global Atlantic BlackRock Allocation Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined Core Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined Growth Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock International Core Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined Mid Cap Growth Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Small Cap Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock U.S. Core Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock Disciplined Value Portfolio, Global Atlantic BlackRock High Yield Portfolio, Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Core Fixed Income Portfolio, Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Global Equity Insights Portfolio, Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Large Cap Growth Insights Portfolio, and Global Atlantic Goldman Sachs Mid Cap Value Insights Portfolio.
8. Global Atlantic, an Indiana limited liability company and a registered investment adviser, serves as investment adviser for each of the Global Atlantic Funds pursuant to an investment advisory agreement between the Trust, on behalf of each Global Atlantic Fund, and Global Atlantic.
9. Each Replacement Portfolio is sub-advised by BlackRock Investment Management, LLC (“BlackRock”) or Goldman Sachs Asset Management, L.P. (“GSAM”). BlackRock is a wholly owned subsidiary of BlackRock, Inc. BlackRock is a registered investment adviser and a commodity pool operator organized in Princeton, New Jersey. BlackRock, Inc. and its affiliates had approximately $4.64 trillion in assets under management as of December 31, 2015. BlackRock is located at 1 University Square, Princeton, NJ 08536. GSAM is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. and an affiliate of Goldman Sachs. As of December 31, 2015, GSAM, including its investment advisory affiliates, had assets under supervision of approximately $1.08 trillion. GSAM's principal offices are located at 200 West Street, New York, NY 20182.
10. The Applicants believe that the Replacement Portfolios have investment objectives, principal investment strategies, and principle risks, as described in their prospectuses, that are substantially similar to, the corresponding Existing Portfolios to make those Replacement Portfolios appropriate candidates as substitutes.
11. Information for each Existing Portfolio and Replacement Portfolio, including investment objectives, principal investment strategies, principal risks, and comparative performance history, can be found in the application.
12. Applicants state that in selecting the Replacement Portfolios, Commonwealth sought to simplify fund lineups while reducing costs and maintaining a high-quality menu of investment options that would offer a similar diversity of investment options after the proposed Substitutions as is currently available under the Contracts. Contract owners with Contract value allocated to the subaccounts of the Existing Portfolios will have lower or equal net annual operating expenses immediately after the proposed Substitutions as before the proposed Substitutions. With respect to all of the proposed Substitutions, the combined management fee and Rule 12b-1 fees paid by the Replacement Portfolio are the same or lower than those of the corresponding Existing Portfolio. The application sets forth the fees and expenses of each Existing Portfolio and its corresponding Replacement Portfolio in greater detail.
13. Applicants represent that as of the Substitution Date (defined below), the Separate Accounts will redeem shares of the Existing Portfolios for cash or in-kind. Redemption requests and purchase orders will be placed simultaneously so that Contract values will remain fully invested at all times.
14. Each Substitution will be effected at the relative net asset values of the respective shares of the Replacement Portfolios in conformity with Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the Section 26 Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any Contracts held by affected Contract owners.[2] 

15. Contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed Substitutions. The obligations of the Section 26 Applicants, and the rights of the affected Contract owners, under the Contracts of affected Contract owners will not be altered in any way. Commonwealth and/or its affiliates will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the Substitutions, including legal and accounting expenses, any applicable brokerage expenses and other fees and expenses. No fees or charges will be assessed to the affected Contract owners to effect the Substitutions. The proposed Substitutions will not cause the Contract fees and charges currently being paid by Contract owners to be greater after the proposed Substitution than before the proposed Substitution. In addition, the Substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected Contract owners in connection with their Contracts, and no tax liability will arise for Contract owners as a result of the Substitutions.
16. The Section 26 Applicants agree that, for a period of two years following the implementation of the proposed Substitution (the “Substitution Date”), and for those Contracts with assets allocated to the Existing Portfolio on the Substitution Date, Commonwealth or an affiliate thereof (other than the Trust) will reimburse, on the last business day of each fiscal quarter, the Contract owners whose subaccounts invest in the applicable Replacement Portfolio to the extent that the Replacement Portfolio's net annual operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) for such period exceeds, on an annualized basis, the net annual operating expenses of the Start Printed Page 20669Existing Portfolio for the most recent fiscal year preceding the date of the most recently filed application. Commonwealth will not increase the Contract fees and charges that would otherwise be assessed under the terms of the Contracts for a period of at least two years following the Substitution Date.
17. From the date the Pre-Substitution Notice (defined below) through 30 days following the Substitution Date, Contract owners may make at least one transfer of Contract value from the subaccount investing in an Existing Portfolio (before the Substitution) or the Replacement Portfolio (after the Substitution) to any other available subaccount under the Contract without charge and without imposing any transfer limitations. Further, on the Substitution Date, Contract values attributable to investments in each Existing Portfolio will be transferred to the corresponding Replacement Portfolio without charge and without being subject to any transfer limitations. Moreover, Commonwealth will not exercise any rights reserved under the Contracts to impose restrictions on transfers between the subaccounts under the Contracts, including limitations on the future number of transfers, for a period beginning at least 30 days before the Substitution Date through at least 30 days following the Substitution Date.
18. At least 30 days prior to the Substitution Date, Contract owners will be notified via prospectus supplements that the Section 26 Applicants received or expect to receive Commission approval of the applicable proposed Substitutions and of the anticipated Substitution Date (the “Pre-Substitution Notice”). Pre-Substitution Notices sent to Contract owners will be filed with the Commission pursuant to Rule 497 under the 1940 Act. The Pre-Substitution Notice will advise Contract owners that from the date of the Pre-Substitution Notice through the date 30 days after the Substitutions, Contract owners may make at least one transfer of Contract value from the subaccounts investing in the Existing Portfolios (before the Substitutions) or the Replacement Portfolios (after the Substitutions) to any other available subaccount without charge and without imposing any transfer limitations. Among other information, the notice will inform affected Contract owners that that, except as described in the disruptive transfers or market timing provisions of the relevant prospectus, Commonwealth will not exercise any rights reserved under the Contracts to impose restrictions on transfers among the subaccounts under the Contracts, including limitations on the future number of transfers, through at least 30 days after the Substitution Date. Additionally, all affected Contract owners will be sent prospectuses of the applicable Replacement Portfolios at least 30 days before the Substitution Date.
19. In addition to the Supplements distributed to the Contract owners, within five business days after the Substitution Date, Contract owners whose assets are allocated to a Replacement Portfolio as part of the proposed Substitutions will be sent a written notice (each, a “Confirmation”) informing them that the Substitutions were carried out as previously notified. The Confirmation also will restate the information set forth in the Pre-Substitution Notice. The Confirmation will also reflect the values of the Contract owner's positions in the Existing Portfolio before the Substitution and the Replacement Portfolio after the Substitution.
Legal Analysis
1. The Section 26 Applicants request that the Commission issue an order pursuant to Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act approving the proposed Substitutions. Section 26(c) of the 1940 Act prohibits any depositor or trustee of a unit investment trust that invests exclusively in the securities of a single issuer from substituting the securities of another issuer without the approval of the Commission. Section 26(c) provides that such approval shall be granted by order from the Commission if the evidence establishes that the substitution is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes of the 1940 Act.
2. The Section 26 Applicants submit that the Substitutions meet the standards set forth in Section 26(c) and that, if implemented, the Substitutions would not raise any of the concerns that Congress intended to address when the 1940 Act was amended to include this provision. Applicants state that each Substitution protects the Contract owners who have Contract value allocated to an Existing Portfolio by providing Replacement Portfolios with substantially similar investment objectives, strategies, and risks, and providing Contract owners with investment options that would have total and net annual operating expense ratios that are lower than, or equal to, their corresponding investment options before the Substitutions.
3. Commonwealth has reserved the right under the Contracts to substitute shares of another underlying fund for one of the current funds offered as an investment option under the Contracts. The Contracts and the Contracts' prospectuses disclose this right.
4. The Section 26 Applicants submit that the ultimate effect of the proposed Substitutions will be to streamline and simplify the investment line-ups that are available to Contract owners while reducing expenses and continuing to provide Contract owners with a wide array of investment options. The Section 26 Applicants state that the proposed Substitutions will not reduce in any manner the nature or quality of the available investment options and the proposed Substitutions also will permit Commonwealth to present information to its Contract owners in a simpler and more concise manner. The Section 26 Applicants also state it is anticipated that after the proposed Substitutions, Contract owners will be provided with disclosure documents that contain a simpler presentation of the available investment options under the Contracts. The Section 26 Applicants also assert that the proposed Substitutions are not of the type that Section 26 was designed to prevent because they will not result in costly forced redemption, nor will they affect other aspects of the Contracts. In addition, the proposed Substitutions will not adversely affect any features or riders under the Contracts because none of the features or riders have any investment restrictions. Accordingly, no Contract owner will involuntarily lose his or her features or riders as a result of any proposed Substitution. Moreover, the Section 26 Applicants will offer Contract owners the opportunity to transfer amounts out of the affected subaccounts without any cost or other penalty (other than those necessary to implement policies and procedures designed to detect and deter disruptive transfer and other “market timing” activity) that may otherwise have been imposed for a period beginning on the date of the Pre-Substitution Notice (which supplement will be delivered to the Contract owners at least thirty (30) days before the Substitution Date) and ending no earlier than thirty (30) days after the Substitution Date. The proposed Substitutions are also unlike the type of substitution that Section 26(c) was designed to prevent in that the Substitutions have no impact on other aspects of the Contracts.
5. The Section 17 Applicants request an order under Section 17(b) exempting them from the provisions of Section 17(a) to the extent necessary to permit the Section 17 Applicants to carry out some or all of the proposed Substitutions. The Section 17 Start Printed Page 20670Applicants state that because the proposed Substitutions may be effected, in whole or in part, by means of in-kind redemptions and purchases, the proposed Substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliated persons.
6. Section 17(a)(1) of the 1940 Act, in relevant part, prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company, or any affiliated person of such person, acting as principal, from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company. Section 17(a)(2) of the 1940 Act generally prohibits the persons described above, acting as principals, from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered investment company.
7. The Section 17 Applicants state that the proposed transactions may involve a transfer of portfolio securities by the Existing Portfolios to the Separate Accounts. Immediately thereafter, the Separate Accounts would purchase shares of the Replacement Portfolios with the portfolio securities received from the Existing Portfolios. Accordingly, the Section 17 Applicants provide that to the extent Commonwealth and the Existing Portfolios, and Commonwealth and the Replacement Portfolios, are deemed to be affiliated persons of one another under Section 2(a)(3) or Section 2(a)(9) of the 1940 Act, it is conceivable that this aspect of the proposed Substitutions could be viewed as being prohibited by Section 17(a). Accordingly, the Section 17 Applicants have determined to seek relief from Section 17(a).
8. The Section 17 Applicants submit that the terms of the proposed in-kind purchases of shares of the Replacement Portfolios by the Separate Accounts, including the consideration to be paid and received, as described in the application, are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned. The Section 17 Applicants submit that the terms of the proposed in-kind transactions, including the considered to be paid to each Existing Portfolio and received by each Replacement Portfolio involved, are reasonable, fair and do not involve overreaching principally because the transactions will conform with all but one of the conditions enumerated in Rule 17a-7 under the 1940 Act. The proposed transactions will take place at relative net asset value in conformity with the requirements of Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the Section 26 Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any Contract held by the affected Contract owners. The Substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected Contract owners in connection with their Contracts, and no tax liability will arise for Contract owners as a result of the Substitutions. The fees and charges under the Contracts will not increase because of the Substitutions. Even though the Separate Accounts, Commonwealth and the Trust may not rely on Rule 17a-7, the Section 17 Applicants believe that the rule's conditions outline the type of safeguards that result in transactions that are fair and reasonable to registered investment company participants and preclude overreaching in connection with an investment company by its affiliated persons.
9. The Section 17 Applicants also submit that the proposed in-kind purchases by the Separate Accounts are consistent with the policies of the Trust and the Replacement Portfolios, as provided in the Trust's registration statement and reports filed under the 1940 Act. Finally, the Section 17 Applicants submit that the proposed Substitutions are consistent with the general purposes of the 1940 Act.
Applicants' Conditions
The Section 26 Applicants, and Global Atlantic as applicable, agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions:
1. The Substitutions will not be effected unless Commonwealth determines that: (i) The Contracts allow the substitution of shares of registered open-end investment companies in the manner contemplated by the application; (ii) the Substitutions can be consummated as described in the application under applicable insurance laws; and (iii) any regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction where the Contracts are qualified for sale have been complied with to the extent necessary to complete the Substitutions.
2. After the Substitution Date, Global Atlantic will not change a sub-adviser, add a new sub-adviser, or otherwise rely on the Manager of Managers Order (as defined in the application), or any replacement order from the Commission, with respect to any Replacement Portfolio without first obtaining shareholder approval of the change in sub-adviser, the new sub-adviser, or the Replacement Portfolio's ability to rely on the Manager of Managers Order, or any replacement order from the Commission.
3. Commonwealth or an affiliate thereof (other than the Trust) will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the Substitutions, including legal and accounting expenses, any applicable brokerage expenses and other fees and expenses. No fees or charges will be assessed to the affected Contract owners to effect the Substitutions. The proposed Substitutions will not cause the Contract fees and charges currently being paid by Contract owners to be greater after the proposed Substitution than before the proposed Substitution.
4. The Substitutions will be effected at the relative net asset values of the respective shares of the Replacement Portfolios in conformity with Section 22(c) of the 1940 Act and Rule 22c-1 thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the Section 26 Applicants. The Substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any Contracts held by affected Contract owners.
5. The Substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected Contract owners in connection with their Contracts, and no tax liability will arise for Contract owners as a result of the Substitutions.
6. The obligations of the Section 26 Applicants, and the rights of the affected Contract owners, under the Contracts of affected Contract owners will not be altered in any way.
7. Affected Contract owners will be permitted to make at least one transfer of Contract value from the subaccount investing in the Existing Portfolio (before the Substitution Date) or the Replacement Portfolio (after the Substitution Date) to any other available investment option under the Contract without charge for a period beginning at least 30 days before the Substitution Date through at least 30 days following the Substitution Date. Except as described in any market timing/short-term trading provisions of the relevant prospectus, the Section 26 Applicants will not exercise any rights reserved under the Contracts to impose restrictions on transfers between the subaccounts under the Contracts, including limitations on the future number of transfers, for a period beginning at least 30 days before the Substitution Date through at least 30 days following the Substitution Date.
8. All affected Contract owners will be notified, at least 30 days before the Substitution Date about: (i) The intended Substitution of Existing Portfolios with the Replacement Portfolios; (ii) the intended Substitution Date; and (iii) information with respect to transfers as set forth in Condition 7 Start Printed Page 20671above. In addition, the Section 26 Applicants will also deliver to affected Contract owners, at least thirty days before the Substitution Date, a prospectus for each applicable Replacement Portfolio.
9. The Section 26 Applicants will deliver to each affected Contract owner within five business days of the Substitution Date a written confirmation which will include: (i) A confirmation that the Substitutions were carried out as previously notified; (ii) a restatement of the information set forth in the Pre-Substitution Notice; and (iii) values of the Contract owner's positions in the Existing Portfolio before the Substitution and the Replacement Portfolio after the Substitution.
10. For a period of two years following the Substitution Date, for Contract owners who were Contract owners as of the Substitution Date, Commonwealth or an affiliate thereof (other than the Trust) will reimburse, on the last business day of each fiscal quarter, the Contract owners whose subaccounts invest in the applicable Replacement Portfolio to the extent that the Replacement Portfolio's net annual operating expenses (taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements) for such period exceeds, on an annualized basis, the net annual operating expenses of the Existing Portfolio for the most recent fiscal year preceding the date of the application. In addition, the Section 26 Applicants will not increase the Contract fees and charges that would otherwise be assessed under the terms of the Contracts for a period of at least two years following the Substitution Date.

     The Section 26 Applicants state that, because the Substitutions will occur at relative net asset value, and the fees and charges under the Contracts will not change as a result of the Substitutions, the benefits offered by the guarantees under the Contracts will be the same immediately before and after the Substitutions. The Section 26 Applicants also state that what effect the Substitutions may have on the value of the benefits offered by the Contract guarantees would depend, among other things, on the relative future performance of the Existing Portfolios and Replacement Portfolios, which the Section 26 Applicants cannot predict. Nevertheless, the Section 26 Applicants note that at the time of the Substitutions, the Contracts will offer a comparable variety of investment options with as broad a range of risk/return characteristics.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Adoption of Updated EDGAR Filer Manual



Document Number: 2017-15862    

Type: Rule    

Date: 2017-07-28    

Agency: Securities and Exchange Commission, Agencies and Commissions    


    The Securities and Exchange Commission (``the Commission'') is adopting revisions to the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval System (``EDGAR'') Filer Manual and related rules to reflect updates to the EDGAR system. The updates are being made primarily to reflect amendments made to several forms under the Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act'') and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'') to effectuate inflation adjustments and other technical amendments required under Titles I and III of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (``JOBS'') Act; support recent updates to Form C and Form D; includes instructions for hyperlinking to exhibits included with certain Securities Act and Exchange Act forms and makes certain corrective changes to previously revised sections. The revised EDGAR Filer Manual also announces updates to the technical specifications for the ABS-EE schema and terminates support for US-GAAP-2015, EXCH-2015, CURRENCY-2014, and COUNTRY-2013 taxonomies. The EDGAR system is scheduled to be upgraded on July 17, 2017.
