Martinez, Maria – Feather Plate “Maria + Popovi”




 












 





 





 



 
 



 
Martinez, Maria – Feather Plate “Maria + Popovi”
6" diameter

$ 2,300.00 




Availability: Out of stock



 This is a classic plate by Maria Martinez and her son, Popovi Da. Maria made and polished the plate while it was painted by her son, Popovi Da  (1923-1971). The plate is highly polished and has a feather pattern as the main design.  The surface of the plate beautifully reflects the light.  The feathers are very tightly painted, which is typical of the early pieces from the late 1950’s.   It is  signed on the back in the clay, “Maria Popovi“. The signature indicates that it was made around 1956-9.   The plate is in very good  condition with no chips, cracks, restoration or repair.

Martinez, Maria – Gunmetal Wedding Vase “Maria Poveka”




 












 





 





 





 





 





 





 





 



 
 



 
Martinez, Maria – Gunmetal Wedding Vase “Maria Poveka”
7"w x 10.5"h

$ 9,500.00 




Availability: Out of stock



 In the 1950’s Maria created a series of pieces which were simply stone polished with no design.  As she primarily made the pottery and polished it this was fitting with the other pieces of her career.  This is one of the few wedding vases we have seen of her work.  It is beautifully constructed with a round body and the elongated spouts. It is not just the symmetry of the wedding vase that is so striking on this piece, but the firing.  It has a beautiful gunmetal coloration with a very metallic appearance to the surface of the vase.  The base is indented and it is signed in the clay, “Maria Poveka”.  This is a combination of her Anglo and Tewa names.  Her name, “Poveka” means “Water Lilly”.  The wedding vase is in excellent condition with no chips, cracks, restoration or repair.

It is an important mediator of social life." (Morris, 1977, p. 216)PROXEMICSCHRONEMICSThe study of use of time.SUMMARYNonverbal communication refers to the interpretations of bodily actions, vocal qualities, use of space and time, and self-presentation cues.Nonverbal communication is inevitable, multichanneled, intentional or unintentional, possibly ambiguous, and the primary means by which we convey our emotions. The sources of nonverbal messages include use of body motions (kinesics: gestures, eye contact, facial expression, posture, and touch), use of voice (vocalics: pitch, volume, rate, quality and intonation, and vocalized pauses), use of space (proxemics: personal space, physical space, and use of artifacts), use of time (chronemics), and self-presentation cues (physical appearance, as well as, clothing and grooming).Although the meanings we attach to nonverbal behaviors are influenced by culture and gender, we can become more adept at sending and interpreting nonverbal messages. In terms of sending nonverbal messages, we can improve by being conscious of the nonverbal behavior we are displaying, by being purposeful in its use, by making sure that our nonverbal cues do not distract from our messages, and by making our nonverbal communication match our verbal messages, and by adapting our nonverbal behavior to the situation.In terms of receiving nonverbal messages, we can improve by not jumping to conclusions, by acknowledging context, by paying attention to multiple nonverbal cues and their relationship to the verbal message, and by perception checking.Examples.:It fliesit's moneyit's on our sideit heals all woundson time3Face can twist into5,000 expressionsSOURCESApplied Organizational Communication by Adler & Towne, 2003Knapp, 1972, p.vhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChronemicsLustin & Koester, 2003, p. 180Blum, 1998, p. 34Full transcriptMore presentations by
