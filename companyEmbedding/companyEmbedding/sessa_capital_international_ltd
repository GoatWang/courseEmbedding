Ashford Prime Responds To Lawsuit From Sessa Capital

Feb 03, 2016, 20:49 ET
		  		  					
						 from   Ashford Hospitality Prime, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


DALLAS, Feb. 3, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Ashford Hospitality Prime, Inc. (NYSE:   AHP) ("Ashford Prime" or the "Company") has been informed today of a lawsuit filed by Sessa Capital ("Sessa") against the Company and its directors. The Company disputes the allegations in the complaint and will vigorously defend against the lawsuit. The Company issued the following statement in response:
We believe this lawsuit is without merit and yet another distracting tactic by one shareholder to prioritize its own short-term interests. Sessa launched its campaign after the Company had already announced a strategic review process focused on determining the best path to maximize shareholder value. In contrast, we believe based on our limited interactions that Sessa is only interested in seeking an immediate sale of the Company, regardless of whether it is in the best interest of all shareholders or is the best long-term solution. 
The Company and its Board have been and remain fully committed to maximizing long-term shareholder value. As previously announced, the Company is currently conducting a thorough strategic review process, which may include a sale. Sessa should let the Board perform its fiduciary duty, rather than wasting time and resources on meritless claims.  
Ashford Prime would also like to correct some of the most egregious misrepresentations in this complaint:

The magnitude of the termination fee that Sessa is complaining about remains unchanged since the time of Ashford Prime's spin-off from Ashford Hospitality Trust, affording all shareholders ownership in the advisor – the potential recipient of the termination fee. 
Sessa has long been aware of the terms of the Company's advisory agreement and was fully aware of the termination fee's existence after it was already in place. Sessa increased its investment in the Company after the Company enacted the amendments to the advisory agreement that it is now criticizing. 
Further, Sessa has never meaningfully engaged with the Company.  The Company on numerous occasions offered Sessa opportunities to discuss its questions and ideas. However it is our belief based on our limited interactions with Sessa that since day one Sessa has planned to pursue a disruptive proxy contest and litigation to pressure the Company into a quick sale.
Ashford Hospitality Prime is a real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on investing in luxury hotels located in resort and gateway markets.
Ashford Prime has retained Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP as legal counsel and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. as financial advisor on this matter.

DALLAS, May 31, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Ashford Hospitality Prime, Inc., (NYSE:    AHP) ("Ashford Prime" or the "Company") today announced that it sent an open letter to Sessa Capital ("Sessa") stating that the Company's receptivity to settlement discussions still stands.  
The full text of the letter follows:








Dear Mr. Petry,
We have read your response to our open letter regarding a settlement, in which you rejected the terms of our settlement proposal in favor of "seeing the proxy contest to completion."  Although Judge David Godbey agreed with our determination that your proposed nominees are invalid and ineligible to stand for election at the Company's 2016 annual meeting, we nevertheless believe that it is in the best interest of all Ashford Prime stockholders that we put an end, once and for all, to the expensive and disparaging proxy contest and litigation that has engulfed the Company since you filed your lawsuits against the Company and announced your board slate in January.  To this end, we are writing to inform you that our previous offer to settle still stands so that the Company may refocus its full efforts to maximize value for all shareholders. 
As a reminder, the key elements of our proposal are as follows: 

Board Composition. We have previously announced a plan to expand the board by two, adding new independent directors with relevant hospitality industry experience. This would bring our total director count to nine, seven of whom would be independent. We would agree to involve Sessa in the selection of these two new directors. 
Special Committee for Advisor Transactions. The board of directors would form this new standing committee comprised only of independent directors, including at least one of the newly-added directors. All transactions with our advisor would be subject to this committee's prior approval. The committee would be tasked with and empowered to improve the terms of the advisory agreement. 
Settlement of Litigation and Standstill. The parties would immediately end their litigation, and Sessa would agree to a customary standstill that would provide the newly comprised board time to implement its business strategy without further distracting and expensive proxy contests brought by Sessa Capital.
We continue to believe that implementation of this proposed settlement would further enhance the benefits that we expect to be realized in connection with the Company's recently-announced strategic plan.  The Company has already made substantial progress in this regard, including:

The execution of a Purchase and Sale Agreement for the sale of the Courtyard Seattle Downtown Hotel for $84.5 million, subject to adjustment as provided in the agreement, which represents a purchase price of $338,000 per key and a trailing 12 month cap rate of 6.7% on net operating income; 
The repurchase of $5.5 million of our common stock, representing approximately 490,000 shares at an average price of $11.32 per share (as of May 27, 2016); and 
The withdrawal of the Company's capital from the investment fund, the proceeds of which are targeted for the Company's stock repurchase program.
We will continue to execute on these strategic review initiatives and others, and believe that the best is yet to come.
It is our sincere hope that you will join us in pursuing a path going forward based on constructive dialogue and cooperation.  We remain willing to move quickly to formalize the proposal outlined above.  You're welcome to contact us privately or publicly as to your answer.
Regardless of your choice, rest assured that we will continue to work tirelessly to create value for all Ashford Prime stockholders, including Sessa.
Sincerely,
Curtis B. McWilliams, Lead Independent Director  Stefani D. Carter, Independent Director  W. Michael Murphy, Independent Director  Andrew L. Strong, Independent Director  Matthew D. Rinaldi, Independent Director
Ashford Prime has retained Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft LLP as legal counsel. Moelis & Company LLC is acting as financial advisor to Ashford Prime in connection with Sessa's proxy contest.
Ashford Prime is a real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on investing in luxury hotels located in resort and gateway markets.

Such statements are subject to numerous assumptions and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control.
These forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated, including, without limitation: general volatility of the capital markets, the general economy or the hospitality industry, whether the result of market events or otherwise; our ability to deploy capital and raise additional capital at reasonable costs to repay debts, invest in our properties and fund future acquisitions; unanticipated increases in financing and other costs, including a rise in interest rates; the degree and nature of our competition; actual and potential conflicts of interest with Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc., Ashford Hospitality Advisors, LLC ("Ashford LLC"), Ashford Inc., Remington Lodging & Hospitality, LLC, our executive officers and our non-independent directors; our ability to implement and execute on planned initiatives announced in connection with the conclusion of our independent directors' strategic review process; changes in personnel of Ashford LLC or the lack of availability of qualified personnel; changes in governmental regulations, accounting rules, tax rates and similar matters; legislative and regulatory changes, including changes to the Internal Revenue Code and related rules, regulations and interpretations governing the taxation of real estate investment trusts ("REITs"); and limitations imposed on our business and our ability to satisfy complex rules in order for us to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These and other risk factors are more fully discussed in the section entitled "Risk Factors" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, and from time to time, in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC").
