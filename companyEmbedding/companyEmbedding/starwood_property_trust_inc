FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

At a Glance
Starwood Property Trust (NYSE: STWD) is a leading, diversified real estate finance company with:

Shares publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (STWD) and a current market capitalization of over $5 billion.
Total capital deployed since inception of over $29 billion.
A portfolio of over $10 billion across the company’s Lending, Investing & Servicing and Property business segments.
More than 350 employees globally dedicated to Starwood Property Trust.
The ability to leverage the platform of Starwood Capital Group, a leading global private investment firm with 25 years of experience and broad operating expertise across virtually every real estate asset class.
A market-leading special servicing business in the United States (LNR Partners LLC).
The size and expertise to successfully execute large, complex real estate transactions.
A strategy of mitigating risk by maintaining a diversified portfolio of investments.



Firm
Starwood Property Trust, an affiliate of global private investment firm Starwood Capital Group, is the largest commercial mortgage real estate investment trust in the United States.
Amid the depths of the Great Recession, Starwood Capital recognized that traditional commercial lenders were withdrawing from the marketplace and a significant need had emerged for alternative commercial mortgage financings. In response, the Firm established Starwood Property Trust and in August 2009 took the company public (NYSE: STWD)—creating the largest blind pool company ever traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The business has since grown dramatically, and Starwood Property Trust today is the nation’s largest commercial mortgage REIT, with a market capitalization of more than $5 billion.
The company’s core business focuses on originating, acquiring, financing and managing commercial mortgage loans and other commercial real estate debt investments. In conjunction with Starwood Capital, Starwood Property Trust in April 2013 acquired LNR Property LLC and subsidiary LNR Partners LLC, the largest special servicer in the U.S., thus gaining significant expertise in the distressed marketplace while also adding substantial scale and sophistication to the company’s operations. In addition, Starwood Property Trust in early 2014 spun off its single-family residential operations into a new entity, Starwood Waypoint Residential Trust (NYSE: SWAY), now trading as Colony Starwood Homes (NYSE: SFR) that is listed alongside Starwood Property Trust on the New York Stock Exchange—and is one of the largest publicly traded investors, owners and operators of single-family rental homes in the U.S.
With total capital deployed since inception of over $29 billion, Starwood Property Trust continues to solidify its position as one of the world’s leading non-bank real estate finance companies.

Business Lines
We have organized Starwood Property Trust into three business segments that encompass our focus on real estate finance and investment. Our diversified model allows us to deploy capital throughout the real estate cycle, while leveraging Starwood Capital Group’s broad expertise in global real estate markets.
Real Estate Lending
Real estate lending has been Starwood Property Trust’s primary business since the company went public in 2009. With total capital deployed in our Real Estate Lending segment of over $19 billion, Starwood Property Trust has built a leading franchise in the global real estate finance market. We provide a seamless, one-stop solution for our borrowers and are able to lend for our balance sheet across the capital stack, including providing first mortgages, subordinate debt, mezzanine loans and B-notes. We also leverage Starwood Capital’s global real estate expertise across virtually every asset class to help source, structure and underwrite lending transactions.
Real Estate Investing & Servicing
Our Real Estate Investing & Servicing (REIS) segment includes our commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) and commercial real estate debt investing business, our special servicing operations, and our commercial mortgage conduit platform. REIS’ market leadership position in CMBS investing and special servicing is the result of its disciplined and consistent approach to investing. Combined with extensive credit underwriting, acquisition, management and workout expertise, this approach has resulted in strong performance across multiple real estate cycles. REIS is led by a seasoned executive team that averages more than 20 years of industry experience and over 19 years with the company.
Debt Investment
Utilizing a disciplined and consistent approach, Starwood Property Trust is a leader in both CMBS and commercial real estate debt investments, deploying over $4 billion of capital since 2013. Our due diligence process supports an unmatched execution capacity—including the ability to underwrite hundreds of commercial loans within a short timeframe, utilizing personnel across the United States and deep relationships in the commercial real estate brokerage community. The company’s investment decisions are informed by a proprietary database management system that tracks over 100,000 properties around the country.
Special Servicing
Starwood Property Trust operates the world’s largest commercial mortgage special servicer, LNR Partners LLC. Backed by nearly 250 employees, LNR is the named special servicer on 23% of all CMBS transactions in the industry, representing an unpaid principal balance of $93 billion. Since inception, LNR has resolved more than 5,995 non-performing assets with a total principal balance of over $66.4 billion across all major property types. LNR has maintained a resolution rate of over 81% on over 5,995 CMBS loans—and, of those resolved loans, $47 billion (71%) were liquidated.
To enhance communication and transparency, LNR has created a centralized repository, Windows Into Our Workouts, that enables investors to access detailed information on assets serviced by LNR, resolved over the last two years or in the process of being marketed for sale.
Starwood Mortgage Capital
Starwood Mortgage Capital is Starwood Property Trust’s commercial real estate conduit loan origination platform. Starwood Mortgage Capital originates competitively priced five-, seven- and 10-year fixed-rate mortgages throughout the United States, typically ranging from $5–$100 million, that are secured by all major real estate asset classes.

Property
In 2014, Starwood Property Trust began investing in real estate assets to complement its Real Estate Lending and Real Estate Investing & Servicing segments. Starwood Property Trust’s equity investments comprise high-quality, stable real estate assets that contain a value-added element, thus allowing the company the opportunity to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns. We focus on investing in properties that generate current cash-on-cash returns while also offering the potential for capital appreciation.


Edge
Starwood Property Trust occupies a unique position in the global real estate finance market, based on the following differentiators:
DEEP, HANDS-ON REAL ESTATE PERSPECTIVE
Starwood Property Trust is led by a seasoned management team that has successfully navigated multiple real estate cycles, with a track record of deploying over $29 billion of capital since the company’s inception. In addition, our affiliation with Starwood Capital allows us to capitalize upon the Firm’s 25 years of experience as a real estate investor and broad operating expertise across virtually every real estate asset class. As a result, we possess a granular understanding of real estate credit risk, and can evaluate each transaction from both a lender’s and equity investor’s perspective.
Global Reach
Starwood Property Trust benefits from a leading global sourcing engine that comes from Starwood Capital’s position as one of the largest institutional real estate investors in the world, with 9 offices in four countries. As a result, we are able to cast a wide net in the search for investment opportunities, and can selectively pursue only those that offer the most attractive potential risk/reward profiles.
One-stop shop for complex transactions
With access to multiples sources of financing and an experienced team of loan origination and syndication professionals, we can offer a customized, one-stop solution to our borrowers—in keeping with our goal of being on virtually every major commercial real estate investor’s short list of preferred lenders. Underscoring our scale, the average size of our loans since inception is approximately $90 million, and we have the ability to structure and originate loans as large as $500 million.
in-depth Distressed market knowledge
Starwood Property Trust’s acquisition of LNR Partners, the largest special servicer in the United States, greatly expanded our expertise in the distressed marketplace. We can analyze both the commercial mortgage-backed securities markets and LNR’s special servicing portfolio to identify situations where we can provide potential solutions for troubled borrowers.
an information Advantage
The expertise developed through Starwood Capital’s symbiotic business lines enhances Starwood Property Trust’s judgment throughout the underwriting process. These investment platforms provide the company with critical, bottom-up intelligence that helps set the agenda for future transactions.
Global Opportunistic Real Estate
This has been Starwood Capital’s primary business since the Firm raised its first distressed real estate fund in 1992.  In executing this strategy, the Firm enables Starwood Property Trust to participate in global investment opportunities across all real estate asset classes and positions in the capital stack that offer compelling risk-reward propositions. For example, Starwood Capital has been one of the most prolific investors in distressed debt since the Global Financial Crisis, while acquiring cash-flowing office, residential, retail, industrial and hotel assets at discounts to replacement cost.
Retail
Starwood Retail Partners manages one of the largest regional mall operating platforms in the U.S., with a portfolio of 30 properties totaling 28 million square feet of gross leasable area and almost $6 billion of gross asset value. The team seeks to capitalize on opportunities in the fast-changing retail landscape by acquiring, redeveloping and repositioning premier real estate assets in the regional mall, lifestyle and power-center sectors. Starwood Retail Partners has built strong relationships with tenants and can provide accurate operating metrics to help fine-tune asset cash flow projections.
Hotel Brand Management
SH Group is a hotel brand management company that generates significant proprietary investment opportunities for Starwood Property Trust. SH Group brings operational expertise in the areas of revenue management, marketing, food & beverage, systems and cost management to the acquisition and underwriting teams of Starwood Capital and its affiliates. SH Group is the force behind some of the most groundbreaking and dynamic hotel brands in the world, including

1 Hotels
As a lifestyle hotel brand inspired by nature, 1 Hotels cultivates the best of socially conscious design and sustainable architecture, together with extraordinary comfort and an unrivaled level of service.
Baccarat Hotels & Resorts
Drawing upon the 250-year history of the iconic French crystal maker, Baccarat Hotels & Resorts delivers a groundbreaking vision of luxury in the world’s most illustrious locales.

Residential
In 2013, Starwood Capital created TRI Pointe Homes (NYSE: TPH)—a West Coast homebuilder that merged with Weyerhaeuser’s homebuilding business in 2014 to create one of the largest homebuilders in the U.S.—which provides a unique perspective on the U.S. residential markets. Starwood Land Ventures, one the nation’s leading providers of residential sites to the homebuilding industry, offers additional insights into land valuation trends in the U.S. and their resulting impact on residential property values.
Energy Infrastructure
Starwood Energy Group specializes in energy infrastructure investments, with a focus on the natural gas and renewable power generation and transmission sectors. Through its general opportunity funds, Starwood Energy Infrastructure Fund I and II, and other affiliated investment vehicles, Starwood Energy Group manages total equity commitments of approximately $2.3 billion, and has executed transactions totaling more than $5 billion in enterprise value. The team leverages its extensive operations, development, construction, acquisition and financing expertise to provide valuable insights into this rapidly evolving industry.
Oil & Gas
Starwood Oil & Gas invests in conventional and unconventional oil & gas assets in North America, and offers a unique perspective on the dramatic transformation of the energy sector. In 2013, the group made a $35 million investment in Northeast Natural Energy to fund the Charleston, WV-based company’s acreage acquisition and development program in one of the most prolific areas of the Marcellus Shale. In 2015, the group led a $110 million investment in EagleRidge Energy, a Dallas-based oil & gas producer focused on one of the lowest-cost natural gas shale plays in Texas.


Approach
Starwood Property Trust employs its expertise and highly diversified and scalable investment platform across all facets of real estate finance to seek to generate consistent, attractive returns for shareholders. In our pursuit of this strategy, we adhere to the following principles:
Provide a One-Stop Financing Solution for Borrowers
Since our inception, we have prided ourselves on our ability to disintermediate traditional senior mortgage and mezzanine lenders by providing one-stop, combined financing in a single seamless process for borrowers. Our focus on large, customized financing solutions has helped set us apart from our competitors.
Approach Real Estate Lending from an Owner’s Perspective
Starwood Property Trust has developed a culture of underwriting real estate loans with a long-term balance-sheet perspective. We also leverage Starwood Capital Group’s 25 years of real estate investment experience when sourcing and underwriting potential transactions.
Invest Across the Real Estate Capital Structure
Starwood Property Trust’s broad wholesale asset origination, acquisition and servicing model provides the company with the flexibility and expertise to invest across the real estate capital structure to take advantage of changing dynamics at different points in the real estate cycle.
Focus on Risk Mitigation
Starwood Property Trust is highly focused on mitigating risk in its portfolio. Our strategy is built on using modest financial leverage to seek to achieve our target returns, and our floating-rate business model provides protection from higher interest rates. In addition, our position as a leading commercial special servicer provides us with a unique credit hedge against our CMBS and loan investments.

Will Starwood Property Trust, Inc. Sink or Swim?
The real estate investment trust is a unique operator in its sector. Here's the case for investing in its stock.











                Eric Volkman
            

                (TMFVolkman)

For those who follow the hospitality sector even casually, Starwood Property Trust (NYSE:STWD) is a familiar-sounding name. Most likely that's because the real estate investment trust's near-namesake, Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide (NYSE:HOT), was the prize in a bruising takeover fight recently won by Marriott International.

IMAGE SOURCE: STARWOOD PROPERTY TRUST. 
Starwood Hotels might be the Starwood grabbing headlines lately, but Starwood Property Trust deserves some attention in its own right. It's a big, busy mortgage REIT with a unique slant on its business. Whether it's a winning stock is another question. Let's take a brief look at the company and find out.
Real estate starsStarwood Property Trust is the creation of ace real estate operator Barry Sternlicht, who was also the leading light at both financial services company Starwood Capital Group and Starwood Hotels & Resorts. He still serves as CEO of Property Trust and Capital Group, although the hotelier has been in different hands for some time.
Starwood Property Trust isn't a traditional mortgage REIT plowing its capital into mortgage-backed securities. Instead, its primary business is the direct financing of real estate projects, lending money to those that are unwilling or unable to get the credit they need from more traditional sources.





That doesn't mean these borrowers are unworthy. In the wake of last decade's financial crisis, banks and other commercial lenders now operate with many restrictions as to how they can extend credit. As a non-bank entity, Starwood Property Trust has far fewer obstacles.
Which is quite an advantage, especially with this company. Sternlicht has a long and genuinely distinguished history in real estate, and that experience informs Starwood Property Trust's business. 
Operationally soundSo how exactly does this shake out in Starwood Property Trust's results?
As far as fundamentals are concerned, Starwood Property Trust is still a relatively young company (it went public in 2009), and is growing comparatively fast. Annual revenue has more than tripled since 2011 (to last year's $736 million).





Trailing-12-month funds from operations (the crucial profitability metric for REITs, as it strips out depreciation and several smaller line items) have seen a nearly 740% jump over that time. That compares very favorably to several big names in the REIT world, mREIT Annaly Capital (NYSE:NLY) and equity player Realty Income.

STWD Funds from Operations (TTM) data by YCharts.
But as you can see, Starwood Property Trust's TTM FFO is down from its early 2015 peak. That has affected the stock price, especially when combined with the market's general fear of fresh rate hikes affecting the business of mREITS (in theory, higher rates raise the cost of a REIT's funding, thereby narrowing the spread between its higher funding costs and its returns).
The difference in price development is stark. Equity REIT Realty Income has done well over the past year, while its mortgage cousin Annaly Capital hasn't gone anywhere. Starwood Property Trust is in the same boat with another big mREIT, American Mortgage Capital, with both declining around the 20% mark.






STWD data by YCharts.
Rising to the surfaceA drop in price, of course, makes the dividend yield higher. Thanks to its stock's decline, Starwood Property Trust's $0.48-per-share quarterly payout yields a shade over 10% these days. That alone makes it a compelling investment case for income investors.
But it's not only the dividend. Starwood Property Trust is a unique operator in the mREIT space. It's a go-to option for commercial real estate funding, it knows how to finance even the most unusual or complex projects, and most importantly, it understands very well how to turn a robust profit doing so.
So it's a solid play on fundamentals, too, in my opinion, and its price drop is undeserved. This makes it a clear bargain at the current price.
The mREIT sea is big and, these days, often choppy. Starwood Property Trust, though, is a very sturdy ship with a solid crew. I'd put money on it staying well afloat rather than sinking in the coming years.
