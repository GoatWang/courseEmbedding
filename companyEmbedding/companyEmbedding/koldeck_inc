Our offering is being made on a self-underwritten and “best-efforts” basis: no
minimum number of shares must be sold in order for the offering to proceed. The
offering price per share is $0.01. The following table sets forth the uses of
proceeds assuming the sale of 50%, 75% and 100%, respectively, of the securities
offered for sale by the Company. To implement our plan of operations we require
a minimum of $42,000 for the next twelve months as described in our Plan of
Operations. If we receives less than a certain minimum percentage of the total
proceeds from the offering, the company will not have sufficient funds to carry
out its business plan. There is no assurance that we will raise the full
$100,000 as anticipated and there is no guarantee that we will receive any
proceeds from the offering.

The above figures represent only estimated costs. The estimated cost of this
registration statement is $8,000 which will be paid from offering proceeds. If
the offering proceeds are less than registration costs, Svetlana Mazur, our
president and director, has verbally agreed to loan the Company funds to
complete the registration process. Ms. Mazur’s verbal agreement to provide us
loans for registration costs is non- binding and discretionary. Also, these
loans would be necessary if the proceeds from this offering will not be
sufficient to implement our business plan and maintain reporting status and
quotation on the OTC Electronic Bulletin Board when and if our common stocks
become eligible for trading on the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board. Ms. Mazur
will not be paid any compensation or anything from the proceeds of this
offering. There is no due date for the repayment of the funds advanced by Ms.
Mazur. Ms. Mazur will be repaid from revenues of operations if and when we
generate revenues to pay the obligation.


Publishing market seems a competitive field with various companies operating
within. But we expect that the following features might help us enter the market
and take our own niche:

Full-time assistance to our customers in their work from beginning to end;

Assistance in promotion of the final work;

Additional services such as book covers design, illustrations and developing a
style of formatting and composition (in case of a series by the same customer we
work for).

Additional services such as workshops for the beginning writers who, probably,
might return to have their work edited, proofread and published.

We plan to keep all our customers informed on the whole process of writing of
their texts. Thus, we can let our customers get involved into the creative work
to the extent they wish.


Company Description
Koldeck Inc. was incorporated in Nevada on March 29, 2016. We are development
stage company and intend to commence operations in the publishing business where
we intend to provide services of professional ghost writers, content writers,
editors and publishers. Our main business activity is content


 writing and
editing services. We plan to deliver our services to both individuals and
companies, as well as to printed or digital newspapers and magazines. Our main
objective is to provide our customers with a quality service of text composing
and editing of written materials. As additional services we may offer help with
illustrating and designing of book covers, as we plan to hire professional
designers if business turns out profitable. We plan to write the texts based on
data provided by our customers by mail, by phone or directly in person during
the interviews. We also plan to deliver services on writing creative texts such
as pieces of fiction, poetry, blog posts, articles for magazines or newspapers.
We also plan to deliver texts non related to fiction such as, business
proposals, presentations, bids, customer offers and letters. We also plan to
offer turning drafts of our customers into concise texts by editing or
rewriting. We also plan to carry out the jobs of editing or rewriting texts to
make them more appealing to the final reader, as well as to make them look
professionally written. As business grows we may change our services to the
needs of the markets or to the needs of the company or to meet the requirements
of our customers.

Our principal services may be split into the following groups:

Creative writing - assistance in writing complete books, manuscripts,
biographies, stage plays or screenplays, or plots, or outlines for the works
mentioned;

Business writing - assistance in writing bids, proposals, letters,
presentations, research papers;

Editing - editing and formatting services, completing or rewriting the texts of
non-professional writers;

Publishing - finding a publisher, designing a book cover or illustrations.

Once the customer chooses their package they agree upon the schedule of
receiving and reviewing the work in progress.
