* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.95% for CHAU and 0.80% for CHAD. The Funds’ Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with each Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse each Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2017, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.95% for CHAU, and 0.80% for CHAD, other than the following: taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions, expenses incurred in connection with any merger or reorganization and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate.

Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus or summary prospectus.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
Single inverse ETFs are trading tools that allow investors to either seek profit or seek to apply a hedge for an existing portfolio position that they anticipate will experience negative returns, in the short term.

The fund allows investors a tactical trading alternative to selling out of an existing position and creating a taxable event.
Since it does not employ leverage, compounding is less magnified compared to leveraged inverse ETFs.

Inverse ETFs are designed to move in the opposite direction of their benchmarks on a daily basis, and should not be expected to track their underlying indexes over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand the consequences of seeking daily inverse investment results and intend to actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The CSI 300 Index (CSIN0301) is a modified free-float market capitalization weighted index comprised of the largest and most liquid stocks in the Chinese A-share market. Index constituent stocks must have been listed for more than three months (unless the stock’s average daily A-share market capitalization since its initial listing ranks among the top 30 of all A-shares) and must not be experiencing obvious abnormal fluctuations or market manipulations. One cannot invest directly in an Index.

If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.

Investment Philosophy 




Investment Philosophy







Overpaying for a stock is one of the greatest investment risks. It can be managed by developing an intimate knowledge of every stock in the portfolioAPS’ investment philosophy is centered on investigative research, rigorous valuation and constant testing of our own investment theses. Our investment philosophy and approach have remained unchanged since APS’ founding in 1995.Investigative Research, Beyond Bottom-UpAsian markets have traditionally been inefficient and they are best exploited by 1) experienced local investment professionals and 2) probing research. We conduct on-site visits; field investigations including interviews with former employees, competitors, suppliers, industry specialists and other stakeholders; and verification of information and data with independent sources. The extensive, granular body of knowledge we collect through this approach enables us to more effectively value a stock, conduct due diligence and think independently of consensus.Rigorous ValuationDuring some market cycles, investors tend to price securities irrationally and incorrectly. Thus, tools such as economic forecasting and modelling cannot be used reliably to produce outperformance and reduce downside risk in the retail-dominated Asian markets. Instead, portfolio risk can be mitigated by constructing a portfolio of alpha-diversified strategies (please see our explanation of alpha groups in the Alpha Groups & Generation section ). Our focus is on each company’s intrinsic worth, and whether the listed price reflects that worth. The key to our success over the years is to buy at inexpensive valuations and to sell when a stock’s valuation becomes overstretched compared to its fundamentals. Sell DisciplineWe adhere to a clear sell discipline and exit when: 1) prices run ahead of fundamentals; 2) initial assumptions are proven wrong; 3) there are major changes in the fundamentals of either the industry or company. Redefining RiskIn our view, there are risks greater than volatility, such as overpaying for a security vis-à-vis its fundamentals. That is why we examine every stock inside-out before making investment decisions—an intimate understanding of a company helps us to evaluate its behaviour under a variety of circumstances such as business and economic cycles, political fluctuations, regulatory changes, structural events, management changeovers, among others.We also focus on a relatively concentrated portfolio of high-conviction stocks, which allows us to initiate positions at reasonable valuations. Our portfolios are also managed with liquidity risk in mind. Only a small proportion of the portfolio is exposed to illiquid stocks from time to time, and as appropriate, in order to earn an illiquidity premium. Competitive Advantages From APS’ Investment Approach1. Our investment decisions are based on insights that can only be gained through a disciplined and rigorously applied process. It goes beyond bottom-up research. 2. When the company’s internal or external circumstances evolve, we have sufficient facts to test and validate our investment theses and make rational decisions, without being influenced by market noise.3. This knowledge gives us the conviction to stay invested when less-informed investors irrationally run for the exit, revise our investment theses as needed and set valuation targets.

Alpha Groups







APS’ portfolios are “alpha diversified” for optimal alpha generationEvery stock in our portfolios is classified under 1 of 4 alpha groups: Structural alpha stocks possess structural strengths and/or core competencies and will likely outperform over the longer term. The investment horizon is normally more than 3 years.Dynamic alpha stocks are subject to cyclical factors such as troughs and peaks in sectors such as semi-conductor, property and airlines. The investment horizon is about 2 years. Economic alpha stocks are undervalued; they have a healthy earnings growth rate yet trade at a large discount to intrinsic value. The investment horizon is 1-3 years.Opportunistic alpha stocks are experiencing special events such as restructuring, product repositioning, mergers and acquisitions, etc. The investment horizon is relatively short, at 6-12 months.

 Hedge Fund Interview with Wong Kok Hoi, Founder, Chairman and CIO of APS Asset Management Pte Ltd   
 November 2010 |  Eurekahedge 





   

 











Founded in 1995, APS provides fund management services specialising in Asia Pacific equity investments. APS is a fully independent firm owned 100% by its employees. Mr Wong Kok Hoi, founder, Chairman and CIO of APS, has more than 29 years of investment experience. APS has three teams of 24 investment professionals based in Singapore, China and Japan, managing three key products, ie, Asia ex-Japan, Greater China and Japan equities. As a bottom-up fundamental manager, APS prides itself on contrarian and creative thinking and original research, and seeks to enhance its clients' portfolios by superior stock-picking. APS's clients are mainly institutions that include pension funds, foundations and family offices based in North America, Europe, Australia/New Zealand and Asia.
Earlier this year, APS won a number of awards. Asia Asset Management named the APS China A-Share Fund "Best of the Best Awards China A-Share 3 Years". APS also received accolades from Hedge Funds World for the APS Asia Pacific-Hedge Fund "Best Performing New Fund". Recently, the APS Asia-Pacific Hedge Fund was the winner of "Fund of the Year" Award in the Asia including Japan category by AsiaHedge Awards 2010. Last year, APS Far East Ex-Japan product was ranked "Best Fund for Past One and Two Years" based on Mercer Investment Consulting Survey for Far East Ex-Japan Equity Funds Ending December 2009.
The performance and AuM of the funds are as follows:

In 2010, many funds have struggled in volatile, unpredictable and non-trending markets. Your funds, on the other hand, have performed admirably. How did you deliver this performance?
Many funds are trend-following and where the trends are volatile and unpredictable, following them can lead to volatile and unpredictable investment returns. At APS, we have a very different approach. We do not follow trends, especially short-term trends. We look for value and attractive businesses. When we find them, we do our due diligence to confirm that our investment hypothesis is correct and then we invest for the long-term. The turnover on our long-only funds typically is between 30% and 40%, so we are not traders. When you focus on the long-term prospects of a business, you can generate attractive risk-adjusted returns for your investors.


One of the themes this year has been the weakening US dollar. Were you able to capture the opportunities presented? Assuming that this trend continues, how do you intend to capitalise on it going forward?
If Asian economies were still dependent on exports to the developed markets where there is a high degree of substitution, the weakening dollar would have presented a greater problem.  The fact is that Asia companies now produce many goods and services that other countries do not, whether it is a low-cost apparel made in Sri Lanka or iPhones and iPads in China.  Moreover, the largest economy in the region, China, effectively has pegged its currency to the US dollar so its weakening has, if anything, strengthened China's positioning as a global low-cost exporter.


What have you done differently in the post-Lehman world to meet investor expectations in terms of performance? Have you changed your investing approach/strategies?
We have not changed our investing approach or strategies in the last 16 years. We have done extremely well in the last three years; our Asia-Pacific Hedge Fund is up 132% in the last three years because we hedged well in 2008. We like to believe that we stay disciplined to our investment process at all times and are not easily "carried away" by market euphoria or pessimism. Also, we already have robust risk controls but early this year, we strengthened them by adding real-time risk analysis systems for the portfolios. These systems help us to understand how the portfolios are positioned and what is helping and hurting in real time.


Of the different strategies employed by APS Asset Management, which has been the best performing over the years and why? What competitive edge do you offer investors investing in your funds?
Our investment strategies are consistent across all our products but our hedge funds, particularly the APS Asia-Pacific Hedge Fund, have performed very well in this tough, directionless environment. The markets in Asia remain inefficient and these allow us to identify and invest in undervalued companies on the long side and short overvalued companies on the short side. Our competitive edge, we believe, is our experience and our expertise in deep and thorough primary research. We have done just this in APS for 16 years and feel that we have become quite good at it. Last year, our APS Asia-Pacific Hedge Fund was up 96% and this year, in what has been an even more challenging environment, it was up 28% as of end-October 2010.


What sort of fundamental/technical analyses would you put into your pre-stock selection research? Could you tell us a little about your investment philosophy? How do you drive synergy across the different funds?
Our stock selection process is purely fundamentally driven; we do not use technical analysis.  Our core investment beliefs are that economic modelling in Asia is not reliable for reducing risk or generating excess returns and that securities can be mispriced by an irrational and volatile fast-moving market. We believe that we must invest independently from the market to generate strong alpha and, as such, we place importance on independence of ideas and thoughts and in-house idea generation by our investment professionals. The empirical evidence is that consensus underperforms.
Our analysts and portfolio managers source ideas from four main areas: structural and business trends, new companies and products, out-of-favour stocks and company-specific leads. Once we have identified an investment idea, it is then classified into what we call "alpha categories": structural, economic, dynamic and opportunistic alpha. Then, we conduct our due diligence and valuation work before a final investment decision is made by a portfolio manager. This results in a diversified "alpha portfolio".
We share ideas across different teams. We are blessed by a team of investment professionals that we built over the years. During the most challenging times in 2008, we retained all of our staff and hence were able to seize the opportunities during the bear and bull markets in the last three years.


Could you give us an overview of your risk management practices across the different funds - any changes over the last two years?
We have an independent risk analytics team, led by our Chief Operations Officer (COO), which monitors portfolio risk at the individual stock and portfolio level. We utilise proprietary "live" portfolio analytics which look at liquidity risk and concentration risk, among other variables. We prepare performance attribution analysis to view our largest contributors and largest detractors. We also have oversight by an independent compliance team to monitor trades and portfolio positions against investment guidelines and our portfolio guidelines are built into a front-end compliance system where trades are cleared before execution.


How has asset raising environment been in 2010 - any new launches or strategies to deal with the changed financial landscape?
Our strong performance over the past three years has generated a great deal of interest in our funds, particularly the APS Asia-Pacific Hedge Fund and the APS China A-Share Fund. As a result, we have seen an increase in our assets under management in both funds. We secured an investment in the APS Asia-Pacific Hedge Fund from one large pension fund in the US and we won our first Asian mandate from an Australian superannuation pension fund. Based on the level of interest we have seen here in Asia and in the US and Europe, we believe 2011 should see even more assets flow into our funds.
In terms of new launches, we launched the APS Greater China Alpha Fund in October 2010 managed by the same team which manages APS China A-Share Fund, which entered a soft close. Also, our open-ended Vietnam Alpha fund will be launched in the second quarter of 2011 to investors seeking to invest in one of the last frontier equities markets in the region.


What do you have to do differently in the post-Lehman environment to raise capital?
Post-Lehman, investors have higher demands for transparency and rigorous attention to investment guidelines, risk controls and compliance. In order to attract assets, I think we will have to demonstrate to investors that we have got skill-sets that can generate long-term alphas. And you will also have to articulate it well, not in a fuzzy or "black-box language" manner.  You also need to have a full infrastructure which we do. In fact, APS looks better as a result of higher investor demands - quite an irony!


How do you foresee the amount of stress laid on tightening regulations across the hedge fund industry to affect your fund? Are there any requirements that could potentially inhibit you funds' strategies?
If anything, the tightening regulations are good for our hedge funds. Our hedge funds are not that large, with the APS Asia-Pacific Hedge Fund just over US$100 million, typically the size which can generate the strongest returns to investors. As a firm, however, APS has US$2 billion AuM so our hedge funds, small as they are, are operating within a larger organisational structure. Investors can get the best of both worlds:  access to a smaller and strong performing hedge fund within a larger firm structure which reduces operational risks.


Could you share with us, your short-term and medium-term outlook on some of the regional markets?  
We remain bullish on the equities markets in Asia. In China, we believe the long-term growth story remains intact and valuations remain attractive. China trades at about 15x PER but offers superior growth prospects. Asia, too, is attractive. Asian economies are increasingly less dependent on Western economies, which is a positive given the sluggish economic environment there. Intra-Asian trade is rising and there is a greater importance within Asia of economies less sensitive to US. For instance, China, India and Indonesia comprise roughly 75% of Asia's GDP, according to the IMF, and are among those economies least sensitive to US growth. Southeast Asia also sees positive demographic trends. The population of 600 million is young, with over 50% less than 30 years old. Like China, countries such as Malaysia, Thailand, Philippines and India are entering a stage of economic development when rising GDP per capita leads to increases in domestic consumption. Finally, equity valuations are attractive in Asia, with most countries trading below a PER to Growth (PEG) ratio of less than one.

China A Shares ETFs | Direxion



























 






























China A-shares, which trade on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges, account for roughly two-thirds of the market capitalization of Chinese stocks. Since most foreign investors cannot purchase China A-shares, investors in most existing China ETFs lack exposure to the majority of Chinese companies.  Direxion Daily CSI 300 China A Share Bull 2x Shares and Bear 1x Shares offer liquid, transparent ways to trade A-shares in either direction.

Strategy & Benefits

Key Benefits
Single inverse ETFs are trading tools that allow investors to either seek profit or seek to apply a hedge for an existing portfolio position that they anticipate will experience negative returns, in the short term.

The fund allows investors a tactical trading alternative to selling out of an existing position and creating a taxable event.
Since it does not employ leverage, compounding is less magnified compared to leveraged inverse ETFs.

Inverse ETFs are designed to move in the opposite direction of their benchmarks on a daily basis, and should not be expected to track their underlying indexes over periods longer than one day. They are not suitable for all investors and should be utilized only by investors who understand the consequences of seeking daily inverse investment results and intend to actively manage their investments.







Target Index

The CSI 300 Index (CSIN0301) is a modified free-float market capitalization weighted index comprised of the largest and most liquid stocks in the Chinese A-share market. Index constituent stocks must have been listed for more than three months (unless the stock’s average daily A-share market capitalization since its initial listing ranks among the top 30 of all A-shares) and must not be experiencing obvious abnormal fluctuations or market manipulations. One cannot invest directly in an Index.

* The Net Expense Ratio includes management fees, other operating expenses and Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses. If Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses were excluded, the Net Expense Ratio would be 0.80%.  The Fund’s Adviser, Rafferty Asset Management, LLC (“Rafferty”) has entered into an Operating Expense Limitation Agreement with the Fund, under which Rafferty has contractually agreed to cap all or a portion of its management fee and/or reimburse the Fund for Other Expenses through September 1, 2018, to the extent that the Fund’s Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses exceed 0.80% of the Fund’s daily net assets other than the following:  taxes, swap financing and related costs, acquired fund fees and expenses, dividends or interest on short positions, other interest expenses, brokerage commissions and extraordinary expenses. If these expenses were included, the expense ratio would be higher.
The performance data quoted represents past performance. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate. An investor’s shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Returns for performance under one year are cumulative, not annualized. For the most recent month-end performance please visit the funds website at direxioninvestments.com.
Short-term performance, in particular, is not a good indication of the fund’s future performance, and an investment should not be made based solely on returns. Because of ongoing market volatility, fund performance may be subject to substantial short-term changes. For additional information, see the fund’s prospectus.
