Asbestos / Mesothelioma

The Law Offices of Patrick M. Walsh have represented clients suffering from mesothelioma for over a decade. Our lawyers know the medical nature of the disease, as well as the legal issues that surround it. In most cases, through a thorough investigation, we are able to determine how, when and where our mesothelioma clients were exposed to asbestos. Asbestos was used widely in a number of different industries up until the early 1980’s. These industries include: steel, automotive (mechanics), construction, rubber, plastics, and many other industries who utilized asbestos in the manufacture of their product, or in their facilities (pipe insulation, asbestos building materials). The only known cause of mesothelioma is exposure to asbestos.

At the Law Offices of Patrick M. Walsh, we help guide individuals, and the families of the deceased, through the process of recovering monetary compensation for the physical and emotional pain and suffering caused by mesothelioma. We begin by thoroughly reviewing the details of your case with you. Once we have performed a thorough investigation and determine that the mesothelioma is the result of occupational exposure to asbestos, we can file a product liability lawsuit against those companies that manufactured, distributed or supplied the asbestos that harmed you or your loved one.

Asbestos / Lung Cancer

As you may be aware, studies have linked lung cancer with smoking.  Lung cancer can also be caused by exposure to asbestos.  When both of these factors are present - smoking and asbestos exposure - an individual is 50 to 80 times more likely to develop lung cancer compared to the general population.  This is known as the "synergistic effect" of smoking and exposure to asbestos.

At the Law Offices of Patrick M. Walsh, we have represented thousands of individuals with asbestos-related diseases (including lung cancer) for over a decade and we have been successful in obtaining compensation for victims of these diseases and their familes.  Several companies used asbestos prior to 1980.  We will conduct a thorough investigation to determine where and how the injured worker was exposed to asbestos and the manufacturer, distributor or seller of the asbestos-containing product to which the injured worker was exposed.  

Asbestos / Non-Malignant Diseases

Exposure to asbestos can also cause non-malignant conditions such as pleural plaques and asbestosis.  Injured workers who believe they were exposed to asbestos should have chest x-rays taken on a routine basis.  These x-rays are read by specially trained "b-readers" who are qualified to review chest x-ray films to determine whether there are signs of asbestos exposure and asbestos diseases in the lungs of the injured workers.

The Law Offices of Patrick M. Walsh have been successful in obtaining compensation for victims of non-malignant asbestos diseases.

Short description




The Law Offices of Patrick M. Walsh have represented clients suffering from mesothelioma for over a decade. Our lawyers know the medical nature of the disease, as well as the legal issues that surround it. In most cases, through a thorough investigation, we are able to determine how, when and where our mesothelioma clients were exposed to asbestos. Asbestos was used widely in a number of different industries up until the early 1980's. These industries include: steel, automotive (mechanics), construction, rubber, plastics, and many other industries who utilized asbestos in the manufacture of their product, or in their facilities (pipe insulation, asbestos building materials). The only known cause of mesothelioma is exposure to asbestos...
 At the Law Offices of Patrick M. Walsh, we help guide individuals, and the families of the deceased, through the process of recovering monetary compensation for the physical and emotional pain and suffering caused by mesothelioma. We begin by thoroughly reviewing the details of your case with you. Once we have performed a thorough investigation and determine that the mesothelioma is the result of occupational exposure to asbestos, we can file a product liability lawsuit against those companies that manufactured, distributed or supplied the asbestos that harmed you or your loved one.

Dr. Walsh is best known for his pioneering work in the development of "the anatomic approach to radical prostatectomy", which involves nerve-sparing techniques that have reduced the probability of impotence and incontinence, and for his 30 years as the Professor and Director of the Brady Urological Institute.  He has also made major contributions to the basic understanding of benign and malignant neoplasms of the prostate.  Along with co-workers, he was the first to describe the 5 alpha-reductase enzyme deficiency, to develop an experimental technique for the induction of benign prostatic hyperplasia, to demonstrate the influence of reversible androgen deprivation on BPH, and to characterize hereditary prostatic cancer.  He was on the editorial board of the New England Journal of Medicine for 15 years and is a member of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences.  For 25 years he was the editor-in-chief of Campbell's Textbook of Urology, which has been renamed Campbell Walsh in his honor.  In 1996, Dr. Walsh received the Charles F. Kettering Medal from the General Motors Cancer Research Foundation for "the most outstanding recent contributions to the diagnosis and treatment of cancer." Dr. Walsh was honored as the 2007 National Physician of the Year for Clinical Excellence by America's Top Doctors®, and received the 2007 King Faisal International Prize in Medicine for his contributions to prostate cancer.   In 2012 he was awarded the Francis Amory Prize by the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.  Together with Janet F. Worthington, he authored  the best-selling books for lay people The Prostate: A Guide for Men and the  Women Who Love Them, which is published by Johns Hopkins University Press  (1995) and Warner Books (1997) and more recently, Dr. Patrick Walsh's Guide  to Surviving Prostate Cancer, Warner Books (2001), Warner Wellness (2007),  Hachette Book Group (2012).  Dr. Walsh  served as the president of both the American Association of Genitourinary  Surgeons and the Clinical Society of Genitourinary Surgeons.  To learn more about Dr. Walsh and his views on prostate cancer, watch his interview with Charlie Rose:

After designation as a Naval Aviator, Walsh began operational flying with the "Golden Dragons" of Attack Squadron 192, deployed to the Indian Ocean aboard the USS America and was later selected by Commander, Light Attack Wing Pacific, as the Junior Officer/Tailhook Pilot of the Year. He then reported to Air Test and Evaluation Squadron 5 as an Operational Test Director until selection to the Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron, “Blue Angels,” where he flew the Left Wingman and Slot Pilot positions. When he returned to the fleet, Walsh joined the "Golden Warriors" of Strike-Fighter Squadron 87 as the Operations Officer and flew combat missions in support of Operations Desert Storm and Provide Comfort from the USS Theodore Roosevelt.
Walsh commanded the “Gunslingers” of Strike-Fighter Squadron 105 for missions in support of Operations Southern Watch and Deny Flight from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower. He commanded Carrier Air Wing 1 for deployment in support of Operation Southern Watch aboard the USS John F. Kennedy. He also commanded Carrier Group Seven of the USS John C.
