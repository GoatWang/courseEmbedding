Making a Big Difference in the Smallest Patient Populations











Manufacturers whose products treat rare diseases take on higher complexity, more risk, and a greater purpose – helping patients who have no other treatment options.











Streamlining trials takes worldwide infrastructure and local expertise while increasing access to life-changing therapies takes demonstrating clinical and economic value.








Ensuring continuity of care takes integrated teams who recognize the barriers and challenges patients face and execute high-touch support services designed to address the needs of the whole patient.








Maximizing efficiency takes third-party logistics and tailored distribution strategies from a partner who has played a key role in the North American commercialization of nearly every successful specialty product in the last decade.








Patients and caregivers battling with a rare disease understand that every patient matters. So do we.








AmerisourceBergen’s Signature® Commercialization Strategies are designed around individual products and the unique needs of patients, providing end-to-end support for each step of the product and patient journey.









It takes experience, commitment and AmerisourceBergen to ensure your rare disease treatment reaches those who need it most.



Clinical Trial Specialty Logistics
For a patient with a rare disease, their lifeline often starts with a global clinical trial.

Toggle Details




Many orphan drug trials require specialized logistics to reach small populations in often geographically challenging locations. Fully integrated GxP-compliant temperature-controlled transport, storage and distribution solutions protect pharmaceuticals requiring cold chain logistics. Efficient management of integrated supply chain logistics improves quality and accountability in transportation, dispensing and storage. Additionally, a strategic partnership with the Medical Research Network offers a highly integrated model for both clinical trials and ongoing home healthcare. Particularly for patients requiring at-home storage, (helping to increase patient recruitment and retention while ensuring the integrity of trial products) technology can make all the difference. The RFID- enabled product storage system CubixxCT® ensures medication utilization and patient-reported outcomes can be tracked during in-home clinical trials, and beyond. The right partner, fully integrated transport, storage and distribution create efficiencies in clinical trials, bringing treatments one step closer to the patient.

Market Access Consulting
For a patient with a rare disease, payer coverage policies can create a barrier to treatment.

Toggle Details




By demonstrating incomparable product value and developing a market access strategy that is tailored to the requirements of local decision makers, manufacturers can overcome increased payer scrutiny. This requires a full understanding of the patient journey. Manufacturers must demonstrate how the product fits into the overall treatment experience, including better outcomes and a reduction in the patient’s total cost of care. This takes gathering insights from patients, caregivers and patient advocates who give voice to the unique needs of the patient population. While in parallel collaborating with physician KOLs to understand their awareness for the new treatment, identify factors that may limit utilization, and create plans to overcome any barriers.
Dedicated consultants, with expertise in the U.S., Canada, and key European markets, aid in developing customized strategies that keep these key stakeholders in mind while considering the complex and evolving reimbursement and competitive landscapes specific to orphan products. Additionally, burden-of- illness studies provide credible data that raise payers’ awareness of unmet needs within their own patient populations. With more of the treatment costs shifting to patients, and providers facing more administrative burden than ever before, designing patient and provider support services that make it easier to navigate a complex reimbursement landscape is more critical than ever. Whether it is evolving the product message as real-world data emerges or tapping patient advocates and advisory boards to stay abreast of payer perception and provider education, monitoring and strategic planning must continue post-launch to drive continued product access.

Patient Access and Adherence
The right advocate relationship makes all the difference for the patient.

Toggle Details




Making a difference can start before the product is even available. Because diagnosis and treatment is particularly arduous for patients with a rare disease, expanded access programs offered prior to FDA approval can provide much- needed support. By preparing providers, patients and caregivers with disease state education, as well as access to registries, manufacturers can build a patient base in advance of the launch of an ultra-orphan therapy. Once a treatment decision has been made, patients and their caregivers must turn their attention to overcoming barriers to access and affordability. Knowledgeable advocates who understand the patient journey, the reimbursement landscape for a specific product, and who are empowered to solve problems, serve as a vital lifeline.
Advocates help patients realize the full benefit to customizable patient support by ensuring they are aware of all the services that provide education and advocacy within the rare disease community – improving speed to therapy, streamlining communications, and creating a consistent patient experience by connecting manufacturers, payers, patients and other healthcare stakeholders. They may assist with enrollment into the support program and provide education so patients and caregivers understand a particular therapy and its intended impact on their disease. Advocates also play an important role by providing logistics support for care coordination and free goods product shipments such as first dose, bridge products and patient assistance programs. Additionally, for patients using a provider-administered product, proactive advocates who navigate the access challenges that often accompany site of care changes enable better adherence to therapy.

Specialty Distribution
Access to treatments in all channels – in the hospital, at the physician’s office, or at home – is important for a patient with a rare disease.

Toggle Details




As the largest distributor of specialty pharmaceuticals reaching hospitals, physician practices, as well as specialty and retail pharmacies, our commercialization experts have the experience and insights to navigate complex distribution decisions. REMS programs, customized contracts and data solutions are just a few of the options that improve patient safety and enhance visibility to both the patient base and product sales trends.

As an example, Cubixx® Solutions technology automates inventory logistics and management functions so healthcare providers benefit from greater efficiency and control. This creates more time for what matters most: patient care. Additionally, an in-home version offers life-saving medications right at the patient’s fingertips.
With the largest collection of specialty physician GPO networks, access is available to thousands of providers across a wide range of specialties. GPO programs raise prescribers’ awareness of breakthrough treatments for rare diseases and enable consistent communication so critical prescribers are aware of not only information related to your products’ indications, but also its coverage, coding, and patient access support programs.

Specialty Pharmacy
We understand the need for detailed information on quality of care and outcomes measurements to improve the patient experience & communication

Toggle Details




Partnerships across AmerisourceBergen further enhance communication between stakeholders, which enhances patient care. In one example, national specialty pharmacy provider US Bioservices partnered with oncology practices a part of the ION Solutions GPO to establish nursing outreach programs that proactively manage patients at key milestones in their therapy. The specialty pharmacy tracks and monitors data, including information pulled from clinical trials, to determine when a patient is likely to experience side effects. The pharmacy then works with oncologists to develop communication and escalation protocols that identify any issues or positive reactions to therapy, all of which is reported back to the practice.
The right technology also plays a key role in improving connectivity between physicians and specialty pharmacy. MyPathpoint is a HIPAA-compliant web portal that provides physicians real-time access to shipment information, prescription status, refill notifications, clinical notes and more. The portal is updated every 15 minutes so physicians can closely monitor patients’ access and ability to adhere to therapy. This proactive approach helps improve both patient adherence and patient outcomes by further reducing gaps in communication.

History[edit]
AmerisourceBergen was formed in 2001 following the merger of AmeriSource Health Corporation and Bergen Brunswig Corporation.[6] AmeriSource and Bergen were both successful pharmaceutical distributors that served similar markets but covered somewhat different geographies. Bringing the two together gave the company a strong national presence that was geared especially towards serving independent community pharmacies, regional retail chain pharmacies, hospitals, physician offices, clinics and other alternate care facilities.
AmerisourceBergen has 26 pharmaceutical distribution centers in the US, nine distribution centers in Canada, four specialty distribution centers in the US, and over 1 million square feet of packaging production capacity in the US and the UK. With the addition of World Courier, the largest specialty courier company in the world, over 150 company-owned offices around the globe were added to the company.
Lawsuit[edit]
In 2012 the state of West Virginia filed a lawsuit against AmerisourceBergen[7] On 5/17/2015, the West Virginia Gazette reported, "AmerisourceBergen, the nation’s third largest drug wholesaler, shipped 80.3 million hydrocodone pills and 38.4 million oxycodone pills to West Virginia over the five-year span — the highest totals for both drugs by any company named in the state’s lawsuit, according to the filing.[8] and that "The lawsuit alleges that the companies have helped fuel the state’s pain pill epidemic by shipping excessive amounts of prescription painkillers to southern West Virginia pharmacies."
Corporate structure[edit]
AmerisourceBergen operates its pharmaceutical distribution business under four primary units: AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation (ABDC), AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group (ABSG), AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services (ABCS) and World Courier. In March 2016 Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. announced it would exercise an option to purchase 22.7 million shares of AmerisourceBergen stock and thereby control 15% of the company.[9]
Good Neighbor Pharmacy[edit]
Good Neighbor Pharmacy is an American retailers' cooperative network of more than 3,400 independently owned and operated pharmacies. It has a business affiliation with AmerisourceBergen, which sponsors the network and owns the name "Good Neighbor Pharmacy" Good Neighbor Pharmacy is the sponsor for "Thought Spot" the annual trade show held in Las Vegas.
ThoughtSpot[edit]
ThoughtSpot is a four-day trade show put on by Good Neighbor Pharmacy held in or around July in Las Vegas aimed for and limited to community and independent pharmacies.[10][11]
Exhibitors are represented throughout the healthcare industry including, brand name, generic and over the counter products. ThoughtSpot 2013 was hosted at the MGM Grand, Las Vegas from July 24 to July 27. Special guest musical performance by Bret Michaels capped off the week on July 27 at a special attendee-only closing event.[12]

History[edit]
AmerisourceBergen was formed in 2001 following the merger of AmeriSource Health Corporation and Bergen Brunswig Corporation.[6] AmeriSource and Bergen were both successful pharmaceutical distributors that served similar markets but covered somewhat different geographies. Bringing the two together gave the company a strong national presence that was geared especially towards serving independent community pharmacies, regional retail chain pharmacies, hospitals, physician offices, clinics and other alternate care facilities.
AmerisourceBergen has 26 pharmaceutical distribution centers in the US, nine distribution centers in Canada, four specialty distribution centers in the US, and over 1 million square feet of packaging production capacity in the US and the UK. With the addition of World Courier, the largest specialty courier company in the world, over 150 company-owned offices around the globe were added to the company.
Lawsuit[edit]
In 2012 the state of West Virginia filed a lawsuit against AmerisourceBergen[7] On 5/17/2015, the West Virginia Gazette reported, "AmerisourceBergen, the nation’s third largest drug wholesaler, shipped 80.3 million hydrocodone pills and 38.4 million oxycodone pills to West Virginia over the five-year span — the highest totals for both drugs by any company named in the state’s lawsuit, according to the filing.[8] and that "The lawsuit alleges that the companies have helped fuel the state’s pain pill epidemic by shipping excessive amounts of prescription painkillers to southern West Virginia pharmacies."
Corporate structure[edit]
AmerisourceBergen operates its pharmaceutical distribution business under four primary units: AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation (ABDC), AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group (ABSG), AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services (ABCS) and World Courier. In March 2016 Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. announced it would exercise an option to purchase 22.7 million shares of AmerisourceBergen stock and thereby control 15% of the company.[9]
Good Neighbor Pharmacy[edit]
Good Neighbor Pharmacy is an American retailers' cooperative network of more than 3,400 independently owned and operated pharmacies. It has a business affiliation with AmerisourceBergen, which sponsors the network and owns the name "Good Neighbor Pharmacy" Good Neighbor Pharmacy is the sponsor for "Thought Spot" the annual trade show held in Las Vegas.
ThoughtSpot[edit]
ThoughtSpot is a four-day trade show put on by Good Neighbor Pharmacy held in or around July in Las Vegas aimed for and limited to community and independent pharmacies.[10][11]
Exhibitors are represented throughout the healthcare industry including, brand name, generic and over the counter products. ThoughtSpot 2013 was hosted at the MGM Grand, Las Vegas from July 24 to July 27. Special guest musical performance by Bret Michaels capped off the week on July 27 at a special attendee-only closing event.[12]

History[edit]
AmerisourceBergen was formed in 2001 following the merger of AmeriSource Health Corporation and Bergen Brunswig Corporation.[6] AmeriSource and Bergen were both successful pharmaceutical distributors that served similar markets but covered somewhat different geographies. Bringing the two together gave the company a strong national presence that was geared especially towards serving independent community pharmacies, regional retail chain pharmacies, hospitals, physician offices, clinics and other alternate care facilities.
AmerisourceBergen has 26 pharmaceutical distribution centers in the US, nine distribution centers in Canada, four specialty distribution centers in the US, and over 1 million square feet of packaging production capacity in the US and the UK. With the addition of World Courier, the largest specialty courier company in the world, over 150 company-owned offices around the globe were added to the company.
Lawsuit[edit]
In 2012 the state of West Virginia filed a lawsuit against AmerisourceBergen[7] On 5/17/2015, the West Virginia Gazette reported, "AmerisourceBergen, the nation’s third largest drug wholesaler, shipped 80.3 million hydrocodone pills and 38.4 million oxycodone pills to West Virginia over the five-year span — the highest totals for both drugs by any company named in the state’s lawsuit, according to the filing.[8] and that "The lawsuit alleges that the companies have helped fuel the state’s pain pill epidemic by shipping excessive amounts of prescription painkillers to southern West Virginia pharmacies."
Corporate structure[edit]
AmerisourceBergen operates its pharmaceutical distribution business under four primary units: AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation (ABDC), AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group (ABSG), AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services (ABCS) and World Courier. In March 2016 Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. announced it would exercise an option to purchase 22.7 million shares of AmerisourceBergen stock and thereby control 15% of the company.[9]
Good Neighbor Pharmacy[edit]
Good Neighbor Pharmacy is an American retailers' cooperative network of more than 3,400 independently owned and operated pharmacies. It has a business affiliation with AmerisourceBergen, which sponsors the network and owns the name "Good Neighbor Pharmacy" Good Neighbor Pharmacy is the sponsor for "Thought Spot" the annual trade show held in Las Vegas.
ThoughtSpot[edit]
ThoughtSpot is a four-day trade show put on by Good Neighbor Pharmacy held in or around July in Las Vegas aimed for and limited to community and independent pharmacies.[10][11]
Exhibitors are represented throughout the healthcare industry including, brand name, generic and over the counter products. ThoughtSpot 2013 was hosted at the MGM Grand, Las Vegas from July 24 to July 27. Special guest musical performance by Bret Michaels capped off the week on July 27 at a special attendee-only closing event.[12]

History[edit]
AmerisourceBergen was formed in 2001 following the merger of AmeriSource Health Corporation and Bergen Brunswig Corporation.[6] AmeriSource and Bergen were both successful pharmaceutical distributors that served similar markets but covered somewhat different geographies. Bringing the two together gave the company a strong national presence that was geared especially towards serving independent community pharmacies, regional retail chain pharmacies, hospitals, physician offices, clinics and other alternate care facilities.
AmerisourceBergen has 26 pharmaceutical distribution centers in the US, nine distribution centers in Canada, four specialty distribution centers in the US, and over 1 million square feet of packaging production capacity in the US and the UK. With the addition of World Courier, the largest specialty courier company in the world, over 150 company-owned offices around the globe were added to the company.
Lawsuit[edit]
In 2012 the state of West Virginia filed a lawsuit against AmerisourceBergen[7] On 5/17/2015, the West Virginia Gazette reported, "AmerisourceBergen, the nation’s third largest drug wholesaler, shipped 80.3 million hydrocodone pills and 38.4 million oxycodone pills to West Virginia over the five-year span — the highest totals for both drugs by any company named in the state’s lawsuit, according to the filing.[8] and that "The lawsuit alleges that the companies have helped fuel the state’s pain pill epidemic by shipping excessive amounts of prescription painkillers to southern West Virginia pharmacies."
Corporate structure[edit]
AmerisourceBergen operates its pharmaceutical distribution business under four primary units: AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation (ABDC), AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group (ABSG), AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services (ABCS) and World Courier. In March 2016 Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. announced it would exercise an option to purchase 22.7 million shares of AmerisourceBergen stock and thereby control 15% of the company.[9]
Good Neighbor Pharmacy[edit]
Good Neighbor Pharmacy is an American retailers' cooperative network of more than 3,400 independently owned and operated pharmacies. It has a business affiliation with AmerisourceBergen, which sponsors the network and owns the name "Good Neighbor Pharmacy" Good Neighbor Pharmacy is the sponsor for "Thought Spot" the annual trade show held in Las Vegas.
ThoughtSpot[edit]
ThoughtSpot is a four-day trade show put on by Good Neighbor Pharmacy held in or around July in Las Vegas aimed for and limited to community and independent pharmacies.[10][11]
Exhibitors are represented throughout the healthcare industry including, brand name, generic and over the counter products. ThoughtSpot 2013 was hosted at the MGM Grand, Las Vegas from July 24 to July 27. Special guest musical performance by Bret Michaels capped off the week on July 27 at a special attendee-only closing event.[12]

History[edit]
AmerisourceBergen was formed in 2001 following the merger of AmeriSource Health Corporation and Bergen Brunswig Corporation.[6] AmeriSource and Bergen were both successful pharmaceutical distributors that served similar markets but covered somewhat different geographies. Bringing the two together gave the company a strong national presence that was geared especially towards serving independent community pharmacies, regional retail chain pharmacies, hospitals, physician offices, clinics and other alternate care facilities.
AmerisourceBergen has 26 pharmaceutical distribution centers in the US, nine distribution centers in Canada, four specialty distribution centers in the US, and over 1 million square feet of packaging production capacity in the US and the UK. With the addition of World Courier, the largest specialty courier company in the world, over 150 company-owned offices around the globe were added to the company.
Lawsuit[edit]
In 2012 the state of West Virginia filed a lawsuit against AmerisourceBergen[7] On 5/17/2015, the West Virginia Gazette reported, "AmerisourceBergen, the nation’s third largest drug wholesaler, shipped 80.3 million hydrocodone pills and 38.4 million oxycodone pills to West Virginia over the five-year span — the highest totals for both drugs by any company named in the state’s lawsuit, according to the filing.[8] and that "The lawsuit alleges that the companies have helped fuel the state’s pain pill epidemic by shipping excessive amounts of prescription painkillers to southern West Virginia pharmacies."
Corporate structure[edit]
AmerisourceBergen operates its pharmaceutical distribution business under four primary units: AmerisourceBergen Drug Corporation (ABDC), AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group (ABSG), AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services (ABCS) and World Courier. In March 2016 Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. announced it would exercise an option to purchase 22.7 million shares of AmerisourceBergen stock and thereby control 15% of the company.[9]
Good Neighbor Pharmacy[edit]
Good Neighbor Pharmacy is an American retailers' cooperative network of more than 3,400 independently owned and operated pharmacies. It has a business affiliation with AmerisourceBergen, which sponsors the network and owns the name "Good Neighbor Pharmacy" Good Neighbor Pharmacy is the sponsor for "Thought Spot" the annual trade show held in Las Vegas.
ThoughtSpot[edit]
ThoughtSpot is a four-day trade show put on by Good Neighbor Pharmacy held in or around July in Las Vegas aimed for and limited to community and independent pharmacies.[10][11]
Exhibitors are represented throughout the healthcare industry including, brand name, generic and over the counter products. ThoughtSpot 2013 was hosted at the MGM Grand, Las Vegas from July 24 to July 27. Special guest musical performance by Bret Michaels capped off the week on July 27 at a special attendee-only closing event.[12]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
