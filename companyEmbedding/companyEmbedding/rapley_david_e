Description
Molecular Forensics offers a comprehensive coverage of the
increasingly important role that molecular analysis plays within
forensic science. Starting with a broad introduction of modern
forensic molecular technologies, the text covers key issues from
the initial scenes of crime sampling to the use of evidential
material in the prosecution of legal cases. The book also explores
the questions raised by the growing debate on the applications of
national DNA databases and the resulting challenges of developing,
maintaining and curating such vast data structures. The broader
range of applications to non-human cases is also discussed, as are
the statistical pitfalls of using so-called unique data such as DNA
profiles, and the ethical considerations of national DNA databases.

An invaluable reference for students taking courses within the
Forensic and Biomedical sciences, and also useful for practitioners
in the field looking for a broad overview of the subject.

Provides a comprehensive overview of modern forensic molecular
technologies.


Explores the growing debate on the applications of national DNA
databases.


Discusses the initial phases of investigation to the conclusion
of cases involving molecular forensic analysis.
