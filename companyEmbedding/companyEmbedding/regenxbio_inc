The Company develops products candidates across the therapeutic areas of metabolic, neurodegenerative and retinal diseases. Its product candidate, RGX-314, is meant for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). Its product candidate, RGX-501, is meant for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH). It is also developing product candidates, such as RGX-111 and RGX-121, to address the neurological symptoms of two severe genetic lysosomal storage diseases, Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I (MPS I) and Mucopolysaccharidosis Type II (MPS II), respectively.The Company's gene therapy product candidates deliver genes to cells using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, which are non-replicating viral delivery vehicles that are not known to cause disease. Its product candidates utilize viral vectors from its gene delivery platform, which it calls its NAV Technology Platform. Its NAV Technology Platform consists of exclusive rights to AAV7, AAV8, AAV9, AAVrh10 and over 100 other AAV vectors (NAV Vectors). As of December 31, 2016, nine NAV Technology Licensees were developed over 20 product candidates using its NAV Vectors. MPS I is caused by defects in the alpha-l-iduronidase (IDUA) gene and MPS II is caused by defects in the iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS) gene, both of which encode for enzymes that are responsible for breakdown of cellular waste products. The Company has received investigational new drug application (IND) for RGX-314 for the treatment of wet AMD. It has initiated the enrollment in the Phase I/II clinical trial for RGX-501.RGX-501 uses the AAV8 vector to deliver the human low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene to liver cells. RGX-111 uses the AAV9 vector to deliver the human alpha-l-iduronidase (IDUA) gene to the central nervous system (CNS).

NAV® Technology | REGENXBIO











































NAV® Technology Platform

REGENXBIO’s gene therapy product candidates deliver genes to cells using adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors, which are nonreplicating viral delivery vehicles that are not known to cause disease. Our product candidates all utilize viral vectors from our proprietary gene delivery platform, which we call our NAV Technology Platform.
 
Our NAV Technology Platform consists of exclusive rights to AAV7, AAV8, AAV9, AAVrh10 and over 100 other novel AAV vectors (NAV Vectors). We currently have exclusive rights to over 100 patents and patent applications worldwide covering our NAV Vectors, including composition of matter claims for AAV7, AAV8, AAV9 and AAVrh10, as well as methods for their manufacture and therapeutic uses. We believe this patent portfolio forms a strong foundation for our current programs and with our ongoing research and development, we expect to continue to expand this robust patent portfolio.
 
The foundation of our NAV Technology Platform was discovered in an effort to identify next generation AAV vectors that could overcome the limitations of earlier generation AAV vectors (AAV1 through AAV6). We believe the key benefits of NAV Vectors over earlier generation AAV vectors potentially include: 
 

•	Higher gene expression
	    •	Longer-term gene expression
	    •	Broad and novel tissue selectivity
	    •	Lower immune response
	    •	Improved manufacturability



	  We believe our NAV Technology Platform is proving to be a significant advancement over earlier AAV vectors in delivering these therapies. Based on data derived from third-party clinical studies and animal models using our NAV Vectors, we believe our NAV Technology Platform possesses unique, beneficial properties that are not seen in earlier generation AAVs. We believe that our NAV Technology Platform, which underpins our internal development programs and the programs of our NAV Technology Licensees, will enable us and our partners to develop best-in-class gene therapy candidates for a wide range of disease targets due to these unique properties.

REGENXBIO Programs



RGX-314

RGX-314 is our product candidate for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). RGX-314 is being developed as a novel, one-time subretinal treatment for wet AMD that includes the NAV AAV8 vector encoding a gene for a monoclonal antibody fragment. The expressed protein is designed to neutralize vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) activity, modifying the pathway for formation of new leaky blood vessels and retinal fluid accumulation.
 
Wet AMD is characterized by loss of vision due to excess blood vessel formation between two layers of cells in the retina. This excess blood vessel formation results in fluid leakage that can result in physical changes in the structure of the retina and changes in vision. As this process becomes more severe, blindness can result from scar formation due to hemorrhaging.
 
Current ant-VEGF therapies require repetitive and inconvenient intraocular injections, typically ranging from every four to eight weeks in frequency, to maintain efficacy. Due to a variety of factors, including inconvenience and discomfort associated with frequent injections in the eye, patient compliance is a significant concern with anti-VEGF therapies. Patients often experience vision loss with reduced frequency of treatment.
 
We are currently enrolling patients with wet AMD in a Phase I clinical trial of subretinally delivered RGX-314.



RGX-501

RGX-501 is our product candidate for the treatment of homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), which is designed to use the AAV8 vector to deliver the human low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) gene to liver cells.
 
HoFH is a monogenic disorder caused by abnormalities in the function or expression of the LDLR gene. HoFH patients have very low levels or are completely deficient of LDLR, resulting in very high total blood cholesterol levels. This leads to premature and aggressive plaque buildup, life threatening coronary artery disease (CAD) and aortic valve disease.
 
The current standard of care in HoFH focuses on early initiation of aggressive treatment due to severe clinical effects of elevated LDL-C. Available therapies do not provide a cure and their use is limited due to tolerability and drug availability.
 
We believe that the liver is the preferred target organ for gene therapy of HoFH since LDLRs produced in the liver contribute to greater than 90 percent of the capture and breakdown of LDL, making the liver by far the most important LDLR producing organ.
 
We, together with trial sponsor University of Pennsylvania, are currently enrolling patients with HoFH in a Phase I/II clinical trial of intravenously administered RGX-501. RGX-501 has received orphan drug product designation from the FDA.




 RGX-111

RGX-111 is our product candidate for the treatment of Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I (MPS I), which is designed to use the AAV9 vector to deliver the human α-l-iduronidase (IDUA) gene to the central nervous system (CNS). MPS I is a rare recessive genetic disease caused by deficiency of IDUA, an enzyme required for the breakdown of polysaccharides heparan sulfate and dermatan sulfate in the lysosomes of cells. Many patients develop symptoms related to glycosaminoglycan storage in the CNS, which can include excessive accumulation of fluid in the brain (hydrocephalus), spinal cord compression and cognitive impairment.
 
Current standard of care treatments cannot treat the CNS manifestations of MPS I and leave a significant unmet need for a method to safely achieve long-term IDUA reconstitution in the CNS.
 
Delivery of the enzyme that is deficient within cells in the CNS could provide a permanent source of secreted IDUA beyond the blood-brain barrier, allowing for long-term cross correction of cells throughout the CNS.
 
We expect to file an IND for RGX-111 for the treatment of MPS I in mid-2017 and expect to begin enrollment in a Phase I/II clinical trial in the second half of 2017. RGX-111 has received orphan drug product and rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA.




RGX-121



RGX-121 is our product candidate for the treatment of Mucopolysaccharidosis Type II (MPS II), also known as Hunter syndrome, which is designed to use the AAV9 vector to deliver the human iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS) gene to the central nervous system (CNS).
 
MPS II is a rare, X-linked recessive disease caused by a deficiency in the lysosomal enzyme IDS. In severe forms of the disease, early developmental milestones may be met, but developmental delay is readily apparent by 18 to 24 months. Developmental progression begins to plateau between three and five years of age, with regression reported to begin around six and a half years.
 
Specific treatment to address the neurological manifestations of MPS II and prevent or stabilize cognitive decline remains a significant unmet medical need.
 
Delivery of the gene encoding the enzyme that is deficient within cells in the CNS could provide a permanent source of secreted IDS beyond the blood-brain barrier, allowing for long-term cross correction of cells throughout the CNS. We believe this strategy could also provide rapid IDS delivery to the brain, potentially preventing the progression of cognitive deficits that otherwise occur in Hunter syndrome patients.
 
Preclinical studies have demonstrated the potential therapeutic benefit of AAV9-mediated IDS gene delivery to the CNS through the cerebrospinal fluid to address neurological manifestations of MPS II. We intend to file an IND in mid-2017 to support the initiation of an early phase, dose-escalation clinical trial of RGX-121-based gene delivery via CNS administration in subjects with MPS II. RGX-121 has received orphan drug product and rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA.

AveXis and REGENXBIO Announce New Exclusive Worldwide Licenses for the Treatment of Two Rare Neurological Monogenic Disorders Using NAV AAV9 Vector
Jun 7 17
AveXis Inc. and REGENXBIO Inc. announced an exclusive worldwide license agreement for AveXis to develop and commercialize gene therapy treatments using REGENXBIO’s NAV AAV9 vector to treat two rare neurological monogenic disorders: Rett syndrome (RTT) and a genetic form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) caused by mutations in the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) gene. Under the terms of the license agreement, REGENXBIO will receive an upfront payment upon execution, ongoing fees, milestone payments and royalties on net sales of products incorporating the NAV AAV9 vector. Preclinical data demonstrating promising efficacy and safety of gene therapy treatments for RTT and ALS using NAV AAV9, generated by AveXis’ Chief Scientific Officer Dr. Brian Kaspar at Nationwide Children's Hospital, has been licensed by AveXis. AveXis intends to move forward with initiating IND-enabling studies in both RTT and ALS and plans to provide more details on these programs in the second half of 2017.


REGENXBIO Inc. Announces Initiation of Phase I Clinical Trial of RGX-314 Gene Therapy for Wet Age-Related Macular Degeneration
May 31 17
REGENXBIO Inc. announced that the first patient was dosed in a phase I clinical trial evaluating RGX-314 for patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD). This multi-center, open-label, multiple-cohort, dose-escalation clinical trial will assess the safety and tolerability of RGX-314 as a one-time therapy for patients with previously treated wet AMD. REGENXBIO plans to share an interim trial update by the end of the 2017. RGX-314 will be evaluated in a Phase I, multi-center, open-label, multiple-cohort, dose-escalation study in adult subjects with wet AMD in the United States. The study is expected to include approximately eighteen previously treated wet AMD subjects that are responsive to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) therapy and are 50 years of age or older. The study is designed to evaluate three doses of RGX-314 (3 × 10^9 genome copies (GC)/eye, 1 × 10^10 GC/eye, and 6 × 10^10 GC/eye). Primary endpoints include adverse events, certain laboratory measures (including immunological parameters) and ocular examinations and imaging (including BCVA and SD-OCT). The primary purpose of the clinical study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of RGX-314 at 24 weeks after a single dose of RGX-314 administered by sub-retinal delivery. Following completion of the primary study period, it is expected that subjects will enter the follow-up period and will continue to be assessed until week 106 to assess long term safety and durability of effect. RGX-314 is being developed as a one-time sub-retinal treatment for wet AMD. It includes the NAV AAV8 vector encoding an antibody fragment designed to neutralize VEGF activity, modifying the pathway for formation of new leaky blood vessels which lead to retinal fluid accumulation and vision loss. In preclinical animal models with conditions similar to macular degeneration, significant and dose-dependent reduction of blood vessel growth and prevention of disease progression was observed after a single sub-retinal dose of RGX-314.

Style Scores:



F Value | F Growth | F Momentum | F VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score
A


Momentum Score
A


VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
