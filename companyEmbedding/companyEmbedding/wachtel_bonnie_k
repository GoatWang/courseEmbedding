Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?

                                            WalletHub is by far my favorite credit monitoring tool and has made it really easy for me to gain an understanding of my score. Signing up was a very simple process and there were no extra strings attached.

Bed Bath & Beyond® Credit Card


                                            The Bed Bath & Beyond Mastercard was purchased from US Bank in October 2016. My advice: If you have been with US Bank and made the transition to Comenity - check your credit report.

                                            It is my opinion that you would do better to find a different company. In the long run they will charge you plenty and the support is virtually non-existent. They don't even have a working answering system. They are disorganized  and a nightmare to work with.

                                            i love banking with veridian, but the new updated online banking is garbage.10x harder to navigate than before staring from the log in page. Making simple transfers or even looking at accounts is harder and more confusing. bring back the old version.

I live on a fixed income. Its very difficult. My father and I are fairly comfortable, but due to the 40+ derogatory items on my credit report, which are all medically related. Lexington law, if you can afford their services, have done soo much for me. In only two months time, they removed 25+ items off my report. Unfortunately I'm unable to continue working with them, due to the roughly $100/mo fee, which is a bit too high for me.… read more

Who is taking it?  If you are just paying taxes and insurance no one can take it from you if you send a letter of intentions and pay what you can every month.  You might put the home up for a fast sale and with the money move into something affordable while paying the six thousand.

Sign up   *Invalid email address   Got it   Got it                 By Dina ElBoghdady  By Dina ElBoghdady  January 16, 2006   At local investor Bonnie K. Wachtel's office, the phones were state of the art when purchased in 1984, but they work just as well as newfangled ones. The colorful flowers on the windowsill are easy-to-maintain fake. And the 25 chairs, mismatched and a bit tattered, work out well for large meetings. If an office reflects a personality, then by most accounts the cramped and cluttered quarters of District-based Wachtel & Co. on 14th Street NW capture Bonnie Wachtel perfectly: practical, unpretentious and, some say, refreshingly offbeat. Last week, Wachtel thrust her small securities brokerage firm into the spotlight when she wrote a public letter detailing what she said were governance lapses at Integral Systems Inc., a software company in Lanham that went public in 1988 underwritten by Wachtel & Co. In the letter, which was filed by the company with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Wachtel called for the firm to be sold, relinquished her seat on what she called its "overly deferential" five-member board of directors, and reprimanded chief executive Steven R. Chamberlain for withholding information from board members about misdemeanor sex-offense and assault charges filed against him in June -- charges that he denies. Wachtel wrote that Chamberlain informed his senior staff of the charges but did not inform the board because he "took the position that the criminal charges were purely personal." The company said last week that a review "found no substantial merit to Ms. Wachtel's concerns," but did not specifically address her assertions. Wachtel's letter created what a friend called a "reputational risk" for her and for the institution her parents launched with $50,000 in savings more than four decades ago. "There's always a problem when you raise a stink that you'll be characterized as a crank or a loose cannon or whatever," said Michael Besche, a Maryland oil executive and a Wachtel & Co. client since 1980. "I have found her to be nothing but a straight arrow. . . . I've been to lots of shareholders meetings with Bonnie, where she stands up and asks pretty pointed questions, no softballs." And with risk comes potential reward. "If she's proved right, then she will gain a reputation amongst savvy investors and people will look upon her as a very useful person to have on a board," said Paul Hodgson, a senior research associate at the Corporate Library, a research group in Maine. Wachtel, who joined the family business in 1984, does not regret going public, and though some Integral directors sided with Chamberlain, she said she's received supportive calls from several of Integral System's largest shareholders in the past week. "I feel extremely confident about what I did out there," Wachtel said in an interview. "You can't persuade me I was wrong because I was outnumbered." Bonnie Wachtel, a lawyer with an MBA, is soft-spoken, but she is also plain-spoken. "Bonnie is opinionated. . . . She is straightforward and like all the Wachtels, extremely honest," said John Sanders, who worked with her father, Sid, for about 20 years, starting in the late 1960s. And, he said, like all Wachtels, she's frugal and smart with money. "It's in the genes," said Sanders, who maintains close ties with the firm and is chairman of the Washington DC Technology Council. Sid Wachtel, a New York native, founded Wachtel & Co. with his wife, Irma, in 1961, after leaving his job as a Treasury Department economist. The early years were so lean that Irma Wachtel supported the family working various data processing jobs at small companies. Those jobs proved useful for more reasons than one. She introduced Sid to entrepreneurs. He sealed the deals. The focus was on small Washington area technology-service-related firms that attracted no attention from big Wall Street investment houses. The goal was to take companies public with small stock offerings, being careful not to raise more money than the company absolutely needed. Then Sid Wachtel would sell the new shares to investors interested for the long term. The Wachtels often hold on to shares in local companies they know well for more than 25 years, such as construction firm Williams Industries Inc. of Manassas. "They want companies they can reach out and touch," said Marianne V. Pastor, a Williams Industries vice president. "They want to go out and kick the tires." The Wachtels encouraged their daughters to get involved in the business early. By age 9, Bonnie was stamping documents, alphabetizing files and answering phones at the office. Her older sister, Wendie L. Wachtel, was a registered stockbroker by age 16 and never left the family business. Bonnie left for college, then law school, then a brief stint at a New York law firm before joining Wachtel & Co in 1984. With Sid and Irma now retired, Bonnie Wachtel, 50, and Wendie Wachtel, 52, run the show, with help from one full-time employee, a cashier. The firm, with 300 active clients, is worth $5 million net, not including the net worth of each family member, which is not a matter of public record. The two advise clients on their investments, buy and sell stocks and bonds for individuals, and finance the same kinds of technology service start-ups that initially intrigued their father. (The firm also compiles a weekly chart on the performance of local stocks trading over the counter that appears in this section.) In 2004, Wachtel & Co. posted profit of $109,554 and revenue of $831,397, according to its most recent financial statement. "We've had enough success over the years that we're not so hungry anymore," Bonnie Wachtel said. "We've made a bunch of money and we're trying to keep our affairs small and manageable." Her two largest individual holdings are Integral Systems -- of which she owns about $1 million worth of stock, exclusive of options she received as director -- and VSE Corp., an engineering services firm in Alexandria, of which Wachtel is a director and in which she owns about $1 million worth of stock. VSE stock jumped to more than $45 a share from $12 in the past two years. But several people who have worked with Wachtel say that even when a stock tanks, she does not retreat. Sandor Rosenberg, chief executive of software development firm Information Analysis Inc. in Fairfax, said his company appointed Wachtel director about 15 years ago. Years later, the company was a highflying firm with a market cap close to $200 million and a product designed to fix computer programs related to the Y2K crash that never happened. Then the company's $2 million net worth tumbled to a negative $1 million, Rosenberg said. "Bonnie was there to help us keep our head screwed on properly," he said. "She's the kind of person you want in your foxhole when times are good and when times are bad." As for taking on a public fight with Integral Systems, a company she described as a financial windfall, Wachtel said, "It was the right thing to do, because the shareholders may well choose to take action, and I think action is warranted." Wendie Wachtel, settled into her desk, a stone's throw from her sister's, added: "And the shareholders deserve to know. They deserve it." In her letters, Bonnie Wachtel contends that Integral Systems' troubles run so deep that its corporate minutes sometimes do not fully reflect meetings and board members are given little time to review decisions as fundamental as those involving executive compensation. Still, the company reported a profit of $6.3 million in fiscal 2005 on revenue of $97.7 million. That profit was down slightly from the previous year. "If we were doing such a bad job then the company could not be announcing forward guidance announcing record profitability," said R. Doss McComas, one of two Integral outside directors Wachtel said deferred too much to Chamberlain. Wachtel dismissed the argument. "Corporate governance is not just for companies that are having financial problems," she said. "We try very hard to set up arrangements where the interest of management and shareholders is aligned so that the ultimate success is something shared by both groups. That's what corporate governance is about." Patrick Ryan, who recently retired after 44 years in the securities industry and knows Wachtel & Co. professionally, said it can be downright dangerous to shirk governance issues in the post-Enron days, after boards were blamed for falling asleep at the wheel. "Now more than ever, if one accepts the responsibility of serving as director of a company, one also has to accept the fiduciary responsibility that goes with the title of director," Ryan said. "They can't sit there like a frog on a log." But generally, directors do not go running to the public at the first sign of trouble either, he said. If a teacher can't discipline a rowdy student, Ryan said, "she doesn't immediately go running to the principal's office to get him kicked out of school. She tries to fix the problem herself." Ryan said he is not familiar with Wachtel's disagreement with Integral Systems. Wachtel said she tried for about a year to do just that before embarking on her letter-writing campaign. In the end, Wachtel, who has a keen interest in philosophy, decided that she would not succumb to "moral relativism." "There generally is a right and a wrong," she said. "I think I may have made that clear."
