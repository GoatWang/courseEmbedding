Quartz




                    Quartz Stone is a composite made-up of 93% quartz, 7% polyester resin and pigment.
                    Quartz stone surface is non-porous, its polished surfaces don't need to be sealed, like granite or other natural stones, in order to keep them from staining. Quartz stone surfacing is practically indestructible and pretty much maintenance free. It resists stains that are caused by fruit juices, wine, food coloring, fingernail polish and remover, tea and markers. The non-porous and non absorbing nature of quartz stone surfaces is very hygienic.
                    




Porcelain Tiles




                    Porcelain tiles are ceramic tiles with a water absorption rate of less than 0.5 percent that are used to cover floors and walls. They can either be unglazed or glazed.
                    




Granite




                    Granite is a light-colored igneous rock with grains large enough to be visible with the unaided eye.  It forms from the slow crystallization of magma below Earth’s surface.  Granite is composed mainly of quartz and  feldspar with minor amounts of mica, amphiboles and other minerals.   This mineral composition usually gives granite a red, pink, gray or white color with dark mineral grains visible throughout the rock.
                    




Mosiacs




                    Mosaic is the art of creating images with an assemblage of small pieces of colored glass, stone, or other materials. It may be a technique of decorative art, an aspect of interior decoration, or of cultural and spiritual significance as in a cathedral. Small pieces, mostly roughly square, of stone or glass of different colors, known as tesserae, (diminutive tessellae), are used to create a pattern or picture
                    




Wooden Cabinets and Bases




                    A little information about wooden cabinets.
                    




Cultured Marbles




                    Cultured Marble is a precise blend of polyester resin, catalyst, fillers and pigments that is thoroughly mixed and placed into open molds that have been coated with a clear gel coat. The gel coat is specially formulated to produce a tough, durable, transparent surface resistant to inservice wear. The manufacturer produces a unique range of colors, patterns, and veining.

The chemical reaction initiated by the catalyst causes the resin to polymerize and harden, bonding the entire matrix together in a hard, strong mass. After several hours of chemical curing, the parts are removed from the molds and trimmed, ground, polished and inspected. the parts are then ready for shipment and installation.

Cultured Marble is a manufactured product, and like natural marble, granite, etc., varies in shade and color. Other products such as carpet, wallpaper, and vinyl tile vary each time they are manufactured. Manufacturers refer to each "run" as a "dye lot."
                    




Luxury Vinyl Panels




                    Premium Glueless Luxury Vinyl planks are constructed with the patented Uniclic® interlocking joint that locks the planks together to form a tight, durable, water resistant joint. Premium Glueless LVT flooring is installed as a floating floor so it’s quick and easy to install with no adhesive required. All you need is a smooth dry surface and a few basic hand tools.Once the floor is installed it can receive traffic immediately.
                    




Hardwood and Laminate




                    Hardwood is wood from angiosperm trees (more strictly speaking non-monocot angiosperm trees). It may also be used for those trees themselves: these are usually broad-leaved; in temperate and boreal latitudes they are mostly deciduous, but in tropics and subtropics mostly evergreen.

> Built-in instruction mode, that allows for a customized whitening procedure based on the client’s needs.

LightBridge™ Technology
The POLUS® Advanced Whitening Accelerator combines halogen and LED light technologies to provide users with a premium whitening experience.
> An advanced light filtration system containing 200,000 optical fibers serves as a bridge between the two light sources, removing all harmful heat and ultraviolet (UV) light from the powerful halogen light source, before merging the light with emissions from the twelve blue LED lights at the front of the lamp head. The end results in a combination of two powerful light sources and ultrasonic technology with wavelengths that span the entire blue light whitening spectrum, providing patients with an effective and precise whitening treatment.
