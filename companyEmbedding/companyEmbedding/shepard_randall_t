Biography[edit]
Randall Terry Shepard was born in Lafayette in 1946, but spent most of his formative years in Evansville, Indiana. Shepard is a seventh generation Hoosier. He is an Eagle Scout and has received the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award.[1] He graduated from Princeton University in 1969 and from the Yale Law School in 1972, and earned a Master of Laws degree from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1995.[2]
Shepard served as executive assistant to Mayor Russell Lloyd of Evansville, and later as a special assistant to the Under Secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation. He was judge of the Vanderburgh County Superior Court from 1980 to 1985. He was appointed the ninety-ninth justice of the Indiana Supreme Court by Governor Robert D. Orr in 1985. He was chosen to become the Chief Justice of Indiana in March 1987, then the youngest state chief justice. Chief Justice Shepard was a chairperson of Indiana's State Student Assistance Commission and a trustee of the National Trust for Historic Preservation for eleven years. He has also served as chair of the ABA Appellate Judges Conference and of the Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar. He is currently the honorary chair and a member of the executive committee of the Indiana Landmarks. Shepard served as President of the National Conference of Chief Justices in 2005 and 2006.[2]
In 2006, Shepard was appointed by Chief Justice John Roberts to be on the U.S. Judicial Conference Advisory Committee of Civil Rules, which the U.S. Supreme Court uses to form changes to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
In September 2005 Shepard was chosen by the Indiana Judicial Nominating Commission and reappointed by Governor Mitch Daniels to the Supreme Court. On November 4, 2008 the public voted to keep Shepard on the court in a statewide retention election.
In July 2007, Shepard and former Governor Joe Kernan were appointed by Daniels to co-chair the Indiana Commission on Local Government Reform.[3]
As a justice, he authored more than 800 majority opinions. He also published more than 40 law review articles.
Shepard retired March 23, 2012. Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels appointed Mark Massa to take Shepard's seat on the Court.[4]
Shepard is married to Amy MacDonell and has one daughter, Martha, born in 1995. He occasionally teaches law at New York University and Yale Law School.[2]

In 2006, Shepard was appointed by Chief Justice John Roberts to be on the U.S. Judicial Conference Advisory Committee of Civil Rules, which the U.S. Supreme Court uses to form changes to the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
In September 2005 Shepard was chosen by the Indiana Judicial Nominating Commission and reappointed by Governor Mitch Daniels to the Supreme Court. On November 4, 2008 the public voted to keep Shepard on the court in a statewide retention election.
In July 2007, Shepard and former Governor Joe Kernan were appointed by Daniels to co-chair the Indiana Commission on Local Government Reform.[3]
As a justice, he authored more than 800 majority opinions. He also published more than 40 law review articles.
Shepard retired March 23, 2012. Indiana Governor Mitch Daniels appointed Mark Massa to take Shepard's seat on the Court.[4]
Shepard is married to Amy MacDonell and has one daughter, Martha, born in 1995. He occasionally teaches law at New York University and Yale Law School.[2]

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

May 31, 2012
INDIANAPOLIS -- Recently retired Indiana Chief Justice Randall T. Shepard has been named the first executive in residence at the Indiana University Public Policy Institute in IU's School of Public and Environmental Affairs. 

Indiana University President Michael A. McRobbie welcomed the appointment of Shepard. "Justice Shepard is without question one of the legal giants in the history of Indiana, and it is an honor to have him associated with Indiana University in this important capacity," he said.

Retired Indiana Chief Justice Randall T. Shepard


                                                        
                                                        Print-Quality Photo 
                                                    
As executive in residence, Shepard will work with PPI on finding ways that nonpartisan research and data can help leaders understand the challenges and opportunities of the future. Under the two-year joint academic appointment with SPEA and the IU McKinney School of Law, Shepard will lead executive seminars and mentor faculty and staff as they develop academic programs focused on the relationship between law and public policy.

"The chief justice's years as leader of one branch of Indiana government have prepared him to be an expert resource and mentor for the work we do at the IU Public Policy Institute," said institute Director John L. Krauss. "We are gratified and pleased that he has chosen to give us the benefit of his knowledge and experience and to use the institute as a forum through which he can continue to help shape Indiana's future. And his past work with PPI ensures that he will hit the ground running."

Shepard has co-chaired two recent projects for PPI: Policy Choices for Indiana's Future, which provides policy guidance for Indiana officials and candidates for office; and the Indiana Commission on Local Government Reform, which was formed by Gov. Mitch Daniels and staffed by PPI. Both projects made detailed recommendations intended to guide policy-makers' decisions and benefit the people of Indiana. Shepard will continue to serve as co-chair of PPI's Advisory Board, furthering the institute's mission of providing nonpartisan research, data and analysis that Indiana's residents and leaders need to make informed decisions. 

"Naming Randy Shepard to this post establishes the high standard of quality we expect for this program and the stature of the executives we wish to include in the future," Krauss said. "We also hope Chief Justice Shepard's work with the institute will allow us to seek larger national projects and relationships." 

Shepard retired in March after serving on the Indiana Supreme Court for 27 years. He had been chief justice for a quarter of a century, making him the nation's longest-serving state court chief justice. He will continue judicial services as a senior judge at the Indiana Court of Appeals, and he anticipates being involved in other endeavors.

"When I decided to leave the bench, it was with the hope that I could find new opportunities to contribute in a meaningful way, and my appointment with PPI certainly fits the bill," Shepard said. "I find it attractive as a combination of public policy exploration that's anchored in rigorous academic enterprise and focused on engaging audiences beyond the university who are charged with leading public institutions."

A native Hoosier who served in city government and as a judge in Evansville and Vanderburgh County before being appointed to the Indiana Supreme Court in 1985, Shepard has been recognized nationally for his service and expertise. In 2006, he was appointed by U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts to serve on a committee that advises the U.S. Supreme Court.

"The chief justice's commitment to engaging beyond the campus is a perfect fit with IUPUI's commitment to engaging our city, state and nation," said Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis Chancellor Charles R. Bantz. "In addition, his willingness to mentor McKinney and SPEA students and faculty contributes to our mission of teaching and research."

Shepard is available for media interviews: Contact Jen Thomas, JTPR Inc., at jen@jtprinc.com or 317-441-2487.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator

 Educational Background



LLM 
Class of 1995 


University of Virginia - School of Law

                  Founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, the University of Virginia School of Law is a world-renowned training ground for distinguished lawyers and public servants. Consistently ranked among the top law schools in the nation, Virginia has educated generations of lawyers, instilling in them a commitment to leadership, integrity and community service.

Virginia is justly famous for its collegial environment that bonds students and faculty, and student satisfaction is consistently cited as among the highest in American law schools. At Virginia, law students share their experiences in a cooperative spirit, both in and out of the classroom, and build a network that lasts well beyond their three years here.

With more than 20,000 students and a faculty of more than 2,100, the University of Virginia has been ranked first or second among the nation's public universities since 1984. The University's diverse intellectual life is open to law students: Up to 12 credits from other departments may be counted toward the J.D. degree.                




JD 
Class of 1972 


Yale University - Yale Law School

                  Located in New Haven, Connecticut, Yale Law School is one of the world’s premier law schools. It offers an unmatched environment of excellence and educational intimacy in the form of world renowned faculty, small classes, limitless opportunities for clinical training, and strong encouragement of public service. The Law School is small by design; its impact on the world is measured by its accomplished graduates and its ongoing scholarship and outreach through numerous centers and projects.

For students, the experience is unparalleled. The faculty-student ratio supports a vast array of courses and opportunities for independent research and student-organized seminars. Students get practical training by representing real clients in clinics starting in their first year.

Throughout, a spirit of collaboration reigns. All first-term courses are ungraded, and subsequent classes are graded honors/pass/low pass. 

Yale Law School is unique among law schools in that it produces leaders in all walks of life: distinguished deans and faculty members at law schools across the country and the world; industry CEOs and corporate counsels; founders of nongovernmental organizations and other nonprofit entities; entrepreneurs; government servants in federal, state, and local offices and the judiciary--just a few areas in which our alumni's talent and passion and dedication have made a difference. Among the School’s graduates are U.S. Presidents and Supreme Court Justices; and among its far-reaching projects, the Information Society Project and the China Center.                




AB, cum laude 
Class of 1969 


Princeton University

                  Princeton University is a vibrant community of scholarship and learning that stands in the nation's service and in the service of all nations. Chartered in 1746, Princeton is the fourth-oldest college in the United States. Princeton is an independent, coeducational, nondenominational institution that provides undergraduate and graduate instruction in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences and engineering.

As a world-renowned research university, Princeton seeks to achieve the highest levels of distinction in the discovery and transmission of knowledge and understanding. At the same time, Princeton is distinctive among research universities in its commitment to undergraduate teaching.

Today, more than 1,100 faculty members instruct approximately 5,000 undergraduate students and 2,500 graduate students. The University's generous financial aid program ensures that talented students from all economic backgrounds can afford a Princeton education.

Indiana University - Robert H. McKinney School of Law


                  Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law (IU McKinney) is located on the campus of Indiana University – Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) in Indianapolis, Indiana. The law school is one of two law schools operated by Indiana University, the other being the Indiana University Maurer School of Law (IU Maurer) in Bloomington. Although both law schools are part of Indiana University, each law school is wholly independent of the other.

With an enrollment of approximately 1,000 students, IU McKinney is the largest law school in the state of Indiana. In the summer of 2001, the school moved to its award-winning new building, Lawrence W. Inlow Hall.[1] Of the 195 American Bar Association (ABA)-accredited law schools evaluated for its 2013 edition (released March 13, 2012), U.S. News & World Report ranked the school 89th overall, ninth in legal writing, and eleventh in healthcare law.[2][3][4] In 2010, based on the number of graduates selected for inclusion in Super Lawyers magazine, that publication ranked the school 44th out of 180 law schools considered.[5]

Formerly known as the Indiana University School of Law – Indianapolis, the school's name was changed in December 2011 in recognition of a $24 million gift from Robert H. McKinney, who previously served as chairman and CEO of First Indiana Corporation and is among the founders of Bose McKinney & Evans LLP, one of the largest law firms in Indianapolis.[

Randall T. Shepard of Evansville was appointed to the Indiana Supreme Court by Governor Robert D. Orr in 1985 at the age of 38. He became Chief Justice of Indiana in March 1987 and retired from the Court in March 2012, at which point he was the longest-serving Chief Justice in Indiana history and the senior Chief Justice in the country’s state supreme courts.

Synopses & ReviewsPublisher CommentsIn addition to having a reputation as an epicenter for middle American values, Indiana is a cultural crossroads that has produced a rich and complex legal and constitutional heritage. The History of Indiana Law traces this history though a series of expert essays by identifying the themes that mark the state's legal development and establish its broader context in the Midwest and nation. Issues addressed by the commissioned writers include: the revolutionary framework bequeathed by the new American republic, including the Northwest Ordinance and the U.S. Constitution of 1787; the shift to Jacksonian democracy, with its emphasis on states' rights, individualism, market capitalism, and limited government; the rise of the industrial heartland and the growth of bureaucratic government; and the adaptation of law to the increasingly complex society of modern Indiana. The contributors also explore the ways in which the state's legal culture responded to---and at times resisted---the influence of national legal developments. Although Indiana outlawed slavery in 1816, the state's laws did not welcome African Americans. The book traces the tortured history of race relations in Indiana and helps explain why the state became a hotbed of white supremacy in the 1920s. Written by leading lawyers and historians, The History of Indiana Law is the indispensable reference and invaluable first source to learn about law and society in Indiana during almost two centuries of statehood. David J. Bodenhamer is professor of history and executive director ofThe Polis Center at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis. He is author or editor of six books, including Fair Trail: Rights of the Accused in American History and The Bill of Rights in Modern America: After 200 Years (with James W. Ely, Jr).The Hon. Randall T. Shepard, an Evansville native, was appointed to the Indiana Supreme in 1985 and was later promoted to Chief Justice of the court.ReviewEvery state should have a book like this, and the authors and editors deserve a great deal of credit for adding this one to the four existing volumes in the Law, Society and Politics in the Midwest series.”  Elizabeth Brand Monroe, Indiana Magazine of HistoryReviewHoosier lawyers will covet this book because it amounts to a mini-encyclopedia that expertly lays out the basic facts and patterns of the states legal history. Historians may hope it does even more. If readers come to consider the state and its system of justice as historically constructed  then The History of Indianas Law will have performed an immensely valuable service to the state as well as to its historians and lawyers.”  The American Journal of Legal HistorySynopsisLong regarded as a center for middle-American values, Indiana is also a cultural crossroads that has produced a rich and complex legal and constitutional heritage. The History of Indiana Law traces this history through a series of expert articles by identifying the themes that mark the states legal development and establish its place within the broader context of the Midwest and nation. The History of Indiana Law explores the ways in which the states legal culture responded toand at times resistedthe influence of national legal developments, including the tortured history of race relations in Indiana. Legal issues addressed by the contributors include the Indiana constitutional tradition, civil liberties, race, womens rights, family law, welfare and the poor, education, crime and punishment, juvenile justice, the role of courts and judiciary, and landmark cases. The essays describe how Indiana law has adapted to the needs of an increasingly complex society. The History of Indiana Law is an indispensable reference and invaluable first source to learn about law and society in Indiana during almost two centuries of statehood.About the AuthorDavid J.
