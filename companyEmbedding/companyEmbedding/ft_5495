It can mow through long hay and uneven terrain without dragging. The quick clip agricultural mower comes complete with a safety kickback guard and a hydraulic vertical lift. Its specialized float system allows the disc mower to contour itself to the land up to 40 degrees. This mower has a cutting width of 6.7 feet.This disc mower features 5 elliptical discs. Each of the 5 discs has two blades, and it also features a lateral circular conveyor disc. This model works on tractors with engines up to 40 HP. The PTO speed is 540 RPM, and the hay mower weighs 1,080 pounds. The Morra Disc Mower has a special reinforcing profile with extra reinforcement in the gearbox zone. It also has a safety release to protect against any impact with large obstacles. The quick clip mower also features a driveline with a free wheel, and two sets of knives (a short set and a long set). In addition, its sprung suspension reduces the agricultural mower's load bearing on the ground. For convenient maintenance, the main drive gear and bearing assembly are easily accessible.  This long-lasting agricultural mower will work hard and take care of all of your heavy farming needs. It's reliable and designed with safety in mind. You can use it on your small, medium, or your large farms under even difficult conditions.
