      Masonite opens the door to extraordinary and unexpected possibilities by
      redefining the role of the door
    
 TAMPA, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--
      Masonite International Corporation (NYSE: DOOR), a leading global
      designer and manufacturer of interior and exterior doors, unveiled a new
      brand identity, symbolized by the introduction of its new tagline “Open
      to Extraordinary,” and a new logo and visual identity that helps to
      redefine the role of a door. Masonite also announced the formation of a
      new Trend Council with a mission to provide customers with insights on
      popular and emerging design trends.

      “The launch of our new brand embodies the spirit of our personality and
      represents the transformation of our company,” said Fred Lynch,
      president and CEO of Masonite. “It depicts the ongoing partnership
      between Masonite and our customers to continually create a better
      experience.”
    

      Masonite’s new tagline “Open to Extraordinary” is an invitation to break
      perceptions, challenge the status quo and open the door’s true potential
      – the extraordinary and unexpected possibilities as a defining element
      throughout the home. From opening the door to extraordinary everyday
      moments, to finding the moments that are extraordinary, Masonite’s new
      tagline captures the endless possibilities for the experiences that make
      life memorable while showcasing its importance in creating a whole-home
      solution.
    

      Masonite is empowering its builder and remodeler customers to change the
      conversation around doors through design trend knowledge, allowing them
      to become the voice of authority. The newly established Masonite Trend
      Council plans to publish trend reports on current and evolving design
      trends. The first Masonite Trend Report of 2017 highlights current
      homebuilding trends and insights from leading industry experts and share
      insider knowledge on current and upcoming trends, where to uncover
      design inspiration, and how the door can be a dynamic design element in
      any home. In addition, a new design trends and inspiration brochure
      designed for consumer audiences is filled with mood boards for visual
      discovery, defining current trends for 2017 and highlighting Masonite’s
      forecasted trends for the next three to five years.
    

      With an eye looking ahead to the future, Masonite is showing its
      customers what trends are gaining popularity, as well as how to provide
      a whole-home offering by coordinating interior and exterior door
      choices. Masonite will combine knowledge provided by its trend council
      of experts with deep regional sales data to deliver clear insight into
      regional markets’ most popular and emerging styles.
    

      “We believe a door is more than just a door, and we never stop pushing
      the boundaries in helping customers elevate the role a door can play in
      the built environment. We are committed to researching, uncovering and
      sharing our own trend and industry insights, leading the conversation
      for the category,” said Lynch.
    

      The new Masonite logo embodies simplistic beauty and reinforces where
      Masonite is taking the door category. The bold, uppercase letters
      signify continued strength and leadership. The strong, stylized ‘M’
      symbol utilizes intersecting doors to reinforce the partnership with
      customers. The modified crossbars of the ‘A’ and ‘E’ in Masonite’s name
      demonstrates the openness and innovation it brings to the industry.
    

      Along with a new logo, Masonite is innovating the digital approach on
      how to buy a door through new technology product innovations and a new
      website. The creation of these platforms will allow customers to
      customize their doors, while simplifying and speeding up the ordering
      process. These new solutions include:
    


        Masonite.com: Redesigned based on extensive research and customer
        feedback, Masonite’s new website provides easier navigation, technical
        documents in a clean format, and inspirational videos and blogs to
        keep customers up-to-date on the latest trends.
      

        The MAX Masonite Xpress Configurator® 3.0: Combining the
        sophisticated configuration capabilities of a deep options database
        with an easy-to-use graphic interface, this web-based door design and
        pricing tool provides dealers an easy and cost-effective way to
        showcase Masonite’s product offerings.
      

        Front Door App: Designed to allow consumers, builders and remodelers
        to view available glass options for entry doors while on the go using
        an iPhone® or iPad®.
      


      “Our goal is to offer a complete solution crafted around success.
      Everything we do is designed to drive business by making our products,
      tools and services easier and more focused on supporting our trade
      partners,” said Lynch.
    

      Additionally, Masonite has released several new products, including the
      release of the VistaGrande™ Three-Quarter Lite and Half Life
      door and the new Heritage® Series Craftsman Fiberglass Entry
      Door.

Masonite International Corporation is a company headquartered in Tampa, Florida, which employs over nine thousand people worldwide. Masonite manufactures interior and exterior doors, door components, and door entry systems. It is one of the world's largest manufacturer and merchandiser of commercial and residential doors. A producer of over 120,000 interior and exterior wood, fiberglass, and metal doors a day, it has operations in more than 60 facilities in twelve countries in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Africa.[1]
History[edit]
Masonite was founded by engineer and inventor William H. Mason after he discovered a more effective way to use wood in building materials. The result was the material known as Masonite.
Masonite was taken private in a leveraged buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR). While under KKR's stewardship, the company went into bankruptcy. Masonite completed a financial restructuring and emerged from both Chapter 11 proceedings in the United States and CCAA protection in Canada, 85 days after the initial filings on March 16, 2009.[2] Nearly four years after its emergence from bankruptcy, in 2013 Masonite filed a registration statement with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to once again become a public company.[3]

Masonite International Corporation is a company headquartered in Tampa, Florida, which employs over nine thousand people worldwide. Masonite manufactures interior and exterior doors, door components, and door entry systems. It is one of the world's largest manufacturer and merchandiser of commercial and residential doors. A producer of over 120,000 interior and exterior wood, fiberglass, and metal doors a day, it has operations in more than 60 facilities in twelve countries in North America, South America, Europe, Asia and Africa.[1]
History[edit]
Masonite was founded by engineer and inventor William H. Mason after he discovered a more effective way to use wood in building materials. The result was the material known as Masonite.
Masonite was taken private in a leveraged buyout by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts (KKR). While under KKR's stewardship, the company went into bankruptcy. Masonite completed a financial restructuring and emerged from both Chapter 11 proceedings in the United States and CCAA protection in Canada, 85 days after the initial filings on March 16, 2009.[2] Nearly four years after its emergence from bankruptcy, in 2013 Masonite filed a registration statement with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to once again become a public company.[3]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
