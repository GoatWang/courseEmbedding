                           This essay looks at the bidirectional relationship between financial history and financial economics. It begins by giving
                              a brief history of financial economics by outlining the main topics of interest to financial economists. It then documents
                              and explains the increasing influence of financial economics upon financial history, and warns of the dangers of applying
                              financial economics unthinkingly to the study of financial history. The essay proceeds to highlight the many insights that
                              financial history can potentially provide to financial economics. The main conclusion of the essay is that financial economics
                              can potentially learn more from financial history than vice versa

                              A chronicle of the problems faced in an attempt to collect data on sociology curriculum trends in California's community college
                                 system is presented. The project was initiated in an effort to determine if other colleges in the system were experiencing
                                 the same difficulties with curriculum and enrollment in sociology courses being encountered by Grossmont College in California.
                                 Of the 104 questionnaires sent out to the Deans of Instruction at the existing California community colleges, 84 were completed
                                 and returned. Much variety was found in how the data were gathered, and there were difficulties in retrieving other data that
                                 were gathered. Often data were unanalyzed or duplicated because of lack of knowledge of what was already stored in the computer.
                                 Although college catalogs are the only uniform sources of information available to the public about the curricula at any given
                                 college, they were poor sources of accurate information about courses offered. Data published on the system by state and federal
                                 agencies were often inaccurate. Several tentative solutions are proposed--such as standards for catalog writing or a centralized
                                 data bank--based on the concept that most institutional research is highly unreliable because the data upon which it is based
                                 are unreliable. (Sc)
