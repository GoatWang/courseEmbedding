      Fitch Affirms GSMS 2014-GC26
    





November 02, 2016 04:08 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has affirmed 12 classes of GS Mortgage Securities Trust 
      series 2014-GC26 (GSMS 2014-GC26) commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of 
      this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are due to overall stable performance of the underlying 
      collateral. The stable performance reflects no material changes to pool 
      metrics since issuance, therefore, the original rating analysis was 
      considered in affirming the transaction. As of the October 2016 
      distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been 
      reduced by 1% to $1.24 billion million from $1.26 billion at issuance. 
      Currently, seven loans (4.6%) have been designated Fitch Loans of 
      Concern. No loans are specially serviced. No loans are defeased.
    

      Stable Performance with No Material Changes: All loans in the pool 
      continue to perform, as of the October 2016 distribution, with property 
      level performance generally in line with issuance expectations and no 
      material changes to pool metrics.
    

      High Fitch Leverage: The Fitch debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and 
      loan to value (LTV) at issuance were 1.13x and 109.6%, respectively.
    

      Strong Pool Diversity: The pool diversity by loan amount is greater than 
      other recent transactions. The largest loan represents 7.1% of the pool, 
      and the top 10 loans represent only 40.5%.
    

      High-Quality Properties: The pool has better than average property 
      quality with approximately one-fifth of the properties inspected by 
      Fitch at issuance assigned a property quality grade of 'A' or 'A-', 
      including five of the top 20 loans.
    

      Fitch Loans of Concern: The largest Fitch Loan of Concern is the 129-131 
      Greene Street loan (1.9% of the pool), which is secured by a two-story 
      8,200-sf retail condo located on Greene Street between Houston and 
      Prince Streets in the SoHo area of New York City. The neighbourhood is 
      home to many notable high-end retailers. The property is 100% leased to 
      a Google subsidiary on a 10-year NNN lease that matures in 2024. The 
      store was to be one of Google's first brick-and-mortar retail locations 
      worldwide. However, Google never took occupancy, and the property is 
      currently being marketed for sublease. The tenant, which has the option 
      to terminate its lease with a fee after five years in 2019, has 
      continued to make all lease payments to date. The loan is structured 
      with a springing full cash flow sweep, which the servicer reports has 
      been triggered. The loan matures in 2018.
    

      The next largest Fitch Loan of Concern is the Staybridge Suites 
      Lafayette loan (1.1% of the pool), which is secured by a 118-key hotel 
      located in Lafayette, LA. The servicer-reported June 2016 annualized NOI 
      DSCR fell to 1.01x due to a decline in hotel occupancy. No other Fitch 
      Loan of Concern comprises more than 0.4% of the pool. Fitch will 
      continue to monitor these loans for performance changes.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlooks on all classes remain Stable. Fitch does not foresee 
      positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or 
      asset-level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level 
      metrics.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:
    

      --$34.2 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$71 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$40 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$280 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$349.8 million class A-5 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$91.6 million class A-AB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$92.6 million class A-S at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$56.5 million class B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$40.8 million class C at 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$0 class PEZ at 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Interest-only class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Interest-only class X-B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      Class A-S, B and C certificates may be exchanged for class PEZ 
      certificates; and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for class A-S, 
      B and C certificates. Fitch does not rate the class D, E, F, G and H 
      certificates, or interest-only classes X-C and X-D.

      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia

      Fitch to Rate GS Mortgage Securities Trust 2014-GC26 Commercial Mortgage 
      P-T Certs; Presale Issued
    





November 17, 2014 05:15 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on GS Mortgage Securities 
      Trust Series 2014-GC26 commercial mortgage pass-through certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$46,189,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$71,003,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$40,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$282,000,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$349,842,000 class A-5 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$91,592,000 class A-AB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$971,195,000b class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$56,483,000b class X-B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$92,569,000a class A-S 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$56,483,000a class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$189,846,000a class PEZ 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$40,794,000a class C 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      (a)Class A-S, B and C certificates may be exchanged for class PEZ 
      certificates; and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for class A-S, 
      B and C certificates.
    

      (b)Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Nov. 14, 2014. Fitch does not expect to rate the $29,811,000 
      interest-only class X-C, the $29,811,000 class E, the $61,190,419 
      interest-only class X-D, the $95,707,000 class D, the $15,690,000 class 
      F, the $12,551,000 class G, or the $32,949,419 class H.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, 
      primary assets of which are 92 loans secured by 133 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.26 
      billion as of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company; Citigroup Global Markets Realty 
      Corp.; Cantor Commercial Real Estate Lending, LLC, MC-Five Mile 
      Commercial Mortgage Finance LLC; and Starwood Mortgage Funding I LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 67.5% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 75.9%, and asset summary reviews of 85% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      High Fitch Leverage: The pool's Fitch DSCR and LTV of 1.13x and 109.6%, 
      respectively, are worse than the 2013 and 2014 year to date (ended third 
      quarter) averages of 1.29x and 101.6% and 1.19x and 106.9%, respectively.
    

      Strong Pool Diversity: The pool diversity by loan amount is greater than 
      other recent transactions. The largest loan represents 7.1% of the pool, 
      and the top 10 loans represent only 40.2%. The average top 10 
      concentrations for year to date 2014 and 2013 conduit transactions were 
      50.8% and 54.5%, respectively. The LCI is 263 and the SCI is 273, which 
      indicate a less concentrated level of sponsor and greater level of loan 
      diversity, as compared to recently rated deals.
    

      High Quality Properties: The pool has better than average property 
      quality with 21.5% of the properties inspected by Fitch assigned a 
      property quality grade of 'A' or 'A-', including five of the top 20 
      loans.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 11.47% below the 
      most recent net operating income (NOI) (for properties for which 
      historical NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during the most recent reporting period). Unanticipated further declines 
      in property-level NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted loans, and could result in potential rating actions on the 
      certificates. Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to 
      GSMS 2014-GC26 certificates and found that the transaction displays 
      slightly above-average sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a 
      scenario in which NCF declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a 
      downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. 
      In a more severe scenario, in which NCF declined a further 30% from 
      Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' 
      could result. The presale report includes a detailed explanation of 
      additional stresses and sensitivities on pages 79 - 80.
    

      The master servicer will be Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, 
      rated 'CMS1-' by Fitch. The special servicer will be LNR Partners, LLC, 
      LLC rated 'CSS1-' by Fitch.

RATINGS RATIONALE




The Certificates are collateralized by 92 fixed-rate loans secured 
by 133 properties. The ratings are based on the collateral and 
the structure of the transaction.




Moody's CMBS ratings methodology combines both commercial real estate 
and structured finance analysis. Based on commercial real estate 
analysis, Moody's determines the credit quality of each mortgage 
loan and calculates an expected loss on a loan specific basis. 
Under structured finance, the credit enhancement for each certificate 
typically depends on the expected frequency, severity, and 
timing of future losses. Moody's also considers a range of qualitative 
issues as well as the transaction's structural and legal aspects.




The credit risk of loans is determined primarily by two factors: 
1) Moody's assessment of the probability of default, which 
is largely driven by each loan's DSCR, and 2) Moody's 
assessment of the severity of loss upon a default, which is largely 
driven by each loan's LTV ratio.




The Moody's Actual DSCR of 1.49X is higher than the 2007 
conduit/fusion transaction average of 1.31X. The Moody's 
Stressed DSCR of 0.93X is also slightly higher than the 2007 conduit/fusion 
transaction average of 0.92X.




Moody's Trust LTV ratio of 114.2% is higher than the 
2007 conduit/fusion transaction average of 110.6% and many 
pools securitized during 2013. 




Moody's also considers both loan level diversity and property level 
diversity when selecting a ratings approach. With respect to loan 
level diversity, the pool's loan level (includes cross collateralized 
and cross defaulted loans) Herfindahl Index is 38.0. The 
transaction's loan level diversity is higher than Herfindahl scores 
found in most multi-borrower transactions issued since 2009. 
With respect to property level diversity, the pool's property 
level Herfindahl Index is 41.3. The transaction's 
property diversity profile is higher than the indices calculated in most 
multi-borrower transactions issued since 2009. 




Moody's also grades properties on a scale of 1 to 5 (best to worst) and 
considers those grades when assessing the likelihood of debt payment. 
The factors considered include property age, quality of construction, 
location, market, and tenancy. The pool's weighted 
average property quality grade is 2.35, which is in-line 
with the indices calculated in most multi-borrower transactions 
since 2009. 


This deal has six super-senior Aaa classes with 30% credit 
enhancement. Although the additional enhancement offered to the 
senior most certificate holders provides additional protection against 
pool loss, the super-senior structure is credit negative 
for the certificate that supports the super-senior class. 
If the support certificate were to take a loss, the loss would have 
the potential to be quite large on a percentage basis. Thin tranches 
need more subordination to reduce the probability of default in recognition 
that their loss-given default is higher. This adjustment 
helps keep expected loss in balance and consistent across deals. 
The transaction was structured with additional subordination at class 
A-S to mitigate the potential increased severity to class A-S.




The transaction contains a group of exchangeable certificates. 
Classes A-S (Aa1 (sf)), B (Aa3 (sf)) and C ( A3 (sf)) may 
be exchanged for Class PEZ ( A1 (sf)) certificates and Class PEZ may be 
exchanged for the Classes A-S, B and C. The PEZ certificates 
will be entitled to receive the sum of interest and principal distributable 
on the Classes A-S, B and C certificates that are exchanged 
for such PEZ certificates. The initial certificate balance of the 
Class PEZ certificates is equal to the aggregate of the initial certificate 
balances of the Class A-S, B and C and represent the maximum 
certificate balance of the PEZ certificates that may be issued in an exchange.




The principal methodology used in this rating was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published on December 2014. 
Please see the Credit Policy page on www.moodys.com for 
a copy of this methodology.




Moody's analysis employed the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model v3.0 
to derive credit enhancement levels based on an aggregation of adjusted 
loan level proceeds derived from Moody's loan level DSCR and LTV ratios. 
Major adjustments to determining proceeds include loan structure, 
property type, sponsorship and diversity. Moody's analysis 
also uses the CMBS IO calculator version 1.0 which references the 
following inputs to calculate the proposed IO rating based on the published 
methodology: original and current bond ratings and credit estimates; 
original and current bond balances grossed up for losses for all bonds 
the IO(s) reference(s) within the transaction; and IO type corresponding 
to an IO type as defined in the published methodology.




Moody's Parameter Sensitivities: If Moody's value of the collateral 
used in determining the initial rating were decreased by 5.0%, 
14.5%, and 23.2%, the model-indicated 
rating for the currently rated junior Aaa class would be Aa1, Aa2, 
A1, respectively. Parameter Sensitivities are not intended 
to measure how the rating of the security might migrate over time; 
rather they are designed to provide a quantitative calculation of how 
the initial rating might change if key input parameters used in the initial 
rating process differed. The analysis assumes that the deal has 
not aged. Parameter Sensitivities only reflect the ratings impact 
of each scenario from a quantitative/model-indicated standpoint. 
Qualitative factors are also taken into consideration in the ratings process, 
so the actual ratings that would be assigned in each case could vary from 
the information presented in the Parameter Sensitivity analysis.




These ratings: (a) are based solely on information in the public 
domain and/or information communicated to Moody's by the issuer 
at the date it was prepared and such information has not been independently 
verified by Moody's; (b) must be construed solely as a statement 
of opinion and not a statement of fact or an offer, invitation, 
inducement or recommendation to purchase, sell or hold any securities 
or otherwise act in relation to the issuer or any other entity or in connection 
with any other matter. Moody's does not guarantee or make any representation 
or warranty as to the correctness of any information, rating or 
communication relating to the issuer. Moody's shall not be liable 
in contract, tort, statutory duty or otherwise to the issuer 
or any other third party for any loss, injury or cost caused to 
the issuer or any other third party, in whole or in part, 
including by any negligence (but excluding fraud, dishonesty and/or 
willful misconduct or any other type of liability that by law cannot be 
excluded) on the part of, or any contingency beyond the control 
of Moody's, or any of its employees or agents, including any 
losses arising from or in connection with the procurement, compilation, 
analysis, interpretation, communication, dissemination, 
or delivery of any information or rating relating to the issuer.




Factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the rating:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range may indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously anticipated. 
Factors that may cause an upgrade of the ratings include significant loan 
paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's share of defeasance 
or overall improved pool performance. Factors that may cause a 
downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the overall performance 
of the pool, loan concentration, increased expected losses 
from specially serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and 
sensitivity analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and 
Sensitivity to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




Moody's received and took into account one or more third-party 
assessments on the due diligence performed regarding the underlying assets 
or financial instruments in this transaction and the assessments had a 
neutral impact on the credit rating. 




Further information on the representations and warranties and enforcement 
mechanisms available to investors are available on http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF389110.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




As the section on loss and cash flow analysis describes, Moody's 
quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios that stress factors 
contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into account the likelihood 
of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows. Moody's 
weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its assumptions of 
the likelihood of the events in such scenarios occurring.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series 
or category/class of debt or pursuant to a program for which the ratings 
are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the rating action on the support provider and in relation to each particular 
rating action for securities that derive their credit ratings from the 
support provider's credit rating. For provisional ratings, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the provisional rating assigned, and in relation to a definitive 
rating that may be assigned subsequent to the final issuance of the debt, 
in each case where the transaction structure and terms have not changed 
prior to the assignment of the definitive rating in a manner that would 
have affected the rating. For further information please see the 
ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this rating action, and 
whose ratings may change as a result of this rating action, the 
associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity. 
Exceptions to this approach exist for the following disclosures, 
if applicable to jurisdiction: Ancillary Services, Disclosure 
to rated entity, Disclosure from rated entity.




Regulatory disclosures contained in this press release apply to the credit 
rating and, if applicable, the related rating outlook or rating 
review.


Please see www.moodys.com for any updates on changes to 
the lead rating analyst and to the Moody's legal entity that has issued 
the rating.

Fitch Affirms GSMS 2014-GC26
























NEW YORK, Nov 02, 2016 (BUSINESS WIRE) --
Fitch Ratings has affirmed 12 classes of GS Mortgage Securities Trust 
      series 2014-GC26 (GSMS 2014-GC26) commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of 
      this press release.


                                        








KEY RATING DRIVERS


                                        








The affirmations are due to overall stable performance of the underlying 
      collateral. The stable performance reflects no material changes to pool 
      metrics since issuance, therefore, the original rating analysis was 
      considered in affirming the transaction. As of the October 2016 
      distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been 
      reduced by 1% to $1.24 billion million from $1.26 billion at issuance. 
      Currently, seven loans (4.6%) have been designated Fitch Loans of 
      Concern. No loans are specially serviced. No loans are defeased.


                                        








Stable Performance with No Material Changes: All loans in the pool 
      continue to perform, as of the October 2016 distribution, with property 
      level performance generally in line with issuance expectations and no 
      material changes to pool metrics.


                                        








High Fitch Leverage: The Fitch debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and 
      loan to value (LTV) at issuance were 1.13x and 109.6%, respectively.


                                        








Strong Pool Diversity: The pool diversity by loan amount is greater than 
      other recent transactions. The largest loan represents 7.1% of the pool, 
      and the top 10 loans represent only 40.5%.


                                        








High-Quality Properties: The pool has better than average property 
      quality with approximately one-fifth of the properties inspected by 
      Fitch at issuance assigned a property quality grade of 'A' or 'A-', 
      including five of the top 20 loans.


                                        








Fitch Loans of Concern: The largest Fitch Loan of Concern is the 129-131 
      Greene Street loan (1.9% of the pool), which is secured by a two-story 
      8,200-sf retail condo located on Greene Street between Houston and 
      Prince Streets in the SoHo area of New York City. The neighbourhood is 
      home to many notable high-end retailers. The property is 100% leased to 
      a Google subsidiary on a 10-year NNN lease that matures in 2024. The 
      store was to be one of Google's first brick-and-mortar retail locations 
      worldwide. However, Google never took occupancy, and the property is 
      currently being marketed for sublease. The tenant, which has the option 
      to terminate its lease with a fee after five years in 2019, has 
      continued to make all lease payments to date. The loan is structured 
      with a springing full cash flow sweep, which the servicer reports has 
      been triggered. The loan matures in 2018.


                                        








The next largest Fitch Loan of Concern is the Staybridge Suites 
      Lafayette loan (1.1% of the pool), which is secured by a 118-key hotel 
      located in Lafayette, LA. The servicer-reported June 2016 annualized NOI 
      DSCR fell to 1.01x due to a decline in hotel occupancy. No other Fitch 
      Loan of Concern comprises more than 0.4% of the pool. Fitch will 
      continue to monitor these loans for performance changes.


                                        








RATING SENSITIVITIES


                                        








The Rating Outlooks on all classes remain Stable. Fitch does not foresee 
      positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or 
      asset-level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level 
      metrics.

No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.

--$40.8 million class C at 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;


                                        








--$0 class PEZ at 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;

Class A-S, B and C certificates may be exchanged for class PEZ 
      certificates; and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for class A-S, 
      B and C certificates. Fitch does not rate the class D, E, F, G and H 
      certificates, or interest-only classes X-C and X-D.

Copyright Â© 2016 by Fitch Ratings, Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its 
      subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 
      1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or 
      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.


                                        








The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.

      Fitch Ratings has affirmed 12 classes of GS Mortgage Securities Trust 
      series 2014-GC26 (GSMS 2014-GC26) commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates. A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of 
      this press release.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      The affirmations are due to overall stable performance of the underlying 
      collateral. The stable performance reflects no material changes to pool 
      metrics since issuance, therefore, the original rating analysis was 
      considered in affirming the transaction. As of the October 2016 
      distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been 
      reduced by 1% to $1.24 billion million from $1.26 billion at issuance. 
      Currently, seven loans (4.6%) have been designated Fitch Loans of 
      Concern. No loans are specially serviced. No loans are defeased.
    

      Stable Performance with No Material Changes: All loans in the pool 
      continue to perform, as of the October 2016 distribution, with property 
      level performance generally in line with issuance expectations and no 
      material changes to pool metrics.
    

      High Fitch Leverage: The Fitch debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and 
      loan to value (LTV) at issuance were 1.13x and 109.6%, respectively.
    

      Strong Pool Diversity: The pool diversity by loan amount is greater than 
      other recent transactions. The largest loan represents 7.1% of the pool, 
      and the top 10 loans represent only 40.5%.
    

      High-Quality Properties: The pool has better than average property 
      quality with approximately one-fifth of the properties inspected by 
      Fitch at issuance assigned a property quality grade of 'A' or 'A-', 
      including five of the top 20 loans.
    

      Fitch Loans of Concern: The largest Fitch Loan of Concern is the 129-131 
      Greene Street loan (1.9% of the pool), which is secured by a two-story 
      8,200-sf retail condo located on Greene Street between Houston and 
      Prince Streets in the SoHo area of New York City. The neighbourhood is 
      home to many notable high-end retailers. The property is 100% leased to 
      a Google subsidiary on a 10-year NNN lease that matures in 2024. The 
      store was to be one of Google's first brick-and-mortar retail locations 
      worldwide. However, Google never took occupancy, and the property is 
      currently being marketed for sublease. The tenant, which has the option 
      to terminate its lease with a fee after five years in 2019, has 
      continued to make all lease payments to date. The loan is structured 
      with a springing full cash flow sweep, which the servicer reports has 
      been triggered. The loan matures in 2018.
    

      The next largest Fitch Loan of Concern is the Staybridge Suites 
      Lafayette loan (1.1% of the pool), which is secured by a 118-key hotel 
      located in Lafayette, LA. The servicer-reported June 2016 annualized NOI 
      DSCR fell to 1.01x due to a decline in hotel occupancy. No other Fitch 
      Loan of Concern comprises more than 0.4% of the pool. Fitch will 
      continue to monitor these loans for performance changes.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      The Rating Outlooks on all classes remain Stable. Fitch does not foresee 
      positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or 
      asset-level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level 
      metrics.
    

      USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10
    

      No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to 
      this rating action.
    

      Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:
    

      --$34.2 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$71 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$40 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$280 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$349.8 million class A-5 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$91.6 million class A-AB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$92.6 million class A-S at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$56.5 million class B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$40.8 million class C at 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$0 class PEZ at 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Interest-only class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --Interest-only class X-B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      Class A-S, B and C certificates may be exchanged for class PEZ 
      certificates; and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for class A-S, 
      B and C certificates. Fitch does not rate the class D, E, F, G and H 
      certificates, or interest-only classes X-C and X-D.

      Copyright Â© 2016 by Fitch Ratings, Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its 
      subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 
      1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or 
      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 
      337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale 
      clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not 
      intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning 
      of the Corporations Act 2001

For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moodyâs publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating.

Release date- 30112016 - DBRS Confirms Ratings on GS Mortgage Securities Trust 2014-GC26.
DBRS Limited (DBRS) has today confirmed the ratings on the following classes of Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2014-GC26, issued by GS Mortgage Securities Trust 2014-GC26 as follows:
Class A-1 at AAA (sf)
Class A-2 at AAA (sf)
Class A-3 at AAA (sf)
Class A-4 at AAA (sf)
Class A-5 at AAA (sf)
Class A-AB at AAA (sf)
Class X-A at AAA (sf)
Class X-B at AAA (sf)
Class X-C at AAA (sf)
Class X-D at AAA (sf)
Class A-S at AAA (sf)
Class B at AA (sf)
Class PEZ at A (sf)
Class C at A (sf)
Class D at BBB (low) (sf)
Class E at BB (low) (sf)
Class F at B (sf)
All trends are Stable. DBRS does not rate the first or second loss piece, Class G or Class H. The Class PEZ certificates are exchangeable with Class A-S, Class B and Class C certificates (and vice versa).
The rating confirmations reflect the overall stable performance of the transaction, which has remained in line with DBRS's expectations since issuance in December 2014. The collateral consists of 92 loans secured by 133 properties, and as of the November 2016 remittance, there has been a collateral reduction of 1.0% since issuance due to scheduled amortization. All of the original loans remain in the pool. Loans representing 94.3% of the current pool balance are reporting YE2015 figures with a weighted-average (WA) debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and a WA debt yield of 1.6 times (x) and 9.3%, respectively. The DBRS underwritten (UW) WA DSCR and WA debt yield at issuance were 1.4x and 8.3%, respectively.
As of the November 2016 remittance report, there are no loans in special servicing but there are 14 loans are on the servicer's watchlist, representing 7.4% of the current pool balance. Three of those loans, representing 2.8% of the pool, are on the watchlist for deferred maintenance; however, none of the issues noted appear to suggest a material impact on the overall condition of the property or operations in general. Five loans, representing 1.8% of the pool, are on the servicer's watchlist for upcoming tenant rollover. According to the servicer, some of these rolling tenants have renewed their leases, but for others, the status is yet to be determined. Three other loans are on the watchlist, representing 1.9% of the pool, for reporting a drop in DSCR as of the annualized Q2 2016 net cash flow (NCF) figures. There is one loan on the watchlist for delinquency, Prospectus ID#86, Dollar General Texas and Oklahoma Portfolio (0.24% of the pool), which showed payments at 30 days to 59 days late as of the November 2016 remittance. As the loan is reporting a YE2015 and a Q2 2016 DSCR of 1.59x and 1.61x, respectively, the payment issues are not likely cash flow related. DBRS has requested information from the servicer on the source of the delinquency and will monitor closely for developments.
The largest loan in the pool is Prospectus ID#1, Queen Ka'ahumanu Center, representing 7.1% of the pool. This loan is secured by the fee interest in a 570,904 square foot (sf) mixed-use regional mall located in Kahului, Hawaii. This is the island of Maui's only regional mall. The collateral is comprised of a regional mall (90.2% of NRA), an outparcel grocery store (4.6% of NRA) and a two-story office structure (2.6% of NRA). The subject was constructed in 1972, with the most recent renovations completed in 1994 and 2005. The sponsor, the Seligman Group, acquired the property from General Growth Partners in 2003 and Jones Lang LaSalle Retail provides third-party management services. As of the June 2016 rent roll, the collateral was 91.9% occupied with an average rental rate of $17.09 per sf (psf), remaining in line with the September 2015 occupancy rate of 92.5% and the average rental rate of $16.86 psf. At issuance, the property was 93.3% occupied with an average rental rate of $16.36 psf. The mall is anchored by Maui's only department stores in Macy's and Sears, in addition to a Foodland Super Market, and the six-screen Consolidated Theatres Ka'ahumanu 6 (Ka'ahumanu Theatres). Anchor sales for non-theater tenants have fallen since issuance. According to the trailing 12 months (T-12) May 2016 tenant sales report (TSR), Macy's Home Store, Macy's, Sears and Foodland Supermarket reported sales of $137.89 psf, $222.92 psf, $204.44 psf and $853.50 psf, respectively, figures that represent decreases of 16.9%, 3.6%, 15.9% and 4.9%, respectively, from the T-12 May 2015 TSR. Ka'ahumanu Theatres reported sales of $625,065.50 per screen, an increase of 25.6% from the T-12 May 2015 TSR. Although sales have declined for non-theater anchor tenants, those leases run through at least 2023 and it was noted at issuance that Sears and Macy's both had very low occupancy costs (0.7% and 3.1%, respectively). According to the YE2015 operating statement analysis report (OSAR), the DSCR was 1.19x, as compared to the DBRS UW DSCR of 1.05x. The DBRS UW NCF figure represented a 14.9% haircut to the Issuer's figure, driven largely by higher capital expenditures and tenant improvement/leasing commission costs underwritten.
Prospectus ID#3, 5599 San Felipe, represents 6.4% of the current pool balance and is secured by the borrower's fee interest in a 436,253 sf office property located in Houston, Texas. The subject consists of a 19-story building that was constructed in 1979, renovated in 1993 and again from 2010 through 2014. As of the June 2016 rent roll, the collateral was 96.2% occupied with an average rental rate of $21.61 psf, a small decrease from the September 2015 occupancy rate of 99.1% and the average rental rate of $22.00 psf. These figures compare similarly to issuance levels. The largest tenant at the property is Schlumberger Technology Corp (Schlumberger), which represents 69.7% of the NRA on a lease through 2027 at, an average rental rate of $24.84 psf. Founded in 1926, Schlumberger is the world's largest oilfield services company, employing over 100,000 people in over 85 countries and has been a tenant at the property since 1994, with the subject serving as its international headquarters. According to the YE2015 OSAR, the DSCR was 1.02x, a decrease from the DBRS UW DSCR of 1.56x. This decline was the result of a 90.5% decrease in expense reimbursements from the DBRS UW figure. At issuance, it was noted the largest tenant, Schlumberger, would begin paying expense reimbursements in August 2016, estimated at $4.0 million annually.

A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.KEY RATING DRIVERSThe affirmations are due to overall stable performance of the underlying collateral. The stable performance reflects no material changes to pool metrics since issuance, therefore, the original rating analysis was considered in affirming the transaction. As of the October 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 1% to $1.24 billion million from $1.26 billion at issuance. Currently, seven loans (4.6%) have been designated Fitch Loans of Concern. No loans are specially serviced. No loans are defeased.Stable Performance with No Material Changes: All loans in the pool continue to perform, as of the October 2016 distribution, with property level performance generally in line with issuance expectations and no material changes to pool metrics.High Fitch Leverage: The Fitch debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and loan to value (LTV) at issuance were 1.13x and 109.6%, respectively.Strong Pool Diversity: The pool diversity by loan amount is greater than other recent transactions. The largest loan represents 7.1% of the pool, and the top 10 loans represent only 40.5%.High-Quality Properties: The pool has better than average property quality with approximately one-fifth of the properties inspected by Fitch at issuance assigned a property quality grade of 'A' or 'A-', including five of the top 20 loans.Fitch Loans of Concern: The largest Fitch Loan of Concern is the 129-131 Greene Street loan (1.9% of the pool), which is secured by a two-story 8,200-sf retail condo located on Greene Street between Houston and Prince Streets in the SoHo area of New York City. The neighbourhood is home to many notable high-end retailers. The property is 100% leased to a Google subsidiary on a 10-year NNN lease that matures in 2024. The store was to be one of Google's first brick-and-mortar retail locations worldwide. However, Google never took occupancy, and the property is currently being marketed for sublease. The tenant, which has the option to terminate its lease with a fee after five years in 2019, has continued to make all lease payments to date. The loan is structured with a springing full cash flow sweep, which the servicer reports has been triggered. The loan matures in 2018.The next largest Fitch Loan of Concern is the Staybridge Suites Lafayette loan (1.1% of the pool), which is secured by a 118-key hotel located in Lafayette, LA. The servicer-reported June 2016 annualized NOI DSCR fell to 1.01x due to a decline in hotel occupancy. No other Fitch Loan of Concern comprises more than 0.4% of the pool. Fitch will continue to monitor these loans for performance changes.RATING SENSITIVITIESThe Rating Outlooks on all classes remain Stable. Fitch does not foresee positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or asset-level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level metrics.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to this rating action.Fitch has affirmed the following ratings:--$34.2 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$71 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$40 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$280 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$349.8 million class A-5 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$91.6 million class A-AB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$92.6 million class A-S at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$56.5 million class B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$40.8 million class C at 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;--$0 class PEZ at 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;--Interest-only class X-A at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--Interest-only class X-B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable.Class A-S, B and C certificates may be exchanged for class PEZ certificates; and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for class A-S, B and C certificates. Fitch does not rate the class D, E, F, G and H certificates, or interest-only classes X-C and X-D.Additional information is available at www.fitchratings.com.Read MoreApplicable CriteriaCounterparty Criteria for Structured Finance and Covered Bonds (pub. 01 Sep 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/886006Criteria for Rating Caps and Limitations in Global Structured Finance Transactions (pub. 16 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/882401Global Structured Finance Rating Criteria (pub. 27 Jun 2016)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/883130U.S. and Canadian Fixed-Rate Multiborrower CMBS Surveillance and U.S. Re-REMIC Criteria (pub. 13 Nov 2015)https://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/873395Related ResearchGS Mortgage Securities Trust 2014-GC26 - Appendixhttps://www.fitchratings.com/site/re/816808Additional DisclosuresDodd-Frank Rating Information Disclosure Formhttps://www.fitchratings.com/creditdesk/press_releases/content/ridf_frame.cfm?pr_id=1014218Solicitation Statushttps://www.fitchratings.com/gws/en/disclosure/solicitation?pr_id=1014218Endorsement Policyhttps://www.fitchratings.com/regulatoryALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

Telephone: 1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only.
