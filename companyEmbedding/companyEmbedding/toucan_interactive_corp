	Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements



	 


	Information included in this Form 10-Q contains forward-looking
	statements. This information may involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results,
	performance or achievements of Toucan Interactive Corp. (the “Company”), to be materially different from future results,
	performance or achievements expressed or implied by any forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause actual results to
	differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the Company’s ability
	to find an acquisition target that will provide value to its stockholders, the Company’s ability to successfully integrate
	an acquisition, the acquisition’s ability to compete successfully in its market and the ability of the Company and/or the
	acquisition to raise funds for working capital purposes, if needed. Forward-looking statements, which involve assumptions and describe
	future plans, strategies and expectations of the Company are generally identifiable by use of the words “may,” “will,”
	“should,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “believe,” “intend,”
	or “project” or the negative of these words or other variations on these words or comparable terminology. These forward-looking
	statements are based on assumptions that may be incorrect, and there can be no assurance that the projections included in the forward-looking
	statements will come to pass. Actual results of the Company could differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking
	statements as a result of various factors. Except as required by applicable laws, the Company has no obligation to update publicly
	any forward-looking statements for any reason, even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future.


	 



	*Please note that throughout this Quarterly
	Report, except as otherwise indicated by the context, references in this report to “Company”,  “we”,
	“us” and “our” are references to Toucan Interactive Corp.

	Corp.(the “Company”), have been prepared without audit pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and
	Exchange Commission. Certain information and footnote disclosures normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance
	with United States generally accepted principles have been condensed or omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations.


	 


	In the opinion of management, the financial statements contain all
	material adjustments, consisting only of normal adjustments considered necessary to present fairly the financial condition, results
	of operations, and cash flows of the Company for the interim periods presented.

	TOUCAN INTERACTIVE CORP.






	NOTES TO THE CONDENSED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS




	May 31, 2016 (Unaudited)



	 



	NOTE 1 – ORGANIZATION AND NATURE OF BUSINESS




	 




	Toucan Interactive Corp

	.
	(the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on January 28, 2014. We were a startup company
	in the business of providing credit information options on all major banks located in Costa Rica, Canada, United States and other
	countries located in North, Central and South America. Pursuant to the transactions described in Note 4 below, the Company experienced
	a change in control and ceased operations as a provider of credit option services. The Company currently serves as a vehicle to
	investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being
	a publicly held corporation.



	 




	NOTE 2 – BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND GOING CONCERN




	 




	BASIS OF ACCOUNTING



	 


	The accompanying unaudited interim financial statements of the Company
	have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and the rules and
	regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) for interim financial reporting. Accordingly, these
	financial statements do not include all information and footnote disclosures required for an annual set of financial statements
	prepared under United States generally accepted accounting principles. In the opinion of our management, all adjustments, consisting
	of normal recurring adjustments, considered necessary for a fair presentation of the financial position, results of operations
	and cash flows as of May 31, 2016 and for all interim periods presented herein have been reflected in these financial statements
	and the notes there to. Interim results for the three months ended May 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results to
	be expected for the fiscal year as a whole. These financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial
	statements and accompanying notes as included in the Form 10-K for the year ended February 29, 2016.


	 



	GOING CONCERN



	 


	The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis
	which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for
	the foreseeable future. The Company has incurred losses resulting in an accumulated deficit of $43,463 as of May 31, 2016 and further
	losses are anticipated in the development of its business raising substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue
	as a going concern. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in
	the future and, or, to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business
	operations when they come due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on
	hand and loans from the controlling stockholder and, or, private placement of common stock. These financials do not include any
	adjustments relating to the recoverability and reclassification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classifications of liabilities
	that might result from this uncertainty.


	 



	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES



	 



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	The Company does not expect the adoption of recently issued accounting
	pronouncements to have a significant impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial position or cash flow.


	 







	5






	 




	 



	NOTE 3 – ADVANCES FROM DIRECTOR




	 



	On January 28, 2014, the Company’s then sole director (the
	“Director”) loaned $678 to incorporate the Company and file initial list with Nevada Secretary of State.


	 


	During the period March 1, 2014 through February 29, 2016, Director
	loaned an additional $9,500 to the Company to pay operating expenses, and $5,500 were repaid.


	 


	On April 21, 2016, Director loaned an additional $10,000 on working
	capital. The Director loans are unsecured, non-interest bearing and due on demand.


	 


	On April 22, 2016, all the outstanding Director Loans were repaid
	in full in the total amount of $14,678.


	 


	On May 2, 2016 the Company’s controlling stockholder loaned
	an amount of $432 to the Company as working capital.


	 


	The balance due to the controlling stockholder was $432 as of May
	31, 2016.



	 




	NOTE 4 – COMMON STOCK




	 



	The Company has 75,000,000, $0.001 par value shares of common stock
	authorized.


	 


	On February 6, 2014, the Company issued 4,000,000 shares of common
	stock for cash proceeds of $4,000 at $0.001 per share.


	 


	From October 3, 2014 to November 24, 2014 the company issued 1,100,000
	shares of common stock for cash proceeds of $22,000 at $0.02 per share.


	 


	On April 22, 2016, pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement (the
	“Purchase Agreement”) with BDK Capital Group, LLC (“BDK”), the Company sold 6,000,000 newly issued shares
	of common stock to BDK for cash proceeds of $243,605 at $0.001 par value per share.


	 


	On April 22, 2016, subsequent to the closing of the transaction
	contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and pursuant to a Repurchase Agreement (the “Repurchase Agreement”) with the
	then majority stockholder (the “Majority Stockholder”), the Majority Stockholder sold and the Company repurchased 4,000,000
	shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $240,605, of which $14,678 went to satisfy amounts due to the Majority
	Stockholder for amounts previously advanced to the Company.


	 


	There were 7,100,000 shares of common stock issued and outstanding
	as of May 31, 2016.



	 




	NOTE 5 – CHANGES IN CONTROL




	 



	Following the closing of the transactions pursuant to the Purchase
	Agreement and the Repurchase Agreement (collectively, the “Transactions”), and the purchase of an additional 870,000
	shares of the Company’s common stock from other minority shareholders, BDK acquired approximately 96% of the issued and outstanding
	capital of the Company.



	 




	NOTE 6 – COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES



	 


	The Company neither owns nor leases any real or personal property.
	Following the closing of the Transactions, BDK has provided office services to the Company without charge. There is no obligation
	for BDK to continue this arrangement. Such costs are immaterial to the financial statements and accordingly are not reflected herein.
	The officers and directors are involved in other business activities and most likely will become involved in other business activities
	in the future.


	 





	NOTE 7 – SUBSEQUENT EVENTS



	 


	In accordance with SFAS 165 (ASC 855-10) the Company has analyzed
	its operations subsequent to May 31, 2016 to the date these financial statements were issued, and has determined that it does not
	have any material subsequent events to disclose in these financial statements.

	ITEM
	2.


	MANAGEMENT’ DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS





	 





	GENERAL





	 




	Toucan
	Interactive Corp. was incorporated in the state of Nevada on January 24, 2014 and maintained its official business address at
	Sabanilla de Montes de Oca, Urbanizacion Carmiol, Casa 254, San Jose, Costa Rica.




	 




	From
	inception until April 2016, the Company’s principal business consisted of developing a website, www.NEEDforCREDIT.com, to
	provide credit option services to users primarily in Costa Rica, Canada, the United States and South and Central America and to
	market context advertising services to banks and financial institutions in these countries and regions.




	 




	In
	April 2016, pursuant to the transactions described in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on April 22, 2016, the Company experienced
	a change of control (the “Change of Control”) and ceased operations as a provider of credit option services. The Company
	also changed the address of its principal executive offices to 25 E. Foothill Blvd., Arcadia, California 91006.




	 




	The
	Company currently serves as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business
	seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. Management does not intend to undertake any efforts to
	cause a market to develop in our securities, either debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business combination.
	The Company will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any industry, specific business or geographical location
	and, thus, may acquire any type of business.




	 




	The
	Company does not currently engage in any business activities that generate cash flow. During the next twelve months we anticipate
	incurring costs related to:




	 




	(i)
	filing Exchange Act reports, and




	(ii)
	investigating, analyzing and consummating a business combination.




	 




	We
	believe we will be able to meet these costs through use of funds in our treasury and additional amounts, as necessary, to be loaned
	to or invested in us by our controlling stockholder, management or other investors. As of the date of the period covered by this
	report, the Company has no cash in its treasury. There are no assurances that the Company will be able to secure funding as needed.




	 




	As
	of the date of this Quarterly Report, the Company has not entered into any definitive agreement with any party, nor have there
	been any specific discussions with any potential business combination candidate regarding business opportunities for the Company.
	The Company has unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities. The analysis
	of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the Company’s officers and directors. In
	its efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets, the Company will consider the following factors:




	 




	(a)
	Potential for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market expansion or new products;




	 




	(b)
	Competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the
	industry as a whole;




	 




	(c)
	Strength and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for recruitment;




	 




	(d)
	Capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be provided by the Company or from operations, through
	the sale of additional securities, through joint ventures or similar arrangements or from other sources;




	 




	(e)
	The cost of participation by the Company as compared to the perceived tangible and intangible values and potentials to be acquired;




	 




	(f)
	The extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced.




	 






	7






	 





	 




	In
	applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances
	and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data. In evaluating a prospective business
	combination, the Company will conduct as extensive a due diligence review of potential targets as reasonably possible.




	 




	We
	anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky. Potentially available business combinations
	may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation
	and analysis of such business opportunities difficult and complex. We cannot assure investors that our choice of a business combination
	will result in profitable operations.





	 






	CRITICAL
	ACCOUNTING POLICIES





	 




	There
	have been no significant changes during the three months ended May 31, 2016 to the critical accounting policies disclosed in our
	audited financial statements included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended February 29, 2016.





	 






	RESULTS
	OF OPERATIONS





	 




	The
	Company was a startup company and has generated minimal revenue to date. We have incurred recurring losses to date. We currently
	serve as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived
	advantages of being a publicly held corporation. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as
	a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification
	of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. We expect we will require additional capital
	to meet our goal of consummating a business combination with suitable growth potential and to meet our long term operating requirements.
	We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, loans from our controlling stockholder and the sale of equity
	or debt securities. We have no committed source of financing and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to raise funds as and
	when we need them.




	 





	Three
	Month Period Ended May 31, 2016 Compared to Three Month Period Ended May 31, 2015.





	 




	We
	earned no revenue during the three months ended May 31, 2016 and 2015. We have earned minimal revenue since the date of inception.




	 




	Our
	net loss for the three month period ended May 31, 2016 was $16,542 compared to a net loss of $16,354 for the three months ended
	May 31, 2015.




	 




	During
	the three month period ended May 31, 2016, we incurred general and administrative expenses of $16,542 as compared to $16,354 incurred
	for the three month period ended May 31, 2015. General and administrative expenses incurred during the three month periods ended
	May 31, 2016 and 2015 were generally related to corporate overhead and administrative contracted services.




	 





	LIQUIDITY
	AND CAPITAL RESOURCES









	 





	Three
	Month Period Ended May 31, 2016  






	 





	As of
	May 31, 2016, we had cash of $0 prepaid expenses of  7,500, liabilities of $7,285, and a working capital surplus of $215. As
	of February 29, 2016, we had cash of $3,757, liabilities of $4,678, and a working capital deficit of $921. We expect to incur
	continued losses until we acquire a company with operations and those operations are profitable.




	 






	8






	 





	 





	Cash
	Flows from Operating Activities





	 




	For
	the three months ended May 31, 2016 and 2015, net cash used in operating activities amounted to $16,542 and $16,354, respectively.




	 





	Cash
	Flows from Investing Activities





	 




	For
	the three months ended May 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company has not generated any cash flows from investing activities.




	 





	Cash
	Flows from Financing Activities





	 




	We
	have financed our operations primarily from loans or the issuance of equity. For the three months ended May 31, 2016 and 2015,
	net cash provided by financing activities amounted to $13,432 and $2,800, respectively.




	 




	We
	have generated minimal revenues from operations to date. It is not likely that we will generate any further revenues until a business
	combination has been consummated, however, even following a business combination, there is no guarantee that any revenues will
	be generated, that any revenues will be sufficient to meet our expenses or that we will ever become profitable. We may consider
	a business combination with a target company which itself has recently commenced operations, is a developing company in need of
	additional funds for expansion into new products or markets, is seeking to develop one or more new products or services, or is
	an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital.




	 




	Moreover,
	any target business that is selected may be financially unstable or in the early stages of development or growth, including businesses
	without established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business
	and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies. In addition, we may effect a business
	combination with a target company in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, and although our management will endeavor
	to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target company, there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess
	all significant risks.




	 




	The
	foregoing considerations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.  We are currently planning
	on devoting the vast majority of our efforts to identifying, investigating and conducting due diligence on target companies and
	negotiating, structuring, documenting and consummating a business combination. Our long-term ability to continue as a going concern
	is dependent upon our ability to complete a business combination and, thereafter, achieve profitable operations.




	 




	We
	believe that we will be able to meet these costs through future cash on hand, if any, and additional amounts, as may be necessary,
	to be loaned by or invested in us by our controlling stockholder, management and/or others. Currently, however, our ability to
	continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations and/or to obtain the necessary
	financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due.  Our
	ability to continue as a going concern is also dependent on our ability to find a suitable target company and enter into a business
	combination.  Management’s plan includes obtaining additional funds through a combination of sales of our equity securities
	before, contemporaneously with, or following, the consummation of a business combination and borrowings, although we do not believe
	that we will be eligible to borrow funds from a bank until at least a business combination is consummated,  However, there
	is no assurance that any additional funding will be available on terms that are favorable to us or at all.




	  




	On
	April 22, 2016, all the loans made by the Company’s then sole director were repaid in full. Since the Change of Control
	in April 2016, we rely on loans from our controlling stockholder to meet our expenses. There is no guarantee that our controlling
	stockholder will continue to lend us funds to meet our expenses in the future. Currently, we do not have any other arrangements
	for financing. On May 2, 2016, the controlling stockholder loaned $432 to the Company for working capital.




	 






	9






	 





	 




	We
	have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If financing is not available
	to us on satisfactory terms or at all, we may be unable to develop operations or meet our expenses.  Additionally, any equity
	financing in which we might engage would result in dilution to our existing stockholders.




	 





	GOING
	CONCERN





	 




	The
	independent auditors’ audit report accompanying our financial statements dated February 29, 2016 contained an explanatory
	paragraph expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. The financial statements have been prepared
	assuming that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities
	and commitments in the ordinary course of business.





	 






	OFF-BALANCE
	SHEET ARRANGEMENTS





	 




	As
	of the date of this Quarterly Report, we do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to
	have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations,
	liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that are material to investors.

	Not
	applicable.





	 







	ITEM
	4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES





	 




	Our
	management is responsible for establishing and maintaining a system of disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule
	13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) that is designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in
	the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods
	specified in the Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls
	and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by an issuer in the reports that it files or submits
	under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the issuer’s management, including its principal executive officer
	or officers and principal financial officer or officers, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate to allow timely
	decisions regarding required disclosure.




	 




	An
	evaluation was conducted under the supervision and with the participation of our management of the effectiveness of the design
	and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of May 31, 2016. Based on that evaluation, our management concluded
	that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date to ensure that information required to be disclosed

	PART
	II.  OTHER INFORMATION





	  







	ITEM
	1. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS





	 




	We
	are not currently a party to any lawsuit or proceeding which, in the opinion of management, is likely to have a material adverse
	effect on us or our business.





	 







	ITEM
	1A. RISK FACTORS






	 






	An
	investment in our common stock involves a number of very significant risks.





	 




	Any
	investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Some, but not all, of the risks that affect an investment in our
	Company include:




	 








	●




	We
	have little operating history and minimal revenue and there is no guarantee that we can
	establish a profitable operation in the foreseeable future;








	●




	We
	have incurred recurring net losses in the past and unless we receive additional financing,
	we may be forced to cease all operations and liquidate our Company;








	●




	We
	face intense competition for business combination opportunities and because of our limited
	resources, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business
	opportunities and successfully completing a business combination with suitable growth
	potential;








	●




	We
	may be unable to obtain additional financing that may be needed to fund the operations
	and/or growth of the target business;








	●




	We
	have no full time employees and are substantially dependent on the efforts of part-time
	management and members of the board of directors, working for per-diem or no cash compensation,
	none of whom are bound by term employment agreements and;








	●




	Our
	controlling stockholder and executive officers and directors currently are able to influence
	matters requiring stockholder approval and their interests may conflict with those of
	other stockholders.






	 





	We
	do not have any targets for a business combination or other transaction and we have no minimum standards for a business combination.





	 




	We
	have no arrangement, agreement, or understanding with respect to acquiring a business opportunity or engaging in a business combination
	with any private entity. There can be no assurance that we will successfully identify and evaluate suitable business opportunities
	or conclude a business combination. We have not established a specific length of operating history or a specified level of earnings,
	assets, net worth or other criteria which we will require a target business opportunity to have achieved. Accordingly, we may
	enter into a business combination with a business opportunity having no significant operating history, losses, limited or no potential
	for earnings, limited assets, negative net worth or other negative characteristics.




	 





	Our
	stockholders may face significant restrictions on the resale of our common stock.





	 




	The
	following factors (there can be others)


	may significantly affect our stockholders’ ability to resell our common stock:




	 








	●




	There
	is currently no established public trading market for our common stock, which makes it
	difficult for our stockholders to resell their shares;








	●




	As
	we are currently a “shell company” as defined under Rule 144, stockholders
	who receive our restricted securities will not be able to sell our shares without registration
	until one year after we have satisfied the applicable conditions under Rule 144;








	●




	Our
	common stock may be subject to significant restriction on resale due to federal penny
	stock restrictions.

	CERTIFICATION
	OF PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER






	 





	I,
	Gang Ding, certify that:




	 






	1.




	I
	have reviewed this quarterly report on Form 10-Q of Toucan Interactive Corp., the registrant;






	 




	 






	2.




	Based
	on my knowledge, this quarterly report does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
	fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances under which such statements were made, not misleading
	with respect to the period covered by this quarterly report;






	 




	 






	3.




	Based

	The

	in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15 (f)) for the registrant and have:






	 






	 




	a)

	such disclosure controls and procedures, or caused such disclosure controls and procedures to be designed under our supervision,
	to ensure that material information relating to the registrant, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to

	c)




	evaluated
	the effectiveness of the registrant’s disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this report our conclusions
	about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this report based
	on such evaluation; and






	 




	 




	 






	 




	d)




	disclosed
	in this report any change in the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant’s
	most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant’s fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially
	affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting;
	and






	 






	5.




	The
	registrant’s other certifying officer and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control
	over financial reporting, to the registrant’s auditors and the audit committee of the registrant’s board of directors
	(or persons performing the equivalent functions):






	 






	 




	a)




	all
	significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which
	are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant’s ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
	information; and






	 




	 




	 






	 




	b)




	any
	fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant’s
	internal control over financial reporting.

Except for fixed costs, the amounts actually spent by us for any specific
purpose may vary and will depend on a number of factors. Non-fixed cost, sales
and marketing and general and administrative costs may vary depending on the
business progress and development efforts, general business conditions and
market reception to our services. Accordingly, our management has broad
discretion to allocate the net proceeds to non-fixed costs.

An example of changes to this spending allocation for non-fixed costs include
Management deciding to spend less of the allotment on product development and
more on sales and marketing. Such changes to spending may occur due to seasonal
variations in market demand for our products and services relative to when the
funds are received.

If necessary, Mikhail Bukshpan, our sole officer and director, has verbally
agreed to loan the company funds to complete the registration process but we
will require full funding to implement our complete business plan.


We are aware of the existence of some websites that provide comparisons of 
different credit card offers, such as: credit.com, bankrate.com, 
creditkarma.com, and cardhub.com. However, to our knowledge, a website that 
provides the same services as ours does not exist. Our users will be able to 
choose a bank by visiting our website alone, instead of surfing the major banks 
website, one after the other. Also, users can always surf the search engines 
such as google.com that will help them compare credit cards in the U.S., 
however, our website will differ from the competitors since we will be 
providing:

1. Information on credit cards in all the Americas

2. Credit cards unique comparison system

3. Special information for people who are applying for their first credit card

4. Special advertising related to credit cards 

5. High visibility on search engines by remaining in the top 20.


Company Description
We are a development stage company which intend to provid e credit information 
options on all major banks located in Costa Rica, Canada, United States and 
other countries located in North, Central and South America, we intend to 
provide information on the different credit cards, lines of credit


 and other 
loans offered by the different banks of each country. At the moment, we are 
building the website concentrating only at the Costa Rican banks. However, we 
will be adding different banks from the United States in the near future. 
Additionally we plan to add the different banks from Canada and other countries 
in the American Continent. Being a development stage company, we have no 
revenues and have limited operating history.

We intend to be in the business of providing different credit options, from 
different banks, using one website: “www.needforcredit.com ”. The company will 
post and continuously update a multitude of credit options available for our 
users, within the different countries offered in our website.

From inception until the date of this filing, we did not have any operating 
activities. However, we have signed two agreements. The first contract was 
signed between Toucan Interactive Corp. and the web designer, Mr. Nasser 
Bouslihim. The second contract was signed between Toucan Interactive Corp. and 
Mr. Dzabir Mamadov, from Kolobok Distribution Inc., a company interested in 
placing an ad on our website.

Toucan Interactive Corp. anticipates that it will derive its income from three 
main sources:

1) Contextual Pay-Per Click and Banner Advertising 

2) Online Consultations on the Different Credit Systems 

3) Mobile Apps

We do not anticipate earning revenues until we get enough users who will 
attract advertisement contracts from different commercial businesses. Since we 
are presently in the development stage of our business, we can provide no 
assurance that we will successfully assemble, construct and sell any products 
or services related to our planned activities. The website is planned to be up 
and running sometimes in the second quarter, but the nature of our business 
will require continuous updates and add-ons of the different countries.
---

Toucan Interactive Corp. was incorporated in Nevada on January 28, 2014. Our 
principal executive office is located at Sabanilla de Montes de Oca, 
Urbanizacion Carmiol, Casa 254, San Jose, Costa Rica. Our phone number is 
514-448-4530.
