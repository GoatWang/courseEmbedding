            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]
Foundations[edit]
The bank opened its doors on March 12, 1887 as a savings and loan association under the name Iberia Building Association.[9] The name originates from New Iberia, LA, which dates back to 1779 when Spanish immigrants named their newly settled “Nueva Iberia” after the Iberian Peninsula.[citation needed] At the time the bank was founded, New Iberia was a farming community of about 3,000 people. Its principal industry was sugarcane farming, as the area’s oil reserves, which would later spur population and economic growth, had yet to be discovered.[10]
For its first 100 years, the bank’s main functions were taking deposits and making home mortgage loans in the New Iberia community.[11]
In 1956 Iberia Building Association changed its name to Iberia Savings & Loan (ISLA). Since savings and loan associations, or “thrifts,” could not lend to businesses, ISLA was not affected by the oil crisis in the early 1980s like many Louisiana commercial banks were.[9]
After regulations preventing thrifts from expanding eased in 1985, the bank absorbed several struggling during the 1980s oil glut. Branches opened in Morgan City and Franklin, LA, moving the thrift beyond Iberia Parish for the first time. ISLA became Iberia Savings Bank (ISB) in 1988, and expansion continued the following year into Lafayette, LA with the acquisition of Acadia Savings & Loan.[11]
Additional regulatory changes in the early 1990s permitted Louisiana savings and loan associations to become state-chartered commercial banks.[9] Bank President Larrey Mouton prepared the company for this transition by forming the holding company ISB Financial Corporation and releasing an IPO on April 13, 1995.[12]




Former IBERIABANK logo, used officially until 2007


In 1999, former Bank One executive Daryl Byrd took over as CEO, ushering in a period of rapid growth for the bank. With its new name IBERIABANK Corporation, the company would grow to acquire 24 banks since 2001.[13]
When Hurricane Katrina hit the gulf coast in 2005, IberiaBank incurred hurricane-related expenses including loan losses associated with the storm, facility repairs and insurance deductible payments. Being a bank solely based in Louisiana, the organization decided to diversify its geographic footprint in the years following the storm to minimize risk.[14] The bank expanded beyond Louisiana for the first time in 2007 with the purchase of Arkansas –based Pulaski Bank and Trust.[15]
Spring of 2008 began a period of rapid growth fueled by accumulating the assets of failed banks in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. It began with the assumption of insured deposits from Arkansas-based ANB Financial, the third FDIC-insured bank to fail in 2008.[16] The following year, IBERIABANK assumed the assets and branches of Birmingham-based CapitalSouth, Orion Bank of Florida, and Century Bank of Florida. Its fifth and final FDIC-assisted transaction occurred late 2009 with the purchase of East Florida’s Sterling Bank.[17]
2000-2017: Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
The company has grown to acquire 24 other banks since 2001.[9]

History[edit]
Foundations[edit]
The bank opened its doors on March 12, 1887 as a savings and loan association under the name Iberia Building Association.[9] The name originates from New Iberia, LA, which dates back to 1779 when Spanish immigrants named their newly settled “Nueva Iberia” after the Iberian Peninsula.[citation needed] At the time the bank was founded, New Iberia was a farming community of about 3,000 people. Its principal industry was sugarcane farming, as the area’s oil reserves, which would later spur population and economic growth, had yet to be discovered.[10]
For its first 100 years, the bank’s main functions were taking deposits and making home mortgage loans in the New Iberia community.[11]
In 1956 Iberia Building Association changed its name to Iberia Savings & Loan (ISLA). Since savings and loan associations, or “thrifts,” could not lend to businesses, ISLA was not affected by the oil crisis in the early 1980s like many Louisiana commercial banks were.[9]
After regulations preventing thrifts from expanding eased in 1985, the bank absorbed several struggling during the 1980s oil glut. Branches opened in Morgan City and Franklin, LA, moving the thrift beyond Iberia Parish for the first time. ISLA became Iberia Savings Bank (ISB) in 1988, and expansion continued the following year into Lafayette, LA with the acquisition of Acadia Savings & Loan.[11]
Additional regulatory changes in the early 1990s permitted Louisiana savings and loan associations to become state-chartered commercial banks.[9] Bank President Larrey Mouton prepared the company for this transition by forming the holding company ISB Financial Corporation and releasing an IPO on April 13, 1995.[12]




Former IBERIABANK logo, used officially until 2007


In 1999, former Bank One executive Daryl Byrd took over as CEO, ushering in a period of rapid growth for the bank. With its new name IBERIABANK Corporation, the company would grow to acquire 24 banks since 2001.[13]
When Hurricane Katrina hit the gulf coast in 2005, IberiaBank incurred hurricane-related expenses including loan losses associated with the storm, facility repairs and insurance deductible payments. Being a bank solely based in Louisiana, the organization decided to diversify its geographic footprint in the years following the storm to minimize risk.[14] The bank expanded beyond Louisiana for the first time in 2007 with the purchase of Arkansas –based Pulaski Bank and Trust.[15]
Spring of 2008 began a period of rapid growth fueled by accumulating the assets of failed banks in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. It began with the assumption of insured deposits from Arkansas-based ANB Financial, the third FDIC-insured bank to fail in 2008.[16] The following year, IBERIABANK assumed the assets and branches of Birmingham-based CapitalSouth, Orion Bank of Florida, and Century Bank of Florida. Its fifth and final FDIC-assisted transaction occurred late 2009 with the purchase of East Florida’s Sterling Bank.[17]
2000-2017: Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
The company has grown to acquire 24 other banks since 2001.[9]

History[edit]
Foundations[edit]
The bank opened its doors on March 12, 1887 as a savings and loan association under the name Iberia Building Association.[9] The name originates from New Iberia, LA, which dates back to 1779 when Spanish immigrants named their newly settled “Nueva Iberia” after the Iberian Peninsula.[citation needed] At the time the bank was founded, New Iberia was a farming community of about 3,000 people. Its principal industry was sugarcane farming, as the area’s oil reserves, which would later spur population and economic growth, had yet to be discovered.[10]
For its first 100 years, the bank’s main functions were taking deposits and making home mortgage loans in the New Iberia community.[11]
In 1956 Iberia Building Association changed its name to Iberia Savings & Loan (ISLA). Since savings and loan associations, or “thrifts,” could not lend to businesses, ISLA was not affected by the oil crisis in the early 1980s like many Louisiana commercial banks were.[9]
After regulations preventing thrifts from expanding eased in 1985, the bank absorbed several struggling during the 1980s oil glut. Branches opened in Morgan City and Franklin, LA, moving the thrift beyond Iberia Parish for the first time. ISLA became Iberia Savings Bank (ISB) in 1988, and expansion continued the following year into Lafayette, LA with the acquisition of Acadia Savings & Loan.[11]
Additional regulatory changes in the early 1990s permitted Louisiana savings and loan associations to become state-chartered commercial banks.[9] Bank President Larrey Mouton prepared the company for this transition by forming the holding company ISB Financial Corporation and releasing an IPO on April 13, 1995.[12]




Former IBERIABANK logo, used officially until 2007


In 1999, former Bank One executive Daryl Byrd took over as CEO, ushering in a period of rapid growth for the bank. With its new name IBERIABANK Corporation, the company would grow to acquire 24 banks since 2001.[13]
When Hurricane Katrina hit the gulf coast in 2005, IberiaBank incurred hurricane-related expenses including loan losses associated with the storm, facility repairs and insurance deductible payments. Being a bank solely based in Louisiana, the organization decided to diversify its geographic footprint in the years following the storm to minimize risk.[14] The bank expanded beyond Louisiana for the first time in 2007 with the purchase of Arkansas –based Pulaski Bank and Trust.[15]
Spring of 2008 began a period of rapid growth fueled by accumulating the assets of failed banks in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. It began with the assumption of insured deposits from Arkansas-based ANB Financial, the third FDIC-insured bank to fail in 2008.[16] The following year, IBERIABANK assumed the assets and branches of Birmingham-based CapitalSouth, Orion Bank of Florida, and Century Bank of Florida. Its fifth and final FDIC-assisted transaction occurred late 2009 with the purchase of East Florida’s Sterling Bank.[17]
2000-2017: Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
The company has grown to acquire 24 other banks since 2001.[9]

IberiaBank Corporation, stylized as IBERIABANK, is an American financial holding company headquartered in Lafayette, LA and the largest bank based in Louisiana.[4] Founded in 1887,[5] it now has over 250 combined offices in 10 states primarily throughout the South. The company has eight locations with representatives of IBERIA Wealth Advisors in four states, and one IBERIA Capital Partners, L.L.C. office in New Orleans.[6]
IberiaBank is an FDIC-insured institution regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. On March 31, 2009, as the financial crisis came to an end, IberiaBank became the first financial institution in the country to repay its TARP funds to the Treasury.[7][8]

History[edit]
Foundations[edit]
The bank opened its doors on March 12, 1887 as a savings and loan association under the name Iberia Building Association.[9] The name originates from New Iberia, LA, which dates back to 1779 when Spanish immigrants named their newly settled “Nueva Iberia” after the Iberian Peninsula.[citation needed] At the time the bank was founded, New Iberia was a farming community of about 3,000 people. Its principal industry was sugarcane farming, as the area’s oil reserves, which would later spur population and economic growth, had yet to be discovered.[10]
For its first 100 years, the bank’s main functions were taking deposits and making home mortgage loans in the New Iberia community.[11]
In 1956 Iberia Building Association changed its name to Iberia Savings & Loan (ISLA). Since savings and loan associations, or “thrifts,” could not lend to businesses, ISLA was not affected by the oil crisis in the early 1980s like many Louisiana commercial banks were.[9]
After regulations preventing thrifts from expanding eased in 1985, the bank absorbed several struggling during the 1980s oil glut. Branches opened in Morgan City and Franklin, LA, moving the thrift beyond Iberia Parish for the first time. ISLA became Iberia Savings Bank (ISB) in 1988, and expansion continued the following year into Lafayette, LA with the acquisition of Acadia Savings & Loan.[11]
Additional regulatory changes in the early 1990s permitted Louisiana savings and loan associations to become state-chartered commercial banks.[9] Bank President Larrey Mouton prepared the company for this transition by forming the holding company ISB Financial Corporation and releasing an IPO on April 13, 1995.[12]




Former IBERIABANK logo, used officially until 2007


In 1999, former Bank One executive Daryl Byrd took over as CEO, ushering in a period of rapid growth for the bank. With its new name IBERIABANK Corporation, the company would grow to acquire 24 banks since 2001.[13]
When Hurricane Katrina hit the gulf coast in 2005, IberiaBank incurred hurricane-related expenses including loan losses associated with the storm, facility repairs and insurance deductible payments. Being a bank solely based in Louisiana, the organization decided to diversify its geographic footprint in the years following the storm to minimize risk.[14] The bank expanded beyond Louisiana for the first time in 2007 with the purchase of Arkansas –based Pulaski Bank and Trust.[15]
Spring of 2008 began a period of rapid growth fueled by accumulating the assets of failed banks in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. It began with the assumption of insured deposits from Arkansas-based ANB Financial, the third FDIC-insured bank to fail in 2008.[16] The following year, IBERIABANK assumed the assets and branches of Birmingham-based CapitalSouth, Orion Bank of Florida, and Century Bank of Florida. Its fifth and final FDIC-assisted transaction occurred late 2009 with the purchase of East Florida’s Sterling Bank.[17]
2000-2017: Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
The company has grown to acquire 24 other banks since 2001.[9]

IberiaBank Corporation, stylized as IBERIABANK, is an American financial holding company headquartered in Lafayette, LA and the largest bank based in Louisiana.[4] Founded in 1887,[5] it now has over 250 combined offices in 10 states primarily throughout the South. The company has eight locations with representatives of IBERIA Wealth Advisors in four states, and one IBERIA Capital Partners, L.L.C. office in New Orleans.[6]
IberiaBank is an FDIC-insured institution regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. On March 31, 2009, as the financial crisis came to an end, IberiaBank became the first financial institution in the country to repay its TARP funds to the Treasury.[7][8]

History[edit]
Foundations[edit]
The bank opened its doors on March 12, 1887 as a savings and loan association under the name Iberia Building Association.[9] The name originates from New Iberia, LA, which dates back to 1779 when Spanish immigrants named their newly settled “Nueva Iberia” after the Iberian Peninsula.[citation needed] At the time the bank was founded, New Iberia was a farming community of about 3,000 people. Its principal industry was sugarcane farming, as the area’s oil reserves, which would later spur population and economic growth, had yet to be discovered.[10]
For its first 100 years, the bank’s main functions were taking deposits and making home mortgage loans in the New Iberia community.[11]
In 1956 Iberia Building Association changed its name to Iberia Savings & Loan (ISLA). Since savings and loan associations, or “thrifts,” could not lend to businesses, ISLA was not affected by the oil crisis in the early 1980s like many Louisiana commercial banks were.[9]
After regulations preventing thrifts from expanding eased in 1985, the bank absorbed several struggling during the 1980s oil glut. Branches opened in Morgan City and Franklin, LA, moving the thrift beyond Iberia Parish for the first time. ISLA became Iberia Savings Bank (ISB) in 1988, and expansion continued the following year into Lafayette, LA with the acquisition of Acadia Savings & Loan.[11]
Additional regulatory changes in the early 1990s permitted Louisiana savings and loan associations to become state-chartered commercial banks.[9] Bank President Larrey Mouton prepared the company for this transition by forming the holding company ISB Financial Corporation and releasing an IPO on April 13, 1995.[12]




Former IBERIABANK logo, used officially until 2007


In 1999, former Bank One executive Daryl Byrd took over as CEO, ushering in a period of rapid growth for the bank. With its new name IBERIABANK Corporation, the company would grow to acquire 24 banks since 2001.[13]
When Hurricane Katrina hit the gulf coast in 2005, IberiaBank incurred hurricane-related expenses including loan losses associated with the storm, facility repairs and insurance deductible payments. Being a bank solely based in Louisiana, the organization decided to diversify its geographic footprint in the years following the storm to minimize risk.[14] The bank expanded beyond Louisiana for the first time in 2007 with the purchase of Arkansas –based Pulaski Bank and Trust.[15]
Spring of 2008 began a period of rapid growth fueled by accumulating the assets of failed banks in the aftermath of the global financial crisis. It began with the assumption of insured deposits from Arkansas-based ANB Financial, the third FDIC-insured bank to fail in 2008.[16] The following year, IBERIABANK assumed the assets and branches of Birmingham-based CapitalSouth, Orion Bank of Florida, and Century Bank of Florida. Its fifth and final FDIC-assisted transaction occurred late 2009 with the purchase of East Florida’s Sterling Bank.[17]
2000-2017: Mergers and acquisitions[edit]
The company has grown to acquire 24 other banks since 2001.[9]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
