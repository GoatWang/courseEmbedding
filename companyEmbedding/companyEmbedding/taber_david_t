David O. Taber

David Taber is the author of the Prentice-Hall book, "Salesforce.com 
		Secrets of Success," and the CEO of SalesLogistix.  
		Before founding SalesLogistix, David ran a marketing consultancy for Silicon Valley and international startups,       
		     David Taber &Associates.       
        In dozens of client engagements, he noticed a repeating pattern:       
        all the companies were using Salesforce.com, and their big problems all 
		related to the business processes 
		surrounding their CRM systems.  Users couldn't find customers, support tickets, or deal      
        status.  Executives couldn't get a believable forecast.  Marketers were going crazy trying to      
        get their leads through to Sales in a productive way. 
That's why he founded SalesLogistix.

			optimization algorithms

			competitive marketing for Sybase

Description
For Sale: Dr. T Gunstock - Westinghouse micarta with natural micarta bolsters and liners with an orange accent spacer, blade in CPM154I am asking $480 Paypal, shipped USPS Priority for the Knife, pouch/paperwork, slip sheath from CollectorKnives, and belt carry "A&M" Leatherworks sheath. First "I'll take it" wins.This knife is used. I tried to depict the condition of the knife to the best of my ability in my pictures. There are some scratches/swirling marks on the pivot point, shield, and blade. Other then that, there are NO chips or dings. There is absolutely ZERO blade play.SPECS:Closed: 3.25"Open: 5.75"Blade: 2 3/8"I am the original owner and purchased this knife directly from David Taber. The spring of the knife is perfectly flush in all three positions. I would say it has "medium" pinch to open. Thank you for looking.

You’re investing in Salesforce.com for one reason: to drive major performance improvements across your entire organization. Salesforce.com® Secrets of Success will help you do just that. Drawing on his experience with dozens of deployments, author David Taber offers expert guidance on every aspect of Salesforce.com deployment, with results-focused best practices for every area of the organization touched by Salesforce.com, including sales, marketing, customer service, finance, legal, and IT.

Taber walks you through developing a comprehensive and effective implementation strategy, followed by tactics and specifics to overcome every challenge you face, including internal politics. Through this book and its companion Web site, www.SFDC-secrets.com, Taber provides questionnaires, step-by-step guides, and extensive resources–all part of the Revenue Overdrive™ system that gives your organization maximum results from Salesforce.com.

Reviews
Praise for Salesforce.com® Secrets of Success
 
“Salesforce.com is usually thought of as an SFA system, but it really needs to be thought of as a full-fledged CRM. For more than five years, I’ve headed up marketing teams trying to expand the power of SFDC for highly automated Internet customer interaction systems. Salesforce.com® Secrets of Success is required reading for the modern marketer, sales exec, or customer support professional.”
—Mark de Visser, CEO of Sonatype
 
“Salesforce.com® Secrets of Success is terrific because it gives guidance to every major executive, as well as tactical recommendations to the implementation team. Using this book’s methods ensures the high user adoption rate we achieved at Syneron. It also provides hundreds of tips that save time and money in the real world.”
—Doron Gerstel, CEO of Syneron Medical
 
“Salesforce.com® Secrets of Success helps the busy executive figure out what to do—and not to do—when a Salesforce system is being built or extended. I appreciate the balance it provides, giving strategic guidance to the executive team and tactical tips to the implementers.”
—Dave Kellogg, CEO of Mark Logic
 
“Salesforce.com® Secrets of Success focuses on the business processes that surround SFDC—the things that people do to leverage the system and become more effective. Any organization going through internal change in sales, marketing, or other customer-facing teams needs to see and work on the big picture. This book helps them do just that.”
—Jon Lambert, CFO of Wombat Trading Systems division, New York Stock Exchange
 
“Mr. Taber takes a hard look at reality and CRM systems and finds the way to bridge the gap between the two using Salesforce.com. You are sure to succeed with your Salesforce.com initiative by reading this excellent book. This is the Salesforce.com ‘manual’ we were all looking for.”
—Joshua Meiri, Salesforce.com User Group Leader
 
“Salesforce.com® Secrets of Success combines Agile with Salesforce.com, the most widely used, hosted SFA system. Taber takes it one step further by telling product marketers and product managers how to use SFDC and the latest Agile tools to do their jobs better. A must-read.”
—Rich Mironov, CMO of Enthiosys
 
“Salesforce.com® Secrets of Success is the distillation of lessons learned at dozens of SFDC customers, and every lesson has been put in terms that people at every level of the organization can understand. I only wish this book had been out when we were building out our system—we could have saved endless meetings by simply following its best practices.”
—Daniel Moskowitz, CFO of Zend Technologies
 
“Salesforce.com® Secrets of Success is an invaluable guide for the executive wanting to get the most leverage from Salesforce.com. The book tells the executive what to ask for—and what not to ask for—to get the best revenue visibility and results from the team. We’ve been steadily expanding our SFDC system to make it into a full-fledged CRM, using the techniques from this book. This book is highly recommended for companies that want to grow their size and sales performance.”
—Dave Robbins, CEO of BigFix
 
“Salesforce.com® Secrets of Success is the first book to apply Agile methods to SFA/CRM systems development, and it breaks new ground for both the technologist and executive. At ThoughtWorks, we’ve been using Agile for years, and Taber’s Salesforce approaches really pay off.”
—Roy Singham, CEO of ThoughtWorks
 
“I have been waiting years for this book and never knew it! David Taber has written an excellent guide to the benefits and pitfalls of implementing SFDC and, in the process, provides insight and valuable information on successfully navigating through user groups, management, sales, marketing, and IT departments to get the best results.” 
—Dan Weiss, Manager of Sales and Marketing Applications, Bell Microproducts

How-To
If You Can't Go Agile for CRM Project, Fixed-Price Can Work

Agile is the best approach for CRM projects, but what if management just won't let you go there? What does it really mean to have a fixed-price, fixed-deliverable project? You will have to put in more effort, but you can succeed in the long run.

Using CRM to Know the Score Before the Super Bowl






Video
An inside look at Cogito's newest emotional intelligence software






















If you've been paying attention, you know that I rail on about the problems of fixed-price CRM projects while endlessly promoting Agile engagements for CRM systems.Why? When you're trying to optimize a CRM system, you're not getting a pre-existing commodity. You're developing a customized system that helps you achieve your specific business goals. It should leverage (or provide the foundation for) organizational change. In other words, you're not buying a product: you're buying into a process.I'll even argue that if all do is buy "an implementation," then you're missing half the point of CRM. If all you get is "automation," then you'll just be doing the same old thing at lower cost, instead of growing the top line.But enough with the polemics. When the Boss Says, 'Forget Agile; It's Fixed Price!'For many, the biggest issue with agile projects is not knowing what you're going to get for your money. If you don't trust the project team and the vendor, agile can indeed look like a license to steal.The best answer to your boss' concerns: Don't even think about starting a project until you find a project team and a vendor that you dotrust. But that's probably just crazy talk. In my experience, fixed-price CRM projects are more likely to be complete in name only, with unhappy users, than they are to be satisfactory to users, with unhappy budget-holders.Analysis: How Much Should You Spend on CRM Software?(Full disclosure: I ran fixed-price Department of Defense projects for years, with only one small overrun. Despite the popular perception, Air Force procurement processes are pretty tight.)  In CRM projects, clients tend to demand fixed-price projects without actually preparing for them. In response, vendors often use three strategies for "fixed pricing"—providing only cookie-cutter CRM implementations, selling just a bucket of hours (that is, not signing up to completing the deliverables), or starting engineering change order (ECO) negotiations almost from the outset. To prevent this from happening, there are a few things to look for in the vendors, as well as a few behaviors you need to follow along the way. Here's a quick rundown of how things ought to work.Step 1: Before Any CRM Project, Do Your HomeworkThe RFI, RFP and RFQ drill works well if your team really knows the details of the business and technical requirements. Unfortunately, spec-writing teams tend to make three classic errors:They simultaneously under-specify (with too many silent assumptions and incomplete information) and over-specify (with too many product-specific stipulations).
They're vague (or even silent) about acceptance criteria for features. A spec without a test or a clear go/no-go threshold is a wish-list, not a spec.
They oscillate between the dweeby features, the business rules, and the overall goals.Commentary: Careful: Your CRM Integration Consultant May Not Know AnythingEverything needs to be translated into pure system attributes and features. It's pretty rare for internal staff to really succeed with writing the specs on their own. Instead, bring in a consultant who will be excluded from the bidding to help you set CRM project priorities and write an iron-clad spec of what you'll need—and only what you really need.Step 2: When Short-Listing, Pit CRM Vendors Against Each OtherAs vendors respond to your RFI, RFP or RFQ, look for more than just good answers. Does the CRM vendor proposal include rules of engagement for the project? If there's no guidance and dialog during the bidding process about the how the project will be managed, then friction is likely to develop later on. There are just too many places for mismatched assumptions.At some point, you'll eliminate some vendors. Identify which of the disqualified ones you communicate best with, and then engage them in a short but critical task. Make it clear that they aren't in the running, pay them for their time and ask them to do two final tasks:Apply Value Engineering to the other vendors' proposed approaches. By ruthlessly applying the 80/20 rule, there is always a way to satisfy the core business requirement with a smaller level of effort.
Sharp-shoot the contract, looking for areas where you could get severely hit by ECOs and loopholes.During your short-listing cycle, modify your specs and contract to avoid the problems that the out-of-the-running vendor has spotted. Even if you pay the vendor $1,000 an hour for this task, you'll still save a bundle overall.Step 3: Pay Attention During the CRM ImplementationIf the winning vendor is smart, it will precisely specify what it will (and won't) deliver in the Statement of Work (SOW). Any change to the SOW will probably require an ECO—each with its own price tag. This will be true even if the following happens:You didn't understand the consequences of the specified deliverable. For example, the SOW might say "20 triggers and 17 workflows," but you may have no idea whether that functionality will be satisfactory to your users.
You discover bad assumptions, additional requirements, or plot complications—or you simply change your mind—at any time after the contract is signed.
All the itemized deliverables do not solve your system problem, make your users happy or achieve your business objective.Also note that the SOW may contain a line item for an explicit number of hours of project meetings, as well as another item for project management. If meetings or your decisions/approvals take longer than the allotted time, the vendor is within its right to issue a change order.

More: 5 Ways to Send a Custom Software Project Off the RailsDuring serious fixed-price projects, meetings and the sequence of tasks will not be under your control. At times, it may feel like you're working for the vendor: You'll receive action items, decision deadlines and resource requests. In particular, you'll need to complete your testing before features can be fully deployed. The vendor has to be running the show if it's going to deliver on time and on budget with quality.In other words, be prepared for the vendor to say "No" fairly often. If this all sounds a bit adversarial, it is. The vendor's fixed price commitment is to delivering only the items you put in the spec, not to making you happy.This won't happen, though, if you prepare your team to the real requirements of fixed-price engagements. It may not be easy, but the short-term pain will result in long-term gains that make users and executives happy.David Taber is the author of the new Prentice Hall book, "Salesforce.com Secrets of Success" and is the CEO of SalesLogistix, a certified Salesforce.com consultancy focused on business process improvement through use of CRM systems.
