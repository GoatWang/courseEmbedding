Investment Process






We believe successful investing, especially during times of economic and political uncertainty, is as much about managing risk as it is returns. Our objective, utilizing our proprietary quantitative research process is to find investments that offer good returns on a risk adjusted basis. Several of the elements in our ranking system include statistical measures of risk, volatility, and excess risk adjusted returns as well as bear market performance and technical profile, allowing for the screening and tracking of a large number of investments. In addition, we also perform qualitative analysis on each of our investments. We remain committed to the continuous exercise of discipline and in-depth research and we will use our quantitative research to assist in making the right investment decisions for you.

Private Capital Management
Private Capital Management (“PCM”) was founded in 1986 with a singular focus on fundamental value investing. By approaching each investment with a due diligence process that seeks a thorough understanding of a business; its risks and opportunities, and ultimately its true intrinsic worth, we can then selectively invest in those companies that are trading at valuation discounts of 40% or more.   Unlike many managers, we are happy to invest in compelling value opportunities of all sizes.  As a result, we consider ourselves �all-cap� managers, though we also recognize that for many years, our portfolios have a tendency to gravitate toward small and mid-cap situations.
We offer PCM clients several ways to access our value portfolios.  For clients seeking an individually managed portfolio, we offer our Value Equity and Value Focus (more concentrated) portfolios, while for investors seeking a mutual fund, we offer the Private Capital Management Value Fund. 
PCM is owned by our Portfolio Manager and CEO, Gregg Powers.  Widely-known for his research skill, Gregg has been a key driver of PCM�s success since 1988.

Investment Philosophy
 
From our founding in 1986, PCM has achieved long-term capital appreciation by investing in companies that are out of favor, underappreciated or misunderstood, and thereby trade at a significant discount to our estimation of their long-term intrinsic value.
                
                We rigorously analyze a host of factors to fully understand a company's ability to create value in the future.  We couple our quantitative assessment with an in-depth qualitative appraisal.  Our long-term investment horizon matched with our in-depth knowledge of various industries developed over more than 20 years of investing in public companies can provide insights into what is being overlooked, misunderstood or underappreciated and how a company may unlock that hidden value for its shareholders.
              


Investment Objective
 
The fund seeks to achieve long-term capital appreciation by investing in companies that are out of favor, underappreciated or misunderstood, and thereby trade at a significant discount to PCM's estimation of long-term intrinsic value.
              


Risk Considerations
 
Mutual Fund investing involves risk and it is possible to lose money by investing in a fund.  The Fund is non-diversified and may invest in a larger portion of its assets in the securities of a single issuer than a more diversified fund causing its value to fluctuate more widely.  The fund may engage in strategies that are considered risky or invest in stocks of companies that are undervalued which may cause greater volatility and less liquidity.

Long-term capital preservation in the context of opportunistic value investing
PCM’s primary objective is to preserve our clients’ capital over the  long term while earning an attractive absolute rate of return. All equity  investment decisions include risk of loss. However, our goal is to avoid  investment decisions that result in a permanent loss of capital. PCM’s Value  Focus Composite has attained positive total returns in 18 of the 22 calendar year periods (82%) since inception.
Produce consistent appreciation of our clients’ assets
The Value Focus strategy goal is to double invested assets over a five year period.  Since strategy inception, Value Focus has returned 14.0% (Net of SMA Fee), a dramatic outperformance vs. the S&P 500 and Russell 2000. 
Focus on absolute not relative metrics
Relative return objectives may create inappropriate incentives, which can result in greater risks being taken and longer time horizon opportunities missed. Since our performance goals and investment timeliness are different, PCM�s returns may not correlate closely with equity market indices.           


PCM manages relationships targeted at $1 million and above.  Separate account clients include high net worth individuals and institutions including universities, foundations, and retirement plans.
Separately  managed accounts offer investors significant advantages:

Since the portfolio is  constructed for you within your stand-alone account, you have full visibility  of account holdings, transactions, and values.
For taxable clients,  unlike in mutual and private funds, you have the ability to execute tax  planning strategies (such as capital gain offsets) that can improve the tax  efficiency of your investment.
Because you own the  portfolio directly, with PCM you have no lock-up periods, notification  requirements, or back door fees.  We are  here to serve you in a transparent, fair and comprehensive manner.

We communicate with our clients frequently and openly.  Quarterly written reports summarize a client's entire portfolio, including assets, income, expenses, transactions and overall performance.  Periodic market letters assess the state of the economy, review our investment strategy and discuss the outlook for our clients' portfolios.
However, the aspect of our communications that our clients appreciate most is the personal touch.  Clients have direct access to our Client Service Team professionals, and many are in frequent contact with us to discuss their portfolios.  Many of our investors are knowledgeable about the companies in their portfolios and achieve great satisfaction from closely following their accounts.

Investment Approach


Identify undervalued companies that can attain their perceived intrinsic value over an acceptable investment time horizon
Quantitative Business Assessment
Qualitative Management and Business Assessment
Time Horizon & Investor Expectations
Portfolio Construction and Sell Discipline



Identify undervalued  companies that can attain their perceived intrinsic value over an acceptable  investment time horizon
Businesses can trade at  significant discounts when:

Investors have concerns over future prospects or near-term earnings
Emerging, high-impact new business initiatives are sub-scale and are not  yet visible to investors
Companies possess a complex business model or  misunderstood asset base

Company specific strengths are ignored due to an  uncertain industry outlook
Differences arise in analytical perspective (time horizon)
                 
Our efforts to identify these opportunities takes on several forms:  criteria based financial screening, referrals from our industry contacts, and  our own in-depth knowledge developed over more than 20 years of public market investing.   PCM’s screening process and broader investment approach is not limited by the  market capitalization of a company.   Instead, our size enables us to become meaningfully involved in  investment situations that many investors consider too small for consideration.
In  identifying opportunities, PCM’s investment leverages its extensive domain  expertise in diverse market segments such as technology, financial services,  consumer discretionary, healthcare, natural resources, and communications.


Quantitative Business  Assessment 
Once a potential investment opportunity is  identified, PCM conducts exhaustive independent financial analysis focused on  valuing a company’s business operations and assets over an identifiable  investment horizon.  
Included in this analysis is a focus on making financial statement adjustments to better reflect the true value of the company�s assets and liabilities, as well as to identify any potential �footnote� risks such as underfunded pensions, off-balance sheet liabilities, environmental liabilities, aggressive accounting procedures, etc.
In our experience, free cash  flow is a superior measure for long-term investors.
                     
                A common characteristic of superior businesses is their ability to generate sustainable and growing free cash flow. PCM defines free cash flow as cash flow from operations less required capital expenditures.
We value businesses by taking the net present value (NPV) of their free cash flow potential, discounted by a rate commensurate with the perceived business risk and variability of the anticipated cash flow stream.
Free cash flow  affords management teams with myriad ways to enhance long-term shareholder  value:

Capital efficient investments in internal operations,  product development or expansion efforts 
Share repurchases 
Acquisitions 
Cash dividend payments 

During turbulent periods where credit  availability is unpredictable, businesses with consistent  cash generation and the appropriate capital structure can  control their own destiny. 


Qualitative Management and  Business Assessment
While comprehensive independent financial  statement analysis is an integral part of our approach, a thorough review  cannot be completed without making judgments on our “prospective” partners –  the company’s management team.  Reaching for this confidence level makes sense for us; our expectation in most situations is that we will be investors in this company for 3 to 5 years, and we may also be one of the company�s largest shareholders.
                
Our qualitative management review includes an evaluation of each company’s leadership:

Compensation practices and perceived goal congruency with shareholders 
Candor with PCM and willingness to engage with long-term shareholders 
History of creating  (or failing to create) value for shareholders 
Intellect, ability,  innovation and focus – can this management group close the valuation gap?  Insider ownership (including recent trading activity) by management and company directors 
Perceived quality and objectivity (independence) of the company�s directors
In the course of our qualitative business assessment, we often seek input from (among others) industry competitors, suppliers, customers and other knowledgeable industry participants.  The objective of this review is to ensure that in addition to being statistically attractive, that we also identify a durable franchise with relevant products and services and defined market segments in which the products have a niche or unique value proposition making them difficult to displace. 
PCM�s qualitative business review seeks the following:

A thorough understanding of the market dynamics for the industry in which the company operates 
Know the competitive risks from other industry operators and their potential to take market share 
Understand management�s commitment to (or answer to) innovation and new product spending 
Review sales team skill and record of success � does company�s sales team execute well? 
Consider any secular threats that may relegate this investment to �value trap� status 
Review ownership of the stock � have activists taken positions and what might they propose?

Where PCM identifies shortcomings or potential risks in these or other aspects of the company, it will seek to analyze and account for them relative to the overall attractiveness of the opportunity.  We understand that manageable risk and near-term uncertainty may underpin or contribute to a compelling valuation.  However, we also understand that some risks are �un-analyzable� and our responsibility is to move on to the next idea. 


Time Horizon & Investor  Expectations
Initially, when we purchase a security we expect  to realize fair value in the market over a multi-year time horizon, often 3 to  5 years.  However, actual holding periods  may vary based on market and company specific factors.
Stocks most often become available at our target  discount because they are out of favor, misunderstood or disdained

We have to be patient, as improvements can take time -  our time horizon must match the opportunity 
We trust our research  and investment thesis - even when contrary views may prevail in the short-term 
We are recursive and  diligent in monitoring and evaluating progress 
We react as needed to  facts that may challenge or change our investment thesis

Because investments are typically out of favor  or in the midst of a business change (earnings volatility) when we are buyers,  price movements can be unpredictable over the near term. 


Portfolio Construction
While PCM’s stock selection process is built on  bottom-up fundamental analysis, our portfolio construction process also  incorporates a broader economic perspective.   Our all capitalization approach allows us to pursue value wherever it is  identified.
PCM normally maintains core position weightings of between 2% and 5%,  though in certain instances positions may comprise as much as 10% of  assets.  The 10 largest holdings may  frequently exceed 40% of account assets. 
PCM does not seek to track a broader market  index.  Rather, we strive to allocate  capital thoughtfully, and will frequently concentrate investments in areas  where our research and world view identify significant opportunity.
Sell Discipline
Target valuations are established at the time of  purchase and continually revisited to incorporate new information such as:

Operational execution
Company fundamentals  and corresponding valuations
Industry outlook and  macroeconomic factors

PCM reduces exposure in holdings as they  approach our estimate of intrinsic value or when warranted by either an adverse  change in a material aspect of the business or its operating environment.
