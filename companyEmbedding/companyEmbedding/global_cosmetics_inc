After a dear friend sustained a head injury in an accident, Global Products President Rebecca Herwick began to recognize how important it is for a person with disabilities to be able to work again and that having a job is important to a person’s confidence, self-worth and independence. She also understands it makes good business sense to hire people who will do the job right and are likely to stay with the company for many years. Over 250 of the Center’s consumers have had their skills, interests and abilities assessed for jobs in the distribution industry because of Global Products’ open door to help.

OFFICIAL SGP MEDIA RELEASEAUGUST 4, 2015Sayville, NY - The Sustainable Green Printing Partnership (SGP), the leading certification organization for the print industry, is pleased to announce that Global Products, Inc of St. Peters, MO has achieved SGP certification. Incorporated in 1995, the award winning printer designs, manufactures and distributes a full line of high-quality and affordable products that are made and/or embellished in the USA using methods such as screen printing, digital printing, embroidery, sublimation, cylindrical printing, and pad printing.
Jan Weyrich, Director of Operations for Global Products, Inc., believes SGP certification has provided many benefits throughout their facility and will be a great marketing tool. 
				"Global Products, Inc. began the sustainability journey several years ago to ensure compliance with regulations that affect the print industry worldwide. Since implementing SGP certification, we have seen many benefits such as a decrease in utilities and waste, as well as a positive impact to our community and employees both personally and professionally," states Weyrich.
Global Products, Inc.'s commitment to promoting sustainable work environments and business practices has led them receiving several awards for their sustainability efforts. As a member of the Specialty Graphic Imaging Association (SGIA), they were a recipient of the 2013, 2014 and 2015 SGIA Sustainability Recognition Award. The facility has also received various awards as a participant in the St. Louis Regional Chamber Green Business Challenge in 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014. 
"We at SGIA are excited that Global Products has taken the step to join the SGP certified print community.

Global Products, Inc. Earns SGP Certification

SGIAJuly 29,2015SGIA member company proves commitment to sustainable business practices
Fairfax, Virginia — Global Products, Inc. (SGIA member since 2002) has been granted the sought-after Sustainable Green Printing Partnership (SGP) Certification. The prestigious certification is the standard for sustainable business practices throughout the industry.
The SGP is a nonprofit, independent organization that has provided parameters and qualifications for sustainable printing operations that were desperately needed in the specialty imaging community. To be SGP Certified means that a company has created and implemented a formal sustainability program — and that they have seen significant results because of it. Global Products, Inc. is the most recent SGIA member company to receive the certification. 
“Global Products, Inc. is committed to promoting sustainable work environments and business practices based on sound economics, environmental protection and social responsibility,” said Jan Weyrich, Operations Manager for Global Products.
With their sustainability program, Global Products has seen a carbon footprint reduction of 10 percent and reduced waste of raw materials by 65 percent within their direct embroidery department. Additionally, Global has purchased a Warehouse Management System in tandem with consolidation software to utilize barcode scanning and eliminate paper printing of pick tickets.
Want to learn more about SGP Certification? Contact Marci Kinter for more information. 
SGP – Sustainable Green Printing Partnership
The Sustainable Green Printing Partnership (SGP) is the leading certifier of printing facilities. SGP provides a sustainable foundation by promoting best practices, networking, and innovation among raw material manufacturers, converters, printers, finishing facilities, trade associations, and print buyers. SGP brings the business community together in the pursuit of a more sustainable supply chain. SGP certified facilities outperform those that do not validate their sustainable performance.
SGIA — Supporting the Leaders of the Digital & Screen Printing Community
“Specialty imaging” comprises digital imaging, screen printing and the many other imaging technologies SGIA members use, including those they’ll tap in the future. These are the imaging processes and technologies employed to create new products and to enhance existing products including point-of-purchase displays, printed electronics, membrane switches, signs, advertisements, garments, containers and vehicles. Make the most of your specialty imaging business.

World-wide supplier of Harley products recovering from fire in St. Peters

KMOV - Mark SchnyderAugust 23, 2010The fire turned out not to be that serious. It happened Sunday night and most of the damage was contained to one small room thanks to a sprinkler system in the building. There's lots of soot and smoke damage and production won't be up to full capacity again for another day or two.The owner of the business, Rebecca Herwick has a lot going on at the moment. She was nice enough to do a brief interview with me and show me around the Global Products production facility.What an impressive business. Global Products makes Harley-Davidson hats and all sorts of gifts like shot glasses, mugs, mousepads, koozies, etc with logos for specific Harley-Davidson retailers all over the world.If it weren't for the relatively minor fire, I'd have had no idea this business existed in St. Peters. Since they don't sell the stuff directly to the public, Global Products (globalproductsinc.com) flies under the radar. The neat thing is, if you collect Harley stuff and find yourself buying a Harley souvenir in some other part of the world, check the tag... You'll see "St. Peters, Missouri" on it. Cool.KMOV video

Manage Your Sales Reps Better

Bloomberg Businessweek - Amy BarrettJune 20, 2008Rebecca Herwick is tough enough to look at home on her Harley. But even she was thrown when seven of her nine sales reps walked out on Aug. 8, 2006, in the midst of a sales reorganization. "I knew it was coming, but the day it came I felt sucker-punched," says Herwick. "If I was a girl, I would have cried."Herwick, the owner and CEO of Global Products, a Harley Davidson licensee that makes everything from bandanas to coffee mugs, knew her sales strategy wasn't working. Herwick had been using independent sales reps rather than an in-house sales force to sell her wares to 800-odd Harley dealers nationwide. That kept fixed costs low—independent reps are paid commission-only—but it also meant Herwick's reps all sold products from other companies as well. While those products didn't compete directly with her $18 million, 115-employee company, Herwick didn't think Global was getting the attention it deserved. There were other headaches: Not all the reps entered orders directly into Global's computer system, creating more work for the company's customer service team. And some reps didn't do a good job explaining custom orders, so when those jobs couldn't be turned around fast enough, customers got frustrated and Herwick looked like the bad guy.Ground Rules:Herwick thought she might do better with an internal sales force. "I wanted my power back," she says. But the independent reps helped keep payroll costs down. In the end, Herwick found it was cost-prohibitive to move sales in-house. Daniel McQuiston, director of education for the nonprofit Manufacturers' Representatives Educational Research Foundation, estimates that a 10-person sales force for a $10 million company could cost $2 million annually in training, salaries, and bonus, compared with less than half that for reps earning 7%. The reps also gave Global broad geographic reach, and they covered their own travel expenses. But managing a contract sales force requires clear expectations, effective systems for tracking performance, and penalties for those who don't play by the rules.That meant Herwick needed more out of her reps. In November, 2005, she laid down some new ground rules. Reps would only get commissions on orders they put into Global's computer system. Instead of the 8% commission they had been receiving, reps would start earning 4%. To get back to 8%, they'd have to get calendars of special events and promotions from each customer, visit dealers and take photos of Global's products, and deliver feedback surveys from each dealer, four times a year. That's when the reps rebelled, with seven of the nine walking. The others quit within a year.In hiring a new team, Herwick insisted on a passion for motorcycles and a comfort level with her technology. She only considered reps who had three or fewer other lines that they would be selling to her clients. By January, 2007, Herwick had a new group in place.Certainly there were some bumps in the road. Two of the new hires left after Herwick found they were selling competing products. Herwick decided she needed to cut down on paperwork, so reps now send in customer calendars and showroom photos just twice a year. Global "has a more formal structure" than many other companies, says Bill Scharr, a rep who signed on in November, 2006. "You either bought into the program or you didn't."The experience was nerve-wracking, but Herwick would do it over again. "I will not let history repeat itself where someone is controlling me," she says.The disruption, and the changes, have been worthwhile. Sales are only growing at about 3% a year, compared with 9% in 2005. But Herwick says that 9% was unsustainable, especially since the growth in motorcycle sales had already started to slow that year. Given the overall state of the economy, she thinks she's doing well.More important, customers notice a difference. Brandi Hamel, motorclothes manager for Bruce Rossmeyer's Boston Harley-Davidson in Everett, Mass., says that before the overhaul she didn't know the name of her Global Products rep. But the new rep, Scharr, "helps out at some of our events, consistently updates us on where our orders are, and is in touch with me at least biweekly," says Hamel. "We now have a personal connection to the company, and everything is so much easier." For Herwick, too.

Small U.S. firms make big global sales: Sinking dollar, cultural ties, free trade provide boost

USA Today - Edward IwataApril 8, 2008A motorcycle-riding businesswoman. As a teen growing up in Missouri, Rebecca Herwick loved dirt bikes and big motorcycles. Today, the 49-year-old Herwick is owner and CEO of Global Products Inc., a St. Peters, Mo., firm that is the exclusive dealer and licensee for Harley-Davidson decals, caps, T-shirts and other gift items.Herwick saw the international potential for Harley-Davidson products during a trip to Europe in the mid-1990s with her former husband, who founded Global Products. The demand for goods with Harley-Davidson's famous bar-and-shield logo has grown steadily each year.Herwick sells her products through dealers and distributors in Canada, Europe, Japan, Australia, South Korea and Dubai. This month, she's helping a Chinese auto dealer open the fourth Harley-Davidson dealership in China, in the large city of Qingdao.International sales last year accounted for 10% of her company's $18 million in annual revenue, and she expects the figure to grow to 25% in the near future if she expands to potential markets in Latin America and other regions."When you ride a Harley, you have a sense of independence and empowerment and luxury," says Herwick. "It doesn't matter where in the world you may be — that feeling is still there."USA Today Article

The cosmetics or beauty products industry in the world is one sector which remains impervious to the ups and downs markets. Overall sales are indeed affected in the event of an economic downturn, but one can count on sales of cosmetics to maintain a certain volume overall. This is because of continuing and growing usage of products by women, and increasingly, by men, across the world.
Cosmetics can be subdivided by the areas of application. Cosmetics used on the face (and other parts of the body like foundation, glitter, etc.) include products like primer applied to minimize the appearance of pores on the skin thereby allowing for a smoother look on the skin, foundation  a coloured cream used to reduce skin colour irregularities across the face (in areas like under eyes, around the lips, T-zone, etc.), concealer to conceal blemishes, marks and other conspicuous irregularities, face powder as a standalone or an addon to foundation (as a powder foundation) which is especially effective in hot and tropical climates. Other addons not used on occasions instead of regularly, include bronzer/blusher for use on the cheeks to add colour to the face, face contour creams or powders to enhance the angles of a face for a slimmer, well-formed look, highlighter to add glow to high points and angles on the face, and setting spray to help makeup stay put longer.
Cosmetics used on the face include lipsticks in matte or non-matte and other varieties, lipstains, coloured lip balms, and lip glosses. Furthermore, the eye-area makeup items include kohl, eye liners, eye brow pencils (and recently, fake eye brows), fake eye lashes, mascara, and more. Another extension of cosmetics are nail colours. Aside from these products, there are ancillary industries for cosmetics supportive products like make up brushes, beauty blenders, etc.
The global market for cosmetics is expected to be worth US$ XXX.X bn in 2015, and is expected to grow at a CAGR of X.X% over the forecast period, to US$ XXX.X bn by 2020. While the global market suffered because of the recession in 2009, and in specific regions thereafter, especially in the Eurozone region, the market recovered and grew thereafter. A large portion of the demand comes from the emerging regions of Asia Pacific, where a number of innovations in cosmetics, the latest one being the cushion/sponge foundation. Large potential markets include China and India, while most high growth innovations of products originate in South Korea, which has built a large export business around cosmetics.
Recent trends include increased use of natural products to mitigate the effects of pollution as well as the harmful chemicals used in making makeup. Other drivers include lasting power and new colour palettes, increasing market share for ethnic (African, or Asian skin tone specific) products. Furthermore, increasing disposable income have led to a larger market for luxury brands like Dior, Guerlain, Clarins, Clinique, Lancome, Estee Lauder, Shiseido, etc. Distribution is pervasive through exclusive stores of luxury products in malls or standalone, while ecommerce is emerging as a global competitor to direct sales for all mass and premium brands. Direct sales for Avon continue to hold and grow market value. Customers are increasingly looking for value for money products which are natural and beneficial for the skin, provide benefits of high priced premium products, at a lower than premium cost. This product class has been dubbed â€œmasstigeâ€. Moreover, a market for of vegan/halal products for Islamic consumers has been proliferating in countries like Turkey, Malaysia, and other Muslim-dense nations, and this trend is only expected to grow.
Some important players in the mass/masstige makeup/cosmetics field include P&G, Beiersdorf, Unilever, MAC, Revlon, Lâ€™Oreal, Olay, Avon, etc. among others.
Drivers
High disposable incomes in developed countries, increasing disposable incomes of an expanding middle class in developing countries, a large population of the world growing older, and a large section of the worldâ€™s teens growing older, younger, a union of for skin-benefiting and beautifying aspects in new makeup products through research into use of natural products, continuing breakthrough research on products are some of the drivers of this market.
Challenges
Tighter purse strings in the wake of inflation and global as well as regional recessions, income inequality making market segmentation of large developing nations difficult, and other factors make up the challenges in this market.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
