Investments involve risk, including potential loss of principal.


 
Performance data quoted represent past performance, which  does not guarantee future results. Investment return and principal  value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor’s shares, when  redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current  performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. For  most recent month-end performance information click here.

 
 
†The Morningstar Ratings™ shown are as of 6/30/17. The Morningstar Rating for funds, or ‘star rating’, is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product’s monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten- year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating, 40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% ten-year rating, 30% five-year rating, 20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the ten-year overall rating formula seems to give the most weight to the ten-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

The Pax Small Cap Fund Individual Investor  Class (PXSCX)  Morningstar ratings were 4 stars out of 646 funds  overall, 3 stars out  of 646 funds for 3-years, 4 stars out of 545 funds  for 5-years. The Pax Small Cap Fund Institutional Class (PXSIX)   Morningstar ratings  were 4 stars out of 646 funds  overall, 3 stars out  of 646 funds for 3-years, 4 stars out of 545 funds  for 5-years.

‡Smart beta, also known as is factor investing, is a strategy wherein a portfolio of securities is over weighted, or tilted, toward certain factors–rather than market capitalization–in an effort to mitigate risk and/or deliver above market returns.

 
1 30 Day Distribution Yield: Funds income distribution paid  in the preceding 30 days annualized. Annual Distribution Yield: actual  annual income distribution paid including capital gains. 30 Day SEC  Yield: Funds net income in the preceding 30 days annualized.
ALPS Distributors, Inc. is not affiliated with MSCI, Aperio Group, LLC. or Impax Asset Management, Ltd.
Effective June 30, 2016 the Pax Growth Fund (the Predecessor Fund) was renamed the Pax ESG Beta Quality Fund (the Fund). The Predecessor Fund is treated as the survivor of the renaming for accounting and performance reporting purposes. Accordingly, all performance and other information shown for the Fund for periods prior to 6/30/2016 is that of the Predecessor Fund.

Equity investments are subject to market fluctuations, the fund’s  share price can fall because of weakness in the broad market, a  particular industry, or specific holdings. Emerging market and  international investments involve risk of capital loss from unfavorable  fluctuations in currency values, differences in generally accepted  accounting principals, economic or political instability in other  nations or increased volatility and lower trading volume. Investments in  high yield bonds generally are subjected to greater price volatility  based on fluctuations in issuer and credit quality. When investing in  bonds, you are subject, but not limited to, the same interest rate,  inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bonds owned by  the Fund. Funds that emphasize investments in smaller companies  generally will experience greater price volatility. Investing in  non-diversified funds generally will be more volatile and loss of  principal could be greater than investing in more diversified funds.

Pax World Management LLC ("Pax World") investment advisor to Pax World Funds, is a sustainable investment firm. Pax World integrates Environmental Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) factors into investment analysis and portfolio construction. For over 45 years, Pax World has made it possible for investors to align their investments with their values and have a positive social and environmental impact. Its platform of sustainable investing solutions includes a family of mutual funds, as well as separately managed accounts.
History[edit]
Pax World launched the first socially responsible mutual fund in the United States in 1971.[1]
The company was founded by Luther Tyson[2] and Jack Corbett,[3] both of whom had worked on peace, housing and employment issues for the United Methodist Church. It was their desire to make it possible for investors to align their investments with their values. At the same time, they wanted to challenge corporations to establish and live up to specific standards of social and environmental responsibility. Their vehicle, the first broadly diversified, publicly available mutual fund to use social as well as financial criteria in the investment decision-making process, was the Pax World Fund, predecessor of what is now the Pax World Balanced Fund.[4]
In 2014, Pax World Management LLC and Ellevate Asset Management LLC, whose principal is Sallie Krawcheck, partnered to form Pax Ellevate Management. Pax Ellevate launched the Pax Ellevate Global Women’s Index Fund, the first broadly diversified mutual fund that invests in companies that are among the highest rated in the world when it comes to advancing women’s leadership.

Pax World Management implements Eze OMS

  Global mutual fund adviser implements Eze Software Group's order management system to handle its investment operations












    About Pax World Management LLC  



Pax World Management LLC is a New Hampshire based asset management firm whose investment strategies focus on environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria. Founded in 1971, by Luther Tyson and Jack Corbett, they are now a leader in sustainable investing. Launching with just over $100,000 in assets, the firm now manages close to $4 billion, primarily across its mutual fund products throughout global markets.

  Founded in Portsmouth, NH



  Asset Classes

  Equities, Equity Options, Fixed Income, High Yield















The Challenge
Pax World Management manages close to $4 billion in assets spread across five equity and fixed income mutual funds, four asset allocation funds, two index funds and several separate accounts, which are overseen by eight portfolio managers.

Trading a variety of fixed income instruments, in addition to domestic and international equities, Pax was looking for a system that could handle both the asset class scope and the compliance requirements surrounding the firm's investment strategies.This included finding a system capable of handling compliance needs pertaining to 40 act regulations. 
Pax was also seeking a solution to help efficiently facilitate accurate settlement processes for their positions. Improvement on this settlement process has
increased the accuracy of their positions and decreased manual reconciliation.
"We were looking to find a system that could help alleviate the tedious, costly, and inefficient manual processes that our portfolio managers were performing," said Brian Fruh, Vice President, Information Technology for Pax World Management. "And perhaps more importantly, we were looking for a service provider offering a support model that we could rely on."
 




"We wanted a system that could help avoid costly and inefficient manual processes"

PAX WORLD MANAGEMENT LLC

 





The Selection Process
Eze Software Group was one of several providers considered by Pax and ultimately was selected to help them manage their investment processes.

"We really like how flexible the system is," said Fruh. "They gave us the best opportunity to simplify and automate many of our operational and trading processes. Another factor in our decision was their experience implementing and working with other traditional asset managers and mutual funds." 
Furthermore, the compliance capabilities of the OMS allowed Pax to ensure that they could focus on their core strategy of sustainable investing. Pax's proprietary ESG screens were loaded into the OMS compliance module and monitored on a pre-trade and post-trade basis. "Eze Software offered us a robust compliance solution which was easily integrated into our investment workflows," said John Boese, Chief Compliance Officer for Pax World Management.
"Eze Software gave us the best opportunity to simplify and automate many of our operational and trading processes"

Solution & Implementation
The EzeSoft consulting team spent considerable time with users at Pax to provide on-site training, ensuring their comfort with the system prior to going live.

Pax now leverages Eze Software OMS for everything from order entry and execution to portfolio modeling. Their portfolio managers have found the portfolio analytics and modeling capabilities to be extremely useful for checking positions, modeling, and sending the resulting trades to the blotter for execution.
"Tailoring the system to our business requirements during the implementation process was straightforward
not only because of Eze Software's technology, but also due to their highly knowledgeable and experienced implementation and support teams," said Fruh.
Additionally, Pax's proprietary ESG screens have been integrated with Eze Software OMS so that they can now easily create and maintain compliance rules designed to restrict their ability to trade those securities.

Results
The implementation from the Pax perspective has been highly successful with their traders and PMs managing their orders in the system comfortably.

"From an operational standpoint, we are simply more efficient now that many of our daily investment processes have been automated," said Fruh. "The automatic flow of accurate position data into the OMS leaves the portfolio managers more time to focus on making accurate, informed investment decisions." With their settlement process now completely automated, Pax can focus their time and energy 
on its core investment strategies.
So why does Eze Software Group stand out compared to other technology vendors? "Eze offered us the best combination of technology, functionality, and customer service," said Fruh. "Since day one they have partnered with us to ensure that we were getting the most out of the system."
