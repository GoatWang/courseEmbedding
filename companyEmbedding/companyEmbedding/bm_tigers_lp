BM LP Gas, New Product in the Market
EB Report   


 
 

 

To meet the increasing demand of LPG here is a new brand in the Market by BM Energy (BD) Ltd.  BM Energy (BD) Limited is a joint venture between Netherlands & Bangladesh to engage in Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) import, storage, bottling and marketing in Bangladesh under the brand name BM LP GAS. They are preparing 3 different sizes as 12, 33 & 45 kg Gas filled Cylinder to be in the market very soon.
To declare their presence in the market, BM Energy had a press conference recently at Hotel La Vinci in the capital on Wednesday, 27 May.
In a detail speech Mr. Firoz Ahmed, General Manager (Sales & Marketing) of BM Energy (BD) ltd. described about their modern plant, capacity and distribution policy with their mission and vision. Mr. Bert Pronk, Honorable Chairman, Mr. Andre Hendriks and Mr. Mustafizur Rahman, Managing Director was also present there and has given welcome speeches with their dream and aspiration.
Mr. Pronk has said, As you are aware, Bangladesh has much potential in terms of gas consumption where today only 6% of the entire population has access to natural gas, mostly in urban areas. The gap between demand and supply of natural gas is widening day by day, because of the massive conversion of fuel-run automobile engines to CNG & increased pressure of growing industries & households on energy supply.
Mr. Andre has said, I learned about Bangladeshi, is that they are very optimistic people. Not only in planning a project, but in general! Even in tough economic times they believe in the future and growth of Bangladesh, and I think they are right!
Mr. Firoz Ahmed, GM – Sales & Marketing has described…about BM LP Gas Technical details and business plan.
According their plan, BM LP Gas is formally launching on coming Saturday, 30 May, 2015. They will have Grand Opening at the BICC along with invited guests and distributors from all over the country. A cultural program will be followed by the launching where eminent singer Kumar Bishwajit will perform live music.

It is a good signed that the people who  were involved in lpg could not back to the previous. Gradually demand is increasing but service & safety facilities were not improving simultaneously. It is a hassle to refill /exchange cylinder from dealer or reseller. If it is  arranged to supply gases from one hubs at one mohalla/ region will be improved  demand in the market.

 Bert Pronk, chairman of BM Energy (BD) Ltd, speaks at a press conference to launch the company’s new liquefied petroleum gas, BM LP gas, at Hotel La Vinci in Dhaka yesterday.

Star Business Report






A new company, BM Energy, will begin its journey on Saturday to supply liquefied petroleum gas to households and industries.  
The Netherlands-Bangladesh joint venture has already set up a 3,000 tonne-LPG bottling plant in Chittagong's Barabkunda area with an investment of $26 million, said Managing Director Mostafizur Rahman.
The company will sell three types of gas-filled cylinders -- 12kg, 33kg and 45kg -- under the brand name of BM LP gas across the country, he said at a press conference yesterday at the capital's Hotel La Vinci.
BM Energy's entry comes on the heels of Omera Petroleum's, which started selling its LPG on April 12. 
Bangladesh has much potential in terms of gas consumption as only 6 percent of the entire population has access to natural gas, and that too mostly in urban areas, said Bert Pronk, chairman of BM Energy.
The gap between demand and supply of natural gas is widening by the day owing to the large scale conversion of fuel-run automobile engines to CNG and increased pressures from the growing industries and households, he added.
The country consumes more than one lakh tonnes of LPG a year, 80 percent of which is imported from Saudi Aramco, the state-owned oil company of Saudi Arabia. The rest is produced by state-run Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC).




The demand for LPG is expected to increase in the coming days as the government looks to stop new piped gas connections for domestic use, said Firoz Ahmed, general manager of sales and marketing of BM Energy.
The market structure of LPG has changed dramatically over the years, with growing participation of private companies.
For instance, in 2014, the private companies supplied 86 percent of the total demand for LPG in the country, he said.
BM Energy will import LPG mainly from Middle Eastern countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar, he said, adding that a 5,000 tonne LPG vessel can be anchored at the company's floating terminal in Chittagong.  
The company has already appointed 3,000 dealers across the country to sell its product, according to Ahmed.
The current plant-gate price of each 12kg LPG cylinder is hovering around Tk 1,130 to Tk 1,250.
BM Energy has not disclosed its LPG price; it will announce it when the product is formally launched at the market. 
Local Bashundhara and Jamuna Spacetech, France's TotalGaz and Australia's Kleenheat are the leading companies that sell cooking gas.

Nothing but amazing things to say about this bag. The center zip pocket dividing the purse is great. Every time I carry the bag I'm stopped and asked about it not to forget all the complements that go along with it too!
