Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/23/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

MCLEAN, Va., Nov. 28, 2012 /PRNewswire/ -- Gladstone Capital Corporation and Gladstone Management Corporation, the investment adviser to the Gladstone Funds (Gladstone Investment Corporation (NASDAQ:   GAIN), Gladstone Commercial Corporation (NASDAQ:   GOOD), and Gladstone Capital Corporation (NASDAQ:   GLAD)), announced today that Mr. George "Chip" Stelljes III notified the management of the Gladstone Funds of his intention to resign as an officer and director of each of the funds to devote his efforts to creating and managing new investment vehicles for the Gladstone family of companies.  No effective date for the resignations have been set but the transition should commence in the very near future.

Mr. Stelljes currently serves as a director and an officer of each of the Gladstone Funds.  Mr. Stelljes serves as co-vice chairman, chief investment officer and assistant secretary of Gladstone Investment, co-vice chairman, chief investment officer and assistant secretary of Gladstone Commercial, and president, chief investment officer and assistant secretary of Gladstone Capital.  In April 2008, Mr. Stelljes turned over the presidency of Gladstone Investment to the fund's current president, David Dullum. In June 2012, Mr. Stelljes was succeeded as the president of Gladstone Commercial by the current president, Robert Cutlip.  In anticipation of Mr. Stelljes resigning as president of Gladstone Capital, management has begun a search for his replacement. 
After Mr. Stelljes steps down from the Gladstone Funds, he will continue to perform his duties as an officer and director of Gladstone Management.  In maintaining his position at Gladstone Management, Mr. Stelljes will primarily devote most of his time to new initiatives but will be available to assist in the management of the funds' portfolio companies, as needed.  
Gladstone Capital Corporation is a publicly traded business development company that invests in debt securities consisting primarily of senior term loans, second term lien loans and senior subordinate term loans in small and medium sized U.S. businesses. The Company has paid 108 consecutive monthly cash distributions on its common stock.  Before the Company started paying monthly distributions it paid eight consecutive quarterly cash distributions.  Information on the business activities of all the Gladstone funds can be found at www.gladstonecapital.com.
