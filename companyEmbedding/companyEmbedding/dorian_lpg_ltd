FlashRatings' Principles

STAMFORD, Conn., June 14, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Dorian LPG Ltd. (NYSE:    LPG) (the "Company" or "Dorian LPG"), a leading owner and operator of modern very large gas carriers ("VLGCs"), today reported its financial results for the three months and fiscal year ended March 31, 2017.

Key Recent Developments

On May 31, 2017, we entered into an agreement to amend our $758 million debt facility that we entered into in March 2015 to relax certain covenants, release $26.8 million of restricted cash to be applied towards the next two debt principal payments, interest and certain fees, and modify certain other terms, including an expanded definition of the components of consolidated liquidity. 
On June 8, 2017, we entered into a $97.0 million bridge loan agreement with DNB Capital LLC and used the proceeds to pay off our term loans with the Royal Bank of Scotland (the "RBS Loan Facility") at 96% of the then outstanding principal amount and to pay accrued interest, legal, arrangement and advisory fees related to the bridge loan. As part of this transaction, $6.0 million of cash previously restricted under the RBS Loan Facility was released as unrestricted cash for use in operations.

John Hadjipateras, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, "Our results for the quarter and the year are a reflection of our consistent chartering strategy and our ongoing efforts to control expenses. We remain focused on efficiently managing our business in an earnings environment which we hope will improve as world fleet growth abates and global LPG trade fundamentals continue to develop favorably both in terms of import demand and supply of cargoes for export. We have proactively taken steps to strengthen our balance sheet and liquidity profile and to position ourselves to take advantage of opportunities that a weak market may present consistent with our goal of managing our capital prudently and generating value for our shareholders. Our mission to provide our customers with safe, reliable and trouble-free transportation services remains the core of our business."
Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2017 Results Summary 
Our net income amounted to $2.0 million, or $0.04 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to net income of $20.2 million, or $0.36 per share, for the three months ended March 31, 2016.               
Our adjusted net income amounted to $1.0 million, or $0.02 per share for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to adjusted net income of $33.8 million, or $0.60 per share for the three months ended March 31, 2016. We have adjusted our net income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 for unrealized gains on derivative instruments of $1.0 million. Please refer to the reconciliation of net income/(loss) to adjusted net income/(loss), which appears later in this press release.
The decrease of $32.8 million in adjusted net income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to a reduction in revenues of $37.8 million, a $0.4 million increase in interest and finance costs, a $0.2 million increase in depreciation and amortization and a $0.1 million increase in foreign currency loss, net, partially offset by a $4.1 million decrease in general and administrative expenses and a $1.6 million decrease in realized loss on derivatives.  
The TCE rate for our fleet was $24,677 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, a 46.8% decrease from the $46,376 TCE rate from the same period in the prior year, reflecting more subdued market conditions. Please see footnote 6 to the table in "—Financial Information" below for other information related to how we calculate TCE. Total fleet utilization (including the utilization of our vessels deployed in the Helios Pool) increased from 91.8% in the quarter ended March 31, 2016 to 96.3% in the quarter ended March 31, 2017.
Vessel operating expenses per day were $8,363 during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and remained relatively constant compared to $8,350 in the same period in the prior year.
Revenues
Revenues of $47.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, including net pool revenues—related party, voyage charters, time charters and other revenues earned by our vessels, decreased $37.7 million, or 44.2%, from $85.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in average TCE rates from $46,376 for the three months ended March 31, 2016 to $24,677 for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The general decline in rates during the three months ended March 31, 2017 was driven by several factors, including, but not limited to, a large number of newbuildings delivered into the global fleet during the period, commodity price fluctuations causing LPG to be less competitive with naphtha for petrochemical users and LPG price firmness in the United States resulting in marginal East-West arbitrage economics, thereby subduing demand for long-haul LPG transportation. The Baltic Exchange Liquid Petroleum Gas Index, an index published daily by the Baltic Exchange for the spot market rate for the benchmark Ras Tanura Chiba route (expressed as U.S. dollars per metric ton), averaged $29.760 during the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to an average of $43.455 for the same period ended March 31, 2016, a decline of 31.5%. The decrease in rates was partially offset by an increase in operating days and vessel utilization from 1,826 and 91.8% for the three months ended March 31, 2016, respectively, to 1,906 and 96.3% for the three months ended March 31, 2017, respectively. Additionally, there was a decrease of $0.2 million in revenues contributed by the Grendon during the three months ended March 31, 2016 that was sold prior to the three months ended March 31, 2017.
Voyage Expenses
Voyage expenses were $0.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017, a decrease of $0.1 million, or 15.6%, from $0.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Voyage expenses are all expenses unique to a particular voyage, including bunker fuel consumption, port expenses, canal fees, charter hire commissions, war risk insurance and security costs. Voyage expenses are typically paid by us under voyage charters and by the charterer under time charters, including our vessels chartered to the Helios Pool. Accordingly, we mainly incur voyage expenses for voyage charters or during repositioning voyages between time charters for which no cargo is available or traveling to or from drydocking. The decrease for the three months ended March 31, 2017, when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016, was mainly attributable to the Grendon operating in our fleet during the three months ended March 31, 2016 incurring voyage expenses of $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 that did not recur during the three months ended March 31, 2017 as the vessel was sold prior to the period.
Vessel Operating Expenses
Vessel operating expenses were $16.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017, or $8,363 per vessel per calendar day, which is calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by calendar days for the relevant time period for the vessels that were in our fleet and were relatively unchanged from $16.6 million, or $8,350 per vessel per calendar day, for the three months ended March 31, 2016.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization was $16.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $0.2 million, or 1.4%, from $15.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 that mainly relates to depreciation expense for an additional operating vessel as one of our ECO VLGCs was delivered during the three months ended March 31, 2016.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $5.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, a decrease of $4.0 million, or 41.5%, from $9.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease was mainly due to decreases of $3.0 million in cash bonuses to various employees, $0.7 million for professional, legal, audit and accounting fees, and $0.3 million for certain non-capitalizable costs incurred prior to vessel delivery.
Loss on disposal of assets
Loss on disposal of assets amounted to $1.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and was primarily attributable to the sale of the Grendon. There was no loss on disposal of assets for the three months ended March 31, 2017.
Other Income—Related Parties
Other income—related parties amounted to $0.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, a decrease of $0.2 million, or 20.2%, from $0.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease of $0.5 million for certain chartering and marine operation services provided by Dorian LPG (USA) LLC and its subsidiaries to a related party, partially offset by an increase of $0.3 million of fees for commercial management services provided by Dorian LPG (UK) Ltd. to the Helios Pool.
Interest and Finance Costs
Interest and finance costs amounted to $7.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $0.3 million, or 5.5%, from $7.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase of $0.3 million during this period was mainly due to a $0.2 million increase in interest incurred on our long-term debt, amortization and other financing expenses, including capitalized interest, from $7.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 to $7.4 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017. Additionally, we had no capitalized interest during the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $0.1 million during the three months ended March 31, 2016. The outstanding balance of our long-term debt as of March 31, 2017 was $770.1 million.
Unrealized Gain/(Loss) on Derivatives
Unrealized gain/(loss) on derivatives amounted to a loss of approximately $1.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to a gain of $12.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The $13.6 million change is primarily attributable to changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps due to changes in forward LIBOR yield curves.
Realized Loss on Derivatives
Realized loss on derivatives amounted to a loss of approximately $0.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, a decrease of $1.6 million, or 65.6%, from a loss of $2.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease is primarily attributable to the termination of the interest rate swaps related to the RBS Loan Facility prior to the three months ended March 31, 2017.
Fiscal Year 2017 Results Summary 
Our net loss amounted to $(1.4) million, or $(0.03) per share, for the year ended March 31, 2017, compared to net income of $129.7 million, or $2.29 per share, for the year ended March 31, 2016.               
Our adjusted net loss amounted to $(28.9) million, or $(0.54) per share for the year ended March 31, 2017, compared to adjusted net income of $139.6 million, or $2.46 per share for the year ended March 31, 2016. We have adjusted our net loss for the year ended March 31, 2017 for unrealized gains on derivative instruments of $27.5 million and for the year ended March 31, 2016 for unrealized losses on derivatives of $8.9 million and the loss on the sale of the Grendon of $1.0 million. Please refer to the reconciliation of net income/(loss) to adjusted net income/(loss), which appears later in this press release.
The decrease of $168.5 million in adjusted net income/(loss) for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the year ended March 31, 2016 is primarily attributable to a reduction in revenues of $122.3 million, a $22.5 million increase in depreciation and amortization, a $19.0 million increase in vessel operating expenses, a $16.2 million increase in interest and finance costs, and a $6.9 million increase in realized loss on derivatives, partially offset by a $9.1 million decrease in voyage expenses, an $8.1 million decrease in general and administrative expenses, and a $0.5 million increase in other income—related parties.  
The TCE rate for our fleet was $22,037 for the year ended March 31, 2017, a 60.0% decrease from the $55,087 TCE rate from the prior year, reflecting more subdued market conditions. Please see footnote 6 to the table in "—Financial Information" below for other information related to how we calculate TCE. Total fleet utilization (including the utilization of our vessels deployed in the Helios Pool) increased from 93.1% in the year ended March 31, 2016 to 93.6% in the year ended March 31, 2017.
Vessel operating expenses per day decreased to $8,233 in the year ended March 31, 2017 from $8,581 in the prior year. This decrease largely related to a $2.4 million, or $436 per vessel per calendar day, reduction in costs relating to the training of additional crew partially offset by an increase of $112 per vessel per calendar day relating to additional repairs and maintenance incurred and spares and stores purchased primarily for two VLGCs that underwent drydocking during the year ended March 31, 2017.
Revenues
Revenues of $167.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2017, including net pool revenues—related party, voyage charters, time charters and other revenues earned by our vessels, decreased $121.8 million, or 42.1%, from $289.2 million for the year ended March 31, 2016. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in average TCE rates from $55,087 for the year ended March 31, 2016 to $22,037 for the year ended March 31, 2017. The general decline in rates during the year ended March 31, 2017 was driven by several factors, including, but not limited to, a large number of newbuildings delivered into the global fleet during the year, commodity price fluctuations causing LPG to be less competitive with naphtha for petrochemical users and LPG price firmness in the United States resulting in marginal East-West arbitrage economics, thereby subduing demand for long-haul LPG transportation. The Baltic Exchange Liquid Petroleum Gas Index, an index published daily by the Baltic Exchange for the spot market rate for the benchmark Ras Tanura Chiba route (expressed as U.S. dollars per metric ton), averaged $26.380 during the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to an average of $79.857 for the year ended March 31, 2016, a decline of 67.0%. The decrease in rates was partially offset by an increase in operating days and vessel utilization from 5,031 and 93.1% for the year ended March 31, 2016, respectively, to 7,464 and 93.6% for the year ended March 31, 2017, respectively. Additionally, there was a decrease of $2.9 million in revenues contributed by the Grendon during the year ended March 31, 2016 that was sold prior to the year ended March 31, 2017.
Voyage Expenses
Voyage expenses were $3.0 million during the year ended March 31, 2017, a decrease of $9.1 million, or 75.4%, from $12.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2016. Voyage expenses are all expenses unique to a particular voyage, including bunker fuel consumption, port expenses, canal fees, charter hire commissions, war risk insurance and security costs. Voyage expenses are typically paid by us under voyage charters and by the charterer under time charters, including our vessels chartered to the Helios Pool. Accordingly, we mainly incur voyage expenses for voyage charters or during repositioning voyages between time charters for which no cargo is available or traveling to or from drydocking. The decrease for the year ended March 31, 2017 when compared to the year ended March 31, 2016 was mainly attributable to a reduction of VLGCs that operated on voyage charters outside of the Helios Pool during the year ended March 31, 2017, resulting in decreases in VLGC bunker costs of $5.7 million, port expenses of $1.0 million and other voyage expenses of $0.8 million. In addition, the Grendon incurred voyage expenses of $1.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2016 that did not recur during the year ended March 31, 2017 as the vessel was sold prior to the period.
Vessel Operating Expenses
Vessel operating expenses were $66.1 million during the year ended March 31, 2017, or $8,233 per vessel per calendar day, which is calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by calendar days for the relevant time period for the vessels that were in our fleet. This was an increase of $19.0 million, or 40.3%, from $47.1 million or $8,581 per vessel per calendar day, for the year ended March 31, 2016. The increase in vessel operating expenses was primarily the result of an increase in vessel operating days for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to the year ended March 31, 2016 as sixteen of our ECO VLGCs were delivered during the year ended March 31, 2016. Vessel operating expenses per vessel per calendar day decreased $348 from $8,581 for the year ended March 31, 2016 to $8,233 for the year ended March 31, 2017. The decrease in vessel operating expenses per vessel per calendar day of $348 was largely due to a $2.4 million, or $436 per vessel per calendar day, reduction in costs relating to the training of additional crew for VLGCs delivered during the year ended March 31, 2016 that did not recur in the year ended March 31, 2017. This was partially offset by an increase of $112 per vessel per calendar day relating to additional repairs and maintenance incurred and spares and stores purchased primarily for two VLGCs that underwent drydocking during the year ended March 31, 2017.
Depreciation and Amortization
Depreciation and amortization was approximately $65.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $22.5 million, or 52.7%, from $42.6 million for the year ended March 31, 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to an increase in VLGC calendar days from 5,491 during the year ended March 31, 2016 to 8,030 during the year ended March 31, 2017 as a result of sixteen of our ECO VLGCs being delivered during the year ended March 31, 2016 and operating for the full year during the year ended March 31, 2017.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $21.7 million for the year ended March 31, 2017, a decrease of $8.1 million, or 27.2%, from $29.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2016 mainly due to decreases of $5.1 million in cash bonuses to various employees, $3.4 million for certain non-capitalizable costs incurred prior to vessel delivery, and $1.1 million for other general and administrative expenses. Partially offsetting these decreases were increases of $1.1 million in salaries, wages and benefits resulting from an increase in the number of employees and merit-based salary increases, $0.3 million for stock-based compensation and $0.1 million for professional, legal, audit and accounting fees.
Loss on disposal of assets
Loss on disposal of assets amounted to $1.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2016 and was primarily attributable to the sale of the Grendon. There was no loss on disposal of assets for the year ended March 31, 2017.
Other income—related parties
Other income—related parties amounted to $2.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $0.5 million, or 23.9%, from $1.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2016. The increase was primarily attributable to an increase of $0.7 million of fees for commercial management services provided by Dorian LPG (UK) Ltd. to the Helios Pool partially offset by a decrease of $0.2 million for certain chartering and marine operation services provided by Dorian LPG (USA) LLC and its subsidiaries to a related party.
Interest and Finance Costs
Interest and finance costs amounted to $29.0 million for the year ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $16.2 million from $12.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2016. The increase of $16.2 million during this period was mainly due to an $11.4 million increase in interest incurred on our long-term debt, amortization and other financing expenses, including capitalized interest, from $17.6 million in the year ended March 31, 2016 to $29.0 million in the year ended March 31, 2017. This increase was largely due to an increase in average indebtedness, excluding deferred financing fees, from $543.1 million for the year ended March 31, 2016 to $810.4 million for the year ended March 31, 2017. Additionally, we had no capitalized interest during the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to $4.8 million during the year ended March 31, 2016. The outstanding balance of our long-term debt as of March 31, 2017 was $770.1 million.
Unrealized Gain/(Loss) on Derivatives
Unrealized gain/(loss) on derivatives amounted to a gain of approximately $27.5 million for the year ended March 31, 2017, compared to an unrealized loss of $8.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2016. The $36.4 million variance was primarily attributable to (i) unrealized gains of $19.4 million from changes in the fair value of our interest rate swaps due to changes in forward LIBOR yield curves for the year ended March 31, 2017 compared to unrealized losses of $8.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2016 and (ii) an $8.1 million unrealized gain attributable to the termination of our interest rate swaps related to the RBS Loan Facility during the year ended March 31, 2017.
Realized Loss on Derivatives
Realized loss on derivatives amounted to a realized loss of approximately $13.8 million for the year ended March 31, 2017, an increase of $6.9 million, or 101.2%, from a realized loss of $6.9 million for the year ended March 31, 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to the termination of the interest rate swaps related to the RBS Loan Facility during the year ended March 31, 2017.
Share Repurchase Program
In August 2015, we established a stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to $100.0 million of our common stock, which expired on December 31, 2016. We repurchased a total of 3,342,035 shares of our common stock for approximately $33.7 million under this program through its expiration. Purchases under the program were made at our discretion in the form of open market repurchase programs, privately negotiated transactions, accelerated share repurchase programs or a combination of these methods.

Market Outlook Update  
U.S. LPG exports hit new records in the first four months of 2017, offsetting declines in Middle Eastern volumes and increasing ton mile demand. We believe that the overall trend for U.S. exports remains positive and LPG volumes will grow well above those of last year. The low U.S. propane inventories have likely been one of the main reasons LPG prices have remained firm relative to West Texas Intermediate crude prices. With the current excess in crude stocks and weakening crude prices, margins on natural gas liquids are expected to improve and the production of natural gas liquids to show growth, increasing propane stocks in the process. India LPG imports registered a 17% year-over-year growth during calendar year 2017, a testament to the Indian government's commitment to replacing kerosene in households with LPG. Neo Panama Canal LPG traffic continues to be very strong, with LPG vessels representing 33% of the total traffic volume. The Panama Canal Authority has announced a toll increase effective October 2017, which will hike rates by about 30% and will likely impact traffic levels and arbitrage margins. If fuel oil prices remain reasonably low, longer voyages around the Cape of Good Hope may become profitable again and result in ship supply tightness and freight rate improvements. Canadian LPG exports are expected to benefit from the Neo Panama Canal toll increases, improving competitiveness of Canadian LPG exports with freight cost savings and higher netbacks to propane producers in Western Canada. The order book stands at about 12% of the VLGC fleet while the over 20-year-old VLGC vessels constitute 15% of the fleet. We maintain our thinking that stronger demolition prices and new environmental regulations will make older VLGC vessels more attractive demolition candidates. With LPG export terminals well established and LPG becoming less freight constrained, more attention will turn to the management of the LPG growth in the receiving and distribution infrastructures. The above market outlook update is based on data derived from industry sources, and there can be no assurances that such trends will continue or that anticipated developments in freight rates, export capacity, export volumes, scrapping rates or other market indicators will materialize.
Seasonality 
Liquefied gases are primarily used for industrial and domestic heating, as a chemical and refinery feedstock, as a transportation fuel and in agriculture. The LPG shipping market is typically stronger in the spring and summer months in anticipation of increased consumption of propane and butane for heating during the winter months. In addition, unpredictable weather patterns in these months tend to disrupt vessel scheduling and the supply of certain commodities. Demand for our vessels therefore may be stronger in our quarters ending June 30 and September 30 and relatively weaker during our quarters ending December 31 and March 31, although 12-month time charter rates tend to smooth these short-term fluctuations. To the extent any of our time charters or the charters of the vessels in the Helios Pool expire during the relatively weaker fiscal quarters ending December 31 and March 31, it may not be possible to re-charter the vessels at similar rates. As a result, we and the Helios Pool may have to accept lower rates or experience off-hire time for the vessels, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results.

 (1) 
 Adjusted EBITDA is non-U.S. GAAP financial measure and represents net income/(loss) before interest and finance costs, unrealized (gain)/loss on derivatives, realized loss on derivatives, stock-based compensation expense, impairment, and depreciation and amortization and is used as a supplemental financial measure by management to assess our financial and operating performance. We believe that adjusted EBITDA assists our management and investors by increasing the comparability of our performance from period to period. This increased comparability is achieved by excluding the potentially disparate effects between periods of derivatives, interest and finance costs, stock-based compensation expense, impairment, depreciation and amortization and loss on disposal of assets expense, which items are affected by various and possibly changing financing methods, capital structure and historical cost basis and which items may significantly affect net income/(loss) between periods. We believe that including adjusted EBITDA as a financial and operating measure benefits investors in selecting between investing in us and other investment alternatives. 







 Adjusted EBITDA has certain limitations in use and should not be considered an alternative to net income/(loss), operating income, cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA excludes some, but not all, items that affect net income/(loss). Adjusted EBITDA as presented below may not be computed consistently with similarly titled measures of other companies and, therefore, might not be comparable with other companies. 







 The following table sets forth a reconciliation of net income/(loss) to Adjusted EBITDA (unaudited) for the periods presented:

 (2) 
 We define calendar days as the total number of days in a period during which each vessel in our fleet was owned. Calendar days are an indicator of the size of the fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that are recorded during that period. 






 (3) 
 We define available days as calendar days less aggregate off‑hire days associated with scheduled maintenance, which include major repairs, drydockings, vessel upgrades or special or intermediate surveys. We use available days to measure the aggregate number of days in a period that our vessels should be capable of generating revenues. 






 (4) 
 We define operating days as available days less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off‑hire for any reason other than scheduled maintenance. We use operating days to measure the number of days in a period that our operating vessels are on hire (refer to 7 below). 






 (5) 
 We calculate fleet utilization by dividing the number of operating days during a period by the number of available days during that period. An increase in non‑scheduled off‑hire days would reduce our operating days, and, therefore, our fleet utilization. We use fleet utilization to measure our ability to efficiently find suitable employment for our vessels. 






 (6) 
 TCE rate is a non-GAAP measure of the average daily revenue performance of a vessel. TCE rate is a shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare period‑to‑period changes in a shipping company's performance despite changes in the mix of charter types (such as time charters, voyage charters) under which the vessels may be employed between the periods. Our method of calculating TCE rate is to divide revenue net of voyage expenses by operating days for the relevant time period, which may not be calculated the same by other companies. 







 The following table sets forth a reconciliation of revenues to TCE rate (unaudited) for the periods presented:

 We determine operating days for each vessel based on the underlying vessel employment, including our vessels in the Helios Pool, or Our Methodology. If we were to calculate operating days for each vessel within the Helios Pool as a variable rate time charter, or Alternate Methodology, our operating days and fleet utilization would be increased with a corresponding reduction to our TCE rate. Operating data using both methodologies since the inception of the Helios Pool is as follows:

 We believe that our methodology using the underlying vessel employment provides more meaningful insight into market conditions and the performance of our vessels. 








 (8) 
 Daily vessel operating expenses are calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by calendar days for the relevant time period. 




In addition to the results of operations presented in accordance with GAAP, we provide adjusted net income/(loss) and adjusted EPS. We believe that adjusted net income/(loss) and adjusted EPS are useful to investors in understanding our underlying performance and business trends.  Adjusted net income/(loss) and adjusted EPS are not a measurement of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP; therefore, these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative or substitute for GAAP.

WHAT IS LPG?
Liquefied petroleum gas ("LPG") is a fossil fuel made during natural gas processing and oil refining. Two thirds of the LPG people use is extracted directly from the earth. The rest of it is manufactured indirectly from crude oil refining. Chemically LPG is a mixture of two flammable but nontoxic gases called propane and butane.
HOW IS LPG STORED?
LPG is liquefied in a tank or bottle in order to have more and take up less space. If you could see inside an LPG tank or bottle, you'd see a liquid not a gas. That's because the propane and butane have been compressed so they take up almost 275 times less space than normal. By comparison, the air in a typical car tire is pressurized to roughly 2–3 times normal air pressure—so the gas in an LPG tank is squeezed about 100 times more. LPG takes up relatively little space compared to the actual amount of energy it contains.









LPG Uses
There are more than 1,000 applications of LPG. Hundreds of millions of people currently use LPG and depend on it for thousands of applications: in commercial business, industry, transportation, farming, power generation, cooking, heating and for recreational
        purposes. It is referred to as the world’s most multi-purpose energy.
        







                      Several billion people around the world use LPG at home for applications such as cooking and heating.







                      LPG is the preferred alternative automotive transportation fuel and is increasingly being used as a marine fuel.







                      Millions of businesses rely on LPG. It is the ideal fuel choice for businesses that are not connected to an existing electrical grid.









                      Farmers across the world rely on LPG to meet the challenge of staying competitive in the modern agricultural environment







                      Other industries such as aerosol, refrigeration, and chemical feedstock all look to LPG to provide sustainable fuel alternatives









WHY USE LPG?
LPG is cleaner than coal and oil and an alternative to gasoline. It makes less air pollution (fewer soot particulates, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur) and produces fewer emissions of carbon dioxide (which cause global warming).  LPG is also highly portable, making it a convenient source of energy usable in remote places where ordinary gas supplies are unavailable or have been interrupted.







WORLDWIDE LPG USE CONTINUES TO  GROW


12.1 mmt
Seaborne LPG imports into China in 2015, up 70% from 7.9 mmt in 2015


8% increase
in Seaborne LPG imports into India in 2015


“the year of the LPG consumer”
Said the Modi Government has called 2016










THE LPG SHIPPING INDUSTRY 
International seaborne LPG transportation services are generally provided by two types of operators: LPG distributors and traders and independent shipowner fleets like Dorian LPG. Traditionally the main trading route in our industry has been the transport of LPG from the Arabian Gulf to Asia. With the emergence of the United States as a major LPG export hub, the U.S. Gulf to Asia has become an important trade route.
Vessels are generally operated under time charters, bareboat charters, spot charters, or contracts of affreightment. LPG distributors and traders use their fleets not only to transport their own LPG, but also to transport LPG for third-party charterers in direct competition with independent owners and operators in the tanker charter market. LPG transportation services operate in markets that are highly competitive and based primarily on supply and demand of available vessels. Generally, competition for charters is based upon charter rate, customer relationships, operating expertise, professional reputation and vessel specifications (size, age and condition).
Very large gas carriers ("VLGCs") like those owned by Dorian LPG are the largest class of vessels in the global LPG fleet.  These vessels are highly- engineered to meet the exacting demands of a customer as well as to comply with strict environmental regulation, including emissions regulations.  Dorian LPG's  modern, ECO-class fleet of VLGCs, combined with its high level of crew training and strict vessel maintenance program has made it a preferred provider of LPG transportation services.


KEY SUPPLY FUNDAMENTALS


1 US shale revolution has created a fundamental shift in trade flows


2 Rapid growth in both LPG supply and demand creating new dynamic


3 Bifurcation of major supply sources makes LPG increasingly competitive


4 VLGCs are a critical link in the global LPG supply chain

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

A Seafaring Tradition
Dorian LPG’s seafaring tradition dates back more than 200 years to when John Hadjipateras' great grandfather, Constantine,  bought his first ship in his early twenties. Constantine, orphaned by the age of 12, came from a ship owning and seafaring family with a fortune that had been squandered.  Though Constantine did not inherit material wealth, he inherited something much more valuable:  his family's impeccable reputation.  Wherever Constantine ventured, he encountered people who had dealt with his family and they did not hesitate to trust him because of that. The understanding that present actions impact future generations is thus one that stewards of family businesses learn early on.Today, Dorian LPG's CEO, John Hadjipateras, has no less an appreciation for maintaining the highest reputation. Dorian LPG's customers are entitled to the top level of performance through core “family values” that include hard work, taking responsibility for one and another's safety and well being and protecting assets that are essential to business success.While times have certainly changed, the long tradition of respect for the seafarer and his or her unique skills and sacrifices is reinforced by Dorian LPG's corporate culture.  As Dorian LPG stepped into the pubic domain in 2014, succession was no longer a family matter however the succession and commitment to the founding family’s values remain a corporate priority.
