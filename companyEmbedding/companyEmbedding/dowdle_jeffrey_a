 DowdleSports.com originated from an old family business that started 
in 1909 and was licensed as a hardware store in Memphis, TN.  The 
sporting goods business emerged from a dissolved partnership in the 
Desoto Hardware Company with Orgill Brothers in the 1940's and became 
Dowdle and Jetton Sporting Goods in 1947 owned by brothers-in-law Bill 
Dowdle and Charlie Jetton.  After several years, Dowdle purchased 
Jetton’s interest and the name was changed to Dowdle Sporting Goods, 
Inc.  In 1995, the name was shortened to Dowdle Sports, Inc and the 
company moved to Cordova suburb of Memphis, TN at 981 N Germantown Pkwy at Macon Rd.
With the evolution of the Internet into an avenue of global commerce,
 DowdleSports.com emerged as an e-commerce venture in 1997.  A robust 
build-up of the online catalog migrated into a separate business which 
has enjoyed the opportunity for us to bring an uncommon commitment with personalized service to our online customers.  DowdleSports.com continues to
 operate with a dedication to customer service and the ability to adapt 
to the ever changing fields of products, technology and competition.  As
 a full line independent dealer of outdoor and athletic sporting goods, 
we have always been able to compete with mass merchants on a local 
level with competitive pricing and superior service and today, we are often cheaper than our large online competitors.  In January 2013, 
DowdleSports.com opened a new team sales show room and again, began selling to 
local teams and customers offering substantial discounts and fast 
service for team uniforms and athletic equipment.  For local sales, you 
can reach us at 901-751-9988 or visit us at our new sales office in the back of the old Dowdle Sports retail
 store located at 981 N Germantown Pkwy in Cordova, TN.

I think I have practically known your family all my life.Many memories come back to me from The Ranch. Jeff was a kind soul and would never harm anyone. I called him shuffles. Because he always just shuffled along. Brings a smile to my face. May the many memories in your heart help you find comfort in the days ahead. Take Care and God Bless!

To the Dowdle family,    When my family first moved back to Cadiz 10 years ago - we moved in next door to Jeff. From the first day - we spoke and sat on each other\'s porches talking.  He many times shoveled my sidewalk and driveway.  We borrowed food back and forth. We didn\'t talk much after we both moved but I will always appreciate his kindness when we first arrived back in town.  I\'m sorry for your loss.    Brooke Bovenizer
