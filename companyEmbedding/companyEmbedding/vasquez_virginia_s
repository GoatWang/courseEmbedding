Virginia Economy
Agriculture
Tobacco, once the basis of the Virginia economy, has been replaced by livestock and livestock products as the state's most valuable source of agricultural income.  Livestock products now generate more than 2/3 of the state's total agricultural receipts.
In terms of revenue generated Virginia's top five agricultural products are broilers (young chickens),
beef cattle and calves, dairy products, greenhouse and nursery products, and turkeys.

Livestock
Broilers (5-12 week-old chickens) are the state's most valuable product followed by beef cattle.
Other important livestock products include milk, turkeys, and horses/mules. Virginia is one of the country's leading (#6 among the states) producers of turkeys.
Chicken eggs, hogs, aquaculture, and sheep and lambs are also part of the livestock products category.


Crops
In this category, greenhouse and nursery products lead the way, generating 9% of Virginia's total
agricultural receipts.
Soybeans edge out tobacco for the number two position, providing about 5% of the state's total agricultural receipts.  Tobacco generates around 4% of total receipts.  Other field crops grown in Virginia are hay, cotton, wheat, peanuts, and barley.
Tomatoes and corn for grain are other major crops grown in Virginia.
Other important vegetable crops grown in the state are potatoes, snap beans, cucumbers, and sweet corn.
Leading fruits grown in Virginia include apples and grapes.

[ More ]
Manufacturing
Manufacturers add value to raw products by creating manufactured items.  For example, cotton cloth becomes more valuable than a boll of cotton through manufacturing processes.

How Untraceable 'Ghost Guns' Are Bought and Sold Online

 A legal loophole means that anyone, including criminals, can order a so-called “ghost gun” off the web without a background check – a gun with no serial number that can’t be traced. 
 The guns are built from kits and arrive in pieces, so under existing law, when they’re shipped, they aren’t guns. When assembled by their buyers, they’re lethal – and legal. 
 Federal officials like Graham Barlowe, the resident agent in charge of the ATF’s Sacramento office, say the loophole is dangerous. 
 “People that could not pass a background check,” said Barlowe, “are purchasing these unfinished receiver kits and making firearms because they know that if they went to a gun store, they wouldn't be able to pass a background check.” 
 Police say criminals are well aware of the availability of “ghost guns,” and they’ve been used in shootings across the country, from Maryland to California. 
 Jeff Rossen, NBC News national investigative correspondent, went online to see how easy it would be to order these gun kits. He quickly found dozens of websites offering the product, and ordered a rifle kit, which he had shipped to former ATF agent Rick Vasquez in Virginia. 







Sen. Chuck Schumer, D.-N.Y., is trying to pass legislation that would ban people from buying untraceable "ghost gun" kits that allow people to make firearms without serial numbers. Via NBC News


 All the parts needed to assemble a gun were in the box when it arrived. It took Vasquez a couple of hours to assemble the weapon. 
 “This is now a completed semi-automatic firearm,” said Vasquez, showing it to Rossen. Rossen noted that there was no serial number on the finished product, making it untraceable. 
 Said Vasquez, “That is correct … You cannot trace this firearm.” He and Rossen then took the weapon to a range and fired it, where in Vasquez’s expert opinion, it “work[ed] great.” 
 Sen. Chuck Schumer, D.-N.Y., the senate minority leader said he wants to close the loophole, but expects fierce opposition from the National Rifle Association. “We are going to try to pass legislation,” said Schumer. “The trouble is the NRA is so unreasonable and has such power in the Congress, you'd think this should pass like that, but it is going to be a long hard road.” 
 The NRA did not respond to repeated requests for comment.

Modern Distilling in Franklin and Floyd Counties                @headerSize>
            

Cool mountain air, clean water, winding roads, small communities, loyal friendships and an emerging lawful spirits industry—that’s what you’ll discover when visiting Franklin and Floyd counties.  Located in the foothills of Virginia’s Blue Ridge, this area is often referred to as “The Moonshine Capital of the World” and is home to a complex history of distilling a variety of spirits. Using recipes passed down for generations, these distillers are bringing the moonshine traditions of Franklin and Floyd to modern times.











5 Mile Mountain Distillery                @headerSize>
            





 

Located in a former water treatment plant, 5 Mile Mountain is Floyd’s first distillery since prohibition. Opening their distillery required changing the liquor laws of the town of Floyd, which was done successfully in 2015, allowing the distillery to begin operations and open a tasting room.  Using an old recipe from a famous local moonshiner, each small batch of moonshine is produced using a traditional copper still on an open flame.  Affectionately named “Mountain Girl," the 100-gallon copper still is lovingly tended to by both distillers (and distillery dog, Titus) to ensure that the product represents the same quality as their predecessors. Kerry Underwood and Patrick Sisk are committed to using natural ingredients including local Virginia corn, local elderberries in their Elderberry Moonshine and local plums in their Vanilla Plum Moonshine.  They are bottling up the love, history and distinctive taste of Five Mile Mountain and putting it on the shelves for everyone to enjoy. Cheers!

Law's Choice Distillery                @headerSize>
            





 

Across the hills and down dusty roads we come to Law’s Choice Distillery, run by Henry Law, a third generation moonshiner from Franklin County.  Henry is the son of the notorious Amos Law, a former kingpin of the modern moonshine industry.  The 1937 Chevy pickup pictured above was Amos’s stillhouse truck, which was abandoned during a hot pursuit. Thirty years later, Henry managed to recover the truck and restore it to its current glory.  Henry spent ten years working for his father, but had a rough start—he blew up a still on his first day!  Nowadays, Henry legally produces Law’s Choice Moonshine, carefully selecting local fruits and grains, including wheat bran, rye, yellow and white corn and malted barley.  Distilling in a sub-style still that was fabricated entirely by hand, Henry follows the same recipe used by his father for more than 60 years.   As a recent addition to the Virginia ABC catalog, you can find Law’s Choice Moonshine  without breaking the “law”!

Twin Creeks Distillery                @headerSize>
            





 

Just down the road in Henry, Virginia, we find Twin Creeks Distillery.  Chris Prillaman began marketing his moonshine and brandies in 2015.  After visiting a distillery in South Carolina, he had a revelation:  “I can do this, I’ve been making moonshine my whole life!” He decided to open his own operation in Franklin County. Chris and his cousin Andrew grew up with moonshine—it’s in their blood.   They learned the trade from their family members and neighbors, some of whom were convicted “shiners." Using the age-old steam distilling method, which is a dying tradition, they make quality products using locally-sourced ingredients.  For instance, their Peach Brandy is made from Franklin County’s finest local peaches.  In addition to their Sugar Rye Moonshine, they plan on introducing some aged spirits in the near future.  Chris says he is “staying true to his roots and the roots of the people of this county." In addition to finding these products at Virginia ABC, you can purchase them in Twin Creek Distillery’s Tasting Room, set to open this fall.

Franklin County Distillery                @headerSize>
            





 

Located in Boones Mill along the major thoroughfare of Rt. 220, you will find Franklin County Distillery (FCD), the first licensed distillery in the county.  The town of Boones Mill thrived because of the railroad line that weaves through the valley. Bootleggers  utilized the railroad to feed the burgeoning new boom—moonshine. FCD recognizes the rich history of the area and hopes to bring that heritage to the nearly 28,000 people that pass through Boones Mill every day. Their new tasting room and distillery is set to open later this summer, which includes some remarkable pieces: two stills brought from Lyon, France and museum-quality framed photographs showing the history of the area’s moonshine production during Prohibition. FCD currently distills in a building out back, across the Maggodee Creek, which has some of the purest water in the land. Their flagship product, White Label Corn Whiskey is made using this clean water and locally-sourced grains.  Find their products at select Virginia ABC stores and online, as well as in their beautiful new facility.
