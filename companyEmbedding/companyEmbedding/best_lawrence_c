Mega Endurance
























Mega Endurance



 The only male enhancement supplement designed specifically to maximize your sexual stamina. Developed by John Lawrence during his career as a performer in the adult film industry, this professional-grade formula is still used by most active male performers to this day. MEGA Endurance gives you the energy and staying power to last as long as it takes to bring any woman to orgasm — even at full speed & intensity of penetration.
 MEGA Endurance is crafted from a precision blend of five powerful & exotic natural ingredients. The formula is tied together by a mysterious root called Dong Quai which grows high in the Kunlunshan Mountains of western China. This potent compound locks the blood into the chambers of your penis to keep you at full hardness for long spans of time...up to 30-45 minutes.
1 bottle contains 60 capsules.
Suggested Use: 2 capsules 20 minutes before sexual activity, taken with a full glass of water.









Qty 3 - $112.39 - Save 25%



Qty 2 - $83.92 - Save 16%



Qty 1 - $49.95

















Product Description
MEGA Endurance is the most effective staying-power supplement ever created for one simple reason: it’s made using the highest-quality ingredients. Every single extract that goes into this precise blend is 100% all-natural and independently tested...so you know you're getting the best possible product available.

DONG QUAI — Used in traditional Chinese medicine to boost male sex drive for centuries, this exotic root boosts nitric oxide levels in your bloodstream, which locks the blood into the chambers of your penis once it’s there — keeping you harder for longer.
L-ARGININE — This natural compound is actually a powerful vasodilator...meaning it helps open your blood vessels to ensure rapid flow of blood to your penis when you need it most.
KOREAN GINSENG — I use roots that have grown for over 100 years because these have been shown to contain the most potent levels of the active compound. Improves sexual performance of men with ED in study after study.
HYPERICUM PERFORATUM (St. John’s Wort) — Targets a crucial component of sexual stamina...your mental state. This powerful herb reduces anxiety and allows you to relax during sex, reducing the stress that can lead to ejaculating too soon.
CINNAMON BARK — Another traditional aphrodisiac, this mysterious ingredient seems to amplify the actions of the other ingredients, tying the formula together to create unheard-of levels of endurance.



Safety
Lawrence Supplements is fully committed to your safety, first and foremost. This is why we only use the purest, most proven herbal extracts- and NEVER add fillers, binders, or untested ingredients. Simply put, if I wouldn’t put it in my body, I won’t ask you to put it in yours.
And to demonstrate my commitment to safety and effectiveness, I subject all of my formulas to an intense, 3-part testing process at an FDA-approved laboratory. This way, I know exactly what’s in each pill, and that’s why I can stand behind everything I make with such confidence.


Our Promise
My promise is simple...I promise to only sell products that I stand behind 100%. If you try any of my products and don’t feel like I’ve delivered on every single one of my claims, then I don’t want you to pay. 
Simply send the unused portion back within 60 days, and I will refund your money, no questions asked. No hassles, no hoops to jump through, just mail it back and I’ll refund your money.

About Us

Lawrence Supplements was established in 2011 after years of personal research and development by its founder John Lawrence.
Disappointed with the lack of availability of safe high quality nutritional supplements, John embarked upon a mission to formulate the best combination of scientifically proven herbs for himself and his cohorts in the adult industry.
That mission led him to all corners of the world to rediscover ancient aphrodisiac secrets and source the purest ingredients for his first proprietary blend - PHGH. PHGH quickly became an industry wide secret of the world's top male adult performers but John was left unsatisfied. He had made his impact upon the adult industry, but it was his decision to share this gift with the world that brought him a real sense of purpose.
He wanted to give this to the people so that all men could have this power, so he left the adult industry and set upon his true mission in life: to help everyday people.
John has been steadfast and dedicated to this undertaking, his new lifework is to produce the highest quality male enhancement formulas with only the best ingredients. John is fully obligated to the safety and satisfaction of the customer and personally stands by a 60 day, 100% money back guarantee.
Lawrence Supplements is committed to developing natural products designed to help men stay healthy and realize their fullest potential.

Testimonials

Maddie O'reilly talks about PHGH in the adult industry 
To ensure accuracy, we only allow customers to review a product if they have purchased it in the last 90 days.


"I just wanted to drop you a line and THANK YOU for creating PHGH . Since you first introduced PHGH to me I've been taking it as a part of my daily blend and I can honestly say this is one of the best supplements I've ever taken. Not only have I found myself experiencing much larger erections than ever before, my sex drive is at an all time high and I feel like I am ready to go at a moments notice. Thank you for for taking the time to create this and please accept my kudos for a job well done."
- Dr. Joseph Levine, Nutra Health Store ,  Medical Director
Based on individual’s opinion regarding individual’s results. Although some may experience extraordinary benefits when using this product, results do vary. This testimonial does not constitute typical results nor do we claim otherwise. This product is not intended to cure erectile dysfunction.


"I am 50 years old and have been using PHGH for five months now. I can honestly say that I have seen a HUGE difference in my overall size and performance. Libido has never been a problem for me, but I have definitely seen an increase there as well. The biggest difference I see from before PHGH to after, is the size and strength of the erection, and the intensity of the orgasms. I feel like a teenager again. This is definitely the best natural male enhancement product that I have ever tried."
- KW,  Beverly Hills, CA
Based on individual’s opinion regarding individual’s results. Although some may experience extraordinary benefits when using this product, results do vary. This testimonial does not constitute typical results nor do we claim otherwise. This product is not intended to cure erectile dysfunction.




"I have tried Viagra and that worked, but who can afford Viagra when having sex on a regular basis. I have tried Man-Up and have to say the results were mixed. Now it has been just over a week of me using PHGH, and I am extremely happy. Last night, WOW! I felt like a king and I know my girlfriend enjoyed it as well. Twice in fact before my first. She has the mentality that good sex is in direct relations to the emotional connection. While I do agree to a point, as a man, we know that sometimes we just can't perform to the level we would like to. PHGH may be the difference in letting that one get away or keeping her completely satisfied."
- CG,  Newport Beach, CA
Based on individual’s opinion regarding individual’s results. Although some may experience extraordinary benefits when using this product, results do vary. This testimonial does not constitute typical results nor do we claim otherwise. This product is not intended to cure erectile dysfunction.


"Guy's am almost 66 and was taking Viagra as I needed it, but I can honestly say something has made me a better. Even when I really not in the mood all my wife has to do is kiss me and look out. So PHGH THANKS. GREAT PRODUCT"
- WS,  Wellington, UK
Based on individual’s opinion regarding individual’s results. Although some may experience extraordinary benefits when using this product, results do vary. This testimonial does not constitute typical results nor do we claim otherwise. This product is not intended to cure erectile dysfunction.




"I have tried almost every pill they make and have spent a lot of money doing it and none of them work. PHGH I got just to try one last time and I was impressed with the results , it really works. My girlfriend doesn't even no I take pill and she asked me what I did differently because it was better and longer sex than I ever before. So I thank u very much for finally making a pill that works."
- NP,  Salt Lake City, UT
Based on individual’s opinion regarding individual’s results. Although some may experience extraordinary benefits when using this product, results do vary. This testimonial does not constitute typical results nor do we claim otherwise. This product is not intended to cure erectile dysfunction.


"Hey guys, I'm 75 years old and feel like 30. I'm now on my second order of PHGH and swear this stuff works. I've tried other brands but nothing works like this product from John Lawrence. I can feel it working for increased length and thickness and it feels grand. It helps with my self confidence as well as major help with my performance. So, at age 75 I can tell you that you have a grand future sexually with this product. Good Luck to each of you reading this. And John, thanks for all your effort to bring a great deal of satisfaction to your customers and the ladies they pleasure. Carlos"
- JB,  Cincinnati, Oh

"This is a great product! It did for me all that it claims it's supposed to do. It's the truth! Harder and easier to obtain erections, less recovery time and a whole load of confidence. The wife is very pleased to say the least. Thank you for this product, John. It's a game changer for a guy in his 40's!"
- TC,  Madison Wisconsin

"Consistent results… I feel like my young self again. The effects of Peyronie's Disease left me terribly embarrassed and atrophied. But the resulting blood flow improvement from this product has restored girth both flaccid and erect, as well as boosting confidence!"

Lawrence's Review of TruGlo Tritium Pistol Night Sight


        The optics of the sights themselves are superb.The quality and durability are terrible. The customer service is yet to be seen. I know that the covers on what appeared to be a fully enclosed metal piece that sits in front of the fiber optic tube, that also enclosed the night sight materials, fell out of the sights in less than two hundred rounds. They required that I mail the slide back to them ,this cost an additional $29 dollar experience. Adding obviously $29 to the already high purchase price. The customer service department told me that they have no way to sight in the sights. I will have to bring it to a gun Smith upon it's return. Although Trijicon sights are not as bright, they are much more durable.
            



Pros:

Excellent optics and night lumination



Cons:

They apparently fall apart in in than 200 rounds ,are not worth
They apparently fall apart in less than 200 rounds



Best Used for:

Ovoid these sights and get something reliable.






 Would Recommend: 
                No

                                        had these installed 5 month ago. the rears are still working good, but the front sight is barely illuminated. I can't get Tru-Glo to answer any of my e-mails.

                                        We had the sights professionally installed then shot approximately 50 round. The next day the front sight no longer was lighted.I do not believe this to be typical.

        I took these sights to a highly respected gunsmith who informed me these TruGlo sights are not worth putting on my Glock 30S.  The front sight does not fit correctly.  The sight has too short of a mounting stem for proper seating which results in an unstable sight.  He installed the sight and showed me how unstable it was. He said  the sight could be secured with a cementing agent but that he highly recommended against doing so.  I chose to return the sights.

Tru-Glo tritium sights








        by

        I fitted these myself to my Glock 30.  This job requires a special thinwall socket to remove the tiny hex head bolt and these are available on the Net for about $9 ppd.
The rear sight was removed with a brass punch, the slide held between two pieces of wood in my vise.

Once fitted, I checked the sights for night visibility and they are very clearly visible in total darkness.  I like them and they are a valuable addition to my home defense weapon.

Nice to be surprised

        These sights really can be seen in the dark.. Compared to my original sights which could not be seen at all in the dark, this was a nice surprise.
When you wake up some night to sounds of someone in your house, you can confidently know that when they come into the room you are in you can put front sight on center mass.
Without night sights your are just going to point a shoot and hope for the best.

        These are sights that are good for a plinking gun, not near up to par with Trijicon Sights. These are the 2nd pair I have put on a .9mm the I shoot just to shoot on a older gun. These sights are a good starting pair of night sight, till you can get a good pair.

Great Night Sights

        I bought these sights to replace the dim, beat-up factory Meprolight sights on my Kimber CDP. The TruGlos installed with little fuss and just minor filing on the rear dovetail. The finish is fine and the tritium is really bright (brighter than AmeriGlo and Trijicon sights that I have). The only note is that these sights do look substantially more "angular" or "tough" than the original (rounded) factory sights. That may or may not be a good thing to you.
Pros: Bright, tough, great price
Cons: Required some fitting

        Great for ccw, range shooting I would buy tritium with fiber optic tubes for
better shade pick up.
Install was good like most glocks are.
Pros: great in very low light, very tough, easy to install
Cons: shade or covered shooting range will be harder to see

        These are good night sights and in my opinion a little better than Trijicon.  Personally I prefer the TruGlo tritium fiber optic sights.  These are a clear green glow in all lighting conditions and priced about the same.
Pros: Excellent night time visibility
Cons: Average daytime visibility

Video games

Library rides nostalgia wave with launch of Retro Gaming Club 
Ian Stepp remembers visiting his aunt’s house as a kid, where he’d play classic games like Duck Hunt and iterations of the Mario Brothers saga on the family’s trusty old Nintendo Entertainment System. 

Now pushing 30, Stepp is still a fan of the now-classic video games that in recent years have spawned a thriving culture and industry capitalizing on the nostalgia of grownups who coveted Nintendo game systems as kids in the 1980s and 90s.

Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.
