Kongregate CEO Emily Greer Joins PlayFab Board of Directors

		  Rounds Out Leadership Team with Appointment of CTO and Four Key Tech and Gaming Hires

SEATTLE, June 30, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- PlayFab, the industry's most complete backend service to build, launch and grow live games, today announced that Emily Greer, co-founder and CEO of Kongregate, has joined its Board of Directors. PlayFab also appointed co-founder and lead developer, Matt Augustine, as Chief Technology Officer (CTO), and is rounding out its leadership team with the addition of four key game and technology industry veterans.
Greer's experience building Kongregate, a subsidiary of GameStop, into a leading free-to-play game portal and mobile game publisher will be invaluable to PlayFab as it focuses on providing the best game-as-a-service technology to help developers of all sizes build, launch, and grow great live games. Pulling from her expertise in mobile and online games, Greer will advise PlayFab on the evolving needs of game developers as the company continues to expand its backend game operations platform.
"Ongoing live operations are crucial to success in free-to-play games," said Greer. "Small and mid-sized developers have been at a huge disadvantage because of the cost and complexity of building and running a backend. PlayFab's backend-as-a-service can help them compete in the tough mobile market."
Greer joins an already distinguished PlayFab Board of Directors, which includes Mitch Lasky, general partner at Benchmark, Bob Berry, CEO of Envelop VR, and Timothy Dick, managing director at Startup Capital Ventures. 
"Kongregate is one of the biggest publishers of indie games out there today, and Emily's keen understanding of what developers need to become more successful will be a great addition to our board," said James Gwertzman, co-founder and CEO of PlayFab. "Combined with our recent senior leadership hires, we're uniquely positioning PlayFab to help developers and grow the live games space in the months and years to come."
In addition to building out its board of directors, PlayFab also appointed co-founder Matt Augustine as CTO. As lead architect of PlayFab's backend platform, Augustine is focused on continuing to build out tools and technologies that empower game developers to boost player acquisition, retention, and monetization.
PlayFab has also recently added four key hires to its leadership team to head up business development, marketing, product, and game operations success. They include:  

Nick Beckley, director of business development – Beckley joins PlayFab from RAD Game Tools where he led sales for the popular games middleware provider. To his role at PlayFab, Beckley brings experience working with developers of all sizes, from small indies to large AAA studios. 
Liz Hunt, director of product – Hunt is a user experience expert who previously led the mobile team at Starbucks and technology team at frog design inc., a global product strategy and design firm. 
Thom Robbins, director of marketing – Robbins brings to PlayFab deep marketing experience from his years at Microsoft, Kentico Software, and Socrata, where he evangelized platform technologies to developers. 
Scott Willoughby, director of game operations success – Willoughby joins PlayFab from Wizards of the Coast, where he led digital strategy and operations for Magic: The Gathering. He also previously led game operations at PopCap. At PlayFab, he will lead efforts to help game developers craft and execute effective game operations strategies.
PlayFab is rapidly growing and currently hiring experienced software developers and engineers to work out of its Seattle office. For more information on current availabilities and how to apply, please visit: https://playfab.com/jobs

PlayFab







Join The PlayFab Team
PlayFab's mission is to transform the game industry by delivering a live-game operations platform that helps studios of all sizes more effectively build, launch, and operate their games post-launch.


Game operations — everything you do with your game post-launch — is hard, and getting harder. The gap in best practices between the best developers and everyone else is large. We're helping to close that gap by providing everything a developer needs to be successful — all the tools, technologies, and know-how — allowing developers to go back to focusing on their game, and letting us take care of everything else.
PlayFab recently received Series A funding from Benchmark and Madrona Venture Group. New hires should expect to hit the ground running and make significant contributions from day one. We don't have a kegerator or dogs running around the office; we do have a seasoned and mature team committed to changing the game industry for the better.

IBM and PlayFab, Inc. Announces Joint Initiative to Apply IBM Watson to Unlock New Value for Game Developers
Mar 20 17
IBM InterConnect –IBM and PlayFab announced a joint initiative to provide game developers with deeper insights into their players' behavior. By pairing the IBM Watson Data Platform on IBM Cloud with PlayFab's backend services for games, developers can utilize the industry's fastest data ingestion engine with cognitive powered decision support to help improve player experiences and boost engagement. The interactive gaming market generated more than $91 billion in revenue in 2016, with more than $41 billion from mobile gaming. To achieve projections of $120 billion by 2020, the industry will need to increase capabilities to understand and act on player behavior in real time. The Watson Data Platform provides game developers with the necessary tools to perform deep, collaborative analytics, including machine learning, across massive data sets. PlayFab provides a backend platform with powerful real-time tools and services for operating games post-launch. The PlayFab platform includes player relationship management, tournaments and leader boards, in-app commerce, content management, and powerful automation tools to reduce player churn and boost engagement and monetization. Through this new initiative, PlayFab's customers can tap into Watson Data Platform to unlock the power of industry leading machine learning technologies. Built on Apache Spark, IBM Watson Machine Learning intelligently and automatically builds models from structured and unstructured data and open machine learning libraries, while accelerating model deployment into business operations. With Watson Machine Learning, game developers can analyze more data about their players and deploy those learnings directly into their games via PlayFab's platform. Additionally, Watson Data Platform provides PlayFab developers the ability to accelerate and simplify data ingestion – potentially up to 43TB per hour (using IBM HTAP with 100 nodes) - then collaborate around the data with a wide range of analytics tools including a variety of machine learning libraries. Watson Data Platform brings together content, data, models, and open source resources from IBM and others, including H2O, RStudio, and Jupyter Notebooks, on Apache Spark in a single, security-rich managed environment.

Meet the Team




James Gwertzman
CEO / Co-Founder


James Gwertzman is a seasoned technology entrepreneur and executive, with 15 years of experience in the game industry. Prior to founding PlayFab, James started and ran PopCap Asia, headquartered in Shanghai, with offices in Tokyo, Seoul, and Singapore. At PopCap, James witnessed firsthand the challenges facing traditional game developers making the transition to games-as-services, and in particular the challenges of building and operating profitable free-to-play games. PopCap China achieved distinction as one of very few western game developers to build a profitable presence in China.
James joined PopCap in 2005 when it acquired Sprout Games, the casual game developer he had co-founded in 2003. He also co-founded console game developer Escape Factory in 2000. Prior to entering the game industry, he worked on server technologies at Microsoft, receiving 2 patents for web personalization work he led for MSN.
Additionally, James is an advisor to Code.org, where he served in 2013 as Chief Evangelist, running the successful Hour of Code initiative which resulted in more than 20 million K-12 students experiencing their first hour-long introduction to computer programming. He is a frequent speaker at industry conferences, and graduated magna cum laude from Harvard with a computer science degree in 1995.



Matt Augustine
CTO / Co-Founder


Matt is the original creator and architect of PlayFab, back when it was still a part of Uber Entertainment. He transferred to PlayFab when it was spun out, and continues to oversee all design and engineering of the core services. He cut his teeth at Microsoft, where he worked on several large-scale projects including docs.com, a site for creating and sharing Microsoft Office documents on Facebook, Live Mesh, a product for synchronizing and sharing files and folders in the cloud, and the account system for Messenger and Hotmail, a system that he helped scale from zero to over 250 million users with minimal downtime. And speaking of downtime, he has none. But if he did, it would go directly to his wife and two children.

Adrienne MacIain

But she never lost her passion for hospitality, now applied to making our office a welcoming, efficient and creative space.

Jordan Roher
Sr. Front-End Web Developer


Jordan is a front-end web developer and avid gamer. He strives for straightforward interfaces tailored for their users. While he might be the last person on Earth who can program in ColdFusion, he turned down that rare and rarely lucrative career to work on HaloWaypoint.com and other Microsoft properties. Now his free time involves recabling his living room, slogging through From Software titles, and worrying how many digits to specify when laying out grids in CSS.

Zach is a recent graduate of Carnegie Mellon University having completed a combined bachelors/masters in math. He’s a third-generation programmer (from both sides!) who has been coding since age 12. He is passionate about using math to solve the weirdest and hardest problems in programming. He has lived all across the US, in Seattle, Berkeley, New Hampshire, New York, Pittsburgh, and Los Angeles. When he’s not programming, he’s either playing funk on his bass or studying functional analysis.
