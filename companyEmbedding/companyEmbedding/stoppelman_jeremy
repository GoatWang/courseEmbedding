How Yelp C.E.O. Jeremy Stoppelman Created a Revolutionary Product | Vanity FairVanity FairSign InIn The DetailsWhat You Should Know About Jeremy StoppelmanA panoply of eccentric biographical data re: the ur-yelper.by David KampOctober 2014EmailFacebookTwitterJeremy Stoppelman, photographed in San Francisco.He was just another gangly Web 2.0 kid with a good job in Silicon Valley (at PayPal) and a big dream: in his case, to launch an online successor to the Yellow Pages. But something funny happened shortly after Jeremy Stoppelman’s project, Yelp, went live: its users embraced the site’s “Write a review” feature to a degree far greater than anticipated. A few weeks of hasty re-coding later, Yelp was reconfigured to make reviewing its raison d’être, and Stoppelman has never looked back. Ten years after its founding, Yelp is the Web’s premier site and app for customer reviews—not just of restaurants, but of shops, kiosks, food trucks, parks, bus lines, funeral homes, D.M.V. offices, and even human attractions. (The Naked Cowboy in Times Square was averaging four stars out of five at press time.) Herewith, some info gleaned from a meandering conversation with the Yelp C.E.O., who turns 37 this November.HE IS himself an avid Yelper, reviewing under the profile name Big Papa. He has waxed enthusiastic over the Renaissance Salon in his current hometown of San Francisco (“My last haircut generated mucho complimentos” ) and panned Frankfurt’s airport (an “authentic interpretation of Dante’s Inferno” ).AMONG THE happiest discoveries he has made by perusing Yelp reviews is the existence of the Seward Street Slides, in San Francisco’s Castro district. “It’s basically these two concrete slides in a quiet, residential neighborhood,” he says. “You zip down them sitting on top of flattened cardboard boxes. I’d be curious to learn the history of these slides, because they’re, like, not at all safe.”HE INITIALLY resisted the push to name his company Yelp, because, to him, it sounded like “a sad cry for help.” He preferred the name Yocal (rhyming with “local” ).HE GREW up in the Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., the son of a securities lawyer and a teacher, and attended Langley High School, just down the road from the headquarters of the C.I.A. Among his schoolmates were a son of Antonin Scalia’s and some kids who were curiously vague about what their parents did for a living.__HE IS—__notwithstanding the fact that Google’s autocomplete function suggests the words “Jeremy Stoppelman Indian” when you enter his name into the search field—a Jewish American of European ancestry who attended a Reform temple as a child and had a Bar Mitzvah. He attributes the frequent misperception of his ethnicity to his “black hair and dark skin tone.”HE PLAYED tennis as a youth and was often told that he looked like Pete Sampras.__HIS FIRST__computer—his family’s, actually—was an Amiga 2000, a little-remembered late-80s high-end P.C. with “unbelievable sound and graphics capabilities” that, to this day, he feels doesn’t get its due.HIS YOUNGER brother, Michael, is Yelp’s vice president in charge of engineering. His older brother, Andy, two years his senior, died abruptly on the eve of his high-school graduation, in 1993, of a rare heart-rhythm disorder. That experience, Jeremy says, made him realize that “life is very short and you have to make the most of it.”HE IS frequently vilified by critics who claim that Yelp is a protection racket whose sales representatives shake down small-business owners, offering better placement of positive reviews (and/or the burying of negative reviews) in exchange for ad purchases—a charge that Stoppelman flatly denies, noting that all the lawsuits brought against Yelp to this effect have been dismissed.HE WAS called a “scumbag,” a “dick,” and “full of shit,” among other things, when he participated in a Reddit Ask Me Anything session last year. He did not respond in kind.HE ACCEPTS the invective hurled his way as the cost of creating a “disruptive, game-changing service or product,” likening the heat Yelp takes to that felt by Airbnb (vis-à-vis the hotel industry) and Uber (vis-à-vis the taxicab industry).HE HAS met three current or former heads of state: two U.S. presidents, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, and the Taoiseach of Ireland, Enda Kenny.HE TOOK up guitar playing just a couple of years ago. He has mastered “Banana Pancakes,” by Jack Johnson. He is getting there on Eric Clapton’s “Layla.”HE FINDS conventional guitar pop difficult to code to, since it interrupts his thought process, but maintains that “the pulsating beat of electronic music is actually very focusing.” Back when he was frequently coding, his favorite artist was the house-music D.J.and producer Kaskade.HE HAS taken to preaching online about the dangers of sugar, citing the research of the outspoken pediatric endocrinologist Robert Lustig (of the University of California, San Francisco) and arguing that “a sugar tax isn’t a terrible idea.”THAT SAID, Yelp user Big Papa recently gave four stars to the San Francisco bakery Baked, describing its brownie as “a complete gut bomb, but it delivered the fructose and glucose I needed to get through a really long end of day meeting.”Jeremy StoppelmanFOLLOWBarack ObamaFOLLOWFollow to get the latest news and analysis about the players in your inbox.See All PlayersShareEmailFacebookTwitterDavid KampDavid Kamp has been a Vanity Fair contributing editor since 1996, profiling such monumental figures of the arts as Johnny Cash, Lucian Freud, Sly Stone, and John Hughes.YOU MIGHT LIKEAN INTERACTIVE LIST OF THE 2014 NEW ESTABLISHMENTVanity FairAs the Mooch Vows to “Kill All the Leakers,” Spicer Receives a Hero’s Welcome in New YorkVanity FairWhy the Scariest Nuclear Threat May Be Coming from Inside the White HouseVanity Fair“I Want to F*cking Kill All the Leakers”: Scaramucci Explodes in Unhinged Late-Night RantVanity FairObamacare Repeal Dies in the Senate as McCain Twists the KnifeVanity FairThe Military Is Officially Ignoring Trump’s Transgender OrderVanity FairAround the WebPowered by ZergnetRELATEDSEEKAN INTERACTIVE LIST OF THE 2014 NEW ESTABLISHMENTAs the Mooch Vows to “Kill All the Leakers,” Spicer Receives a Hero’s Welcome in New YorkBY EMILY JANE FOXSEEK

Company history (2004–2016)[edit]
Origins (2004–2009)[edit]




Jeremy Stoppelman, co-founder and CEO of Yelp


Two former PayPal employees, Jeremy Stoppelman and Russel Simmons, founded Yelp at a business incubator, MRL Ventures, in 2004.[4][5] Stoppelman and Simmons conceived the initial idea for Yelp as an email-based referral network, after Stoppelman caught the flu[6] and had a difficult time finding an online recommendation for a local doctor.[5][7][8] The co-founders' former colleague from PayPal and founder of MRL Ventures, Max Levchin, provided $1 million in initial funding.[5] MRL co-founder David Galbraith, who instigated the local services project based on user reviews, came up with the name "Yelp".[9] According to Fortune Magazine, Yelp's initial email-based system was "convoluted".[5] The idea was rejected by investors and did not attract users beyond the cofounders' friends and family.[10] Usage data showed that users were not answering requests for referrals, but were using the "Real Reviews" feature, which allowed them to write reviews unsolicited.[5]
According to the San Francisco Chronicle, "the site's popularity soared" after it was re-designed in late 2005.[11] Yelp raised $5 million in funding in 2005 from Bessemer Ventures and $10 million in November 2006 from Benchmark Capital.[5] The number of reviewers on the site grew from 12,000 in 2005, to 100,000 in 2006.[10] By the summer of 2006, the site had one million monthly visitors.[10] It raised $15 million in funding from DAG Ventures in February 2008.[12][13] In 2010, Elevation Partners invested $100 million; $75 million was spent on purchasing equity from employees and investors, while $25 million was invested in sales staff and expansion.[14] Yelp grew from six million monthly visitors in 2007 to 16.5 million in 2008 and from 12 to 24 cities during the same time period. By 2009, the site had 4.5 million reviews.[15] By 2010, Yelp's revenues were estimated to be $30 million and it employed 300 people.[10]
Private company (2009–2012)[edit]
Yelp introduced a site for the United Kingdom in January 2009[16] and one for Canada that August.[15] The first non-English Yelp site was introduced in France in 2010; users had the option to read and write content in French or English.[17] From 2010 to 2011, Yelp launched several more sites, in Austria, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands. International website traffic doubled during the same time period.[18] An Australian website went live in November 2011.[4] It was supported through a partnership with Telstra, which provided one million initial business listings,[19] and was initially glitchy.[20] Yelp had a presence in 20 countries by the end of 2012, including Turkey[21] and Denmark.[22] Yelp's first site in Asia was introduced in September 2012 in Singapore,[6] which was followed by Japan in 2014.[23]
In December 2009, Google entered into negotiations with Yelp to acquire the company,[24][25] but the two parties failed to reach an agreement.[26][27] According to The New York Times, Google offered more than $500 million, but the deal fell through after Yahoo offered $1 billion.[28] Tech Crunch reported that Google refused to match Yahoo's offer. Both offers were later abandoned following a disagreement between Yelp's management and board of directors about the offers.[29] In June 2015, Yelp published a study alleging Google was altering search results to benefit its own online services.[30][31]
Yelp began a service called Yelp Deals in April 2011,[32] but by August it cut back on Deals due to increased competition and market saturation.[33] That September, the Federal Trade Commission investigated Yelp's allegations that Google was using Yelp web content without authorization and that Google's search engine algorithms favored Google Places over similar services provided by Yelp.[34][35] In a January 2014 agreement, Google was not subject to anti-trust litigation from the FTC, but did have to allow services like Yelp the ability to opt out of having their data scraped and used on Google's websites.[36]
Public entity (2012–present)[edit]




The 140 New Montgomery building in San Francisco, home of Yelp's headquarters


Having filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with the Securities Exchange Commission in November 2011,[37][38] Yelp's stock began public trading on the New York Stock Exchange on March 2, 2012. At a share price of $15, the company was valued at $898 million.[39][40] In 2012, Yelp agreed to acquire its largest European rival, Qype, for $50 million.[6] The following year, CEO Jeremy Stoppelman reduced his salary to $1.[41] Yelp acquired the start-up online reservation company SeatMe for $12.7 million in cash and company stock in 2013.[42][43][44] Yelp's second quarter 2013 revenue of $55 million "exceeded expectations", but the company was not yet profitable.[45]
In 2012/13, Yelp moved into its new corporate headquarters, occupying nearly 150,000 square feet on 12 floors of 140 New Montgomery (the former PacBell building) in San Francisco.[46]
The company was profitable for the first time in the second quarter of 2014, as a result of increasing ad spending by business owners and possibly from changes in Google's local search algorithm.[47] It is dubbed as Google Pigeon, which helped authoritative local directory sites like Yelp and TripAdvisor, in getting more visibility.[48] Over the course of the year, Yelp websites were launched in Mexico, Japan and Argentina.[49] Also in 2014, Yelp expanded in Europe through the acquisitions of German-based restaurant review site Restaurant-Kritik and French-based CityVox.[50][51]
In early February 2015 Yelp announced it was buying Eat24, an online food-ordering service, for $134 million.[52][53]
In late 2015, a "Public Services & Government" section was introduced to Yelp and the General Services Administration began encouraging government agencies to create and monitor official government pages.[54] For example, the Transportation Security Administration created official TSA Yelp pages.[55][56] Later that year Yelp began experimenting in San Francisco with consumer alerts that were added to pages about restaurants with poor hygiene scores in government inspections.[57] Research conducted by the Boston Children's Hospital found that Yelp reviews with keywords associated with food poisoning correlates strongly with poor hygiene at the restaurant. Researchers at Columbia University used data from Yelp to identify three previously unreported restaurant-related food poisoning outbreaks.[58]
In 2016, Yelp invested in Nowait, an app that allows users to see how long they would have to wait at a restaurant that does not accept reservations, as well as put their names on the waitlist without being physically present at a restaurant. When their table is ready, users get a text message. Customers can also text back to say they’re running late, and restaurants can decide whether or not to hold the table for them.[59]
On November 2, 2016, concurrent with its earnings report for Q3 2016, Yelp announced it would drastically scale back its operations outside North America and halt international expansion. This resulted in the termination of essentially all international employees across Yelp's 30+ international markets from the sales, marketing, public relations, business outreach, and government relations departments. Overseas employees now primarily consist of engineering and product management staff. Yelp claims these layoffs affected only 175 individuals, or 4 percent of its total workforce.[60]
In April, 2017, Yelp announced that it had acquired Wi-Fi marketing company Turnstyle Analytics for $20 million.[61]

Yelp's website, Yelp.com, is a crowd-sourced local business review and social networking site.[5] Its user community is primarily active in major metropolitan areas.[10] The site has pages devoted to individual locations, such as restaurants or schools, where Yelp users can submit a review of their products or services[65] using a one to five star rating system.[10] Businesses can also update contact information, hours and other basic listing information or add special deals.[10][15] In addition to writing reviews, users can react to reviews, plan events or discuss their personal lives.[5] According to Sterling Market Intelligence, Yelp is "one of the most important sites on the Internet."[22] As of Q2 2016 it has 168 million monthly unique visitors and 108 million reviews.[66]
78 percent of businesses listed on the site have a rating of three stars or better,[67] but some negative reviews are very personal or extreme.[10] Many reviews are written in an entertaining or creative manner.[11] Users can give a review a "thumbs-up" if it is "useful, funny or cool."[68] Each day a "Review of the Day" is determined based on a vote by users.[69]
As of June 2016, 72 percent of Yelp searches are done from a mobile device.[67] The Yelp iPhone app was introduced in December 2008.[70] In August 2009, Yelp released an update to the iPhone app with a hidden Easter Egg augmented reality feature called Monocle, which allowed users looking through their iPhone camera to see Yelp data on businesses seen through the camera.[71] Check-in features were added in 2010.[72][73]
Yelp users can make restaurant reservations in Yelp through Yelp Reservations, a feature originally added in June 2010.[74][75] Yelp's reservation features were initially done through a 2010 partnership with OpenTable,[76] but Yelp became increasingly competitive with OpenTable after Yelp's 2013 acquisition of SeatMe, resulting in the end of the partnership in April 2015.[77] SeatMe was reworked into the current "Yelp Reservations" feature.[78] In 2013, features to have food ordered and delivered were added to Yelp[79] as well as the ability to view hygiene inspection scores[80] and make appointments at spas.[81] Yelp's content was integrated into the mapping and directions app of Apple's September 2012 release of iOS 6.[82] Yelp also has features for finding local businesses offering special deals to Yelp users.[83]
In March 2014, Yelp added features for ordering and scheduling manicures, flowers, golf and legal consultations, among other things, through Yelp.[84] In October 2014, the company, working in collaboration with hotel search site Hipmunk, added features to book hotels through Yelp.[81]
On February 14, 2017, Yelp launched a Yelp Questions and Answers, new feature that allows the users to ask venue specific questions related to businesses.[85] It allows users to upvote and downvote the answers on the basis of helpfulness.[86]
Features for businesses[edit]
Yelp added the ability for business owners to respond to reviews in 2008.[10][87] Businesses can respond privately by messaging the reviewer or publicly on their profile page. In some cases, Yelp users that had a bad experience have updated their reviews more favorably due to the businesses' efforts to make it right. In other cases disputes between reviewers and business owners have led to harassment and physical altercations.[10] The system has led to criticisms that business owners can bribe reviewers with free food or discounts to increase their rating, though Yelp users say this rarely occurs.[69] A business owner can "claim" a profile, which allows them to respond to reviews and see traffic reports.[10] Businesses can also offer discounts to Yelp users that visit often using the "check in" feature.[72][73] In 2014, Yelp released an app for business owners to respond to reviews and manage their profiles from a mobile device.[88] Business owners can also flag a review to be removed, if the review violates Yelp's content guidelines.[89]
Yelp's revenues primarily come from selling ads and sponsored listings to small businesses.[8][10] Advertisers can pay to have their listing appear at the top of search results, or feature ads on the pages of their competitors.[10][15][87] As of 2016, advertising revenue was growing at a rate of 30% year over year.[90] Yelp will only allow businesses with at least a three-star rating to sign up for advertising.[11] Originally a sponsored "favorite review" could place a positive review above negative ones,[10] but Yelp stopped offering this option in 2010 in an effort to deter misconceptions that advertisers were able to marginalize negative reviews for pay.[91][92]
Relationship with businesses[edit]
A Harvard Business School study published in 2011 found that each "star" in a Yelp rating affected the business owner's sales by 5–9 percent.[93][94] A 2012 study by two Berkeley economists found that an increase from 3.5 to 4 stars on Yelp resulted in a 19 percent increase in the chances of the restaurant being booked during peak hours.[95] A 2014 survey of 300 small business owners done by Yodle found that 78 percent were concerned about negative reviews. Also, 43 percent of respondents said they felt online reviews were unfair, because there is no verification that the review is written by a legitimate customer.[94]
Astroturfing[edit]
As Yelp became more influential, the practice of fake reviews written by competitors or business owners became more prevalent.[68] A study from Harvard professor Michael Luca analyzed 316,415 reviews in Boston and found that fake reviews rose from 6% of the site's reviews in 2006 to 20% in 2014.[93] Yelp's own review filter identifies 25% of reviews as suspicious.[96]
Yelp has a proprietary algorithm that attempts to evaluate whether a review is authentic and filters out reviews that it believes are not based on a patron's actual personal experiences, as required by the site's Terms of Use.[10][97] The review filter was first developed two weeks after the site was founded and the company saw their "first obviously fake reviews."[96] Filtered reviews are moved into a special area and not counted towards the businesses' star-rating.[96] The filter sometimes filters legitimate reviews, leading to complaints from business owners.[68] New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman said Yelp has "the most aggressive" astroturfing filter out of the crowd-sourced websites it looked into.[96] Yelp has also been criticized for not disclosing how the filter works,[96] which it says would reveal information on how to outsmart it.[10]
Yelp also conducts "sting operations" to uncover businesses writing their own reviews.[98] In October 2012, Yelp placed a 90-day "consumer alert" on 150 business listings believed to have paid for reviews. The alert read "We caught someone red-handed trying to buy reviews for this business".[99][100][101] In June 2013, Yelp filed a lawsuit against BuyYelpReview/AdBlaze for allegedly writing fake reviews for pay.[102][103] In 2013 Yelp sued a lawyer it alleged was part of a group of law firms that exchanged Yelp reviews, saying that many of the firm's reviews originated from their own office. The lawyer said Yelp was trying to get revenge for his own legal disputes and activism against Yelp.[3] An effort to win dismissal of the case was denied in December 2014.[104] In September 2013, Yelp cooperated with Operation Clean Turf, a sting operation by the New York Attorney General that uncovered 19 astroturfing operations.[96] In April 2017, a Norfolk, Massachusetts jury awarded a jewelry store over $34,000 after it determined that its competitor's employee had filed a false negative Yelp review that knowingly caused emotional distress.[105]
Alleged manipulation by Yelp[edit]
According to BusinessWeek, Yelp has "always had a complicated relationship with small businesses."[3] Throughout much of Yelp's history there have been allegations that Yelp has manipulated their website's reviews based on participation in its advertising programs.[106] Many business owners say Yelp salespeople offered to remove or suppress negative reviews if they purchase advertising.[68] Others report seeing negative reviews featured prominently and positive reviews buried; soon after, they would receive calls from Yelp attempting to sell paid advertising.[107] Yelp says its sales staff do not have the ability to modify reviews and that changes in the reviews are caused by its automated filter.[65][108]
Several lawsuits have been filed against Yelp accusing it of extorting businesses into buying advertising products. Each have been dismissed by a judge before reaching trial.[68] In early 2010, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Yelp alleging it asked a Long Beach veterinary hospital to pay $300 a month for advertising services that included the suppression or deletion of disparaging customer reviews.[109] The following month, nine additional businesses joined the class-action lawsuit,[110] and two similar lawsuits were filed.[111] That May the lawsuits were combined into one class-action lawsuit,[112] which was dismissed by San Francisco U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in 2011. Chen said the reviews were protected by the Communications Decency Act of 1996 and that there was no evidence of manipulation by Yelp.[113] The plaintiffs filed an appeal.[114] In September 2014 the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal, finding that even if Yelp did manipulate reviews to favor advertisers, this would not fall under the court's legal definition of extortion.[115][116][117]
In August 2013, Yelp launched a series of town hall style meetings in 22 major American cities in an effort to address concerns among local business owners. Many attendees expressed frustrations with Yelp's automated filter removing positive reviews after they decline to advertise, receiving reviews from users that never entered the establishment, and other issues.[114][118] A 2011 Harvard study by Michael Luca found that there was no significant statistical correlation between being a Yelp advertiser and having more favorable reviews.[94][119] The Federal Trade Commission received 2,046 complaints about Yelp from 2008 to 2014,[94] most from small businesses regarding allegedly unfair or fake reviews or negative reviews that appear after declining to advertise.[120] According to Yelp, the Federal Trade Commission finished a second examination of Yelp's practices in 2015 and in both cases did not pursue an action against the company.[121][122]
Journalist David Lazarus of the Los Angeles Times also criticized Yelp in 2014 for the practice of selling competitors' ads to run on top of business listings and then offering to have the ads removed as part of a paid feature.[123]
In 2015, San Francisco filmmaker Kaylie Milliken was reportedly producing a documentary film titled Billion Dollar Bully about Yelp's alleged business practices.[124]
Community[edit]
According to Inc. Magazine most reviewers (sometimes called "Yelpers"[11]) are "well-intentioned" and write reviews in order to express themselves, improve their writing, or be creative. In some cases, they write reviews in order to lash out at corporate interests or businesses they dislike.[10] Reviewers may also be motivated by badges and honors, such as being the first to review a new location,[11] or by praise and attention from other users.[87] Many reviews are written in an entertaining or creative manner.[11] Some users post reviews as a matter of protest or support of the business's political views; Yelp attempts to filter these.[125] Users can give a review a "thumbs-up" if it is "useful, funny or cool."[68] Each day a "Review of the Day" is determined based on a vote by users.[69] According to The Discourse of Online Consumer Reviews many Yelp reviewers are internet-savvy adults aged 18–25 or "suburban baby boomers".[126]
Reviewers are encouraged to use real names and photos.[126] Each year members of the Yelp community are invited or self-nominated to the "Yelp Elite Squad" and some are accepted based on an evaluation of their reviews.[127][128] Users must also use their real name and photo on Yelp to qualify for the Elite Squad.[69] They are governed by a council and estimated to have several thousand members. Yelp does not disclose how the Yelp Elite are selected.[11][127] Elite Squad members are given different color badges based on how long they've been an elite member.[128] The Yelp Elite Squad originated with parties Yelp began throwing for members in 2005,[128] and in 2006 it was formally codified;[127] the name came from a joking reference to prolific reviewers that were invited to Yelp parties as the "Yelp Elite Squad."[5][10] Members are invited to special opening parties, given gifts, and receive other perks.[5][128] Businesses host parties for the Yelp Elite as a way of getting reviews.[10][127] As of 2011, there were 60 local Elite Squads, most in North America and Europe.[127]
Yelp receives about six subpoenas a month asking for the names of anonymous reviewers, mostly from business owners seeking litigation against those writing negative reviews.[94] In 2012 the Alexandria Circuit Court and the Virginia Court of Appeals[129] held Yelp in contempt for refusing to disclose the identities of seven reviewers that anonymously criticized a carpet-cleaning business; in 2014 Yelp appealed to the Virginia Supreme Court.[120][130] Six internet companies and the Electronic Frontier Foundation said a ruling against Yelp would negatively affect free speech online. The judge from an early ruling said that if the reviewers did not actually use the businesses' services, their communications would be false claims not protected by free speech laws.[131] In 2014, a California state law was enacted that prohibits businesses from using "disparagement clauses" in their contracts or terms of use that allow them to sue or fine customers that write negatively about them online.[132][133]
As of 2010, Yelp employed a staff of 40 community managers that organize parties for prolific reviewers, send encouraging messages to reviewers and host classes for small business owners.[10] Yelp reviewers are not required to disclose their identity, but Yelp encourages them to do so.[5] After leaving a negative review a user may say "you've been Yelped",[69] while businesses with positive reviews advertise with "People Love us on Yelp!".[10]

Yelp is an American multinational corporation headquartered in San Francisco, California. It develops, hosts and markets Yelp.com and the Yelp mobile app, which publish crowd-sourced reviews about local businesses, as well as the online reservation service Yelp Reservations and online food-delivery service Eat24. The company also trains small businesses in how to respond to reviews, hosts social events for reviewers, and provides data about businesses, including health inspection scores.
Yelp was founded in 2004 by former PayPal employees Russel Simmons and Jeremy Stoppelman. Yelp grew quickly and raised several rounds of funding. By 2010 it had $30 million in revenues and the website had published more than 4.5 million crowd-sourced reviews. From 2009 to 2012, Yelp expanded throughout Europe and Asia. In 2009 it entered several negotiations with Google for a potential acquisition. Yelp became a public company in March 2012 and became profitable for the first time two years later. As of 2016, Yelp.com has 135 million monthly visitors and 95 million reviews. The company's revenues come from businesses advertising.
According to BusinessWeek, Yelp has a complicated relationship with small businesses.[3] Criticism of Yelp focuses on the legitimacy of reviews, public statements of Yelp manipulating and blocking reviews in order to increase ad spending, as well as concerns regarding the privacy of reviewers.

Company history (2004–2016)[edit]
Origins (2004–2009)[edit]




Jeremy Stoppelman, co-founder and CEO of Yelp


Two former PayPal employees, Jeremy Stoppelman and Russel Simmons, founded Yelp at a business incubator, MRL Ventures, in 2004.[4][5] Stoppelman and Simmons conceived the initial idea for Yelp as an email-based referral network, after Stoppelman caught the flu[6] and had a difficult time finding an online recommendation for a local doctor.[5][7][8] The co-founders' former colleague from PayPal and founder of MRL Ventures, Max Levchin, provided $1 million in initial funding.[5] MRL co-founder David Galbraith, who instigated the local services project based on user reviews, came up with the name "Yelp".[9] According to Fortune Magazine, Yelp's initial email-based system was "convoluted".[5] The idea was rejected by investors and did not attract users beyond the cofounders' friends and family.[10] Usage data showed that users were not answering requests for referrals, but were using the "Real Reviews" feature, which allowed them to write reviews unsolicited.[5]
According to the San Francisco Chronicle, "the site's popularity soared" after it was re-designed in late 2005.[11] Yelp raised $5 million in funding in 2005 from Bessemer Ventures and $10 million in November 2006 from Benchmark Capital.[5] The number of reviewers on the site grew from 12,000 in 2005, to 100,000 in 2006.[10] By the summer of 2006, the site had one million monthly visitors.[10] It raised $15 million in funding from DAG Ventures in February 2008.[12][13] In 2010, Elevation Partners invested $100 million; $75 million was spent on purchasing equity from employees and investors, while $25 million was invested in sales staff and expansion.[14] Yelp grew from six million monthly visitors in 2007 to 16.5 million in 2008 and from 12 to 24 cities during the same time period. By 2009, the site had 4.5 million reviews.[15] By 2010, Yelp's revenues were estimated to be $30 million and it employed 300 people.[10]
Private company (2009–2012)[edit]
Yelp introduced a site for the United Kingdom in January 2009[16] and one for Canada that August.[15] The first non-English Yelp site was introduced in France in 2010; users had the option to read and write content in French or English.[17] From 2010 to 2011, Yelp launched several more sites, in Austria, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands. International website traffic doubled during the same time period.[18] An Australian website went live in November 2011.[4] It was supported through a partnership with Telstra, which provided one million initial business listings,[19] and was initially glitchy.[20] Yelp had a presence in 20 countries by the end of 2012, including Turkey[21] and Denmark.[22] Yelp's first site in Asia was introduced in September 2012 in Singapore,[6] which was followed by Japan in 2014.[23]
In December 2009, Google entered into negotiations with Yelp to acquire the company,[24][25] but the two parties failed to reach an agreement.[26][27] According to The New York Times, Google offered more than $500 million, but the deal fell through after Yahoo offered $1 billion.[28] Tech Crunch reported that Google refused to match Yahoo's offer. Both offers were later abandoned following a disagreement between Yelp's management and board of directors about the offers.[29] In June 2015, Yelp published a study alleging Google was altering search results to benefit its own online services.[30][31]
Yelp began a service called Yelp Deals in April 2011,[32] but by August it cut back on Deals due to increased competition and market saturation.[33] That September, the Federal Trade Commission investigated Yelp's allegations that Google was using Yelp web content without authorization and that Google's search engine algorithms favored Google Places over similar services provided by Yelp.[34][35] In a January 2014 agreement, Google was not subject to anti-trust litigation from the FTC, but did have to allow services like Yelp the ability to opt out of having their data scraped and used on Google's websites.[36]
Public entity (2012–present)[edit]




The 140 New Montgomery building in San Francisco, home of Yelp's headquarters


Having filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with the Securities Exchange Commission in November 2011,[37][38] Yelp's stock began public trading on the New York Stock Exchange on March 2, 2012. At a share price of $15, the company was valued at $898 million.[39][40] In 2012, Yelp agreed to acquire its largest European rival, Qype, for $50 million.[6] The following year, CEO Jeremy Stoppelman reduced his salary to $1.[41] Yelp acquired the start-up online reservation company SeatMe for $12.7 million in cash and company stock in 2013.[42][43][44] Yelp's second quarter 2013 revenue of $55 million "exceeded expectations", but the company was not yet profitable.[45]
In 2012/13, Yelp moved into its new corporate headquarters, occupying nearly 150,000 square feet on 12 floors of 140 New Montgomery (the former PacBell building) in San Francisco.[46]
The company was profitable for the first time in the second quarter of 2014, as a result of increasing ad spending by business owners and possibly from changes in Google's local search algorithm.[47] It is dubbed as Google Pigeon, which helped authoritative local directory sites like Yelp and TripAdvisor, in getting more visibility.[48] Over the course of the year, Yelp websites were launched in Mexico, Japan and Argentina.[49] Also in 2014, Yelp expanded in Europe through the acquisitions of German-based restaurant review site Restaurant-Kritik and French-based CityVox.[50][51]
In early February 2015 Yelp announced it was buying Eat24, an online food-ordering service, for $134 million.[52][53]
In late 2015, a "Public Services & Government" section was introduced to Yelp and the General Services Administration began encouraging government agencies to create and monitor official government pages.[54] For example, the Transportation Security Administration created official TSA Yelp pages.[55][56] Later that year Yelp began experimenting in San Francisco with consumer alerts that were added to pages about restaurants with poor hygiene scores in government inspections.[57] Research conducted by the Boston Children's Hospital found that Yelp reviews with keywords associated with food poisoning correlates strongly with poor hygiene at the restaurant. Researchers at Columbia University used data from Yelp to identify three previously unreported restaurant-related food poisoning outbreaks.[58]
In 2016, Yelp invested in Nowait, an app that allows users to see how long they would have to wait at a restaurant that does not accept reservations, as well as put their names on the waitlist without being physically present at a restaurant. When their table is ready, users get a text message. Customers can also text back to say they’re running late, and restaurants can decide whether or not to hold the table for them.[59]
On November 2, 2016, concurrent with its earnings report for Q3 2016, Yelp announced it would drastically scale back its operations outside North America and halt international expansion. This resulted in the termination of essentially all international employees across Yelp's 30+ international markets from the sales, marketing, public relations, business outreach, and government relations departments. Overseas employees now primarily consist of engineering and product management staff. Yelp claims these layoffs affected only 175 individuals, or 4 percent of its total workforce.[60]
In April, 2017, Yelp announced that it had acquired Wi-Fi marketing company Turnstyle Analytics for $20 million.[61]

Yelp's website, Yelp.com, is a crowd-sourced local business review and social networking site.[5] Its user community is primarily active in major metropolitan areas.[10] The site has pages devoted to individual locations, such as restaurants or schools, where Yelp users can submit a review of their products or services[65] using a one to five star rating system.[10] Businesses can also update contact information, hours and other basic listing information or add special deals.[10][15] In addition to writing reviews, users can react to reviews, plan events or discuss their personal lives.[5] According to Sterling Market Intelligence, Yelp is "one of the most important sites on the Internet."[22] As of Q2 2016 it has 168 million monthly unique visitors and 108 million reviews.[66]
78 percent of businesses listed on the site have a rating of three stars or better,[67] but some negative reviews are very personal or extreme.[10] Many reviews are written in an entertaining or creative manner.[11] Users can give a review a "thumbs-up" if it is "useful, funny or cool."[68] Each day a "Review of the Day" is determined based on a vote by users.[69]
As of June 2016, 72 percent of Yelp searches are done from a mobile device.[67] The Yelp iPhone app was introduced in December 2008.[70] In August 2009, Yelp released an update to the iPhone app with a hidden Easter Egg augmented reality feature called Monocle, which allowed users looking through their iPhone camera to see Yelp data on businesses seen through the camera.[71] Check-in features were added in 2010.[72][73]
Yelp users can make restaurant reservations in Yelp through Yelp Reservations, a feature originally added in June 2010.[74][75] Yelp's reservation features were initially done through a 2010 partnership with OpenTable,[76] but Yelp became increasingly competitive with OpenTable after Yelp's 2013 acquisition of SeatMe, resulting in the end of the partnership in April 2015.[77] SeatMe was reworked into the current "Yelp Reservations" feature.[78] In 2013, features to have food ordered and delivered were added to Yelp[79] as well as the ability to view hygiene inspection scores[80] and make appointments at spas.[81] Yelp's content was integrated into the mapping and directions app of Apple's September 2012 release of iOS 6.[82] Yelp also has features for finding local businesses offering special deals to Yelp users.[83]
In March 2014, Yelp added features for ordering and scheduling manicures, flowers, golf and legal consultations, among other things, through Yelp.[84] In October 2014, the company, working in collaboration with hotel search site Hipmunk, added features to book hotels through Yelp.[81]
On February 14, 2017, Yelp launched a Yelp Questions and Answers, new feature that allows the users to ask venue specific questions related to businesses.[85] It allows users to upvote and downvote the answers on the basis of helpfulness.[86]
Features for businesses[edit]
Yelp added the ability for business owners to respond to reviews in 2008.[10][87] Businesses can respond privately by messaging the reviewer or publicly on their profile page. In some cases, Yelp users that had a bad experience have updated their reviews more favorably due to the businesses' efforts to make it right. In other cases disputes between reviewers and business owners have led to harassment and physical altercations.[10] The system has led to criticisms that business owners can bribe reviewers with free food or discounts to increase their rating, though Yelp users say this rarely occurs.[69] A business owner can "claim" a profile, which allows them to respond to reviews and see traffic reports.[10] Businesses can also offer discounts to Yelp users that visit often using the "check in" feature.[72][73] In 2014, Yelp released an app for business owners to respond to reviews and manage their profiles from a mobile device.[88] Business owners can also flag a review to be removed, if the review violates Yelp's content guidelines.[89]
Yelp's revenues primarily come from selling ads and sponsored listings to small businesses.[8][10] Advertisers can pay to have their listing appear at the top of search results, or feature ads on the pages of their competitors.[10][15][87] As of 2016, advertising revenue was growing at a rate of 30% year over year.[90] Yelp will only allow businesses with at least a three-star rating to sign up for advertising.[11] Originally a sponsored "favorite review" could place a positive review above negative ones,[10] but Yelp stopped offering this option in 2010 in an effort to deter misconceptions that advertisers were able to marginalize negative reviews for pay.[91][92]
Relationship with businesses[edit]
A Harvard Business School study published in 2011 found that each "star" in a Yelp rating affected the business owner's sales by 5–9 percent.[93][94] A 2012 study by two Berkeley economists found that an increase from 3.5 to 4 stars on Yelp resulted in a 19 percent increase in the chances of the restaurant being booked during peak hours.[95] A 2014 survey of 300 small business owners done by Yodle found that 78 percent were concerned about negative reviews. Also, 43 percent of respondents said they felt online reviews were unfair, because there is no verification that the review is written by a legitimate customer.[94]
Astroturfing[edit]
As Yelp became more influential, the practice of fake reviews written by competitors or business owners became more prevalent.[68] A study from Harvard professor Michael Luca analyzed 316,415 reviews in Boston and found that fake reviews rose from 6% of the site's reviews in 2006 to 20% in 2014.[93] Yelp's own review filter identifies 25% of reviews as suspicious.[96]
Yelp has a proprietary algorithm that attempts to evaluate whether a review is authentic and filters out reviews that it believes are not based on a patron's actual personal experiences, as required by the site's Terms of Use.[10][97] The review filter was first developed two weeks after the site was founded and the company saw their "first obviously fake reviews."[96] Filtered reviews are moved into a special area and not counted towards the businesses' star-rating.[96] The filter sometimes filters legitimate reviews, leading to complaints from business owners.[68] New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman said Yelp has "the most aggressive" astroturfing filter out of the crowd-sourced websites it looked into.[96] Yelp has also been criticized for not disclosing how the filter works,[96] which it says would reveal information on how to outsmart it.[10]
Yelp also conducts "sting operations" to uncover businesses writing their own reviews.[98] In October 2012, Yelp placed a 90-day "consumer alert" on 150 business listings believed to have paid for reviews. The alert read "We caught someone red-handed trying to buy reviews for this business".[99][100][101] In June 2013, Yelp filed a lawsuit against BuyYelpReview/AdBlaze for allegedly writing fake reviews for pay.[102][103] In 2013 Yelp sued a lawyer it alleged was part of a group of law firms that exchanged Yelp reviews, saying that many of the firm's reviews originated from their own office. The lawyer said Yelp was trying to get revenge for his own legal disputes and activism against Yelp.[3] An effort to win dismissal of the case was denied in December 2014.[104] In September 2013, Yelp cooperated with Operation Clean Turf, a sting operation by the New York Attorney General that uncovered 19 astroturfing operations.[96] In April 2017, a Norfolk, Massachusetts jury awarded a jewelry store over $34,000 after it determined that its competitor's employee had filed a false negative Yelp review that knowingly caused emotional distress.[105]
Alleged manipulation by Yelp[edit]
According to BusinessWeek, Yelp has "always had a complicated relationship with small businesses."[3] Throughout much of Yelp's history there have been allegations that Yelp has manipulated their website's reviews based on participation in its advertising programs.[106] Many business owners say Yelp salespeople offered to remove or suppress negative reviews if they purchase advertising.[68] Others report seeing negative reviews featured prominently and positive reviews buried; soon after, they would receive calls from Yelp attempting to sell paid advertising.[107] Yelp says its sales staff do not have the ability to modify reviews and that changes in the reviews are caused by its automated filter.[65][108]
Several lawsuits have been filed against Yelp accusing it of extorting businesses into buying advertising products. Each have been dismissed by a judge before reaching trial.[68] In early 2010, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Yelp alleging it asked a Long Beach veterinary hospital to pay $300 a month for advertising services that included the suppression or deletion of disparaging customer reviews.[109] The following month, nine additional businesses joined the class-action lawsuit,[110] and two similar lawsuits were filed.[111] That May the lawsuits were combined into one class-action lawsuit,[112] which was dismissed by San Francisco U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in 2011. Chen said the reviews were protected by the Communications Decency Act of 1996 and that there was no evidence of manipulation by Yelp.[113] The plaintiffs filed an appeal.[114] In September 2014 the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal, finding that even if Yelp did manipulate reviews to favor advertisers, this would not fall under the court's legal definition of extortion.[115][116][117]
In August 2013, Yelp launched a series of town hall style meetings in 22 major American cities in an effort to address concerns among local business owners. Many attendees expressed frustrations with Yelp's automated filter removing positive reviews after they decline to advertise, receiving reviews from users that never entered the establishment, and other issues.[114][118] A 2011 Harvard study by Michael Luca found that there was no significant statistical correlation between being a Yelp advertiser and having more favorable reviews.[94][119] The Federal Trade Commission received 2,046 complaints about Yelp from 2008 to 2014,[94] most from small businesses regarding allegedly unfair or fake reviews or negative reviews that appear after declining to advertise.[120] According to Yelp, the Federal Trade Commission finished a second examination of Yelp's practices in 2015 and in both cases did not pursue an action against the company.[121][122]
Journalist David Lazarus of the Los Angeles Times also criticized Yelp in 2014 for the practice of selling competitors' ads to run on top of business listings and then offering to have the ads removed as part of a paid feature.[123]
In 2015, San Francisco filmmaker Kaylie Milliken was reportedly producing a documentary film titled Billion Dollar Bully about Yelp's alleged business practices.[124]
Community[edit]
According to Inc. Magazine most reviewers (sometimes called "Yelpers"[11]) are "well-intentioned" and write reviews in order to express themselves, improve their writing, or be creative. In some cases, they write reviews in order to lash out at corporate interests or businesses they dislike.[10] Reviewers may also be motivated by badges and honors, such as being the first to review a new location,[11] or by praise and attention from other users.[87] Many reviews are written in an entertaining or creative manner.[11] Some users post reviews as a matter of protest or support of the business's political views; Yelp attempts to filter these.[125] Users can give a review a "thumbs-up" if it is "useful, funny or cool."[68] Each day a "Review of the Day" is determined based on a vote by users.[69] According to The Discourse of Online Consumer Reviews many Yelp reviewers are internet-savvy adults aged 18–25 or "suburban baby boomers".[126]
Reviewers are encouraged to use real names and photos.[126] Each year members of the Yelp community are invited or self-nominated to the "Yelp Elite Squad" and some are accepted based on an evaluation of their reviews.[127][128] Users must also use their real name and photo on Yelp to qualify for the Elite Squad.[69] They are governed by a council and estimated to have several thousand members. Yelp does not disclose how the Yelp Elite are selected.[11][127] Elite Squad members are given different color badges based on how long they've been an elite member.[128] The Yelp Elite Squad originated with parties Yelp began throwing for members in 2005,[128] and in 2006 it was formally codified;[127] the name came from a joking reference to prolific reviewers that were invited to Yelp parties as the "Yelp Elite Squad."[5][10] Members are invited to special opening parties, given gifts, and receive other perks.[5][128] Businesses host parties for the Yelp Elite as a way of getting reviews.[10][127] As of 2011, there were 60 local Elite Squads, most in North America and Europe.[127]
Yelp receives about six subpoenas a month asking for the names of anonymous reviewers, mostly from business owners seeking litigation against those writing negative reviews.[94] In 2012 the Alexandria Circuit Court and the Virginia Court of Appeals[129] held Yelp in contempt for refusing to disclose the identities of seven reviewers that anonymously criticized a carpet-cleaning business; in 2014 Yelp appealed to the Virginia Supreme Court.[120][130] Six internet companies and the Electronic Frontier Foundation said a ruling against Yelp would negatively affect free speech online. The judge from an early ruling said that if the reviewers did not actually use the businesses' services, their communications would be false claims not protected by free speech laws.[131] In 2014, a California state law was enacted that prohibits businesses from using "disparagement clauses" in their contracts or terms of use that allow them to sue or fine customers that write negatively about them online.[132][133]
As of 2010, Yelp employed a staff of 40 community managers that organize parties for prolific reviewers, send encouraging messages to reviewers and host classes for small business owners.[10] Yelp reviewers are not required to disclose their identity, but Yelp encourages them to do so.[5] After leaving a negative review a user may say "you've been Yelped",[69] while businesses with positive reviews advertise with "People Love us on Yelp!".[10]

Yelp is an American multinational corporation headquartered in San Francisco, California. It develops, hosts and markets Yelp.com and the Yelp mobile app, which publish crowd-sourced reviews about local businesses, as well as the online reservation service Yelp Reservations and online food-delivery service Eat24. The company also trains small businesses in how to respond to reviews, hosts social events for reviewers, and provides data about businesses, including health inspection scores.
Yelp was founded in 2004 by former PayPal employees Russel Simmons and Jeremy Stoppelman. Yelp grew quickly and raised several rounds of funding. By 2010 it had $30 million in revenues and the website had published more than 4.5 million crowd-sourced reviews. From 2009 to 2012, Yelp expanded throughout Europe and Asia. In 2009 it entered several negotiations with Google for a potential acquisition. Yelp became a public company in March 2012 and became profitable for the first time two years later. As of 2016, Yelp.com has 135 million monthly visitors and 95 million reviews. The company's revenues come from businesses advertising.
According to BusinessWeek, Yelp has a complicated relationship with small businesses.[3] Criticism of Yelp focuses on the legitimacy of reviews, public statements of Yelp manipulating and blocking reviews in order to increase ad spending, as well as concerns regarding the privacy of reviewers.

Company history (2004–2016)[edit]
Origins (2004–2009)[edit]




Jeremy Stoppelman, co-founder and CEO of Yelp


Two former PayPal employees, Jeremy Stoppelman and Russel Simmons, founded Yelp at a business incubator, MRL Ventures, in 2004.[4][5] Stoppelman and Simmons conceived the initial idea for Yelp as an email-based referral network, after Stoppelman caught the flu[6] and had a difficult time finding an online recommendation for a local doctor.[5][7][8] The co-founders' former colleague from PayPal and founder of MRL Ventures, Max Levchin, provided $1 million in initial funding.[5] MRL co-founder David Galbraith, who instigated the local services project based on user reviews, came up with the name "Yelp".[9] According to Fortune Magazine, Yelp's initial email-based system was "convoluted".[5] The idea was rejected by investors and did not attract users beyond the cofounders' friends and family.[10] Usage data showed that users were not answering requests for referrals, but were using the "Real Reviews" feature, which allowed them to write reviews unsolicited.[5]
According to the San Francisco Chronicle, "the site's popularity soared" after it was re-designed in late 2005.[11] Yelp raised $5 million in funding in 2005 from Bessemer Ventures and $10 million in November 2006 from Benchmark Capital.[5] The number of reviewers on the site grew from 12,000 in 2005, to 100,000 in 2006.[10] By the summer of 2006, the site had one million monthly visitors.[10] It raised $15 million in funding from DAG Ventures in February 2008.[12][13] In 2010, Elevation Partners invested $100 million; $75 million was spent on purchasing equity from employees and investors, while $25 million was invested in sales staff and expansion.[14] Yelp grew from six million monthly visitors in 2007 to 16.5 million in 2008 and from 12 to 24 cities during the same time period. By 2009, the site had 4.5 million reviews.[15] By 2010, Yelp's revenues were estimated to be $30 million and it employed 300 people.[10]
Private company (2009–2012)[edit]
Yelp introduced a site for the United Kingdom in January 2009[16] and one for Canada that August.[15] The first non-English Yelp site was introduced in France in 2010; users had the option to read and write content in French or English.[17] From 2010 to 2011, Yelp launched several more sites, in Austria, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands. International website traffic doubled during the same time period.[18] An Australian website went live in November 2011.[4] It was supported through a partnership with Telstra, which provided one million initial business listings,[19] and was initially glitchy.[20] Yelp had a presence in 20 countries by the end of 2012, including Turkey[21] and Denmark.[22] Yelp's first site in Asia was introduced in September 2012 in Singapore,[6] which was followed by Japan in 2014.[23]
In December 2009, Google entered into negotiations with Yelp to acquire the company,[24][25] but the two parties failed to reach an agreement.[26][27] According to The New York Times, Google offered more than $500 million, but the deal fell through after Yahoo offered $1 billion.[28] Tech Crunch reported that Google refused to match Yahoo's offer. Both offers were later abandoned following a disagreement between Yelp's management and board of directors about the offers.[29] In June 2015, Yelp published a study alleging Google was altering search results to benefit its own online services.[30][31]
Yelp began a service called Yelp Deals in April 2011,[32] but by August it cut back on Deals due to increased competition and market saturation.[33] That September, the Federal Trade Commission investigated Yelp's allegations that Google was using Yelp web content without authorization and that Google's search engine algorithms favored Google Places over similar services provided by Yelp.[34][35] In a January 2014 agreement, Google was not subject to anti-trust litigation from the FTC, but did have to allow services like Yelp the ability to opt out of having their data scraped and used on Google's websites.[36]
Public entity (2012–present)[edit]




The 140 New Montgomery building in San Francisco, home of Yelp's headquarters


Having filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with the Securities Exchange Commission in November 2011,[37][38] Yelp's stock began public trading on the New York Stock Exchange on March 2, 2012. At a share price of $15, the company was valued at $898 million.[39][40] In 2012, Yelp agreed to acquire its largest European rival, Qype, for $50 million.[6] The following year, CEO Jeremy Stoppelman reduced his salary to $1.[41] Yelp acquired the start-up online reservation company SeatMe for $12.7 million in cash and company stock in 2013.[42][43][44] Yelp's second quarter 2013 revenue of $55 million "exceeded expectations", but the company was not yet profitable.[45]
In 2012/13, Yelp moved into its new corporate headquarters, occupying nearly 150,000 square feet on 12 floors of 140 New Montgomery (the former PacBell building) in San Francisco.[46]
The company was profitable for the first time in the second quarter of 2014, as a result of increasing ad spending by business owners and possibly from changes in Google's local search algorithm.[47] It is dubbed as Google Pigeon, which helped authoritative local directory sites like Yelp and TripAdvisor, in getting more visibility.[48] Over the course of the year, Yelp websites were launched in Mexico, Japan and Argentina.[49] Also in 2014, Yelp expanded in Europe through the acquisitions of German-based restaurant review site Restaurant-Kritik and French-based CityVox.[50][51]
In early February 2015 Yelp announced it was buying Eat24, an online food-ordering service, for $134 million.[52][53]
In late 2015, a "Public Services & Government" section was introduced to Yelp and the General Services Administration began encouraging government agencies to create and monitor official government pages.[54] For example, the Transportation Security Administration created official TSA Yelp pages.[55][56] Later that year Yelp began experimenting in San Francisco with consumer alerts that were added to pages about restaurants with poor hygiene scores in government inspections.[57] Research conducted by the Boston Children's Hospital found that Yelp reviews with keywords associated with food poisoning correlates strongly with poor hygiene at the restaurant. Researchers at Columbia University used data from Yelp to identify three previously unreported restaurant-related food poisoning outbreaks.[58]
In 2016, Yelp invested in Nowait, an app that allows users to see how long they would have to wait at a restaurant that does not accept reservations, as well as put their names on the waitlist without being physically present at a restaurant. When their table is ready, users get a text message. Customers can also text back to say they’re running late, and restaurants can decide whether or not to hold the table for them.[59]
On November 2, 2016, concurrent with its earnings report for Q3 2016, Yelp announced it would drastically scale back its operations outside North America and halt international expansion. This resulted in the termination of essentially all international employees across Yelp's 30+ international markets from the sales, marketing, public relations, business outreach, and government relations departments. Overseas employees now primarily consist of engineering and product management staff. Yelp claims these layoffs affected only 175 individuals, or 4 percent of its total workforce.[60]
In April, 2017, Yelp announced that it had acquired Wi-Fi marketing company Turnstyle Analytics for $20 million.[61]

Yelp's website, Yelp.com, is a crowd-sourced local business review and social networking site.[5] Its user community is primarily active in major metropolitan areas.[10] The site has pages devoted to individual locations, such as restaurants or schools, where Yelp users can submit a review of their products or services[65] using a one to five star rating system.[10] Businesses can also update contact information, hours and other basic listing information or add special deals.[10][15] In addition to writing reviews, users can react to reviews, plan events or discuss their personal lives.[5] According to Sterling Market Intelligence, Yelp is "one of the most important sites on the Internet."[22] As of Q2 2016 it has 168 million monthly unique visitors and 108 million reviews.[66]
78 percent of businesses listed on the site have a rating of three stars or better,[67] but some negative reviews are very personal or extreme.[10] Many reviews are written in an entertaining or creative manner.[11] Users can give a review a "thumbs-up" if it is "useful, funny or cool."[68] Each day a "Review of the Day" is determined based on a vote by users.[69]
As of June 2016, 72 percent of Yelp searches are done from a mobile device.[67] The Yelp iPhone app was introduced in December 2008.[70] In August 2009, Yelp released an update to the iPhone app with a hidden Easter Egg augmented reality feature called Monocle, which allowed users looking through their iPhone camera to see Yelp data on businesses seen through the camera.[71] Check-in features were added in 2010.[72][73]
Yelp users can make restaurant reservations in Yelp through Yelp Reservations, a feature originally added in June 2010.[74][75] Yelp's reservation features were initially done through a 2010 partnership with OpenTable,[76] but Yelp became increasingly competitive with OpenTable after Yelp's 2013 acquisition of SeatMe, resulting in the end of the partnership in April 2015.[77] SeatMe was reworked into the current "Yelp Reservations" feature.[78] In 2013, features to have food ordered and delivered were added to Yelp[79] as well as the ability to view hygiene inspection scores[80] and make appointments at spas.[81] Yelp's content was integrated into the mapping and directions app of Apple's September 2012 release of iOS 6.[82] Yelp also has features for finding local businesses offering special deals to Yelp users.[83]
In March 2014, Yelp added features for ordering and scheduling manicures, flowers, golf and legal consultations, among other things, through Yelp.[84] In October 2014, the company, working in collaboration with hotel search site Hipmunk, added features to book hotels through Yelp.[81]
On February 14, 2017, Yelp launched a Yelp Questions and Answers, new feature that allows the users to ask venue specific questions related to businesses.[85] It allows users to upvote and downvote the answers on the basis of helpfulness.[86]
Features for businesses[edit]
Yelp added the ability for business owners to respond to reviews in 2008.[10][87] Businesses can respond privately by messaging the reviewer or publicly on their profile page. In some cases, Yelp users that had a bad experience have updated their reviews more favorably due to the businesses' efforts to make it right. In other cases disputes between reviewers and business owners have led to harassment and physical altercations.[10] The system has led to criticisms that business owners can bribe reviewers with free food or discounts to increase their rating, though Yelp users say this rarely occurs.[69] A business owner can "claim" a profile, which allows them to respond to reviews and see traffic reports.[10] Businesses can also offer discounts to Yelp users that visit often using the "check in" feature.[72][73] In 2014, Yelp released an app for business owners to respond to reviews and manage their profiles from a mobile device.[88] Business owners can also flag a review to be removed, if the review violates Yelp's content guidelines.[89]
Yelp's revenues primarily come from selling ads and sponsored listings to small businesses.[8][10] Advertisers can pay to have their listing appear at the top of search results, or feature ads on the pages of their competitors.[10][15][87] As of 2016, advertising revenue was growing at a rate of 30% year over year.[90] Yelp will only allow businesses with at least a three-star rating to sign up for advertising.[11] Originally a sponsored "favorite review" could place a positive review above negative ones,[10] but Yelp stopped offering this option in 2010 in an effort to deter misconceptions that advertisers were able to marginalize negative reviews for pay.[91][92]
Relationship with businesses[edit]
A Harvard Business School study published in 2011 found that each "star" in a Yelp rating affected the business owner's sales by 5–9 percent.[93][94] A 2012 study by two Berkeley economists found that an increase from 3.5 to 4 stars on Yelp resulted in a 19 percent increase in the chances of the restaurant being booked during peak hours.[95] A 2014 survey of 300 small business owners done by Yodle found that 78 percent were concerned about negative reviews. Also, 43 percent of respondents said they felt online reviews were unfair, because there is no verification that the review is written by a legitimate customer.[94]
Astroturfing[edit]
As Yelp became more influential, the practice of fake reviews written by competitors or business owners became more prevalent.[68] A study from Harvard professor Michael Luca analyzed 316,415 reviews in Boston and found that fake reviews rose from 6% of the site's reviews in 2006 to 20% in 2014.[93] Yelp's own review filter identifies 25% of reviews as suspicious.[96]
Yelp has a proprietary algorithm that attempts to evaluate whether a review is authentic and filters out reviews that it believes are not based on a patron's actual personal experiences, as required by the site's Terms of Use.[10][97] The review filter was first developed two weeks after the site was founded and the company saw their "first obviously fake reviews."[96] Filtered reviews are moved into a special area and not counted towards the businesses' star-rating.[96] The filter sometimes filters legitimate reviews, leading to complaints from business owners.[68] New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman said Yelp has "the most aggressive" astroturfing filter out of the crowd-sourced websites it looked into.[96] Yelp has also been criticized for not disclosing how the filter works,[96] which it says would reveal information on how to outsmart it.[10]
Yelp also conducts "sting operations" to uncover businesses writing their own reviews.[98] In October 2012, Yelp placed a 90-day "consumer alert" on 150 business listings believed to have paid for reviews. The alert read "We caught someone red-handed trying to buy reviews for this business".[99][100][101] In June 2013, Yelp filed a lawsuit against BuyYelpReview/AdBlaze for allegedly writing fake reviews for pay.[102][103] In 2013 Yelp sued a lawyer it alleged was part of a group of law firms that exchanged Yelp reviews, saying that many of the firm's reviews originated from their own office. The lawyer said Yelp was trying to get revenge for his own legal disputes and activism against Yelp.[3] An effort to win dismissal of the case was denied in December 2014.[104] In September 2013, Yelp cooperated with Operation Clean Turf, a sting operation by the New York Attorney General that uncovered 19 astroturfing operations.[96] In April 2017, a Norfolk, Massachusetts jury awarded a jewelry store over $34,000 after it determined that its competitor's employee had filed a false negative Yelp review that knowingly caused emotional distress.[105]
Alleged manipulation by Yelp[edit]
According to BusinessWeek, Yelp has "always had a complicated relationship with small businesses."[3] Throughout much of Yelp's history there have been allegations that Yelp has manipulated their website's reviews based on participation in its advertising programs.[106] Many business owners say Yelp salespeople offered to remove or suppress negative reviews if they purchase advertising.[68] Others report seeing negative reviews featured prominently and positive reviews buried; soon after, they would receive calls from Yelp attempting to sell paid advertising.[107] Yelp says its sales staff do not have the ability to modify reviews and that changes in the reviews are caused by its automated filter.[65][108]
Several lawsuits have been filed against Yelp accusing it of extorting businesses into buying advertising products. Each have been dismissed by a judge before reaching trial.[68] In early 2010, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Yelp alleging it asked a Long Beach veterinary hospital to pay $300 a month for advertising services that included the suppression or deletion of disparaging customer reviews.[109] The following month, nine additional businesses joined the class-action lawsuit,[110] and two similar lawsuits were filed.[111] That May the lawsuits were combined into one class-action lawsuit,[112] which was dismissed by San Francisco U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in 2011. Chen said the reviews were protected by the Communications Decency Act of 1996 and that there was no evidence of manipulation by Yelp.[113] The plaintiffs filed an appeal.[114] In September 2014 the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal, finding that even if Yelp did manipulate reviews to favor advertisers, this would not fall under the court's legal definition of extortion.[115][116][117]
In August 2013, Yelp launched a series of town hall style meetings in 22 major American cities in an effort to address concerns among local business owners. Many attendees expressed frustrations with Yelp's automated filter removing positive reviews after they decline to advertise, receiving reviews from users that never entered the establishment, and other issues.[114][118] A 2011 Harvard study by Michael Luca found that there was no significant statistical correlation between being a Yelp advertiser and having more favorable reviews.[94][119] The Federal Trade Commission received 2,046 complaints about Yelp from 2008 to 2014,[94] most from small businesses regarding allegedly unfair or fake reviews or negative reviews that appear after declining to advertise.[120] According to Yelp, the Federal Trade Commission finished a second examination of Yelp's practices in 2015 and in both cases did not pursue an action against the company.[121][122]
Journalist David Lazarus of the Los Angeles Times also criticized Yelp in 2014 for the practice of selling competitors' ads to run on top of business listings and then offering to have the ads removed as part of a paid feature.[123]
In 2015, San Francisco filmmaker Kaylie Milliken was reportedly producing a documentary film titled Billion Dollar Bully about Yelp's alleged business practices.[124]
Community[edit]
According to Inc. Magazine most reviewers (sometimes called "Yelpers"[11]) are "well-intentioned" and write reviews in order to express themselves, improve their writing, or be creative. In some cases, they write reviews in order to lash out at corporate interests or businesses they dislike.[10] Reviewers may also be motivated by badges and honors, such as being the first to review a new location,[11] or by praise and attention from other users.[87] Many reviews are written in an entertaining or creative manner.[11] Some users post reviews as a matter of protest or support of the business's political views; Yelp attempts to filter these.[125] Users can give a review a "thumbs-up" if it is "useful, funny or cool."[68] Each day a "Review of the Day" is determined based on a vote by users.[69] According to The Discourse of Online Consumer Reviews many Yelp reviewers are internet-savvy adults aged 18–25 or "suburban baby boomers".[126]
Reviewers are encouraged to use real names and photos.[126] Each year members of the Yelp community are invited or self-nominated to the "Yelp Elite Squad" and some are accepted based on an evaluation of their reviews.[127][128] Users must also use their real name and photo on Yelp to qualify for the Elite Squad.[69] They are governed by a council and estimated to have several thousand members. Yelp does not disclose how the Yelp Elite are selected.[11][127] Elite Squad members are given different color badges based on how long they've been an elite member.[128] The Yelp Elite Squad originated with parties Yelp began throwing for members in 2005,[128] and in 2006 it was formally codified;[127] the name came from a joking reference to prolific reviewers that were invited to Yelp parties as the "Yelp Elite Squad."[5][10] Members are invited to special opening parties, given gifts, and receive other perks.[5][128] Businesses host parties for the Yelp Elite as a way of getting reviews.[10][127] As of 2011, there were 60 local Elite Squads, most in North America and Europe.[127]
Yelp receives about six subpoenas a month asking for the names of anonymous reviewers, mostly from business owners seeking litigation against those writing negative reviews.[94] In 2012 the Alexandria Circuit Court and the Virginia Court of Appeals[129] held Yelp in contempt for refusing to disclose the identities of seven reviewers that anonymously criticized a carpet-cleaning business; in 2014 Yelp appealed to the Virginia Supreme Court.[120][130] Six internet companies and the Electronic Frontier Foundation said a ruling against Yelp would negatively affect free speech online. The judge from an early ruling said that if the reviewers did not actually use the businesses' services, their communications would be false claims not protected by free speech laws.[131] In 2014, a California state law was enacted that prohibits businesses from using "disparagement clauses" in their contracts or terms of use that allow them to sue or fine customers that write negatively about them online.[132][133]
As of 2010, Yelp employed a staff of 40 community managers that organize parties for prolific reviewers, send encouraging messages to reviewers and host classes for small business owners.[10] Yelp reviewers are not required to disclose their identity, but Yelp encourages them to do so.[5] After leaving a negative review a user may say "you've been Yelped",[69] while businesses with positive reviews advertise with "People Love us on Yelp!".[10]

Yelp is an American multinational corporation headquartered in San Francisco, California. It develops, hosts and markets Yelp.com and the Yelp mobile app, which publish crowd-sourced reviews about local businesses, as well as the online reservation service Yelp Reservations and online food-delivery service Eat24. The company also trains small businesses in how to respond to reviews, hosts social events for reviewers, and provides data about businesses, including health inspection scores.
Yelp was founded in 2004 by former PayPal employees Russel Simmons and Jeremy Stoppelman. Yelp grew quickly and raised several rounds of funding. By 2010 it had $30 million in revenues and the website had published more than 4.5 million crowd-sourced reviews. From 2009 to 2012, Yelp expanded throughout Europe and Asia. In 2009 it entered several negotiations with Google for a potential acquisition. Yelp became a public company in March 2012 and became profitable for the first time two years later. As of 2016, Yelp.com has 135 million monthly visitors and 95 million reviews. The company's revenues come from businesses advertising.
According to BusinessWeek, Yelp has a complicated relationship with small businesses.[3] Criticism of Yelp focuses on the legitimacy of reviews, public statements of Yelp manipulating and blocking reviews in order to increase ad spending, as well as concerns regarding the privacy of reviewers.

Company history (2004–2016)[edit]
Origins (2004–2009)[edit]




Jeremy Stoppelman, co-founder and CEO of Yelp


Two former PayPal employees, Jeremy Stoppelman and Russel Simmons, founded Yelp at a business incubator, MRL Ventures, in 2004.[4][5] Stoppelman and Simmons conceived the initial idea for Yelp as an email-based referral network, after Stoppelman caught the flu[6] and had a difficult time finding an online recommendation for a local doctor.[5][7][8] The co-founders' former colleague from PayPal and founder of MRL Ventures, Max Levchin, provided $1 million in initial funding.[5] MRL co-founder David Galbraith, who instigated the local services project based on user reviews, came up with the name "Yelp".[9] According to Fortune Magazine, Yelp's initial email-based system was "convoluted".[5] The idea was rejected by investors and did not attract users beyond the cofounders' friends and family.[10] Usage data showed that users were not answering requests for referrals, but were using the "Real Reviews" feature, which allowed them to write reviews unsolicited.[5]
According to the San Francisco Chronicle, "the site's popularity soared" after it was re-designed in late 2005.[11] Yelp raised $5 million in funding in 2005 from Bessemer Ventures and $10 million in November 2006 from Benchmark Capital.[5] The number of reviewers on the site grew from 12,000 in 2005, to 100,000 in 2006.[10] By the summer of 2006, the site had one million monthly visitors.[10] It raised $15 million in funding from DAG Ventures in February 2008.[12][13] In 2010, Elevation Partners invested $100 million; $75 million was spent on purchasing equity from employees and investors, while $25 million was invested in sales staff and expansion.[14] Yelp grew from six million monthly visitors in 2007 to 16.5 million in 2008 and from 12 to 24 cities during the same time period. By 2009, the site had 4.5 million reviews.[15] By 2010, Yelp's revenues were estimated to be $30 million and it employed 300 people.[10]
Private company (2009–2012)[edit]
Yelp introduced a site for the United Kingdom in January 2009[16] and one for Canada that August.[15] The first non-English Yelp site was introduced in France in 2010; users had the option to read and write content in French or English.[17] From 2010 to 2011, Yelp launched several more sites, in Austria, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands. International website traffic doubled during the same time period.[18] An Australian website went live in November 2011.[4] It was supported through a partnership with Telstra, which provided one million initial business listings,[19] and was initially glitchy.[20] Yelp had a presence in 20 countries by the end of 2012, including Turkey[21] and Denmark.[22] Yelp's first site in Asia was introduced in September 2012 in Singapore,[6] which was followed by Japan in 2014.[23]
In December 2009, Google entered into negotiations with Yelp to acquire the company,[24][25] but the two parties failed to reach an agreement.[26][27] According to The New York Times, Google offered more than $500 million, but the deal fell through after Yahoo offered $1 billion.[28] Tech Crunch reported that Google refused to match Yahoo's offer. Both offers were later abandoned following a disagreement between Yelp's management and board of directors about the offers.[29] In June 2015, Yelp published a study alleging Google was altering search results to benefit its own online services.[30][31]
Yelp began a service called Yelp Deals in April 2011,[32] but by August it cut back on Deals due to increased competition and market saturation.[33] That September, the Federal Trade Commission investigated Yelp's allegations that Google was using Yelp web content without authorization and that Google's search engine algorithms favored Google Places over similar services provided by Yelp.[34][35] In a January 2014 agreement, Google was not subject to anti-trust litigation from the FTC, but did have to allow services like Yelp the ability to opt out of having their data scraped and used on Google's websites.[36]
Public entity (2012–present)[edit]




The 140 New Montgomery building in San Francisco, home of Yelp's headquarters


Having filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with the Securities Exchange Commission in November 2011,[37][38] Yelp's stock began public trading on the New York Stock Exchange on March 2, 2012. At a share price of $15, the company was valued at $898 million.[39][40] In 2012, Yelp agreed to acquire its largest European rival, Qype, for $50 million.[6] The following year, CEO Jeremy Stoppelman reduced his salary to $1.[41] Yelp acquired the start-up online reservation company SeatMe for $12.7 million in cash and company stock in 2013.[42][43][44] Yelp's second quarter 2013 revenue of $55 million "exceeded expectations", but the company was not yet profitable.[45]
In 2012/13, Yelp moved into its new corporate headquarters, occupying nearly 150,000 square feet on 12 floors of 140 New Montgomery (the former PacBell building) in San Francisco.[46]
The company was profitable for the first time in the second quarter of 2014, as a result of increasing ad spending by business owners and possibly from changes in Google's local search algorithm.[47] It is dubbed as Google Pigeon, which helped authoritative local directory sites like Yelp and TripAdvisor, in getting more visibility.[48] Over the course of the year, Yelp websites were launched in Mexico, Japan and Argentina.[49] Also in 2014, Yelp expanded in Europe through the acquisitions of German-based restaurant review site Restaurant-Kritik and French-based CityVox.[50][51]
In early February 2015 Yelp announced it was buying Eat24, an online food-ordering service, for $134 million.[52][53]
In late 2015, a "Public Services & Government" section was introduced to Yelp and the General Services Administration began encouraging government agencies to create and monitor official government pages.[54] For example, the Transportation Security Administration created official TSA Yelp pages.[55][56] Later that year Yelp began experimenting in San Francisco with consumer alerts that were added to pages about restaurants with poor hygiene scores in government inspections.[57] Research conducted by the Boston Children's Hospital found that Yelp reviews with keywords associated with food poisoning correlates strongly with poor hygiene at the restaurant. Researchers at Columbia University used data from Yelp to identify three previously unreported restaurant-related food poisoning outbreaks.[58]
In 2016, Yelp invested in Nowait, an app that allows users to see how long they would have to wait at a restaurant that does not accept reservations, as well as put their names on the waitlist without being physically present at a restaurant. When their table is ready, users get a text message. Customers can also text back to say they’re running late, and restaurants can decide whether or not to hold the table for them.[59]
On November 2, 2016, concurrent with its earnings report for Q3 2016, Yelp announced it would drastically scale back its operations outside North America and halt international expansion. This resulted in the termination of essentially all international employees across Yelp's 30+ international markets from the sales, marketing, public relations, business outreach, and government relations departments. Overseas employees now primarily consist of engineering and product management staff. Yelp claims these layoffs affected only 175 individuals, or 4 percent of its total workforce.[60]
In April, 2017, Yelp announced that it had acquired Wi-Fi marketing company Turnstyle Analytics for $20 million.[61]

Yelp's website, Yelp.com, is a crowd-sourced local business review and social networking site.[5] Its user community is primarily active in major metropolitan areas.[10] The site has pages devoted to individual locations, such as restaurants or schools, where Yelp users can submit a review of their products or services[65] using a one to five star rating system.[10] Businesses can also update contact information, hours and other basic listing information or add special deals.[10][15] In addition to writing reviews, users can react to reviews, plan events or discuss their personal lives.[5] According to Sterling Market Intelligence, Yelp is "one of the most important sites on the Internet."[22] As of Q2 2016 it has 168 million monthly unique visitors and 108 million reviews.[66]
78 percent of businesses listed on the site have a rating of three stars or better,[67] but some negative reviews are very personal or extreme.[10] Many reviews are written in an entertaining or creative manner.[11] Users can give a review a "thumbs-up" if it is "useful, funny or cool."[68] Each day a "Review of the Day" is determined based on a vote by users.[69]
As of June 2016, 72 percent of Yelp searches are done from a mobile device.[67] The Yelp iPhone app was introduced in December 2008.[70] In August 2009, Yelp released an update to the iPhone app with a hidden Easter Egg augmented reality feature called Monocle, which allowed users looking through their iPhone camera to see Yelp data on businesses seen through the camera.[71] Check-in features were added in 2010.[72][73]
Yelp users can make restaurant reservations in Yelp through Yelp Reservations, a feature originally added in June 2010.[74][75] Yelp's reservation features were initially done through a 2010 partnership with OpenTable,[76] but Yelp became increasingly competitive with OpenTable after Yelp's 2013 acquisition of SeatMe, resulting in the end of the partnership in April 2015.[77] SeatMe was reworked into the current "Yelp Reservations" feature.[78] In 2013, features to have food ordered and delivered were added to Yelp[79] as well as the ability to view hygiene inspection scores[80] and make appointments at spas.[81] Yelp's content was integrated into the mapping and directions app of Apple's September 2012 release of iOS 6.[82] Yelp also has features for finding local businesses offering special deals to Yelp users.[83]
In March 2014, Yelp added features for ordering and scheduling manicures, flowers, golf and legal consultations, among other things, through Yelp.[84] In October 2014, the company, working in collaboration with hotel search site Hipmunk, added features to book hotels through Yelp.[81]
On February 14, 2017, Yelp launched a Yelp Questions and Answers, new feature that allows the users to ask venue specific questions related to businesses.[85] It allows users to upvote and downvote the answers on the basis of helpfulness.[86]
Features for businesses[edit]
Yelp added the ability for business owners to respond to reviews in 2008.[10][87] Businesses can respond privately by messaging the reviewer or publicly on their profile page. In some cases, Yelp users that had a bad experience have updated their reviews more favorably due to the businesses' efforts to make it right. In other cases disputes between reviewers and business owners have led to harassment and physical altercations.[10] The system has led to criticisms that business owners can bribe reviewers with free food or discounts to increase their rating, though Yelp users say this rarely occurs.[69] A business owner can "claim" a profile, which allows them to respond to reviews and see traffic reports.[10] Businesses can also offer discounts to Yelp users that visit often using the "check in" feature.[72][73] In 2014, Yelp released an app for business owners to respond to reviews and manage their profiles from a mobile device.[88] Business owners can also flag a review to be removed, if the review violates Yelp's content guidelines.[89]
Yelp's revenues primarily come from selling ads and sponsored listings to small businesses.[8][10] Advertisers can pay to have their listing appear at the top of search results, or feature ads on the pages of their competitors.[10][15][87] As of 2016, advertising revenue was growing at a rate of 30% year over year.[90] Yelp will only allow businesses with at least a three-star rating to sign up for advertising.[11] Originally a sponsored "favorite review" could place a positive review above negative ones,[10] but Yelp stopped offering this option in 2010 in an effort to deter misconceptions that advertisers were able to marginalize negative reviews for pay.[91][92]
Relationship with businesses[edit]
A Harvard Business School study published in 2011 found that each "star" in a Yelp rating affected the business owner's sales by 5–9 percent.[93][94] A 2012 study by two Berkeley economists found that an increase from 3.5 to 4 stars on Yelp resulted in a 19 percent increase in the chances of the restaurant being booked during peak hours.[95] A 2014 survey of 300 small business owners done by Yodle found that 78 percent were concerned about negative reviews. Also, 43 percent of respondents said they felt online reviews were unfair, because there is no verification that the review is written by a legitimate customer.[94]
Astroturfing[edit]
As Yelp became more influential, the practice of fake reviews written by competitors or business owners became more prevalent.[68] A study from Harvard professor Michael Luca analyzed 316,415 reviews in Boston and found that fake reviews rose from 6% of the site's reviews in 2006 to 20% in 2014.[93] Yelp's own review filter identifies 25% of reviews as suspicious.[96]
Yelp has a proprietary algorithm that attempts to evaluate whether a review is authentic and filters out reviews that it believes are not based on a patron's actual personal experiences, as required by the site's Terms of Use.[10][97] The review filter was first developed two weeks after the site was founded and the company saw their "first obviously fake reviews."[96] Filtered reviews are moved into a special area and not counted towards the businesses' star-rating.[96] The filter sometimes filters legitimate reviews, leading to complaints from business owners.[68] New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman said Yelp has "the most aggressive" astroturfing filter out of the crowd-sourced websites it looked into.[96] Yelp has also been criticized for not disclosing how the filter works,[96] which it says would reveal information on how to outsmart it.[10]
Yelp also conducts "sting operations" to uncover businesses writing their own reviews.[98] In October 2012, Yelp placed a 90-day "consumer alert" on 150 business listings believed to have paid for reviews. The alert read "We caught someone red-handed trying to buy reviews for this business".[99][100][101] In June 2013, Yelp filed a lawsuit against BuyYelpReview/AdBlaze for allegedly writing fake reviews for pay.[102][103] In 2013 Yelp sued a lawyer it alleged was part of a group of law firms that exchanged Yelp reviews, saying that many of the firm's reviews originated from their own office. The lawyer said Yelp was trying to get revenge for his own legal disputes and activism against Yelp.[3] An effort to win dismissal of the case was denied in December 2014.[104] In September 2013, Yelp cooperated with Operation Clean Turf, a sting operation by the New York Attorney General that uncovered 19 astroturfing operations.[96] In April 2017, a Norfolk, Massachusetts jury awarded a jewelry store over $34,000 after it determined that its competitor's employee had filed a false negative Yelp review that knowingly caused emotional distress.[105]
Alleged manipulation by Yelp[edit]
According to BusinessWeek, Yelp has "always had a complicated relationship with small businesses."[3] Throughout much of Yelp's history there have been allegations that Yelp has manipulated their website's reviews based on participation in its advertising programs.[106] Many business owners say Yelp salespeople offered to remove or suppress negative reviews if they purchase advertising.[68] Others report seeing negative reviews featured prominently and positive reviews buried; soon after, they would receive calls from Yelp attempting to sell paid advertising.[107] Yelp says its sales staff do not have the ability to modify reviews and that changes in the reviews are caused by its automated filter.[65][108]
Several lawsuits have been filed against Yelp accusing it of extorting businesses into buying advertising products. Each have been dismissed by a judge before reaching trial.[68] In early 2010, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Yelp alleging it asked a Long Beach veterinary hospital to pay $300 a month for advertising services that included the suppression or deletion of disparaging customer reviews.[109] The following month, nine additional businesses joined the class-action lawsuit,[110] and two similar lawsuits were filed.[111] That May the lawsuits were combined into one class-action lawsuit,[112] which was dismissed by San Francisco U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in 2011. Chen said the reviews were protected by the Communications Decency Act of 1996 and that there was no evidence of manipulation by Yelp.[113] The plaintiffs filed an appeal.[114] In September 2014 the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal, finding that even if Yelp did manipulate reviews to favor advertisers, this would not fall under the court's legal definition of extortion.[115][116][117]
In August 2013, Yelp launched a series of town hall style meetings in 22 major American cities in an effort to address concerns among local business owners. Many attendees expressed frustrations with Yelp's automated filter removing positive reviews after they decline to advertise, receiving reviews from users that never entered the establishment, and other issues.[114][118] A 2011 Harvard study by Michael Luca found that there was no significant statistical correlation between being a Yelp advertiser and having more favorable reviews.[94][119] The Federal Trade Commission received 2,046 complaints about Yelp from 2008 to 2014,[94] most from small businesses regarding allegedly unfair or fake reviews or negative reviews that appear after declining to advertise.[120] According to Yelp, the Federal Trade Commission finished a second examination of Yelp's practices in 2015 and in both cases did not pursue an action against the company.[121][122]
Journalist David Lazarus of the Los Angeles Times also criticized Yelp in 2014 for the practice of selling competitors' ads to run on top of business listings and then offering to have the ads removed as part of a paid feature.[123]
In 2015, San Francisco filmmaker Kaylie Milliken was reportedly producing a documentary film titled Billion Dollar Bully about Yelp's alleged business practices.[124]
Community[edit]
According to Inc. Magazine most reviewers (sometimes called "Yelpers"[11]) are "well-intentioned" and write reviews in order to express themselves, improve their writing, or be creative. In some cases, they write reviews in order to lash out at corporate interests or businesses they dislike.[10] Reviewers may also be motivated by badges and honors, such as being the first to review a new location,[11] or by praise and attention from other users.[87] Many reviews are written in an entertaining or creative manner.[11] Some users post reviews as a matter of protest or support of the business's political views; Yelp attempts to filter these.[125] Users can give a review a "thumbs-up" if it is "useful, funny or cool."[68] Each day a "Review of the Day" is determined based on a vote by users.[69] According to The Discourse of Online Consumer Reviews many Yelp reviewers are internet-savvy adults aged 18–25 or "suburban baby boomers".[126]
Reviewers are encouraged to use real names and photos.[126] Each year members of the Yelp community are invited or self-nominated to the "Yelp Elite Squad" and some are accepted based on an evaluation of their reviews.[127][128] Users must also use their real name and photo on Yelp to qualify for the Elite Squad.[69] They are governed by a council and estimated to have several thousand members. Yelp does not disclose how the Yelp Elite are selected.[11][127] Elite Squad members are given different color badges based on how long they've been an elite member.[128] The Yelp Elite Squad originated with parties Yelp began throwing for members in 2005,[128] and in 2006 it was formally codified;[127] the name came from a joking reference to prolific reviewers that were invited to Yelp parties as the "Yelp Elite Squad."[5][10] Members are invited to special opening parties, given gifts, and receive other perks.[5][128] Businesses host parties for the Yelp Elite as a way of getting reviews.[10][127] As of 2011, there were 60 local Elite Squads, most in North America and Europe.[127]
Yelp receives about six subpoenas a month asking for the names of anonymous reviewers, mostly from business owners seeking litigation against those writing negative reviews.[94] In 2012 the Alexandria Circuit Court and the Virginia Court of Appeals[129] held Yelp in contempt for refusing to disclose the identities of seven reviewers that anonymously criticized a carpet-cleaning business; in 2014 Yelp appealed to the Virginia Supreme Court.[120][130] Six internet companies and the Electronic Frontier Foundation said a ruling against Yelp would negatively affect free speech online. The judge from an early ruling said that if the reviewers did not actually use the businesses' services, their communications would be false claims not protected by free speech laws.[131] In 2014, a California state law was enacted that prohibits businesses from using "disparagement clauses" in their contracts or terms of use that allow them to sue or fine customers that write negatively about them online.[132][133]
As of 2010, Yelp employed a staff of 40 community managers that organize parties for prolific reviewers, send encouraging messages to reviewers and host classes for small business owners.[10] Yelp reviewers are not required to disclose their identity, but Yelp encourages them to do so.[5] After leaving a negative review a user may say "you've been Yelped",[69] while businesses with positive reviews advertise with "People Love us on Yelp!".[10]

Yelp is an American multinational corporation headquartered in San Francisco, California. It develops, hosts and markets Yelp.com and the Yelp mobile app, which publish crowd-sourced reviews about local businesses, as well as the online reservation service Yelp Reservations and online food-delivery service Eat24. The company also trains small businesses in how to respond to reviews, hosts social events for reviewers, and provides data about businesses, including health inspection scores.
Yelp was founded in 2004 by former PayPal employees Russel Simmons and Jeremy Stoppelman. Yelp grew quickly and raised several rounds of funding. By 2010 it had $30 million in revenues and the website had published more than 4.5 million crowd-sourced reviews. From 2009 to 2012, Yelp expanded throughout Europe and Asia. In 2009 it entered several negotiations with Google for a potential acquisition. Yelp became a public company in March 2012 and became profitable for the first time two years later. As of 2016, Yelp.com has 135 million monthly visitors and 95 million reviews. The company's revenues come from businesses advertising.
According to BusinessWeek, Yelp has a complicated relationship with small businesses.[3] Criticism of Yelp focuses on the legitimacy of reviews, public statements of Yelp manipulating and blocking reviews in order to increase ad spending, as well as concerns regarding the privacy of reviewers.

Company history (2004–2016)[edit]
Origins (2004–2009)[edit]




Jeremy Stoppelman, co-founder and CEO of Yelp


Two former PayPal employees, Jeremy Stoppelman and Russel Simmons, founded Yelp at a business incubator, MRL Ventures, in 2004.[4][5] Stoppelman and Simmons conceived the initial idea for Yelp as an email-based referral network, after Stoppelman caught the flu[6] and had a difficult time finding an online recommendation for a local doctor.[5][7][8] The co-founders' former colleague from PayPal and founder of MRL Ventures, Max Levchin, provided $1 million in initial funding.[5] MRL co-founder David Galbraith, who instigated the local services project based on user reviews, came up with the name "Yelp".[9] According to Fortune Magazine, Yelp's initial email-based system was "convoluted".[5] The idea was rejected by investors and did not attract users beyond the cofounders' friends and family.[10] Usage data showed that users were not answering requests for referrals, but were using the "Real Reviews" feature, which allowed them to write reviews unsolicited.[5]
According to the San Francisco Chronicle, "the site's popularity soared" after it was re-designed in late 2005.[11] Yelp raised $5 million in funding in 2005 from Bessemer Ventures and $10 million in November 2006 from Benchmark Capital.[5] The number of reviewers on the site grew from 12,000 in 2005, to 100,000 in 2006.[10] By the summer of 2006, the site had one million monthly visitors.[10] It raised $15 million in funding from DAG Ventures in February 2008.[12][13] In 2010, Elevation Partners invested $100 million; $75 million was spent on purchasing equity from employees and investors, while $25 million was invested in sales staff and expansion.[14] Yelp grew from six million monthly visitors in 2007 to 16.5 million in 2008 and from 12 to 24 cities during the same time period. By 2009, the site had 4.5 million reviews.[15] By 2010, Yelp's revenues were estimated to be $30 million and it employed 300 people.[10]
Private company (2009–2012)[edit]
Yelp introduced a site for the United Kingdom in January 2009[16] and one for Canada that August.[15] The first non-English Yelp site was introduced in France in 2010; users had the option to read and write content in French or English.[17] From 2010 to 2011, Yelp launched several more sites, in Austria, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands. International website traffic doubled during the same time period.[18] An Australian website went live in November 2011.[4] It was supported through a partnership with Telstra, which provided one million initial business listings,[19] and was initially glitchy.[20] Yelp had a presence in 20 countries by the end of 2012, including Turkey[21] and Denmark.[22] Yelp's first site in Asia was introduced in September 2012 in Singapore,[6] which was followed by Japan in 2014.[23]
In December 2009, Google entered into negotiations with Yelp to acquire the company,[24][25] but the two parties failed to reach an agreement.[26][27] According to The New York Times, Google offered more than $500 million, but the deal fell through after Yahoo offered $1 billion.[28] Tech Crunch reported that Google refused to match Yahoo's offer. Both offers were later abandoned following a disagreement between Yelp's management and board of directors about the offers.[29] In June 2015, Yelp published a study alleging Google was altering search results to benefit its own online services.[30][31]
Yelp began a service called Yelp Deals in April 2011,[32] but by August it cut back on Deals due to increased competition and market saturation.[33] That September, the Federal Trade Commission investigated Yelp's allegations that Google was using Yelp web content without authorization and that Google's search engine algorithms favored Google Places over similar services provided by Yelp.[34][35] In a January 2014 agreement, Google was not subject to anti-trust litigation from the FTC, but did have to allow services like Yelp the ability to opt out of having their data scraped and used on Google's websites.[36]
Public entity (2012–present)[edit]




The 140 New Montgomery building in San Francisco, home of Yelp's headquarters


Having filed for an initial public offering (IPO) with the Securities Exchange Commission in November 2011,[37][38] Yelp's stock began public trading on the New York Stock Exchange on March 2, 2012. At a share price of $15, the company was valued at $898 million.[39][40] In 2012, Yelp agreed to acquire its largest European rival, Qype, for $50 million.[6] The following year, CEO Jeremy Stoppelman reduced his salary to $1.[41] Yelp acquired the start-up online reservation company SeatMe for $12.7 million in cash and company stock in 2013.[42][43][44] Yelp's second quarter 2013 revenue of $55 million "exceeded expectations", but the company was not yet profitable.[45]
In 2012/13, Yelp moved into its new corporate headquarters, occupying nearly 150,000 square feet on 12 floors of 140 New Montgomery (the former PacBell building) in San Francisco.[46]
The company was profitable for the first time in the second quarter of 2014, as a result of increasing ad spending by business owners and possibly from changes in Google's local search algorithm.[47] It is dubbed as Google Pigeon, which helped authoritative local directory sites like Yelp and TripAdvisor, in getting more visibility.[48] Over the course of the year, Yelp websites were launched in Mexico, Japan and Argentina.[49] Also in 2014, Yelp expanded in Europe through the acquisitions of German-based restaurant review site Restaurant-Kritik and French-based CityVox.[50][51]
In early February 2015 Yelp announced it was buying Eat24, an online food-ordering service, for $134 million.[52][53]
In late 2015, a "Public Services & Government" section was introduced to Yelp and the General Services Administration began encouraging government agencies to create and monitor official government pages.[54] For example, the Transportation Security Administration created official TSA Yelp pages.[55][56] Later that year Yelp began experimenting in San Francisco with consumer alerts that were added to pages about restaurants with poor hygiene scores in government inspections.[57] Research conducted by the Boston Children's Hospital found that Yelp reviews with keywords associated with food poisoning correlates strongly with poor hygiene at the restaurant. Researchers at Columbia University used data from Yelp to identify three previously unreported restaurant-related food poisoning outbreaks.[58]
In 2016, Yelp invested in Nowait, an app that allows users to see how long they would have to wait at a restaurant that does not accept reservations, as well as put their names on the waitlist without being physically present at a restaurant. When their table is ready, users get a text message. Customers can also text back to say they’re running late, and restaurants can decide whether or not to hold the table for them.[59]
On November 2, 2016, concurrent with its earnings report for Q3 2016, Yelp announced it would drastically scale back its operations outside North America and halt international expansion. This resulted in the termination of essentially all international employees across Yelp's 30+ international markets from the sales, marketing, public relations, business outreach, and government relations departments. Overseas employees now primarily consist of engineering and product management staff. Yelp claims these layoffs affected only 175 individuals, or 4 percent of its total workforce.[60]
In April, 2017, Yelp announced that it had acquired Wi-Fi marketing company Turnstyle Analytics for $20 million.[61]

Yelp's website, Yelp.com, is a crowd-sourced local business review and social networking site.[5] Its user community is primarily active in major metropolitan areas.[10] The site has pages devoted to individual locations, such as restaurants or schools, where Yelp users can submit a review of their products or services[65] using a one to five star rating system.[10] Businesses can also update contact information, hours and other basic listing information or add special deals.[10][15] In addition to writing reviews, users can react to reviews, plan events or discuss their personal lives.[5] According to Sterling Market Intelligence, Yelp is "one of the most important sites on the Internet."[22] As of Q2 2016 it has 168 million monthly unique visitors and 108 million reviews.[66]
78 percent of businesses listed on the site have a rating of three stars or better,[67] but some negative reviews are very personal or extreme.[10] Many reviews are written in an entertaining or creative manner.[11] Users can give a review a "thumbs-up" if it is "useful, funny or cool."[68] Each day a "Review of the Day" is determined based on a vote by users.[69]
As of June 2016, 72 percent of Yelp searches are done from a mobile device.[67] The Yelp iPhone app was introduced in December 2008.[70] In August 2009, Yelp released an update to the iPhone app with a hidden Easter Egg augmented reality feature called Monocle, which allowed users looking through their iPhone camera to see Yelp data on businesses seen through the camera.[71] Check-in features were added in 2010.[72][73]
Yelp users can make restaurant reservations in Yelp through Yelp Reservations, a feature originally added in June 2010.[74][75] Yelp's reservation features were initially done through a 2010 partnership with OpenTable,[76] but Yelp became increasingly competitive with OpenTable after Yelp's 2013 acquisition of SeatMe, resulting in the end of the partnership in April 2015.[77] SeatMe was reworked into the current "Yelp Reservations" feature.[78] In 2013, features to have food ordered and delivered were added to Yelp[79] as well as the ability to view hygiene inspection scores[80] and make appointments at spas.[81] Yelp's content was integrated into the mapping and directions app of Apple's September 2012 release of iOS 6.[82] Yelp also has features for finding local businesses offering special deals to Yelp users.[83]
In March 2014, Yelp added features for ordering and scheduling manicures, flowers, golf and legal consultations, among other things, through Yelp.[84] In October 2014, the company, working in collaboration with hotel search site Hipmunk, added features to book hotels through Yelp.[81]
On February 14, 2017, Yelp launched a Yelp Questions and Answers, new feature that allows the users to ask venue specific questions related to businesses.[85] It allows users to upvote and downvote the answers on the basis of helpfulness.[86]
Features for businesses[edit]
Yelp added the ability for business owners to respond to reviews in 2008.[10][87] Businesses can respond privately by messaging the reviewer or publicly on their profile page. In some cases, Yelp users that had a bad experience have updated their reviews more favorably due to the businesses' efforts to make it right. In other cases disputes between reviewers and business owners have led to harassment and physical altercations.[10] The system has led to criticisms that business owners can bribe reviewers with free food or discounts to increase their rating, though Yelp users say this rarely occurs.[69] A business owner can "claim" a profile, which allows them to respond to reviews and see traffic reports.[10] Businesses can also offer discounts to Yelp users that visit often using the "check in" feature.[72][73] In 2014, Yelp released an app for business owners to respond to reviews and manage their profiles from a mobile device.[88] Business owners can also flag a review to be removed, if the review violates Yelp's content guidelines.[89]
Yelp's revenues primarily come from selling ads and sponsored listings to small businesses.[8][10] Advertisers can pay to have their listing appear at the top of search results, or feature ads on the pages of their competitors.[10][15][87] As of 2016, advertising revenue was growing at a rate of 30% year over year.[90] Yelp will only allow businesses with at least a three-star rating to sign up for advertising.[11] Originally a sponsored "favorite review" could place a positive review above negative ones,[10] but Yelp stopped offering this option in 2010 in an effort to deter misconceptions that advertisers were able to marginalize negative reviews for pay.[91][92]
Relationship with businesses[edit]
A Harvard Business School study published in 2011 found that each "star" in a Yelp rating affected the business owner's sales by 5–9 percent.[93][94] A 2012 study by two Berkeley economists found that an increase from 3.5 to 4 stars on Yelp resulted in a 19 percent increase in the chances of the restaurant being booked during peak hours.[95] A 2014 survey of 300 small business owners done by Yodle found that 78 percent were concerned about negative reviews. Also, 43 percent of respondents said they felt online reviews were unfair, because there is no verification that the review is written by a legitimate customer.[94]
Astroturfing[edit]
As Yelp became more influential, the practice of fake reviews written by competitors or business owners became more prevalent.[68] A study from Harvard professor Michael Luca analyzed 316,415 reviews in Boston and found that fake reviews rose from 6% of the site's reviews in 2006 to 20% in 2014.[93] Yelp's own review filter identifies 25% of reviews as suspicious.[96]
Yelp has a proprietary algorithm that attempts to evaluate whether a review is authentic and filters out reviews that it believes are not based on a patron's actual personal experiences, as required by the site's Terms of Use.[10][97] The review filter was first developed two weeks after the site was founded and the company saw their "first obviously fake reviews."[96] Filtered reviews are moved into a special area and not counted towards the businesses' star-rating.[96] The filter sometimes filters legitimate reviews, leading to complaints from business owners.[68] New York Attorney General Eric T. Schneiderman said Yelp has "the most aggressive" astroturfing filter out of the crowd-sourced websites it looked into.[96] Yelp has also been criticized for not disclosing how the filter works,[96] which it says would reveal information on how to outsmart it.[10]
Yelp also conducts "sting operations" to uncover businesses writing their own reviews.[98] In October 2012, Yelp placed a 90-day "consumer alert" on 150 business listings believed to have paid for reviews. The alert read "We caught someone red-handed trying to buy reviews for this business".[99][100][101] In June 2013, Yelp filed a lawsuit against BuyYelpReview/AdBlaze for allegedly writing fake reviews for pay.[102][103] In 2013 Yelp sued a lawyer it alleged was part of a group of law firms that exchanged Yelp reviews, saying that many of the firm's reviews originated from their own office. The lawyer said Yelp was trying to get revenge for his own legal disputes and activism against Yelp.[3] An effort to win dismissal of the case was denied in December 2014.[104] In September 2013, Yelp cooperated with Operation Clean Turf, a sting operation by the New York Attorney General that uncovered 19 astroturfing operations.[96] In April 2017, a Norfolk, Massachusetts jury awarded a jewelry store over $34,000 after it determined that its competitor's employee had filed a false negative Yelp review that knowingly caused emotional distress.[105]
Alleged manipulation by Yelp[edit]
According to BusinessWeek, Yelp has "always had a complicated relationship with small businesses."[3] Throughout much of Yelp's history there have been allegations that Yelp has manipulated their website's reviews based on participation in its advertising programs.[106] Many business owners say Yelp salespeople offered to remove or suppress negative reviews if they purchase advertising.[68] Others report seeing negative reviews featured prominently and positive reviews buried; soon after, they would receive calls from Yelp attempting to sell paid advertising.[107] Yelp says its sales staff do not have the ability to modify reviews and that changes in the reviews are caused by its automated filter.[65][108]
Several lawsuits have been filed against Yelp accusing it of extorting businesses into buying advertising products. Each have been dismissed by a judge before reaching trial.[68] In early 2010, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Yelp alleging it asked a Long Beach veterinary hospital to pay $300 a month for advertising services that included the suppression or deletion of disparaging customer reviews.[109] The following month, nine additional businesses joined the class-action lawsuit,[110] and two similar lawsuits were filed.[111] That May the lawsuits were combined into one class-action lawsuit,[112] which was dismissed by San Francisco U.S. District Judge Edward Chen in 2011. Chen said the reviews were protected by the Communications Decency Act of 1996 and that there was no evidence of manipulation by Yelp.[113] The plaintiffs filed an appeal.[114] In September 2014 the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal, finding that even if Yelp did manipulate reviews to favor advertisers, this would not fall under the court's legal definition of extortion.[115][116][117]
In August 2013, Yelp launched a series of town hall style meetings in 22 major American cities in an effort to address concerns among local business owners. Many attendees expressed frustrations with Yelp's automated filter removing positive reviews after they decline to advertise, receiving reviews from users that never entered the establishment, and other issues.[114][118] A 2011 Harvard study by Michael Luca found that there was no significant statistical correlation between being a Yelp advertiser and having more favorable reviews.[94][119] The Federal Trade Commission received 2,046 complaints about Yelp from 2008 to 2014,[94] most from small businesses regarding allegedly unfair or fake reviews or negative reviews that appear after declining to advertise.[120] According to Yelp, the Federal Trade Commission finished a second examination of Yelp's practices in 2015 and in both cases did not pursue an action against the company.[121][122]
Journalist David Lazarus of the Los Angeles Times also criticized Yelp in 2014 for the practice of selling competitors' ads to run on top of business listings and then offering to have the ads removed as part of a paid feature.[123]
In 2015, San Francisco filmmaker Kaylie Milliken was reportedly producing a documentary film titled Billion Dollar Bully about Yelp's alleged business practices.[124]
Community[edit]
According to Inc. Magazine most reviewers (sometimes called "Yelpers"[11]) are "well-intentioned" and write reviews in order to express themselves, improve their writing, or be creative. In some cases, they write reviews in order to lash out at corporate interests or businesses they dislike.[10] Reviewers may also be motivated by badges and honors, such as being the first to review a new location,[11] or by praise and attention from other users.[87] Many reviews are written in an entertaining or creative manner.[11] Some users post reviews as a matter of protest or support of the business's political views; Yelp attempts to filter these.[125] Users can give a review a "thumbs-up" if it is "useful, funny or cool."[68] Each day a "Review of the Day" is determined based on a vote by users.[69] According to The Discourse of Online Consumer Reviews many Yelp reviewers are internet-savvy adults aged 18–25 or "suburban baby boomers".[126]
Reviewers are encouraged to use real names and photos.[126] Each year members of the Yelp community are invited or self-nominated to the "Yelp Elite Squad" and some are accepted based on an evaluation of their reviews.[127][128] Users must also use their real name and photo on Yelp to qualify for the Elite Squad.[69] They are governed by a council and estimated to have several thousand members. Yelp does not disclose how the Yelp Elite are selected.[11][127] Elite Squad members are given different color badges based on how long they've been an elite member.[128] The Yelp Elite Squad originated with parties Yelp began throwing for members in 2005,[128] and in 2006 it was formally codified;[127] the name came from a joking reference to prolific reviewers that were invited to Yelp parties as the "Yelp Elite Squad."[5][10] Members are invited to special opening parties, given gifts, and receive other perks.[5][128] Businesses host parties for the Yelp Elite as a way of getting reviews.[10][127] As of 2011, there were 60 local Elite Squads, most in North America and Europe.[127]
Yelp receives about six subpoenas a month asking for the names of anonymous reviewers, mostly from business owners seeking litigation against those writing negative reviews.[94] In 2012 the Alexandria Circuit Court and the Virginia Court of Appeals[129] held Yelp in contempt for refusing to disclose the identities of seven reviewers that anonymously criticized a carpet-cleaning business; in 2014 Yelp appealed to the Virginia Supreme Court.[120][130] Six internet companies and the Electronic Frontier Foundation said a ruling against Yelp would negatively affect free speech online. The judge from an early ruling said that if the reviewers did not actually use the businesses' services, their communications would be false claims not protected by free speech laws.[131] In 2014, a California state law was enacted that prohibits businesses from using "disparagement clauses" in their contracts or terms of use that allow them to sue or fine customers that write negatively about them online.[132][133]
As of 2010, Yelp employed a staff of 40 community managers that organize parties for prolific reviewers, send encouraging messages to reviewers and host classes for small business owners.[10] Yelp reviewers are not required to disclose their identity, but Yelp encourages them to do so.[5] After leaving a negative review a user may say "you've been Yelped",[69] while businesses with positive reviews advertise with "People Love us on Yelp!".[10]

Yelp's Jeremy Stoppelman: a profile

Back to Gallery
















Jeremy Stoppelman was on a conference call with venture capitalists when an assistant slipped him a note: "Steve Jobs is on the line."
Stoppelman quietly left the room at Yelp headquarters in downtown San Francisco. It was January 2010, and Google wanted to buy Yelp, the online, crowd-sourced review site. 
On the phone, Jobs urged Stoppelman, who revered the Apple chief as a visionary, to "stay independent and not sell out to Google." Jobs was not a fan of Google and had accused the search giant of stealing Apple's smart-phone and tablet technology.
"At that point, we had already turned down Google," Stoppelman said. "But Steve liked Yelp and wanted to make sure about Google. It was a moment where I said, 'This is crazy. What just happened?' "

For Stoppelman, who is 34 and co-founded Yelp in October 2004, the crazy moments have only continued. After his company went public this spring, when the young entrepreneur pushed the button to ring the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange, Stoppelman received another call - this one from President Obama, congratulating him. 
Today, Yelp has a market capitalization of about $1.3 billion, and Stoppelman's 11 percent stake is valued at more than $145 million. The company, which started in San Francisco as a vague idea about "local," now has 70 million unique monthly visitors, and has expanded to 17 countries. Stoppelman is an undisputed junior titan of Silicon Valley.
Sought-after nerd
He also has the canonical startup story. He was the kid who loved to tinker, who inadvertently blew a few things up and charred the walls with his experiments, who learned programming in middle school, earned his bachelor's degree in computer engineering, and then headed west - arriving in San Francisco at the start of the dot-com boom. He was the kid who became a sought-after nerd and was - after his second job out of college - given $1 million to sit around a SoMa loft with a dozen people and a dog and dream up The Next Big Thing. 
"The rule in the incubator was that we'd play around and come up with crazy ideas," said Max Levchin, a Ukraine-born computer scientist who co-founded the online payment system PayPal, where Stoppelman worked as his second job out of college. "It was a hacker commune, and the idea was to build great products."
Levchin, whose PayPal was sold to eBay for $1.5 billion in 2002, remembers the day Stoppelman and another former PayPal engineer, Russ Simmons, landed on the concept that would become Yelp.
"It was my 29th birthday, and we were at the Slanted Door in the Ferry Building," Levchin said. "Jeremy and Russ had been talking about doing something with local review or local search and were asking questions like: How do you get your friends to help you find the best plumber or doctor or nicest restaurant close by? Over lunch, I could see Russ and Jeremy at the other end of the table just scheming. After lunch, they said they thought they'd figured it out."
Ranking of businesses
Returning to the incubator on Mission near Third Street, Levchin listened as Stoppelman and Simmons explained their inchoate idea of an "e-mail type of product where you ask your friends to help you come up with a ranking of businesses."
"I thought it might work, but it might not," Levchin said. "I backed them because I believed in Russ and Jeremy. Russ is an amazing developer and engineer, and Jeremy is just really smart and really tenacious, with a lot of good stubbornness. Their idea was good, but of course it was not what Yelp ended up being, which is very common with startups."
Elon Musk, another PayPal founder, said he always considered Yelp a cool idea. Musk had done something similar with a company called Zip2, which he founded after dropping out of Stanford graduate school to provide local online content to news organizations.
"Someone needed to do user reviews right," said Musk, who went on to run Tesla Motors and co-found SpaceX, which recently made history by having the first commercial spaceship complete a mission to the International Space Station. "Effectively, Yelp is fulfilling a much better function than the Yellow Pages ever did," Musk said. "What Jeremy did was come up with an unmet need to know about local businesses and services."
Stoppelman, who spent his early childhood in Arlington, Va., before his family moved to nearby McLean - his middle school was next to CIA headquarters - said his interest in computers started in the fifth grade.
His mother, Lynn, was an English teacher before she began a marketing business out of their home, and his father, John, was a securities lawyer. 
"I think my dad did legal work for someone who had a Packard Bell 8088, and they couldn't pay him so they gave him a computer," Stoppelman said, sitting in a Yelp conference room, his vizsla named Darwin at his side. "I was initially not allowed to touch it, but that didn't last long. I started tinkering with it, and there were many times I screwed up the computer."
He got his own personal computer, an Amiga 2000, when he was in the 10th grade, and he was soon convinced that he'd be a video game programmer when he grew up. In high school, he took programming classes in Turbo Pascal, a software development system.
But the young Stoppelman was equally interested in business and investing. His father took small companies public, and talked about stocks. Jeremy was 14 when he opened a Schwab account and bought stocks with money earned mowing lawns or picking up pinecones.
When he arrived at the University of Illinois, he was interested in both finance and engineering. He thought the business majors looked like they were having fun, and the engineering majors looked like they were enduring torture. He chose engineering and graduated in 1999. 
Arriving in the valley
"I was interviewing for jobs really as the bubble was getting started," Stoppelman said. When he came out for an interview at a startup called@Home Network, a high-speed cable Internet service, he was struck by what he saw driving to the interview.
"I was driving down (Highway) 101, and I'd see these billboards for engineering tools, like FPGA (an integrated circuit). I thought, this is a very hard-core place if people can afford billboards to advertise esoteric technologies that the average person would have no clue about."
Within three weeks of being hired as a software engineer at@Home, he'd finished his work and found there was nothing else for him to do. "I'd go to my boss and say I was done. He'd say, 'OK, come back at 5.' I'd come back, and he'd be gone. It was a messed-up company."
He stayed for four months, all the while having his phone "ring every day with recruiters."
"I thought it was stupid to be with a big company," Stoppelman said. "I found my way to X.com (the precursor to PayPal), where I interviewed with Elon Musk. I didn't know these guys existed yet: the 28-year-old CEO, this senior guy who has the crazy twinkle in his eye, and he's telling me how his company is going to take down Visa and MasterCard. I'd just never seen this before. I thought of companies as big organizations that hired gray-haired CEOs. I was like, 'Whoa, I want to learn from this guy!' So I ended up as the third engineer hired. I stayed for 3 1/2 years."
When eBay purchased PayPal, Stoppelman was ready for something different, and he enrolled at Harvard Business School.
"I came back to San Francisco for the summer after my first year at Harvard and was originally going to work for Peter Thiel (the third PayPal founder, who had started a hedge fund called Clarium Capital). We had been in touch, and he said, 'We'll find something for you to do.' So I went to his office and was filling out paperwork, and Peter said, 'I was talking to Max (Levchin), and he has this new incubator thing brewing. So I went over to 650 Mission, and Max said, 'Great, hang out here. Just brainstorm until you come up with something.' "
Stoppelman had every intention of returning to Harvard in the fall.
"Jeremy was doing well in business school, and his goal was to get under his belt the basics of business theory so he could be a well-rounded CEO to start his own company," Levchin recalled. But "when Jeremy and Russ had this idea that came together over my birthday lunch, I said to Jeremy, 'You can hit the snooze button on the alarm clock of life, or this can be the big alarm.' I told him he was ready, and that this was a huge opportunity that - if he hit the snooze button - it would go away."
Stoppelman said, "When Max committed $1 million to us, to basically two guys with an idea, we had our 'Are you for real? Or are you a phony?' moment."
Stoppelman dropped out of Harvard. When Yelp was started in 2004, it was a social network built around asking friends for recommendations. 
"We got some early press on it," Stoppelman said, "but mostly people said it's a cool concept but in practice, it's still easier just to e-mail your friends directly." While disappointed, Stoppelman and Simmons began to look at how people had used the new site. They landed on something interesting.
A change in plans
"We had added a feature literally as an afterthought," Stoppelman said. "Russ asked me, 'Should we have a way people can write a review without being asked a question?' I said, 'Sure, no one is going to use it, but sure, tuck it in there.' What we found after the failed launch was that writing reviews was popular. We realized we had missed something there. We began to build a new site that was all about making review writing fun."
The new Yelp was launched in February 2005 and began to take off immediately. By June 2006, it had 1 million unique visitors per month.
"The site became popular in San Francisco, but then came the question of scalability," Stoppelman recalled. "People told us, 'Oh, this will work in San Francisco but not in a place like New York.' "
 Yelp was rolled out in Boston, then Chicago, then Los Angeles and New York. Very early on, they hit on the idea of a "Yelp Elite Squad," where the most prolific Yelpers were invited to social events. The gatherings, held sometimes once a week at bars and restaurants, turned an online experience into a community of like minds.
The problem Yelp faces today, Stoppelman noted, is the same problem that Google faces in its rankings. Several lawsuits have been filed by business owners against Yelp reviewers, and allegations of illegitimate reviews have dogged the company.
"You are going to have people who are unhappy with the reviews or the placement," Stoppelman said. "Rest assured, our engineers are working every day to make sure reviews are unbiased and accurate."
Daily routine unchanged
On a recent day, Stoppelman, who is unmarried and lives in the Marina, heads out on a walk along Crissy Field with Darwin. In slim-fitting jeans, slim blazer, a checked button-down and aviator shades, he said that while his life is dotted with crazy moments - the calls from Steve Jobs or the president - his daily existence hasn't changed much. 
His small desk at work is set in the midst of everyone else's. He still likes checking out new bars and restaurants, is a voracious reader of nonfiction (a recent book was "Moonwalking With Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything"), and he's taking an online course to learn how to play the guitar. His 30-year-old brother, Michael, is vice president of engineering at Yelp. And his mother was recently out for a visit. (His father died in 1998.)
Walking along the windswept path of Crissy Field, Stoppelman said he is looking now at "how big Yelp can be. We are a successful U.S. company. But can we be global? Will the things that work here work in Japan? In China? They all represent a different challenge."
Looking out at the sweeping Golden Gate Bridge, Stoppelman said, "As a kid, I harbored this fantasy of starting a company. I looked at the entrepreneur column in Forbes. I looked at it every month and thought, 'I want to be that guy.' "
The day Yelp went public is a day he'll never forget.
"It was this euphoric feeling of pushing the button to turn on the bell, and it was like that moment on the roller coaster going cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching, and then I'm on 'Squawk Box' and Jim Cramer is yelling at me and three panelists are hitting me with questions. It was high stress, but fun. My mom was up there with me on the platform. She was pretty fired up. I don't know if it gets much better than that."

What are they fighting about?   Jeremy Stoppelman, CEO and co-founder of YelpUpdated 74w ago · Featured in Forbes and Inc · Upvoted by  Saravanan Ganesh, Software Engineer at Google (2016-present) and  Jesse Collins, former Software Engineer Intern at Yelp (2016)I think at this point everyone can agree that Google Search (and it’s associated AdWords business) is a monopoly in every sense of the word. On the web they’re probably well over 70% of the market and on mobile it’s nearly 100%. While operating a monopoly is not illegal it does mean your operations and conduct are subject to additional rules, regulations, and scrutiny, primarily to ensure you’re not maintaining that monopoly illegally. From my perspective there is no question that Google is both harming consumers and illegally defending their monopoly by restricting distribution of key comp...

While most of us here know Yelp and well, Yelp only has unaided brand awareness of about 30% among digital adults in the US. Similarly, we only have about a third penetration among smartphone users. And we have about 20 million monthly users of our mobile app. That is a lot of opportunity to make more consumers aware of Yelp and get them using the Yelp app.On the local business front, there are about 20 million local businesses in the US and about 50 million in the countries where Yelp exists.

I'm really proud of the culture we've built and imho it's a very special place! Almost all of our managers and leadership team has been home grown and we pride ourselves on developing our own talent whenever possible. Our engineering internship program has been a huge success through the years and I think our on-campus reputation at top universities backs that up.

Unlike many other sites, our stance is quality over quantity when it comes to reviews. As a result, we only recommend about 71% of the reviews that are submitted. If advertisers could control their reviews, then you’d expect them all to have perfect 5-star ratings on Yelp. Spoiler alert: They don’t. To test this, do a few searches in broad categories in your area - maybe for a dentist, mattress, or locksmith. You’ll find ads for busi...

We have a range of controls in place to prevent this sort of thing, and my best guess is that we are far ahead of anyone else in the industry on this issue precisely because we’ve been in the spotlight for so long.  Many of our controls are obvious, like making sure that sales reps don’t have administrative access to post and remove reviews.  Others are a little less obv... (more) What's the solution to San Francisco's housing shortage?   Jeremy Stoppelman, CEO and co-founder of YelpAnswered 75w ago · Upvoted by  Andy Anderson, lives in San Francisco, CA and  Jay Wacker, lived in the Bay Area since 1998Build baby build. NIMBYs have dominated the development conversation in major cities across the nation. This problem is particularly acute in San Francisco where economic and population growth have been robust, but building hasn't remotely kept up. While anti-development groups and voices (often older and wealthier) have long been heard both at various city meetings and through voting, young people often don't vote and aren't particularly well organized. This ultimately means their views aren't fairly represented, which is why I've financially backed SFBARF a pro-renters group that advocate... (more) Are restaurants afraid to be unique and take risks because they're slaves to Yelp reviews?   Jeremy Stoppelman, CEO and co-founder of YelpAnswered 75w agoNate Silver did a study comparing Yelp restaurant ratings to Michelin (which relies on "professional critics") and found them to be quite similar. While Yelp represents a new way to get reliable recommendations on restaurants and other businesses, the idea of publicly critiquing is nothing new and Yelp is unlikely to have had a negative impact on the creativity of chefs and food entrepreneurs. If anything it gives a new and powerful way for non-traditional food providers like food trucks to market themselves since Yelp isn't limited to the high end.5.3k Views · 62 UpvotesWhat do you think of Google My Business listings and reviews?   Jeremy Stoppelman, CEO and co-founder of YelpAnswered 75w agoI think it's a weak product that generally does consumers a disservice. There are much more trusted and reliable ratings/review resources available across the web and mobile and it's a real shame that those options are buried under inferior house-owned Google results. Perhaps it's easiest to show by example. Let's take a popular new(ish) restaurant in San Francisco: Liholiho Yacht Club. Yelp has 683 detailed reviews (our ratings have meaty text explaining what's behind the stars) and over 2000 photos of the food, drinks, and business. Google+ Local's page has 40 "reviews" and 25% of these have... (more) What is Yelp's strategy for addressing businesses that offer incentives for positive reviews?   Jeremy Stoppelman, CEO and co-founder of YelpAnswered 75w agoWe have a number of ways of attacking this. The first line of defense is our recommendation algorithm. It can spot unusual activity and reviews are automatically moved to the not recommended section (off the page). Obviously if you're a business owner providing a valuable incentive for a positive review and those reviews don't stick to your business page, you won't be happy with the outcome and most likely, will stop doing it. We also run sting operations and will post evidence and a prominent "Consumer Alert" on the business' page.4.4k Views · 49 UpvotesHow can Yelp positively affect small business and help them grow?   Jeremy Stoppelman, CEO and co-founder of YelpAnswered 75w ago · Featured in HuffPostYelp levels the playing field between small local businesses and mass chains, allowing them to earn new customers based purely on doing an incredible job day in and out vs. simply having a massive advertising budget. Thanks to Yelp amazing local businesses now get free exposure just for having a great product and delivering good service. We know that 89% of Yelp users spend money at a local business within a week after searching on Yelp. That kind of purchase intent drives dollars directly to small businesses. And if they use the free tools we give them, like responding to reviews, business...

Hide this message.QuoraSign In Jeremy Stoppelman Yelp (company) BusinessJeremy Stoppelman: How is Yelp helping small businesses that have a good product but are low rated because of a small number of heavily biased reviews?UpdateCancelPromoted by MetadataAll you need to know to start doing account-based marketing.Create your first account-based marketing campaign using this simple step-by-step guide. Download now!Read More at metadata.ioAnswer Wiki1 Answer  George Weisgerber III, has advised small business owners & entrepreneurs, as well as Fortune 500 CEO'sAnswered 47w agoYelp provides an abundance of support to help small businesses engage with new and existing customers on their platform such as a dashboard filled with analytics, online ordering with no setup fee, a great mobile app, and more. If your business has a poor Yelp rating because of a few biased reviews, here are three steps you can take to improve it:ADDRESS THE “HEAVILY BIASED” REVIEWS: Below are my recommendations for addressing negative reviews, depending on the reason you feel they’re “heavily biased.”The Review Is Fake. Not only is the author not a customer, you believe they are a competitor, disgruntled employee, etc.Respond to the review publicly, with proof that the review is fake. Your reply should be professional & matter-of-fact. Take the highroad and don’t write anything that reflects negatively on you or your business. Remember you’re composing this response to inform your customers; not to insult your competition or former employee.Flag the review, by logging into either the Yelp for Business Owners mobile app or website, and clicking “report this review.” Provide as much relevant and factual information for the moderator that will be evaluating the validity of your claim. Follow up with an email to feedback@yelp.com.The Review is From An Actual Customer. Although you feel the review is totally biased and not-true; it was written by a one of your leads or customers.Send a private message to the customer who left the review. Respond diplomatically and thank the reviewer for their feedback, perhaps this is a simple misunderstanding that can be rectified, and possibly lead to the customer leaving an updated review.If that doesn’t work, respond publicly. Potential customers will get to read your side of the story, and see that your business is responsive to feedback.PROACTIVELY CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR POSITIVE REVIEWS. Now that you’ve addressed the BAD, you can start focusing on the GOOD :)Place a "Find us on Yelp" sign near the cash wrap, or a sticker in your window.Update your email signature by adding a yelp icon with a link to your page. Followed by, “the best compliment is a 5-star review”If you see a customer check-in on Yelp, Twitter, Foursquare or any other platform: Leave a comment thanking them for stopping by, and let them know you appreciate any feedback they can provide, followed by a link to your yelp page ;)KEEP EM’ COMING BACK FOR MORE A Harvard Study found that a one-star increase in a business’s Yelp rating, leads to 5–9% more revenue. So don’t stop, just because you’ve gotten a few good reviews to balance out those “heavily biased” ones. Be sure to respond to all new reviews ASAP and follow these three quick steps to attract new customers to your business via YelpMake sure you business’s address, hours, phone #, and website info are updatedUpload enticing images and videos of your businessYelp allows your business to be listed in up to three categories. Take advantage of all three. For instance, if you have a pizzeria that serves other dishes, and offers catering; be sure you’re listed under Italian Food and Catering, not just Pizza.I understand how frustrating it can be to read negative things about your business, especially heavily biased reviews. You didn’t invest your blood, sweat, tears and treasure into your small business, so some knucklehead could go disparage you online. Remember why you did though, to build something that’s yours, to do what you love, and to serve those customers who love your food, service, clothing, etc.George Weisgerber III www.localangel.nyc248 ViewsPromoted by ToptalGreat developers and designers are hard to find.Let Toptal match you with the top 3% of developers and designers for your next project.

How Yelp C.E.O. Jeremy Stoppelman Created a Revolutionary Product
He was just another gangly Web 2.0 kid with a good job in Silicon Valley (at PayPal) and a big dream: in his case, to launch an online successor to the Yellow Pages. But something funny happened shortly after Jeremy Stoppelman’s project, Yelp, went live: its users embraced the site’s “Write a review” feature to a degree far greater than anticipated. A few weeks of hasty re-coding later, Yelp was reconfigured to make reviewing its raison d’être, and Stoppelman has never looked back. Ten years after its founding, Yelp is the Web’s premier site and app for customer reviews—not just of restaurants, but of shops, kiosks, food trucks, parks, bus lines, funeral homes, D.M.V. offices, and even human attractions. (The Naked Cowboy in Times Square was averaging four stars out of five at press time.) Herewith, some info gleaned from a meandering conversation with the Yelp C.E.O., who turns 37 this November.HE IS himself an avid Yelper, reviewing under the profile name Big Papa. He has waxed enthusiastic over the Renaissance Salon in his current hometown of San Francisco (“My last haircut generated mucho complimentos” ) and panned Frankfurt’s airport (an “authentic interpretation of Dante’s Inferno” ).AMONG THE happiest discoveries he has made by perusing Yelp reviews is the existence of the Seward Street Slides, in San Francisco’s Castro district. “It’s basically these two concrete slides in a quiet, residential neighborhood,” he says. “You zip down them sitting on top of flattened cardboard boxes. I’d be curious to learn the history of these slides, because they’re, like, not at all safe.”HE INITIALLY resisted the push to name his company Yelp, because, to him, it sounded like “a sad cry for help.” He preferred the name Yocal (rhyming with “local” ).HE GREW up in the Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., the son of a securities lawyer and a teacher, and attended Langley High School, just down the road from the headquarters of the C.I.A. Among his schoolmates were a son of Antonin Scalia’s and some kids who were curiously vague about what their parents did for a living.HE IS—notwithstanding the fact that Google’s autocomplete function suggests the words “Jeremy Stoppelman Indian” when you enter his name into the search field—a Jewish American of European ancestry who attended a Reform temple as a child and had a Bar Mitzvah. He attributes the frequent misperception of his ethnicity to his “black hair and dark skin tone.”HE PLAYED tennis as a youth and was often told that he looked like Pete Sampras.HIS FIRST computer—his family’s, actually—was an Amiga 2000, a little-remembered late-80s high-end P.C. with “unbelievable sound and graphics capabilities” that, to this day, he feels doesn’t get its due.HIS YOUNGER brother, Michael, is Yelp’s vice president in charge of engineering. His older brother, Andy, two years his senior, died abruptly on the eve of his high-school graduation, in 1993, of a rare heart-rhythm disorder. That experience, Jeremy says, made him realize that “life is very short and you have to make the most of it.”HE IS frequently vilified by critics who claim that Yelp is a protection racket whose sales representatives shake down small-business owners, offering better placement of positive reviews (and/or the burying of negative reviews) in exchange for ad purchases—a charge that Stoppelman flatly denies, noting that all the lawsuits brought against Yelp to this effect have been dismissed.HE WAS called a “scumbag,” a “dick,” and “full of shit,” among other things, when he participated in a Reddit Ask Me Anything session last year. He did not respond in kind.HE ACCEPTS the invective hurled his way as the cost of creating a “disruptive, game-changing service or product,” likening the heat Yelp takes to that felt by Airbnb (vis-à-vis the hotel industry) and Uber (vis-à-vis the taxicab industry).HE HAS met three current or former heads of state: two U.S. presidents, Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, and the Taoiseach of Ireland, Enda Kenny.by Anonymousreply 610/02/2014

Yelp sucks. I reported a place as being closed (out of business) three times over a period of two months and they STILL are showing it as open. And they even posted reviews from people who SAY that it's closed. They're either morons or seriously understaffed.by Anonymousreply 310/01/2014
