U.S. Hispanic Market


Palladium is a leading private equity firm investing in lower-middle market companies with a focus on the fast growing $1.2 trillion U.S. Hispanic market. 
We believe our combination of experience investing in private equity, growing companies that benefit from the growth in the U.S. Hispanic market, and our active involvement in the U.S. Hispanic community provides a competitive advantage to source proprietary founder-owned businesses that we believe can benefit from the fast growth of the $1.2 trillion U.S. Hispanic market.

A strong commitment to the highest standards of business practices and ethics is essential to creating value for our stakeholders.
As a result, we have adopted the Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) investment guidelines endorsed by the Private Equity Growth Council in 2009. This set of comprehensive principles address environmental, health, safety, labor, governance and social issues and are applied in our business decisions prior to investing in companies and during our period of ownership. We are committed to these principles, which we believe support our goals to achieve sound investments, build stronger, more competitive companies and affirm Palladium’s objective to generate positive returns.

Nick Nicolay, President of Kar's, said, "The markets served by our company are complex and continue to evolve. Kar's believes passionately that this partnership will better position the organization to drive innovation, meet customer needs and most of all guarantee that our consumers will be able to find their favorite Kar's Nuts and Second Nature trail mix snacks wherever and whenever they want them. Our partnership with Palladium, with their deep experience in partnering with founder and family owned companies at important inflection points in their growth, will allow us to continue fulfilling this mission and maintain our core values as we accelerate our efforts to reach more consumers."

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3.

4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry

4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.
