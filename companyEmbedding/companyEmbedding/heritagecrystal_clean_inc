Compliance 















Our Approach 



We Don’t Bend the Rules About Regulatory Compliance
 















Hazardous and non-hazardous wastes must be managed properly. Environmental firms that bend the rules create significant risks for themselves and their customers.Heritage-Crystal Clean takes great pride in doing things right. We take compliance seriously and we intend to achieve an exceptional compliance record through careful diligence from our trained, professional employees and the various programs we have instituted to manage the collection, transportation and disposal of your used solvent products and wastes.




The Complete Package 



We ensure regulatory compliance through these benefits and features:Good People: Our employees can answer all your compliance inquiries and successfully complete various safety training programs.Financial Responsibility: We maintain insurance coverage for various contingencies in amounts in excess of the limits required by law.Sound Business: HCC is making continuing investments in new vehicles, new branches and new services and products..Regularly Scheduled Service: We show up when we promise. This reduces the volume of waste that our customers have onsite.Administrative Excellence: We provide preprinted, prepared forms for your review and signature and feature a centralized tracking system.Technical Competence: HCC employs trained professionals who are experts in profiling and sampling your waste products.




Reuse & Non-Hazardous Programs  



The “Better Way” of DisposalOur hallmark service, Parts Cleaning, is based on the awareness that our customers need to clean dirty parts but don’t wish to produce hazardous waste. To address this, we created the HCC Reuse and Non-Hazardous programs:










						Non-Hazardous Program					
CRYSTAL CLEAN’s Non-Hazardous Program provides our customers with Premium high flashpoint, low odor mineral spirits and removal & management of the used mineral spirits as non-hazardous waste.Thousands of customers have switched to the HCC Parts Cleaning Service and are enjoying not only the cost savings, but reduced paperwork, a safer workplace and greater concern for the environment.Why not join them?






						Reuse Program					
We provide top quality, premium solvent on our regular, scheduled visits and remove the used solvent as a product — not a waste — to be used as an ingredient in a manufacturing process. This unique approach provides substantial benefits for our customers over the old method of waste disposal:The HCC Reuse Program reduces the amount of hazardous waste generated, thereby reducing manifesting and other regulatory reporting requirements.The HCC Reuse Program results in true waste minimization as encouraged by the Environmental Protection Agency and other environmental groups. More than 30 state environmental agencies have agreed in writing that the HCC Reuse Program is a correct and environmentally sound method of managing used solvent.In fact, we’re so good at it, that we’ve boiled it down to 10 easy steps!Premium solvents are delivered to your location.As needed, a sample of your used solvent is submitted to an analytical laboratory.The sample is evaluated for the HCC Reuse Program.You review and sign off on prepared paperwork.An experienced HCC service rep collects the used solvent and transports it in a fully licensed HCC service truck.The product is transported to the nearest HCC branch location.The product is shipped to one of HCC’s regional bulking facilities.The product is again tested to verify that it meets the end user’s specifications.The product is delivered and used as a manufacturing ingredient.HCC maintains detailed records of each transaction.

The current standard requires all employers to have a hazard communication program for workers exposed to hazardous chemicals. The program includes materials such as container labels, safety data sheets, and employee training.

Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc. Announces 2016 Third Quarter Financial ResultsBack to HCCI Snapshot

Share Story5:29PM ET 10/19/2016 Globe NewswireELGIN, Ill., Oct.  19, 2016  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc. (Nasdaq: HCCI), a leading provider of parts cleaning, used oil re-refining, and hazardous and non-hazardous waste services primarily focused on small and mid-sized customers, today announced results for the third quarter and first three quarters of fiscal 2016, which ended September 10, 2016.
Third quarter and year-to-date highlights include:Revenues decreased 1.0%, to $81.9 million, compared to $82.7 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.  Year-to-date revenues decreased 3.5%, to $240.9 million, compared to $249.7 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2015.  The year-over-year decrease in revenue was primarily due to the decline in oil product pricing, and specifically the approximate 11% decline in the market price for the type of base oil we sell. Our 2016 third quarter EBITDA was $8.0 million.  For the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, EBITDA decreased 15.3% to $17.5 million compared to the first three quarters of 2015.  Our Environmental Services segment includes parts cleaning, containerized waste, and vacuum services.  During the third quarter, Environmental Services revenues decreased $0.8 million, or 1.6%, compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015.  Environmental Services revenues decreased $1.9 million, or 1.2%, for the first three quarters of 2016 compared to the first three quarters of 2015.  Average revenues per working day in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 in our Environmental Services segment were approximately $885,000, compared to $900,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.   Our Oil Business segment includes used oil collection activities, sales of recycled fuel oil, and re-refining activities.  During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, Oil Business revenues of $30.6 million were flat compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015.  During the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, Oil Business revenues decreased $6.9 million, to $84.8 million from $91.7 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2015.  The revenue decrease was mainly due to lower selling prices for our base oil and RFO products, which was partially offset by higher base oil volume sold. The decline in revenue was further offset by increased revenue from used oil collection charges and stop fees of approximately $13 million during the first three quarters of 2016.  During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the average spot market price for the type of lubricating base oil we produce declined over 11% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2015.  However, the average spot market price during the third quarter was up approximately 10% compared to the second quarter of fiscal 2016. During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we produced base oil at a rate of 92% of the nameplate capacity of our re-refinery, which was a slightly lower rate compared to the two prior quarters in fiscal 2016.  The decreased production rate was mainly due to a planned, extended shutdown during the fiscal third quarter. SG&A expense for the third quarter of fiscal 2016 was $11.6 million compared to $10.7 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2015.  In the first three quarters of fiscal 2016, SG&A expense was $36.9 million, compared to $33.9 million in the first three quarters of fiscal 2015.  The increase in SG&A expense was due to unusually high legal expenses of $2.1 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and $5.5 million for the first three quarters of fiscal 2016.  The majority of these legal expenses pertain to matters stemming from our acquisition of FCC Environmental, including expenses incurred in connection with arbitration claims brought against the sellers of FCC Environmental in order to enforce our rights under the stock purchase agreement.  We are seeking reimbursement for legal fees incurred in these matters. Net income attributable to common shareholders for the third quarter was $2.3 million compared to net income attributable to common shareholders of $2.7 million for the year earlier quarter.  Income per share was $0.10 in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to $0.12 in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.  Net income attributable to common shareholders for the first three quarters was $2.4 million compared to net income attributable to common shareholders of $3.7 million for the first three quarters of fiscal 2015.  Net income per share was $0.11 in the first three quarters of fiscal 2016 compared to net income per share of $0.17 in the first three quarters of fiscal 2015. The Company's Founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer, Joe Chalhoub, commented, "We are pleased with the continued improvement in the profitability of our Oil Business segment over the last two quarters.  During the third quarter we realized the benefit of an improvement in our base oil spread due primarily to higher base oil selling prices and a small improvement in our average used oil collection charge."Chalhoub added, "While revenue in our Environmental Services segment continued to be under pressure in the third quarter due to decreased activity at customers in and around the energy sector, we expect to generate revenue growth in this segment during the fourth quarter.  Given the lack of revenue growth in the segment, we are especially pleased with our improvement in operating margin for the quarter."Mark DeVita, Chief Financial Officer, stated, "We saw improved operating margin percentages in both of our business segments during the third quarter.  During the third quarter our profit before corporate SG&A expense in the Environmental Services segment was 29.4% compared to 28.7% in the third quarter of fiscal 2015.  In our Oil Business segment our profit before corporate SG&A expense was 5.7% compared to 2.1% in the third quarter of fiscal 2015."DeVita added, "We are also pleased to report our cash flow from operations was approximately $9.6 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2016.  Our cash balance at the end of the quarter was $29.8 million, which represents a $4.5 million increase compared to the end of the second quarter."DeVita also added, "Our net income attributable to common shareholders during the third quarter was negatively impacted by legal fees and other expenses stemming from our acquisition of FCC Environmental.  We believe a majority of the legal fees and other expenses stemming from our acquisition of FCC Environmental have now been recognized.  Excluding the impact of these expenses our adjusted net income attributable to common shareholders for the third quarter would have been $0.22 per share."Safe Harbor StatementAll references to the "Company," "we," "our," and "us" refer to Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc., and its subsidiaries.This release contains forward-looking statements that are based upon current management expectations.

interest expense, depreciation and amortization.  We have presented EBITDA because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our performance and believe it is frequently used by analysts, investors, our lenders and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry.  Management uses EBITDA as a measurement tool for evaluating our actual operating performance compared to budget and prior periods.  Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA differently than we do.  EBITDA is not a measure of performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net income prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP.  Some of these limitations are:      EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;   EBITDA does not reflect interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt;   EBITDA does not reflect tax expense or the cash requirements necessary to pay for tax obligations; and   Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.   We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using EBITDA only as a supplement.     (b) Legal fees incurred to resolve routine and non-routine matters stemming from the acquisition of FCC Environmental and International Petroleum Corp.  (c) Fines and restitution related to activities at FCC Environmental and International Petroleum Corp. prior to our acquisition of these companies.  (d) Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for certain non-cash or infrequently occurring items such as:   (1) Acquisition and integration costs related to the purchase of FCC Environmental, which are included in SG&A   (2) Non-cash compensation expenses which are recorded in SG&A  (e) The write down of inventory values resulted in lower carrying costs for certain types of inventories.  Depending on various factors, it is possible that these lower inventory values may result in lower cost of sales in future periods and thereby positively impact profitability in future periods. We have presented Adjusted EBITDA because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our performance and believe it may be used by analysts, investors, our lenders, and other interested parties in the evaluation of our performance.  Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do.  Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net income prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP.  Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures.  Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Management believes that adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share provide investors and management useful information about the earnings impact of certain legal fees, restitution, and fines.     Reconciliation of our Net Earnings and Net Earnings Per Share Determined in Accordance with U.S. GAAP to

(HCCI), a leading provider of parts cleaning, used oil re-refining, and hazardous and non-hazardous waste services primarily focused on small and mid-sized customers, today announced results for the second quarter which ended June 17, 2017.Second Quarter ReviewRevenue for the second quarter of 2017 was $86.4 million compared to $80.6 million for the same quarter of 2016, an increase of 7.2%.Operating margin increased to 22.9% from 19.3% in the second quarter of 2016 due to significant improvements in the spreads in our oil business segment, lower disposal costs, and lower expenses for workers' compensation compared to the year-ago quarter. Our second quarter SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue decreased to 13.2% from 15.3% in the second quarter of 2016 mainly due to significantly lower legal fees compared to the prior year.Net income attributable to common shareholders for the second quarter was $6.9 million compared to net income attributable to common shareholders of $1.8 million in the year earlier quarter. Basic earnings per share was a record $0.31 in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to earnings per share of $0.08 in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Earnings during the second quarter of 2017 include a $3.6 million pre-tax benefit due to a settlement received during the second quarter of 2017.SegmentsOur Environmental Services segment includes parts cleaning, containerized waste, vacuum services, antifreeze recycling, and field services. Environmental Services revenues were $55.1 million during the quarter compared to $52.4 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2016. Environmental Services operating margin was 30.3%, our highest ever for a 12-week quarter, compared to 28.8% in 2016, primarily due to lower disposal costs and lower expenses for workers' compensation.President and CEO Brian Recatto commented, "As we continue to increase our revenue growth rate, we are working hard to better leverage our existing assets to mitigate the margin impact of additional costs to grow the business in this segment."Our Oil Business segment includes used oil collection activities, sales of recycled fuel oil, and re-refining activities. During the second quarter of fiscal 2017, Oil Business revenues increased 11.3% to $31.3 million compared to $28.1 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. The revenue increase was mainly driven by higher pricing for our base oil products, partially offset by lower used oil collection charges. Oil Business segment operating margin was 9.9% in the second quarter of 2017 compared to 1.6% in the second quarter of fiscal 2016, with the improvement primarily due to higher spreads on our base oil products.Brian Recatto commented, "We are pleased that improved base oil pricing has allowed us to achieve nearly double-digit operating margin in this segment for the first time since we began operating the re-refinery."Settlement UpdateOn March 8, 2017 we entered into a settlement agreement with the sellers of FCC Environmental pertaining to all matters in arbitration which were not covered by the partial arbitration award we received in the first quarter of 2017. Under the terms of this agreement the sellers of FCC Environmental agreed to pay us $8.6 million in two equal installments. The first installment of $4.3 million was received in the first quarter of 2017 and was used to reduce an existing receivable.  We received the second installment of $4.3 million in the second quarter of 2017.  A portion of the second installment was applied to a receivable and the remaining amount of approximately $3.6 million was recorded as a gain in the second quarter.Safe Harbor StatementAll references to the “Company,” “we,” “our,” and “us” refer to Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc., and its subsidiaries.This release contains forward-looking statements that are based upon current management expectations.

net income before provision for income taxes, interest income, interest expense, depreciation and amortization.  We have presented EBITDA because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our performance and believe it is frequently used by analysts, investors, our lenders and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry.  Management uses EBITDA as a measurement tool for evaluating our actual operating performance compared to budget and prior periods.  Other companies in our industry may calculate EBITDA differently than we do.  EBITDA is not a measure of performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net income prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP.  Some of these limitations are:           EBITDA does not reflect our cash expenditures, or future requirements, for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;           EBITDA does not reflect interest expense or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt;           EBITDA does not reflect tax expense or the cash requirements necessary to pay for tax obligations; and           Although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and EBITDA does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements.           We compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our U.S. GAAP results and using EBITDA only as a supplement.         (b) Legal fees incurred to resolve routine and non-routine matters stemming from the acquisition of FCC Environmental and International Petroleum Corp.         (c) Gain from partial award for claims made in our arbitration related to our acquisition of FCC Environmental and International Petroleum Corp. in 2014.         (d) Settlement of disputes related to the acquisition of FCC Environmental and International Petroleum Corp. of Delaware.          (e) Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for certain non-cash or infrequently occurring items such as:            (1) Non-cash compensation expenses which are recorded in SG&A         (f) The write down of inventory values resulted in lower carrying costs for certain types of inventories.  Depending on various factors, it is possible that these lower inventory values may result in lower cost of sales in future periods and thereby positively impact profitability in future periods.           We have presented Adjusted EBITDA because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our performance and believe it may be used by analysts, investors, our lenders, and other interested parties in the evaluation of our performance.  Other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do.  Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance under U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for net income prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP.  Adjusted EBITDA has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under U.S. GAAP.        Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures               Adjusted net earnings (loss) and adjusted net earnings (loss) per share are non-GAAP financial measures.  Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as substitute for, financial measures prepared in accordance with GAAP.  Management believes that adjusted net earnings and adjusted net earnings per share provide investors and management useful information about the earnings impact of the settlement received in the second fiscal quarter of 2017.                         Reconciliation of our Net Earnings and Net Earnings Per Share Determined

About Us

Heritage Crystal Clean is the second largest provider of parts cleaning services in the U.S. and a leading provider of containerized waste services focused on small to mid-sized customers. HCCI's services allow customers to outsource their management of regulated wastes, enabling them to focus on their core businesses and helping them remain in compliance with complex regulations. HCCI currently operates out of 67 branches serving more than 44,000 customers. In addition to parts cleaning, containerized waste and vacuum truck services, HCCI is accelerating the number of branches offering used oil collection. HCCI is building a used oil re-refinery with the capacity to recycle approximately 50 million gallons of used oil feedstock and produce about 30 million gallons of lubricating base oil per year. The re-refinery provides HCCI with both economic and environmental competitive advantages. Rerefining is considered the "best and highest use" of used oil because it conserves and reuses a valuable resource, reduces pollution and is energy efficient. In addition to re-refining, HCCI's continuing growth strategy includes geographic expansion as well as the introduction of new service offerings. Heritage Crystal Clean, Inc. is publicly-traded on the NASDAQ Global Market under the ticker symbol HCCI.
					



Heritage Environmental Services is one of the country's premier privately held comprehensive environmental services firms, with more than 40 years experience. Heritage's owned and operated facilities, logistics network and customized programs allow them to service over 10,000 customer sites throughout the United States. Heritage's services include waste treatment, incineration and disposal, a nationwide network
for transportation, onsite services, industrial maintenance, lab pack services, laboratory testing, by-product management, dedicated research and development, product recovery and product manufacturing.
					

						From comprehensive services to industry-changing R&D solutions, Heritage is dedicated to finding innovative reuse and recycling options, developing better standards and creating new technologies that will benefit the environmental management needs of its customers. Sustainability is important to any company, and Heritage’s goal is to be a trusted partner by providing a single source for the resolution of environmental challenges.
					



Heritage Interactive Services is just one of the companies created by Heritage Environmental Services in its long history of looking to the future, creating new solutions, innovative approaches, better technologies, and services that promote enduring customer relationships.
Since 2000, Heritage Interactive Services has been improving upon the concept that waste materials are not worthless. We believe used, but not used up, materials of all types should be recognized as by-products having some basic value. We work to reduce, repurpose, reuse or recycle materials before disposal is considered. Heritage Interactive Services has evolved from being a waste disposal manager for our customers, to becoming their "By-Product Solution Partner."

A Solid Company that Knows Its Business 

















Heritage-Crystal Clean is a leader in the environmental services market, providing the smart alternative. We are clearly focused on our customers and their needs. We’re increasing our service coverage and maintaining the passion for customer service that HCC is renowned for.


































Mission Statement 



Heritage-Crystal Clean strives to build upon our history and experience in the industry to provide effective and environmentally conscious solutions that make a difference to our customers. At the heart of this is a dedication to service, safety and environmental and regulatory excellence.






















Our History 




















 

1980’s Heritage Environmental Services established a division to concentrate on the service needs of smaller customers. This division, known as Crystal Clean, began providing parts cleaning and used oil collection services to customers in Indianapolis, Indiana and gradually expanded to several other cities in the Midwest. 



1980’s 


 

1990’s During the 1990s, the Crystal Clean division expanded into markets in Texas and Louisiana as the result of a business venture with a major branded motor oil company. By the late 1990s, the Crystal Clean division was offering services to small to mid-sized customers in roughly a dozen metropolitan area. 



1990’s 


 

1999 In 1999, the parent of Heritage Environmental Services and Joseph Chalhoub, our Founder, agreed to form a new company, Heritage-Crystal Clean, LLC, and to contribute the business assets of the Crystal Clean division to this new company. Mr. Chalhoub invested in the new company, became its first President and CEO, and recruited a team of seasoned industry professionals to join our company and implement plans for growth. 



1999 


 

2008 On March 12, 2008 Heritage-Crystal Clean, Inc. completed a successful initial public offering and began listing its stock on the NASDAQ stock exchange under the symbol, HCCI. 



2008 


 

2010 In June 2010 the company completes its first follow-on public equity offering. The offering raises over $20 million to help fund initial capital expenditures to support the construction of a re-refinery in Indianapolis, Indiana. 



2010 


 

2012 In January of 2012 Heritage-Crystal Clean, LLC begins full operation of its used oil re-refinery in Indianapolis, Indiana by producing primarily high-quality Group II lubricating base oil. The initial nameplate capacity of the facility was 50 million gallons per year of output. 



2012 


 

2012 In April of 2012 the company completes a follow-on public equity offering. The offering rates approximately $65 million, a majority of which is used to pay down debt and fund the additional capital expenditures which were undertaken to complete the re-refinery in Indianapolis, Indiana.  



2012 


 

2014 In October of 2014 Heritage-Crystal Clean, LLC acquires FCC Environmental for an initial price of approximately $88 MM (which later was adjusted downward to $83 MM). This provides the company the opportunity to add significant density in its route service business in the southern and eastern U.S. as well as provide increased used oil feedstock for an expanding re-refinery. 



2014 


 

2015 In September 2015 we completed an expansion of the nameplate capacity at our re-refinery in Indianapolis, Indiana from 50 million to 75 million gallons per year. 



2015 


 

2016 In March 2016 the company announces that it has led the industry in successfully moving from paying generators to collect their used oil to charging customers to remove this regulated material. 



2016 


 

2017 On January 31, 2017 the Founder and CEO of the company, Joe Chalhoub, retires. Joe is officially replaced the following day, February 1, 2017, by Brian Recatto.  



2017 



















 

















Brian Recatto 



President & CEO 



Mr. Brian Recatto was appointed Heritage-Crystal Clean’s President and Chief Executive Officer in February 2017. He has served as a Director on our Board since July 2012 and was Lead Director in 2016. From 2014 to January 2017, Mr. Recatto served as President, U.S. Operations for Gibson Energy Inc.  He joined Gibson Energy through its acquisition of OMNI Energy Services, where he had served in various executive positions since 2007, including Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, and President and Chief Executive Officer.  Prior to joining OMNI, Mr. Recatto held senior executive positions with Charles Holston Inc., Philip Services Corporation and Meklo Inc.  Early in his career, he founded EMRAS Inc.  He has over 30 years of experience in the environmental and industrial waste management services sector.  Mr. Recatto holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Finance from Louisiana State University.
