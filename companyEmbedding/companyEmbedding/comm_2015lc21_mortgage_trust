                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Date of Release: May 12, 2017
DBRS Confirms All Classes of COMM 2015-LC21 Mortgage Trust


May 12, 2017







DBRS Limited (DBRS) has today confirmed all classes of Commercial Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2015-LC21 issued by COMM 2015-LC21 Mortgage Trust as follows:

-- Class A-1 at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-2 at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-SB at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-3 at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-4 at AAA (sf)
-- Class A-M at AAA (sf)
-- Class X-A at AAA (sf)
-- Class B at AA (low) (sf)
-- Class X-B at A (sf)
-- Class C at A (low) (sf)
-- Class X-C at BBB (sf)
-- Class D at BBB (low) (sf)
-- Class X-D at BB (sf)
-- Class E at BB (low) (sf)
-- Class X-E at B (sf)
-- Class F at B (low) (sf)

All trends are Stable. DBRS does not rate the first loss piece, Class G.

The rating confirmations reflect the overall stable performance of the transaction, which has remained in line with DBRS�s expectations since issuance. The collateral consists of 103 loans secured by 198 commercial properties; as of the April 2017 remittance, the pool has experienced collateral reduction of 1.3% because of scheduled amortization, with all of the original loans remaining in the pool. Thirteen loans, representing 24.9% of the pool balance, including six loans in the Top 15, were structured with full interest-only (IO) terms at issuance, while an additional 40 loans, representing 36.9% of the pool balance, were structured with partial IO periods. As of the April 2017 remittance, 26 loans, representing 26.8% of the pool balance, have remaining partial-IO terms ranging from one to 37 months. Based on the most recent year-end (YE) reporting for the underlying loans, the pool reported a weighted-average (WA) debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and WA Debt Yield of 2.10 times (x) and 10.7%, respectively. At issuance, the pool reported a WA DSCR and WA debt yield of 1.70x and 10.4%, respectively, with a WA DBRS Term DSCR and WA DBRS Debt Yield of 1.58x and 8.6%, respectively. 

As of the April 2017 remittance, there are no loans in special servicing and seven loans, representing 4.2% of the pool balance, on the servicer�s watchlist. One loan (Prospectus ID#35 - Shoppes of Beavercreek, 1.1% of the pool balance) was watchlisted because of its retail tenant bankruptcy exposure and was analyzed with a stressed cash flow to reflect the increased risk. Two loans (1.5% of the pool balance) were watchlisted because of structural triggers but are performing in line with DBRS�s expectations at issuance. The four remaining loans are being monitored for a low DSCR.

At issuance, DBRS shadow-rated the largest loan, Courtyard by Marriott Portfolio (Prospectus ID#1, 7.4% of the pool balance) investment grade. DBRS has today confirmed that the performance of these loans remains consistent with investment-grade loan characteristics.

DBRS has provided updated loan-level commentary and analysis for larger and/or pivotal watchlisted loans, as well as for the largest 15 loans in the pool, in the DBRS commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) IReports platform. Registration is free. To view these and future loan-level updates provided as part of DBRS�s ongoing surveillance for this transaction, please register or log in at www.ireports.dbrs.com

February 29, 2016
Management�s Report on Assessment of Compliance
with Regulation AB Servicing Criteria

1.CWCapital Asset Management LLC (�CWCAM�) is responsible for assessing compliance with applicable servicing criteria,
set forth in Item 1122(d) of Regulation AB of the Securities and Exchange Commission, for all commercial mortgage-backed securitization
transactions publicly-issued pursuant to a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 on or after January 1, 2006,
wherein the Company provides special servicer activities (the Platform), except for servicing criteria 1122(d)(1)(iii), 1122(d)(3)(i)(b), 1122(d)(3)(i)(c), 1122(d)(3)(i)(d), 1122(d)(3)(ii), 1122(d)(3)(iii),
1122(d)(3)(iv), 1122(d)(4)(v), 1122(d)(4)(ix), 1122(d)(4)(x), 1122(d)(4)(xi), 1122(d)(4)(xii), 1122(d)(4)(xiii),  1122(d)(4)(xiv),  and
1122(d)(4)(xv),  which the Company has determined are not applicable to the activities it performs with respect to the Platform,
as of and for the twelve months ended December 31,  2015 (Applicable Servicing Criteria). With respect to applicable servicing criteria
1122(d)(1)(ii),  1122(d)(1)(v),  1122(d)(2)(vi), 1122(d)(4)(i), 1122(d)(4)(iii),  and 1122(d)(4)(iv),  the Company has determined that
there were no activities performed during the twelve months ended December 31,  2015,  with respect to the Platform,  because there
were no occurrences of events that would require the Company to perform such activities. Appendix A to Management�s Report
on Assessment of Compliance with Regulation AB Servicing Criteria (the �Assessment�) identifies the individual asset-backed
transactions and securities defined by management as constituting the Platform. Appendix B to this Assessment notes the Applicable
Servicing Criteria.

2.CWCAM has assessed its compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria as of December 31, 2015
and for the period from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2015 (�the Reporting Period�). In making this assessment, management
used the criteria set forth by the Securities and Exchange Commission in paragraph (d) of item 1122 of Regulation AB.

3.Based on such assessment, management believes that as of December 31, 2015, and for Reporting Period, CWCAM has complied in
all material respects with the Applicable Servicing Criteria set forth in Item 1122(d) with respect to the Platform.
KPMG LLP, an independent registered public accounting
firm, has issued an attestation report on CWCAM�s compliance with the Applicable Servicing Criteria as of December 31, 2015,

Approximately $1.03 billion of Structured Securities Affected

RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the six P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable 
ranges.




The rating on the IO class, class X-A, was affirmed 
based on the credit performance (or the weighted average rating factor 
or WARF) of its referenced classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 4.7% 
of the current balance. Moody's provides a current list of 
base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions on moodys.com 
at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The principal methodology used in these ratings was "Approach to Rating 
US and Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014. 
Please see the Ratings Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 48, 
the same as at securitization




DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the May 12, 2016 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 0.6% to $1.31 
billion from $1.32 billion at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 103 mortgage loans ranging in size 
from less than 1% to 7.4% of the pool, with 
the top ten loans constituting 34.4% of the pool. 
One loan, constituting 7.4% of the pool, has 
an investment-grade structured credit assessments.




One loan, constituting 0.6% of the pool, is 
on the master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes 
loans that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part 
of the CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As 
part of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




Moody's received full or partial year 2014 operating results for 88% 
of the pool. Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 118.2%, 
compared to 118.9% at securitization. Moody's 
conduit component excludes loans with structured credit assessments, 
defeased and CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. 
Moody's net cash flow (NCF) reflects a weighted average haircut 
of 14.2% to the most recently available net operating income 
(NOI). Moody's value reflects a weighted average capitalization 
rate of 9.5%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.45X and 0.90X, 
respectively, compared to 1.46X and 0.90X at securitization. 
Moody's actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and the loan's 
actual debt service. Moody's stressed DSCR is based on Moody's 
NCF and a 9.25% stress rate the agency applied to the loan 
balance.




The loan with a structured credit assessment is the Courtyard by Marriott 
Portfolio Loan ($97 million -- 7.4% of the pool), 
which is secured by a fee simple and leasehold interests in 65 Courtyard 
by Marriott hotel properties located across 29 states. The properties 
were built between 1985 and 1990 and contain a total of 9,590 guestrooms. 
The total loan has an original principal balance of $670 million, 
consisting of a senior tranche in the amount of $315 million and 
a junior tranche in the amount of $355 million. The Senior 
Tranche is comprised of four pari passu notes. Only the non-controlling 
Note A-2B with an original principal balance of $97.05 
million is included and pooled in this trust. The non-controlling 
Note A-2A, with an original principal balance of $100.0 
million, was included in the COMM 2015-CCRE23 trust while 
the non-controlling Note A-1, with an original principal 
balance of $33.5 million, was also included in COMM 
2015-CCRE23 trust as a non-pooled component. The 
remaining Note A-2C, with an original balance of $84.45 
million, was included in the GSMS 2015-GC30 trust. 
The Junior Tranche is evidenced by the controlling Note B with an original 
principal balance of $355 million which is included in COMM 2015-CCRE23. 
Moody's structured credit assessment and stressed DSCR are aa2 (sca.pd) 
and 2.52X, respectively, the same as at securitization.




The top three conduit loans represent 11.9% of the pool 
balance. The largest loan is the Courtyard by Marriott Pasadena 
Loan ($72.7 million -- 5.5% of the pool), 
which is secured by a fee simple interest in a 314-guestroom, 
limited-service hotel located in Pasadena, CA. Built 
in 2000, the Property's improvements are comprised of a single, 
six-story building and an eight-level parking garage containing 
432 spaces. The Property underwent a $5.3 million 
($16,756 per key) PIP renovation in 2013, of which 
approximately $4.1 million was spent on guestroom improvements 
and $1.3 million was spent on common area and amenity improvements. 
As of April 30, 2015, the Property's 12-month 
average occupancy rate and ADR were 90.6% and $165.81, 
respectively, which equates to a RevPAR of $150.14. 
The subject's demand segmentation is comprised of approximately 
65% commercial, 20% leisure and 15% meeting 
and group business. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 138.5% 
and 0.86X, respectively, compared to 140.5% 
and 0.85X at securitization.




The second largest loan is Meridian at Brentwood Loan ($42.3 
million -- 3.2% of the pool), which is secured 
by the borrower's fee simple interest in two, Class A mixed-use 
buildings and one parking garage located in Brentwood, MO, 
which is approximately 15 miles west of the St. Louis CBD. 
The Property's two commercial structures are seven and three stories 
tall and contain approximately 242,235 square feet (SF) of office 
and ground floor retail space. As of December 31st, 2014, 
the Property was 100.0% occupied by 10 tenants. The 
three largest tenants in occupancy are BJC Health System (57.0% 
of NRA, lease expiration of December 2025), Missouri College 
(16.2% of NRA, lease expiration of December 2018) 
and EverBank (8.1% of NRA, lease expiration of September 
2017). Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 137.1% and 
0.85X, respectively, the same as at securitization.




The third largest loan is the 155 Mercer Street Loan ($41 million 
-- 3.1% of the pool), which is secured by the 
borrower's fee simple interest a three-story, single-tenant 
retail building located in the SoHo neighborhood of New York, NY. 
The Property contains 14,589 SF of rentable area, of which 
approximately 4,452 SF is below grade level, 3,857 SF 
is at grade level, 3,506 SF consists of second floor space, 
and 2,774 SF consists of third floor space. As of June 6th, 
2015, the Property was 100% occupied by Dolce & Gabbana 
pursuant to a lease that expires in November 2022 and does not provide 
for any renewal or termination options. The sponsor is Joseph Sitt 
of Thor Equities. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 129.8% 
and 0.69X, respectively, the same as at securitization.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.

How cash-out refinancing works



The cash out refinance is designed to accomplish two goals — to improve on the terms of an existing home loan and deliver additional funds at a low interest rate. Other types of mortgage refinance include the rate and term refinance, in which the new loan amount is equal to the remaining balance on the old mortgage, and the limited cash out refinance, in which the closing costs are added wrapped into the new loan, increasing its balance.It only makes sense to undertake a cash-out refinance if the new loan comes with a better refinance rate or more favorable terms (replacing an adjustable rate home loan with a fixed rate mortgage, for example).

Refinance with cash out: conforming loans
It is important to note that cash out refinancing generally costs more than rate and term or limited cash out refinancing. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, for example, require lenders to collect surcharges for these loans (called “conforming” mortgages) because they are considered riskier.
The added costs of cash out refinancing can be substantial and should be considered carefully. If, for example, a homeowner wishes to refinance a $200,000 mortgage and take an additional $10,000 cash out, there may be no extra costs (the new loan amount is less than 60 percent of the home’s value and the borrower has a 700 FICO score, for example). On the other hand, if the homeowner has a 650 FICO and the new loan amount is 83 percent of the property value, it would cost an extra $6,300 to borrow $10,000!
In general, cash out refinancing is likely to be the lowest cost option when the amount of additional cash is relatively high. In the above example, the added costs come to 63 percent of the amount borrowed. If the homeowner were to take $100,000 cash out, however, the added costs come to nine percent of the amount borrowed — a considerably lower figure. The chart below shows the added costs, which depend on the borrower’s credit score and the loan-to-value ratio. Notice cash out is limited to 85 percent of the property value.




What is cash-out refinancing?
A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

Glossary Terms
​ Cash-Out Refinancing

A refinance in which the new loan amount exceeds the total needed to pay off the existing mortgage. The difference goes to the borrower and can be used for any purpose.

​ Equity

The difference between the fair market value of an asset (like a home) and the amount of debt against that asset (like a mortgage balance).

​  Rate and Term Refinancing

A mortgage refinance that replaces the existing mortgage with a new one but does not disburse cash to the borrower. Rate and term refinancing is undertaken simply to improve on the terms of the old loan – reducing the interest rate is a popular goal.

​  Refinance 

Refinancing means replacing one loan with a new, better loan. Improving the terms of a loan can mean obtaining a lower interest rate, a lower monthly payment, replacing an adjustable or variable rate loan with a fixed-rate loan or increasing the size of the loan and taking the difference in cash.

Cash-Out Refinance Pros
Cash out refinancing offers a few advantages over other sources of funds:

Because it’s secured by real estate, the interest rate is lower than rates for unsecured financing.
Because it’s a first mortgage, the interest rate is lower than rates for home equity loans, which are usually second mortgages.
The interest may be tax-deductible. Check with a tax pro.



Cash-Out Refinance Cons

Underwriting guidelines are stricter than for rate and term refinancing.
Costs are higher because surcharges are assessed against the entire refinance, not just the amount of cash out.
Cash out refinancing takes longer than setting up a home equity loan or personal (unsecured) loan.
Increasing the loan-to-value to over 80 percent requires mortgage insurance.







 



Alternatives to cash-out refinancing
Homeowners considering a cash out refinance should compare the costs of all available options:

Rate and term refinance plus a home equity loan (if terms of existing loan can be bettered)
Adding just a home equity loan (if existing loan cannot be improved)
Taking a personal loan (if credit rating is good and costs are low)
Consolidating debt with a debt management plan or balance transfer card

Cash out refinancing is a valid strategy for financing anything from college tuition to debt consolidation to home improvements. However, homeowners should run the numbers and consider the total cost of borrowing — lender fees, interest rates and third party costs — before committing.

Will you save money by refinancing your current loan?
A mortgage refinance can mean big savings, but it may come at a price in the short term. The decision to refinance generally comes down to whether you'll be in your home long enough for your monthly savings to outweigh the upfront refinancing costs. Our Refinance Calculator can help you determine the amount of time you'll need to stay in your home after refinancing your mortgage to breakeven and cover your costs.

Breakeven Analysis







                                    Monthly Payment
                                    ?
There are several ways to calculate your refinance breakeven. The "quick and dirty" method involves dividing the difference in your monthly payment by the refinancing costs. That isn't necessarily the most accurate method, and the longer you've been paying your current loan, the less accurate that breakeven calculation is. In addition, this method won't help you if your refinancing from a 30-year mortgage to a 15-year loan.










                                    Interest Expense
                                    ?
The next method is based on the difference in  interest expense between your current loan and a refinance mortgage. Your breakeven is that point in which the total interest savings equals the cost of refinancing. This method allows you to compare loans with different terms.










                                    Mortgage Tax Deduction
                                    ?
If you itemize your deductions when you file your taxes, it affects your breakeven point. Higher interest rates mean higher mortgage deductions. Refinancing to a lower rate decreases your mortgage interest deduction.










                                    Pay Down Existing Mortgage
                                    ?
You can choose to refinance or leave your mortgage alone, but you have another option -- use your cash to pay down your mortgage balance instead of spending it on refinancing. You can reamortize your loan to reduce your payment or accelerate your repayment. This breakeven method measures how long it would take for your refinance payment less the reamortized payment on your current mortgage to cover the costs of refinancing.

HARP Loan















Advertorial






 (877) 792-9388







Toggle nav


What is the HARP Program?
When you have little equity in your home, or owe as much or more on your mortgage than your home is worth, it can be difficult to find a lender willing to help you refinance.
                            But for borrowers who have remained current on their mortgages, and have loans owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, there is hope. It’s called Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP).
                        
Introduced in March 2009, HARP enables borrowers with little or no equity to refinance into more affordable mortgages without new or additional mortgage insurance.
                            HARP targets borrowers with loan-to-value (LTV) ratios equal to or greater than 80 percent and who have limited delinquencies over the 12 months prior to refinancing.







Significant changes have been made to HARP since the program was first introduced. For example, in 2011 the LTV ceiling was removed, property appraisal requirements were waived in certain circumstances, certain risk fees for borrowers
                            selecting shorter amortization terms were eliminated, and certain representations and warranties were waived. In 2013, the eligibility date was changed from the date the loan was acquired by Fannie Mae                            or Freddie Mac to the date on the note, increasing the pool of eligible borrowers.
                        
Through HARP, you can get a lower interest rate (which means less out-of-pocket costs each month), get a shorter loan term, or change from an adjustable to fixed-rate
                            mortgage. There’s no minimum credit score needed, either.
                        
And now that HARP guidelines are simpler, even people who were formerly turned down may now be eligible for HARP refinancing.
                        
Find out if you qualify for HARP!




How can HARP help me?
If you are current on your mortgage; have a mortgage that is owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, and owe as much or more than your home is currently worth, you may be eligible for HARP refinancing. That can mean significant savings
                            by: 

Lowering your monthly payment
Reducing your interest rate
Securing a fixed-rate mortgage that won’t change over time
Building equity faster—shorter term options may be available
Lower closing costs because an appraisal is not usually required
Check your HARP eligibility‎!





HARP program includes:


No underwater limits
Borrowers will now be able to refinance regardless of how far their homes have fallen in value. Previous loan-to-value limits were set at 125 percent.
                                


No appraisals or underwriting
Most homeowners will not have to get an appraisal or have their loan underwritten, making their refinance process smoother and faster.


Modified fees
Certain risk-based fees for borrowers who refinance into shorter-term loans have been reduced.


Less paperwork
Lenders now need less paperwork for income verification, and have the option of qualifying a borrower by documenting that the borrower has at least 12 months
                                    of mortgage payments in reserve.


Program Deadline
The end date to get a HARP refinance is September 30, 2017.


Check if you qualify for HARP before it's gone!






Might you be eligible?
See if you meet these basic eligibility requirements:

You are current on your mortgage, with no 30-day+ late payments in the last six months and no more than one in the past 12 months
Your home is your primary residence, a 1-unit second home or a 1- to 4-unit investment property.
Your loan is owned by Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae. You can use the Loan Look-up Tools below if you are unsure.
Your loan was originated on or before May 31, 2009.
Your current loan-to-value (LTV) ratio must be greater than 80%.
Verify your HARP eligibility now‎!











Gather your financial information
Make sure you have your basic financial and loan information on hand when you call your mortgage company. You’ll need:

Your mortgage statements, including information on a second mortgage (if applicable).
Your income details (paystub or income tax return).






Connect with us
The licensed lending officer will also explain all the steps–from getting started, to locking in your low rate, to closing your loan quickly. Because we are a direct lender, if you have any questions during the loan process,
                                you will have one direct number enabling you to get quick answers straight from the source.
