About | Two Sigma














































About
More than 1,100 people who believe the scientific method is the best way to approach investing. Ideas backed up with information. And improved by iteration. That’s Two Sigma.
We’re not your typical investment manager. We follow principles of technology and innovation as much as principles of investment management. Fields like machine learning and distributed computing guide us. Since 2001, we’ve searched for ways that these kinds of technologies can make us better at what we do. We never stop researching and developing.
In the process, we work to help real people. Through our investors, we support the retirements of millions around the world. And we help fund breakthrough research, education and a wide range of charities and foundations.












35,000,000+

Gigabytes of data, and growing:  To test and develop investment models, it helps to have a lot of data. We have a lot of data.*














10,000+

Data sources, both public and proprietary:  We look beyond the obvious. So we can find connections that lead to the next great investment idea.*














95,000

CPUs With 1,695 terabytes of memory:  This is what a tech-driven investment manager looks like.*














1x10^14

Calculations per second:  With 100 teraflops of computing power, we have the tools to model the most complex investment ideas.*














3,300+

Person-years of R&D, growing by 700+ person-years annually:  Our R&D base far exceeds any new startup and is growing faster than any other investment management firm we know.*














2/3

Research and development:  Most finance companies keep technology in the back office. Not us. Research and development make us who we are.*














72%

Non-financial backgrounds:  Most of us don’t have traditional finance backgrounds. This helps us see what others in the industry don’t.*














97%

Voluntary employee retention since inception:  We like it here. We’re a career destination for people with big ideas who want room to grow.*














8

Gold and Silver medalists at the International Math Olympiad:  We like solving hard problems.*














75+

Home countries:  Diversity of thought. Ideas. Languages. Our team brings all of that from all over the world.*














40+

Countries where we trade equities, futures, FX and derivatives:  As a firm, we use diversified systematic strategies in the global financial markets.*

Assets under management: We have a range of investors from all over the world.*












Co-Chairmen


        
          David Siegel and John Overdeck are recognized pioneers in the fields of technology and investment management. They have more than 40 years of experience in the development of computer-driven, model-based trading systems. Together, David and John run the company.  They work together to drive the mission and strategy for Two Sigma, nurture talent and shape the company’s unique culture.
        




David Siegel, Co-Chairman
Prior to co-founding Two Sigma, David was Chief Technology Officer and Managing Director at Tudor Investment Corporation. After earning his doctorate, David joined D. E. Shaw & Co. and rose to become the company's first chief information officer. While at D. E. Shaw & Co., he founded and served as president of FarSight Financial Services, the world's first integrated personal financial services website, which was acquired by Merrill Lynch. A graduate of Princeton University, David received a PhD in computer science from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he studied at its Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. David has had a lifelong interest in building intelligent computational systems and continues to actively pursue this mission at Two Sigma today.
He currently sits on the Board of Directors of the Hamilton Insurance Group, the Scratch Foundation, NYC FIRST and NAF. In addition, David is a trustee of Carnegie Hall, an Executive Advisory Committee Member of the NSF/MIT Center for Brains, Minds & Machines and an advisory board member of Stanford’s Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society.
David is also a member of the Cornell Tech Board of Overseers and a member of the Corporation Visiting Committee for the MIT Media Laboratory.



John Overdeck, Co-Chairman
John began his career at D.E. Shaw & Co, where he rose to Managing Director. While at D. E. Shaw, he directed the firm’s Japanese equity and equity-linked investments and supervised the firm’s London investment management affiliate.  Following D.E. Shaw and before starting Two Sigma, John spent two years at Amazon.com, first serving as Vice President and technical assistant to Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos. He went on to lead customer relationship management at Amazon.com, directing Amazon’s renowned personalization, community, and targeted marketing features and technology.  He also led critical efforts to make Amazon’s customer technology more scalable.
A lifelong math enthusiast, John won a silver medal for the United States in the 27th International Mathematics Olympiad. He earned a B.S. in Mathematics (with distinction) and a M.S. in Statistics from Stanford University. John currently serves on the Board of Directors of the Hamilton Insurance Group. In addition to his family’s charitable activities, John also serves on the boards of the Robin Hood Foundation, the Institute for Advanced Study and is the acting Chair of the National Museum of Mathematics. 



Founders
Two Sigma Investments was founded in 2001 by David Siegel, John Overdeck and Mark Pickard. They shared the belief that innovative technology and data science could help discover value in the world's data to consistently deliver value for clients.
It is this belief that drives Two Sigma's ongoing development of new technologies that synthesize and integrate vast amounts of data, yielding results that seek to drive smarter investing and more consistent returns.

Why Two Sigma












Internships

We offer a 10-week paid summer internship program in SoHo, NYC. Interns will attend internal speaker series, game nights, 3D printing classes, presentation skills workshops, Broadway shows, and much more. In Quantitative Research and Software Engineering, you’ll own a single project during the course of your time with us. We’ll assign you a dedicated manager, and you’ll present your results at the end of the program.


          “I know my contributions matter. I could see the results of my work the first week I was here – not just on a project but in the real world.”

          We hire students across all degree levels, with varied backgrounds. While we analyze the data-rich financial markets, prior experience in the financial industry is not a requirement. In fact, more than 70% of our employees come from outside of finance. We're looking for intellectual curiosity, passion for science and technology, and a desire to join a dynamic and talented team. Learn more about how we hire and what makes Two Sigma a career destination for top talent.

Approach | Two Sigma













































Approach
The global markets fuel our imagination like nothing else. Unlimited information to study. Countless ways to take action. Fast feedback. Boundless opportunity. It’s got it all.
We apply the scientific method to investment management. Some people call us systematic. Here’s what that means to us: We combine massive amounts of data, world-class computing power and financial expertise to develop sophisticated trading models. And we use technology in an effort to constantly refine our investment process and our insights into how the markets will behave. Risk is a living thing in our business, and we watch over it carefully.








Technology & Data
Technology drives our business. We use machine learning, distributed computing and other technologies to find connections in the world’s data. We’ve been pushing the frontiers of Big Data since before it was a buzzword. To us, it’s just data. We work with vast sets of it, from over a thousand diverse sources.






Research & The Scientific Method
Guided by the scientific method, we devise models that begin with inspired ideas or economic hypotheses. In a systematic, process-driven fashion, models are expanded, tested and integrated into our investment strategies.






Investment Management
We’re always looking to improve our investment strategies, measuring our results as we go along. So we can make more intelligent trading decisions, with one eye on generating real alpha, and the other on effectively managing risk.

We take care of our people. We offer an extremely competitive benefits package, including medical, dental and disability insurance, and flexible healthcare and commuter spending accounts. We also offer a 401(K) plan with partial company match.

Fitness at work
People do their best work when their mind and body are in harmony. So our New York campus has three on-site gyms, each with locker rooms, showers and same-day laundry service. We also have free weekly well-being classes including fitness boot camp, yoga and meditation. And for those who savor the taste of competition, there are always our ping pong tables – sacred athletic venues, really – and our own basketball, softball, soccer and volleyball teams.

Technology is a key part of how we work and play. Our Hacker Lab Workshop series features classes in electronics, hardware and software design – all taught by TS-ers.

We've held classes on 3D printing; soldering and building interactive LED installations; designing circuit boards; and more.

Spark

Spark
Many TS-ers have ideas for new projects, but limited ways to explore them. Others have valuable insight to bring to projects, but might not know about all that's going on across the company. Enter Spark. It’s our internal open-source platform where people can share and collaborate on ideas. It all comes together in Spark Day, where selected ideas are presented to the entire firm. Starting this year, the people behind the audience favorite will win sabbatical time to bring their vision to life.

We think of Beaker as the Universal Translator for Data Scientists. We hope you enjoy it as much as we do. You’ll find more information on it here.

We've even got two turntables and some microphones. Want to come and just jam? Far out. Want to record and mix your own tracks? Have at it. Want to just gather around the piano and sing carols?

Good times
We throw great parties – because we like to celebrate our successes, and well, because we just like parties. Our annual summer outing, where TS-ers and their families spend a day soaking up the sun at some secret location, is a perennial favorite. Another is our annual holiday party, whose venues have included space shuttles and submarines. Other fiestas include New Sigma, where we welcome all new hires, and Birthday Snacks Day, when dessert is served to everyone to honor that month’s birthdays.
