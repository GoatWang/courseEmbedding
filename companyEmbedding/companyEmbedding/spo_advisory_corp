   Hedge Funds-News  John Scully’s SPO Advisory Corp Finds Value In Three Key Energy Stocks    Published on June 26, 2015 at 9:38 am by  
                                Gene Guzun
                                  in Hedge Funds,News         Page 1 of 2Next &gt&gtSee All           SPO Advisory Corp, formerly known as Main Street Partners, is a hedge fund firm co-founded by John Scully in 1991. The investment management firm employs a value-based investing approach, as the team of experts at SPO Advisory generally seek stocks that cost much less than valuation metrics say they are. Even more to that, SPO Advisory manages a very concentrated portfolio, with its top ten holdings representing 99.01% of its entire public portfolio. The firm’s most recent 13F filing reveals that its public equity portfolio has a value of $7.27 billion as of March 31, while its holdings are spread across the following sectors: consumer discretionary, technology, energy, and finance. In the following article we’ll discuss John Scully’s top energy stocks that include the following companies: Pioneer Natural Resources Co. (NYSE:PXD), Oasis Petroleum Inc. (NYSE:OAS) and Range Resources Corporation (NYSE:RRC).  Why are we interested in the 13F filings of a select group of hedge funds? We use these filings to determine the top 15 small-cap stocks held by these elite funds based on 16 years of research that showed their top small-cap picks are much more profitable than both their large-cap stocks and the broader market as a whole; yet investors have been stuck (until now) investing in all of a hedge fund’s stocks: the good, the bad, and the ugly. Why pay fees to invest in both the best and worst ideas of a particular hedge fund when you can simply mimic the best ideas of the best fund managers on your own? These top small-cap stocks beat the S&P 500 Total Return Index by an average of nearly one percentage point per month in our backtests, which were conducted over the period of 1999 to 2012. Even better, since the beginning of forward testing at the end of August 2012, the strategy worked just as our research predicted and then some, outperforming the market every year and returning 142% over the last 33 months, which is more than 84 percentage points higher than the returns of the S&P 500 ETF (SPY) (see more details). John H. ScullySPO Advisory Corp    [/hedge-fund-follow-email] SPO Advisory Corp increased its equity holding in Pioneer Natural Resources Co. (NYSE:PXD) by 502,000 shares, ending the first quarter with 7.35 million shares valued at $1.20 billion. This represents the third-largest holding of SPO Advisory and its top energy stock when considering the value of the shares held. The shares of Pioneer Natural Resources have dropped by slightly more than 4% year-to-date and are currently trading around $142 per share. The Texas-based independent upstream energy company has reported total production of 17.4 million barrels of oil equivalent, which yields a decrease of 5.6% quarter-over-quarter. Despite the above-mentioned decrease in production, the company’s crude oil and natural gas production has increased over the past 13 quarters. It is also expected that Pioneer Natural Resources will increase its production by approximately 4% in the fiscal second quarter of this year as a result of low commodity prices. Within our database, Andreas Halvorsen’s Viking Global represents the second-largest investor in Pioneer Natural Resources Co. (NYSE:PXD), with 5.81 million shares, trailing only SPO.

        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60)

      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
