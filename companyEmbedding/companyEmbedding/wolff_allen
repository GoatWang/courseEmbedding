Allen was born January 27, 1932 in Springfield, Massachusetts to Emil and Dorothy (Brown) Wolff.  He grew up in the Bronx and Albany, New York, and graduated from Albany High School in 1949 where he competed on the cross country and track teams.  He was also an Eagle Scout and served on the staff of Big Moose Wilderness Scout Camp, teaching bird study, canoeing, and riflemanship. At Michigan State College, Allen participated on the track team, livestock judging team, ROTC, and was elected to the 35-member Blue Key Men's Honorary.  He paid part of his college expenses by performing magic tricks at clubs and parties for $5 and $10, as well as shearing sheep.  He earned a Bachelor of Science in Agriculture in 1953, as a Distinguished Military Graduate.  While attending The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine, Allen met his future wife Martha Jane Riemenschneider, who typed his first scientific paper.  He paid his tuition there by shearing sheep and serving in the Ohio National Guard, and graduated with a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine in 1957. After serving a short time in the U.S. Army, Dr. and Mrs. Wolff eventually settled in Brunswick, Ohio where his practice changed from a combination of farm and pet animals to mostly pets.  Additionally, he published about 20 scientific papers, several on disease of the pancreas.  Following retirement in 1996, after 39 years of practice, Allen helped his wife with her activity on behalf of the Brunswick Food Pantry.  They also volunteered at the Rural Area Veterinary Services, which provided basic veterinary services for underserved areas of Appalachia including several counties of southeastern Ohio.  He enjoyed helping students learn basic surgeries.  He also enjoyed gardening, making pies and jams, entering products in the Medina County Fair, and traveling through the U.S. and all seven continents.  "Allemande Al" taught Square and Round dancing and choreographed over 90 dances.  He and Martha attended 20 national dance conventions and 24 state conventions, performing at most of them.  Allen is survived by his wife of 55 years, Martha; daughter Amy (Lenny) Wolff of Fairfield, Ohio; son Scott of Blacklick, Ohio; daughter Darcy (Eric) Schwalm of Greer, South Carolina; and five grandchildren Tiffany Wolff and Emily, Spenser, Caroline, and Annabelle Schwalm. It is ironic that Allen succumbed to an illness of the pancreas, after having become a knowledgeable person on some diseases of the pancreas. In lieu of flowers, a contribution may be made to the Brunswick Food Pantry at 1255 N. Carpenter Road, Brunswick, Ohio 44212 or to a charitable organization of your choice.  Funeral arrangements are private.  Lenny Wolff (Oct 24, 2012)        Al lived a very full life, doing it "His Own Way". His approach to all that he did was filled with great passion and determination. His valiant battle with cancer highlighted his deep concern for taking care of others as he had done his entire life. He took great care in making sure everyone he left behind was taken care of when he left even as he experienced issues from his medical problems. His life will be carried on through his family who will miss him greatly.Quote   Darrell Stone (Oct 24, 2012)        Amy Wolff was a neighbor for several years. She told me about her father many times and then I met him during his square dancing era. Amy is a daughter for which any father would be grateful. Lenny, Amy, Tiffany have become ubquitous friends over many years at Fairfield Covenant. May God be with your families during this time of reflection.Quote   Glenn Bierman (Oct 25, 2012)        I am sorry for your lost. It is amazing what you learn about someone when there gone. As a family and friends we had good times together.Quote   Ann Wengler (Oct 25, 2012)        Amy, I am so sorry for your loss. You are in my thoughts an prayers. Take care. - AnnQuote   Barbara, Paul, Crystal Connelly, Peg Tirrell (Oct 25, 2012)        We will miss Al's smile and choreography. You have given the Square and Round Dance world much. Our thoughts and prayers go out to Martha and family as you join the saints in the everlasting dance.Quote   Sally & Pat Moncol (Oct 25, 2012)        Our deepest sympathy goes out to the Wolff family. Dr. Wolff was not only our Vet. but also became a good friend. We never met a more dedicated veterinarian. The family will be in our prayers.Quote   jack woolf, first cousin (Oct 25, 2012)        I have fond rememberances of Allen and his parentsAunt Dorothy and Uncle Emil, at family reunions.We had many cousins to play with. When I was in college near Albany, the Emil and Dorothy constantly 'checked' up on me.Martha, when you moved to Ohio, we rarely re-unioned.I'm sure Allen will be missed by all.Thanks for letting me know.Quote   Burleigh Cubert (Oct 26, 2012)        Allen my old shooting buddy from our years at Albany High School was a good friend. The last time we met was in 60 or 61 when I was at the National Matches. Our sympathy goes out to Martha and the family.Burleigh and Carolyn CubertQuote   Amy Wolff - eldest daughter (Oct 28, 2012)        My dad -- the first man in my life. He prided himself on being organized, frugal, and accomplishing whatever he set out to do. He has generously given me so much, both tangible and intangible, and has taught me so much in my life. He didn't always say so until recent times, but I know he loved me. It is so touching to read and hear the comments from so many who knew and respected him in the various facets of his life. I will miss him dearly.Quote   Sarah Jones (Oct 29, 2012)        Dear Wolff Family,I am so sorry for your loss please accept my sincere condolences at this time. Something that I have found to be a great source of comfort are the thoughts expressed in the Bible at John 5:28,29 where we see that there is going to be a resurrection of those who have fallen asleep in death. Also at Revelation 21;4 we see that God is going to eliminate all of the causes for why we deal with sorrow, pain and even death itself. it is my sincere hope that these thoughts bring your family comfort at this time. Once again I am so sorry for your loss.Quote   Start Prev 1 2 Next EndPage 1 of 2Name Email Condolence1000   I agree to the terms and conditionsAntispam protection     Case insensitive   Send Reset       Recent Obituaries  REEL  WATTERS, JOHN  PHILLIPS, MICHAEL  RODGERS  GOSNELL,K  SMITH SR.

He was very professional, courteous and had great patience. Our first court hearing was pushed back due to court congestion. Mr. Healy requested the officer to be present for the next hearing. When the hearing date arrived the officer was not present as he was on "vacation". I was very upset since I didn't want to reschedule and have to take another day off of work. But Mr. Healy calmed me down and told me he would handle it. As we stood in front of the judge I did not say one word. Mr. Healy spoke with great confidence and composer. The judge did not grant the state a continuance and dismissed my case. I am so thankful for Mr. Healy and his ability to be the voice of the people.

Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant.

You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions

When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time.

Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship.
