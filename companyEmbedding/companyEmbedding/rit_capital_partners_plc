History[edit]
In 1961, the company was founded, on the initiative of Jacob Rothschild, to serve the English branch of the family Rothschild for investments outside their bank N M Rothschild & Sons: it was named "Rothschild Investment Trust".[2] In 1980, there was a conflict between Jacob Rothschild and Evelyn de Rothschild, then the head of N M Rothschild & Sons. Evelyn de Rothschild withdrew the money invested in the banking house of Rothschild Investment Trust and forbade the company to continue using the name Rothschild. Jacob Rothschild left the Board of N M Rothschild & Sons and took sole control of the Rothschild Investment Trust, which he renamed "RIT & Northern."[3]
In November 1983, Jacob Rothschild merged RIT & Northern into Charterhouse Japhet and took a controlling stake in the combined business which was briefly known as Charterhouse J. Rothschild.[3] Jacob Rothschild then sold the banking business, still known as Charterhouse Japhet, to Royal Bank of Scotland in 1985.[4] In 1988, Jacob Rothschild transformed the remaining investment business into a publicly traded investment trust with the name "RIT Capital Partners plc."[5] In May 2012, RIT Capital Partners, led by Jacob Rothschild, bought a 37% share in Rockefeller Financial Services (David Rockefeller).[6]
Operations[edit]
RIT Capital Partners operates internationally and is on long-term growth of its capital oriented. To achieve this goal, the company can be applied at all asset classes to invest. The main focus, however, it acquires shares in publicly traded and privately held companies. The profits are only a small part of an annual dividend paid. The rest is reinvested. RIT Capital Partners has its headquarters in Spencer House, ( St James's, London, England ), one of the last surviving city palaces in London (next door to Bridgewater House, one of the others). Due to the initiative of Lord Jacob Rothschild, in 1985 RIT Capital Partners plc purchased a 96-year lease (with an additional 24-year option) of the house and restored the state rooms and garden to their original appearance.[7]

Consensus Ratings for RIT Capital Partners plc (LON:RCP) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Hold RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.00)Consensus Price Target: N/A

History[edit]
In 1961, the company was founded, on the initiative of Jacob Rothschild, to serve the English branch of the family Rothschild for investments outside their bank N M Rothschild & Sons: it was named "Rothschild Investment Trust".[2] In 1980, there was a conflict between Jacob Rothschild and Evelyn de Rothschild, then the head of N M Rothschild & Sons. Evelyn de Rothschild withdrew the money invested in the banking house of Rothschild Investment Trust and forbade the company to continue using the name Rothschild. Jacob Rothschild left the Board of N M Rothschild & Sons and took sole control of the Rothschild Investment Trust, which he renamed "RIT & Northern."[3]
In November 1983, Jacob Rothschild merged RIT & Northern into Charterhouse Japhet and took a controlling stake in the combined business which was briefly known as Charterhouse J. Rothschild.[3] Jacob Rothschild then sold the banking business, still known as Charterhouse Japhet, to Royal Bank of Scotland in 1985.[4] In 1988, Jacob Rothschild transformed the remaining investment business into a publicly traded investment trust with the name "RIT Capital Partners plc."[5] In May 2012, RIT Capital Partners, led by Jacob Rothschild, bought a 37% share in Rockefeller Financial Services (David Rockefeller).[6]
Operations[edit]
RIT Capital Partners operates internationally and is on long-term growth of its capital oriented. To achieve this goal, the company can be applied at all asset classes to invest. The main focus, however, it acquires shares in publicly traded and privately held companies. The profits are only a small part of an annual dividend paid. The rest is reinvested. RIT Capital Partners has its headquarters in Spencer House, ( St James's, London, England ), one of the last surviving city palaces in London (next door to Bridgewater House, one of the others). Due to the initiative of Lord Jacob Rothschild, in 1985 RIT Capital Partners plc purchased a 96-year lease (with an additional 24-year option) of the house and restored the state rooms and garden to their original appearance.[7]

Dollar spins wheels ahead of GDP report expected to show faster clip of growth
              
              The U.S. dollar churned lower against most rivals save for the depreciating Swiss franc on Friday ahead of an update on the broadest measure of the U.S. economy—a GDP report that could help shape the Federal Reserve’s so far slow-moving approach to interest rates.

Dollar rises from 13-month low

History[edit]
In 1961, the company was founded, on the initiative of Jacob Rothschild, to serve the English branch of the family Rothschild for investments outside their bank N M Rothschild & Sons: it was named "Rothschild Investment Trust".[2] In 1980, there was a conflict between Jacob Rothschild and Evelyn de Rothschild, then the head of N M Rothschild & Sons. Evelyn de Rothschild withdrew the money invested in the banking house of Rothschild Investment Trust and forbade the company to continue using the name Rothschild. Jacob Rothschild left the Board of N M Rothschild & Sons and took sole control of the Rothschild Investment Trust, which he renamed "RIT & Northern."[3]
In November 1983, Jacob Rothschild merged RIT & Northern into Charterhouse Japhet and took a controlling stake in the combined business which was briefly known as Charterhouse J. Rothschild.[3] Jacob Rothschild then sold the banking business, still known as Charterhouse Japhet, to Royal Bank of Scotland in 1985.[4] In 1988, Jacob Rothschild transformed the remaining investment business into a publicly traded investment trust with the name "RIT Capital Partners plc."[5] In May 2012, RIT Capital Partners, led by Jacob Rothschild, bought a 37% share in Rockefeller Financial Services (David Rockefeller).[6]
Operations[edit]
RIT Capital Partners operates internationally and is on long-term growth of its capital oriented. To achieve this goal, the company can be applied at all asset classes to invest. The main focus, however, it acquires shares in publicly traded and privately held companies. The profits are only a small part of an annual dividend paid. The rest is reinvested. RIT Capital Partners has its headquarters in Spencer House, ( St James's, London, England ), one of the last surviving city palaces in London (next door to Bridgewater House, one of the others). Due to the initiative of Lord Jacob Rothschild, in 1985 RIT Capital Partners plc purchased a 96-year lease (with an additional 24-year option) of the house and restored the state rooms and garden to their original appearance.[7]

History[edit]
In 1961, the company was founded, on the initiative of Jacob Rothschild, to serve the English branch of the family Rothschild for investments outside their bank N M Rothschild & Sons: it was named "Rothschild Investment Trust".[2] In 1980, there was a conflict between Jacob Rothschild and Evelyn de Rothschild, then the head of N M Rothschild & Sons. Evelyn de Rothschild withdrew the money invested in the banking house of Rothschild Investment Trust and forbade the company to continue using the name Rothschild. Jacob Rothschild left the Board of N M Rothschild & Sons and took sole control of the Rothschild Investment Trust, which he renamed "RIT & Northern."[3]
In November 1983, Jacob Rothschild merged RIT & Northern into Charterhouse Japhet and took a controlling stake in the combined business which was briefly known as Charterhouse J. Rothschild.[3] Jacob Rothschild then sold the banking business, still known as Charterhouse Japhet, to Royal Bank of Scotland in 1985.[4] In 1988, Jacob Rothschild transformed the remaining investment business into a publicly traded investment trust with the name "RIT Capital Partners plc."[5] In May 2012, RIT Capital Partners, led by Jacob Rothschild, bought a 37% share in Rockefeller Financial Services (David Rockefeller).[6]
Operations[edit]
RIT Capital Partners operates internationally and is on long-term growth of its capital oriented. To achieve this goal, the company can be applied at all asset classes to invest. The main focus, however, it acquires shares in publicly traded and privately held companies. The profits are only a small part of an annual dividend paid. The rest is reinvested. RIT Capital Partners has its headquarters in Spencer House, ( St James's, London, England ), one of the last surviving city palaces in London (next door to Bridgewater House, one of the others). Due to the initiative of Lord Jacob Rothschild, in 1985 RIT Capital Partners plc purchased a 96-year lease (with an additional 24-year option) of the house and restored the state rooms and garden to their original appearance.[7]

About us


 

Free from the constraints of a formal benchmark, RIT has a remit to invest globally in any asset class.
Our corporate objective is to deliver long-term capital growth, while preserving shareholders’ capital; to invest without the constraints of a formal benchmark, but to deliver for shareholders increases in capital value in excess of the relevant indices over time. 
Therefore we aim to deliver healthy participation in up markets with reasonable protection in down markets. Over time this should allow us to compound ahead of markets through the cycles. 
Since inception, we have participated in 75% of market upside but only 39% of the market declines.  A shareholder who invested in RIT at inception has seen a share price total return of 12.9% per annum, which represents a meaningful outperformance of global equity markets.
