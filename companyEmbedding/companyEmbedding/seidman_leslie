History[edit]
BDO USA, LLP was founded as Seidman and Seidman in New York City in 1910 by three immigrant brothers: Maximillian L. Seidman, Francis E. Seidman, and Jacob S. Seidman. At that time the accounting profession was in its infancy, with fewer than 2,200 practicing CPAs in the United States. Shortly thereafter in 1913, the 16th Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified, followed by the Revenue Act of 1913 with new impositions of U.S. Federal income tax enacted by Congress in that year. M. L. Seidman saw the potential of the accountant's role to provide tax services to individuals. By 1917, Congress enacted the first revenue bills and the U.S. entry into World War I created the need for corporate income and excess profit taxes. At the same time, federal spending rose to $18.9 billion with 58 percent of the federal revenues provided from income taxes. M.L. Seidman and his siblings, who joined him in his new accounting firm, seized the opportunity to provide tax services to businesses in addition to individuals.
Expansion[edit]
An era of expansion began. Fostered by the federal government's conversion of furniture and woodworking companies to aircraft production for the war effort, the firm opened an office in Grand Rapids, Michigan in 1917. Seidman and Seidman quickly established itself as a leader in serving the furniture industry by developing the first effective furniture plant costing system. Today, BDO Seidman's Furniture Industry practice remains in the industry.
In 1925, the firm rapidly expanded, opening offices in Jamestown, Illinois and Rockford, Illinois, followed by Chicago in 1921, and Gardner, Massachusetts in 1924. In 1922, J. S. Seidman joined the firm as a founding member.
The 1930s brought another new beginning for the accounting profession. In 1933, Congress passed the Securities Act, requiring public corporations to have financial statements included in registration statements and periodic reports reported on by independent CPAs. A year later, the Securities and Exchange Commission was created to administer the new legislation.
In 1950, L. William Seidman joined the firm and ultimately became its managing partner before leaving for government service, most notably as Chair of the FDIC.[2]
Development of the national firm[edit]
The firm continued to grow and by the 1960s, truly became a national firm. On April 1, 1968 the firm was converted into a national general partnership. This marked the beginning of a new era of expansion. Over the years to the present, the firm established many offices throughout the United States. Founding Partner Keith Beresheim was instrumental in helping BDO grow its practice and become a national tier firm.
Present[edit]
Today, BDO USA, LLP has more than 60 offices and more than 400 independent Alliance firm locations nationwide. During this timeframe, BDO International was created and has grown to become the fifth largest accounting and consulting network in the world with over 1,400 Member Firm offices in 135 countries.
In February 2009, BDO USA, LLP launched the firm’s first-ever national advertising campaign: "PEOPLE WHO KNOW, KNOW BDO”.
In June 2012, the Monitor (Joseph A. Smith, Jr.) of the National Mortgage Settlement announced he engaged BDO USA, LLP as his primary professional firm. BDO will join the Monitor and his team for a period of three and a half years as they oversee implementation of the historic National Mortgage Settlement involving 49 states, the United States government and five of the nation’s largest banks.
Controversies[edit]
BDO has been involved in a number of engagements which resulted in major litigation and press attention.
Washington, D.C. tax scandal (November 2007–10)[edit]
A group of DC government employees had embezzled funds by fraudulently issuing real estate tax refund checks to their friends. BDO Seidman was the independent auditor of the DC government's financial records. On November 21, 2007 Reuters wrote “Washington, D.C., officials should fix problems identified in an audit that found the city mishandled millions of dollars, according to Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, who represents the U.S. capital in Congress…. The audit, conducted by accounting firm BDO Seidman, LLP, found that financial reporting for the city's school system and Medicaid programs did not match their financial statements, making both areas vulnerable to fraud….Altogether, auditors found more than 160 instances where the city failed to comply with conditions for spending federal money, primarily by misreporting funds and mismanaging cash." As of November 2007, it was estimated that over $30 million were scammed by Washington, DC tax officials since 1999. At the height of the scam, half of the property tax refund checks were fraudulent. The average legitimate check was less than $10,000 while the average scam check was over $300,000. "The scandal may also singe BDO Seidman, a private audit firm that gave [Washington DC CFO Natwar] Gandhi its seal of approval earlier this year. Its auditors were paid millions to go over the city’s books and gave Gandhi’s office an unqualified opinion."[citation needed] In 2010, a mentally ill woman, who was not a DC employee was able to exploit a security loophole in DC's financial systems to file tax returns claiming $19.1 million in refunds, but these were stopped.[relevant? – discuss][3]
New York Law School and Madoff scandal (December 2008)[edit]
On December 16, 2008, in connection with the Bernard Madoff scandal, the New York Law School filed a lawsuit against J. Ezra Merkin, Ascot Partners, and its auditor BDO Seidman, after losing its $3 million investment in Ascot. The lawsuit charged Merkin with recklessness, gross negligence and breach of fiduciary duties.[4]

BDO will join the Monitor and his team for a period of three and a half years as they oversee implementation of the historic National Mortgage Settlement involving 49 states, the United States government and five of the nation’s largest banks.
Controversies[edit]
BDO has been involved in a number of engagements which resulted in major litigation and press attention.
Washington, D.C. tax scandal (November 2007–10)[edit]
A group of DC government employees had embezzled funds by fraudulently issuing real estate tax refund checks to their friends. BDO Seidman was the independent auditor of the DC government's financial records. On November 21, 2007 Reuters wrote “Washington, D.C., officials should fix problems identified in an audit that found the city mishandled millions of dollars, according to Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, who represents the U.S. capital in Congress…. The audit, conducted by accounting firm BDO Seidman, LLP, found that financial reporting for the city's school system and Medicaid programs did not match their financial statements, making both areas vulnerable to fraud….Altogether, auditors found more than 160 instances where the city failed to comply with conditions for spending federal money, primarily by misreporting funds and mismanaging cash." As of November 2007, it was estimated that over $30 million were scammed by Washington, DC tax officials since 1999. At the height of the scam, half of the property tax refund checks were fraudulent. The average legitimate check was less than $10,000 while the average scam check was over $300,000. "The scandal may also singe BDO Seidman, a private audit firm that gave [Washington DC CFO Natwar] Gandhi its seal of approval earlier this year. Its auditors were paid millions to go over the city’s books and gave Gandhi’s office an unqualified opinion."[citation needed] In 2010, a mentally ill woman, who was not a DC employee was able to exploit a security loophole in DC's financial systems to file tax returns claiming $19.1 million in refunds, but these were stopped.[relevant? – discuss][3]
New York Law School and Madoff scandal (December 2008)[edit]
On December 16, 2008, in connection with the Bernard Madoff scandal, the New York Law School filed a lawsuit against J. Ezra Merkin, Ascot Partners, and its auditor BDO Seidman, after losing its $3 million investment in Ascot. The lawsuit charged Merkin with recklessness, gross negligence and breach of fiduciary duties.[4]

Leslie Seidman: Lighting Up a Dark Room at the FASB

					Posted on December 27, 2010 by Neil Garfield									

Leslie F. Seidman
Chairman, FASB

EDITOR’S COMMENT:

You probably  don’t know the name Seidman, much less  Leslie Seidman. But back in the  1960’s when the accounting rules were first being changed (causing  Briloff to write the book Unaccountable Accounting),  the Seidman accounting firm was one of the few who understood the  significance and moral hazard of what was being laid at the foundation  of required disclosure and certification of financial statements.  Neither Seidman nor Briloff got the attention they deserved because they  were bearing messages that nobody wanted to hear. The usual excuses of  apparent “transparency” and facilitating free flow of capital and  commerce were used to justify giving management the right to basically  tell you what you wanted to hear if you were holding the stock or bond,  or to induce you to buy if you were a prospective investor.
The  eventual changes were monumental in scope, misleading in nature and  essentially legitimized fraud on the securities exchanges, which had a  catalytic effect on the fringe shadow markets where regulation was  already spotty at best.
Now through a fluke of circumstance, Leslie Seidman  has become chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, and  stands in a position similar to Elizabeth Warren, to change the way  business is reported on Wall Street — a fact making many people  nervous all over the world of finance. The FASB makes the rules on generally accepted accounting practices (GAAP). She has no incentive that we know of to do anything but the job to which she was appointed, without favoritism to Wall Street, business or anyone else. And she stands a good chance of re-appointment when her term runs out after the previous chairman suddenly stepped down.
This time there is a light at the end of the tunnel and it’s name is Seidman — a long-standing reputable name in the field of accounting. Let’s hope she is able to push through the reforms required to bring us back to days when we could actually know the condition of companies, cities, states and the federal government. Maybe we could even bring to light “selling forward” and price earnings ratios on “forward earnings”. The possibilities are endless. You may not know the name Leslie Seidman, but if the U.S. regains respect in the world of finance, it will be because of people like Seidman, Shapiro at the SEC, and Warren at the Consumer Protection Agency.
PRESS RELEASE:
Leslie F. Seidman was named Chairman of the Financial Accounting  Standards Board (FASB) by the Financial Accounting Foundation, effective  December 23, 2010.  She was originally appointed to the FASB in July  2003 and reappointed to a second term in July 2006.
As Chairman of the FASB, Ms. Seidman is responsible for managing the  organization’s day-to-day activities and leading the Board’s efforts to  develop high-quality financial reporting standards that result in  decision-useful information for investors and other users of financial  statements.
From 1994–1999, Ms. Seidman was a member of the FASB staff.  She  initially joined the organization as an Industry Fellow, after which she  served as a Project Manager and as the Assistant Director of Research  and Technical Activities.  As Assistant Director, she supervised staff  members dealing with implementation and practice issues, including the  FASB’s Emerging Issues Task Force, and had liaison responsibilities for  the Securities and Exchange Commission and the regulators of financial  institutions.
In between her two tenures at the FASB, Ms. Seidman founded and managed a  financial reporting consulting firm, serving corporations, accounting  firms and other organizations.  Prior to her Fellowship at the FASB, Ms.  Seidman was a vice president in the accounting policies department of  J.P. Morgan & Co. Inc., where she was responsible for establishing  accounting policies for new financial products, particularly securities  and derivatives, and analyzing and implementing new accounting  standards.  Ms. Seidman started her career at Arthur Young & Co.  (now Ernst & Young, LLP), as a member of the audit staff, serving  clients in the retail, publishing and venture capital industries.
A member of the AICPA, the American Women’s Society of CPAs, and the  Institute of Management Accountants, Ms. Seidman earned an M.S. degree  in accounting from New York University and a B.A. degree in English from  Colgate University.

What was the time-frame–what products. Could it overlap the period 2003-4 when they were cooking up the off-balance sheet financing securitization?

This is great of course and will be very well accepted I believe now, by all concerned.  Takes me back though in the days when all of a sudden, the internal auditors, the state auditors, the fed auditors, all called us to let us know when they would be there and what files to pull.  I knew then we were in trouble.  It goes without saying that “surprise” audits are still very key to well run operations and those that run a tight ship are going to have it made.  Can you imagine.  Calling in to let us know which files to pull for audit.  Like I said, I knew it was the beginning of the end.

					Leslie F. Seidman, Chairman



















Leslie F. Seidman was named chairman of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) by the Financial Accounting Foundation, effective December 23, 2010.  She was originally appointed to the FASB in July 2003 and was reappointed to a second term in July 2006.
As chairman of the FASB, Ms. Seidman is responsible for managing the organization’s day-to-day activities and leading the Board’s efforts to develop high-quality financial reporting standards that result in decision-useful information for investors and other users of financial statements.  This includes oversight of the FASB’s extensive due process, designed to educate and elicit input from a diverse group of U.S. stakeholders through regularly scheduled Board meetings, speaking engagements, roundtables, comment letters, and other public outreach efforts.  Responsibilities also include guiding the FASB’s joint agenda with the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as the two organizations work toward achieving a common set of high-quality, global accounting standards.
From 1994–1999, Ms. Seidman was a member of the FASB staff.  She initially joined the organization as an industry fellow, after which she served as a project manager and as the assistant director of research and technical activities.  As assistant director, she supervised staff members dealing with implementation and practice issues, including the FASB’s Emerging Issues Task Force, and had liaison responsibilities for the Securities and Exchange Commission and the regulators of financial institutions.
In between her two tenures at the FASB, Ms. Seidman founded and managed a financial reporting consulting firm, serving corporations, accounting firms, and other organizations.  Prior to her fellowship at the FASB, Ms. Seidman was a vice president in the accounting policies department of J.P. Morgan & Co. Inc., where she was responsible for establishing accounting policies for new financial products, particularly securities and derivatives, and analyzing and implementing new accounting standards.  Ms. Seidman started her career at Arthur Young & Co. (now Ernst & Young, LLP), as a member of the audit staff, serving clients in the retail, publishing, and venture capital industries.
Drawing upon her extensive knowledge of standard setting and the financial services industry, Ms. Seidman authored the first three editions of Financial Instruments, a comprehensive practice manual for accountants and other professionals (currently in its 11th edition from publisher CCH).  In addition, she has authored, reviewed, and edited hundreds of accounting pronouncements of the FASB and AICPA, and contributed to several books and other publications.  She is the recipient of the 2011 Max Block Distinguished Article Award.
Ms. Seidman is a member of the AICPA, the American Woman’s Society of CPAs, Financial Executives International, the International Women’s Forum, and the Institute of Management Accountants, where she formerly served on the Financial Reporting Committee.  Ms. Seidman, a CPA (inactive), earned an M.S. degree in accounting from New York University Stern School of Business and a B.A. degree in English from Colgate University.
