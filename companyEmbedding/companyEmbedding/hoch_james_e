Job Details
               Educational Institution; 201-500 employees; Higher Education industry
Title: Director of Major Gifts
               Company: Union Rescue Mission
Job Details
               Company Size: Less than $1 mil - Employee Range: Less than 25. Since 1887, the Rescue Mission has served people in need in Central New York. Beginning as an outreach to Erie Canal workers and the community that formed around them, we have been here to help through war and peace, economic booms and recessions, even the Great Depression. Over the years, the faces and needs have changed and programs have come and gone, but many things have remained the same:We address an individual's basic needs first, knowing those must be met before a person is able to deal with the more difficult issues of life. We all need food, clothing, shelter and hope. We believe that God is the source of real life change. We treat people with dignity and respect because they are all made in God's image. Our goal is to assist people in becoming as independent as possible. While independence will look differently depending on the person, for many it will involve permanent housing, employment, family reconciliation and freedom from addiction. By helping an individual, we also help a family and ultimately our entire community. We depend on the involvement and resources of a caring community for all of the services we provide.

JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREMiddle Egyptian Grammarby Hoch, James E.This is a practical, modern introductory grammar for classroom and self-instruction. Unlike Alan Gardiner's monumental Egyptian Grammar , this is not intended as a reference work, and it is designed to be as user-friendly as possible by, for example, presenting simplified forms of genuine texts rather than diving straight into the originals.General, Egypt, GrammarCondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STORESemitic Words In Egyptian Texts Of The New Kingdom And Third Intermediate Periodby Hoch, James E.Semitic words and names appear in unprecedented numbers in texts of the New Kingdom, the period when the Egyptian empire extended into Syria-Palestine. In his book, James Hoch provides a comprehensive account of these words--their likely origins, their contexts, and their implications for the study of Egyptian and Semitic linguistics and Late-Bronze and Iron-Age culture in the eastern Mediterranean. Unlike previous word catalogs, this work consists of concise word studies and contains a wealth of linguistic, lexical, and cultural information.Hoch considers some five hundred Semitic words found in Egyptian texts from about 1500 to 650 b.c.e. Building on previous scholarship, he proposes new etymologies and translations and discusses phonological, morphological, and semantic factors that figure in the use of these words. The Egyptian evidence is essential to an understanding of the phonology of Northwest Semitic, and Hoch presents a major reconstruction of the phonemic systems. Of equal importance is his account of the particular semantic use of Semitic vocabulary, in contexts sometimes quite different from those of the Hebrew scriptures and Ugaritic myths and legends. With its new critical assessment of many hotly debated issues of Semitic and Egyptian philology, this book will be consulted for its lexical and linguistic conclusions and will serve as the basis for future work in both fields.Originally published in 1994.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These paperback editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback editions. The goal of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the rich scholarly heritage found in the thousands of books published by Princeton University Press since its founding in 1905.EgyptCondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.
