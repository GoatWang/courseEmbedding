      Fitch Assigns Final Ratings to GS Mortgage Securities Trust 2016-GS2 
      Commercial Mtg P-T Certificates
    





May 31, 2016 02:24 PM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings and Rating Outlooks for 
      GS Mortgage Securities Trust (GSMS) 2016-GS2 Commercial Mortgage 
      Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2016-GS2.
    

      --$11,733,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$7,506,000a class F 'B?sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$31,903,230a class G 'NR'.
    

      a Privately placed and pursuant to rule 144A.
    

      b Notional amount and interest only.
    

      c The class A-S, class B, and class C certificates may be exchanged for 
      class PEZ certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for 
      the class A-S, class B, and class C certificates.
    

      The ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as of May 9, 
      2016. Fitch does not rate the $31,903,230 class G. The certificates 
      represent the beneficial ownership interest in the trust, primary assets 
      of which are 37 loans secured by 115 commercial properties having an 
      aggregate principal balance of approximately $750.6 million as of the 
      cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust by Goldman Sachs 
      Mortgage Company.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral 
      including site inspections on 83.4% of the properties by balance and 
      asset summary reviews and cash flow analysis of 93.8% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Fitch Leverage: The Fitch stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) on 
      the trust-specific debt is 1.24x, higher than the 2015 and YTD 2016 
      averages of 1.18x and 1.17x, respectively, for the other Fitch-rated 
      U.S. multiborrower deals. The Fitch stressed loan-to-value (LTV) ratio 
      on the trust-specific debt is 103.4%, lower than the 2015 and YTD 2016 
      averages of 109.3% and 107.9%, respectively, for the other Fitch-rated 
      deals.
    

      Highly Concentrated Pool: The largest 10 loans in the transaction 
      compose 62.7% of the pool by balance. Compared to other Fitch-rated U.S. 
      multiborrower deals, the concentration in this transaction is higher 
      than the 2015 and YTD 2016 average concentrations of 49.3% and 54.8%, 
      respectively. The pool's concentration results in a loan concentration 
      index (LCI) of 539, which is higher than the 2015 average of 367 and 
      2016 YTD average of 415.
    

      Credit Opinion Loan: One loan in the pool received shadow ratings. The 
      Veritas Multifamily Pool 1 (9.99% of the pool) received an 
      investment-grade rating of 'AAAsf' on a fusion basis and a 'AAAsf' 
      rating on a stand-alone basis.
    

      Interest-Only Loans: 17 loans that make up 62.5% of the pool are full 
      interest-only. This is higher than the average of 23.3% for 2015 and 
      30.8% for YTD 2016 of the other Fitch-rated U.S. multiborrower deals. In 
      addition, 14 loans which comprised 23.3% of the pool are partial 
      interest-only; this share is lower than the average of 43.1% for 2015 
      and 41.1% for YTD 2016 of the other Fitch-rated U.S. multiborrower 
      deals. Overall, the pool is scheduled to pay down by 5.08%, compared 
      with the averages of 11.7% for 2015 and 9.9% YTD for 2016 for the other 
      Fitch-rated U.S. deals.
    

      ADDITIONAL RATING DRIVERS
    

      Sponsor Concentration: The top 10 sponsors comprise 75.7% of the pool, 
      including a single sponsor's 17.3% share. This results in a sponsor 
      concentration index (SCI) of 833, which is higher than the 2015 and YTD 
      2016 averages of 410 and 461, respectively, for other Fitch-rated 
      multiborrower deals.
    

      Mortgage Coupons: The weighted average (WA) mortgage coupon for this 
      pool of loans is 4.55%, well below historical averages. Fitch accounted 
      for increased refinance risk in a higher interest rate environment by 
      analyzing sensitivity to increased interest rates in conjunction with 
      Fitch's stressed refinance rates, which were 9.07% on a WA basis.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's NCF was 6.4% below the most recent year's 
      NOI (for properties for which a full year NOI was provided, excluding 
      properties that were stabilizing during this period). The following 
      rating sensitivities describe how the ratings would react to further NCF 
      declines below Fitch's NCF. The implied rating sensitivities are only 
      indicative of some of the potential outcomes and do not consider other 
      risk factors to which the transaction is exposed. Stressing additional 
      risk factors may result in different outcomes. Furthermore, the implied 
      ratings, after the further NCF stresses are applied, are more akin to 
      what the ratings would be at deal issuance had those further stressed 
      NCFs been in place at that time.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to GSMS 2016-GS2 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity 
      to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a 
      further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' 
      certificates to 'A-sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, in which 
      NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on pages 10.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third party due diligence information from Ernst 
      & Young LLP. The third-party due diligence information was provided on 
      Form ABS Due Diligence-15E and focused on a comparison and 
      re-computation of certain characteristics with respect to each of the 
      mortgage loans. Fitch considered this information in its analysis and 
      the findings did not have an impact on the analysis.

NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has assigned the following ratings and Rating Outlooks for 
      GS Mortgage Securities Trust (GSMS) 2016-GS4 Commercial Mortgage

      --$10,266,000a class F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$37,212,204a class G 'NR'.
    

      (a) Privately placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      (b) Notional amount and interest only.
    

      (c) Class A-S, B and C certificates may be exchanged for class PEZ 
      certificates, and class PEZ certificates may be exchanged for class A-S, 
      B and C certificates.
    

      These expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer 
      as of Nov. 23, 2016. Fitch does not rate the $37,212,204 class G.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 33 loans secured by 95 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.03 
      billion as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by Goldman Sachs Mortgage Company.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 80.3% of the properties by balance and 
      cash flow analysis of 93.5% of the pool.
    

      The transaction has a Fitch stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) 
      of 1.34x, a Fitch stressed loan-to-value (LTV) of 94.6%, and a Fitch 
      debt yield of 10.6%. Fitch's aggregate net cash flow represents a 
      variance of 13.2% to issuer cash flows.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Lower Fitch Leverage: The Fitch stressed debt service coverage ratio 
      (DSCR) on the trust-specific debt is 1.34x, higher than the 2015 and YTD 
      2016 averages of 1.18x and 1.20x, respectively. The Fitch stressed 
      loan-to-value (LTV) ratio on the trust-specific debt is 94.6%, lower 
      than the 2015 and YTD 2016 averages of 109.3% and 105.7%, respectively, 
      for the other Fitch-rated deals.
    

      Highly Concentrated Pool: The largest 10 loans in the transaction 
      comprise 65.8% of the pool by balance. Compared to other Fitch-rated 
      U.S. multiborrower deals, the concentration in this transaction is 
      higher than the 2015 and YTD 2016 average concentrations of 49.3% and 
      54.6%, respectively. The pool's concentration results in a loan 
      concentration index (LCI) of 541, which is higher than the 2015 average 
      of 367 and 2016 YTD average of 419.
    

      Credit Opinion Loans: The three largest loans in the pool, AMA Plaza 
      (9.7% of the pool), 225 Bush Street (9.7% of the pool) and 540 West 
      Madison (7.3% of the pool), have investment grade credit opinions. AMA 
      Plaza has an investment-grade credit opinion of 'BBBsf*' on a 
      stand-alone basis. 225 Bush Street has an investment-grade credit 
      opinion of 'BBB+sf*' on a stand-alone basis. 540 West Madison has an 
      investment-grade credit opinion of 'BBB-sf*' on a stand-alone basis. The 
      three loans have a weighted average Fitch DSCR and Fitch LTV of 1.53x 
      and 58.6%, respectively.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 11% below the most 
      recent year's net operating income (NOI); for properties for which a 
      full-year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to GSMS 2016-GS4 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivities to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'AA-sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, 
      in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the 
      junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on page 10.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with due diligence information from [Ernst & Young 
      LLP]. The due diligence focused on [a comparison and re-computation of 
      certain characteristics with respect to each of the mortgage loans]. 
      Fitch considered this information in its analysis and the findings did 
      not have an impact on our analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence 
      Form-15E received by Fitch in connection with this transaction may be 
      obtained through the link contained on the bottom of the related rating 
      action commentary.

      Copyright © 2016 by Fitch Ratings, Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its 
      subsidiaries. 33 Whitehall Street, NY, NY 10004. Telephone: 
      1-800-753-4824, (212) 908-0500. Fax: (212) 480-4435. Reproduction or 
      retransmission in whole or in part is prohibited except by permission. 
      All rights reserved. In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in 
      making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on 
      factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from 
      other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable 
      investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance 
      with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of 
      that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources 
      are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The 
      manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party 
      verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated 
      security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the 
      jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the 
      issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public 
      information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, 
      the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit 
      reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, 
      engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third 
      parties, the availability of independent and competent third-party 
      verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the 
      particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. 
      Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an 
      enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can 
      ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a 
      rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer 
      and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information 
      they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other 
      reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the 
      work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to 
      financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax 
      matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other 
      information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and 
      predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified 
      as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, 
      ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions 
      that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or 
      affirmed.
    

      The information in this report is provided "as is" without any 
      representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or 
      warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the 
      requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion 
      as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made 
      by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch 
      is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports 
      are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of 
      individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating 
      does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, 
      unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the 
      offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. 
      Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not 
      solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are 
      named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is 
      neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, 
      verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in 
      connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or 
      withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. 
      Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a 
      recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not 
      comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security 
      for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of 
      payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from 
      issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for 
      rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 
      (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, 
      Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, 
      or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a 
      single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to 
      US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, 
      publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute 
      a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any 
      registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, 
      the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or 
      the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative 
      efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may 
      be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to 
      print subscribers.
    

      For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia 
      Pty. Ltd. holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license 
      no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale 
      clients only. Credit ratings information published by Fitch is not 
      intended to be used by persons who are retail clients within the meaning

RATINGS RATIONALE




The ratings on the P&I classes were affirmed because the transaction's 
key metrics, including Moody's loan-to-value (LTV) 
ratio, Moody's stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and the 
transaction's Herfindahl Index (Herf), are within acceptable 
ranges.




The ratings on the IO classes were affirmed based on the credit performance 
(or the weighted average rating factor) of their referenced classes.




Moody's rating action reflects a base expected loss of 5.8% 
of the current balance. Moody's provides a current list of 
base expected losses for conduit and fusion CMBS transactions on moodys.com 
at http://www.moodys.com/viewresearchdoc.aspx?docid=PBS_SF215255.




FACTORS THAT WOULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGS:




The performance expectations for a given variable indicate Moody's forward-looking 
view of the likely range of performance over the medium term. Performance 
that falls outside the given range can indicate that the collateral's 
credit quality is stronger or weaker than Moody's had previously expected.




Factors that could lead to an upgrade of the ratings include a significant 
amount of loan paydowns or amortization, an increase in the pool's 
share of defeasance or an improvement in pool performance.




Factors that could lead to a downgrade of the ratings include a decline 
in the performance of the pool, loan concentration, an increase 
in realized and expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans 
or interest shortfalls.




METHODOLOGY UNDERLYING THE RATING ACTION




The methodologies used in these ratings were "Approach to Rating US and 
Canadian Conduit/Fusion CMBS" published in December 2014, and "Moody's 
Approach to Rating Large Loan and Single Asset/Single Borrower CMBS" 
published in October 2015. Please see the Rating Methodologies 
page on www.moodys.com for a copy of these methodologies.




Additionally, the methodology used in rating Cl. X-A 
and Cl. X-B was "Moody's Approach to Rating Structured 
Finance Interest-Only Securities" published in October 2015. 
Please see the Rating Methodologies page on www.moodys.com 
for a copy of this methodology.




Please note that on February 27, 2017, Moody's released a 
"Request for Comment" in which it has requested market feedback on proposed 
changes to its methodology for rating structured finance interest-only 
(IO) securities called "Moody's Approach to Rating Structured Finance 
Interest-Only Securities," dated October 20, 2015. 
If Moody's adopts the new methodology as proposed, the changes could 
affect the ratings of GSMS 2016-GS2. Please see "Moody's 
Proposes Revised Approach to Rating Structured Finance Interest-Only 
(IO) Securities", which is available at www.moodys.com, 
for more information about the implications of the proposed changes to 
the methodology on Moody's ratings.




DESCRIPTION OF MODELS USED




Moody's review used the excel-based CMBS Conduit Model, 
which it uses for both conduit and fusion transactions. Credit 
enhancement levels for conduit loans are driven by property type, 
Moody's actual and stressed DSCR, and Moody's property 
quality grade (which reflects the capitalization rate Moody's uses 
to estimate Moody's value). Moody's fuses the conduit 
results with the results of its analysis of investment grade structured 
credit assessed loans and any conduit loan that represents 10% 
or greater of the current pool balance. 




Moody's uses a variation of Herf to measure the diversity of loan 
sizes, where a higher number represents greater diversity. 
Loan concentration has an important bearing on potential rating volatility, 
including the risk of multiple notch downgrades under adverse circumstances. 
The credit neutral Herf score is 40. The pool has a Herf of 19, 
unchanged from Moody's securitization.




When the Herf falls below 20, Moody's uses the excel-based 
Large Loan Model and then reconciles and weights the results from the 
conduit and large loan models in formulating a rating recommendation. 
The large loan model derives credit enhancement levels based on an aggregation 
of adjusted loan-level proceeds derived from Moody's loan-level 
LTV ratios. Major adjustments to determining proceeds include leverage, 
loan structure, and property type. Moody's also further 
adjusts these aggregated proceeds for any pooling benefits associated 
with loan level diversity and other concentrations and correlations. 





DEAL PERFORMANCE




As of the April 12, 2017 distribution date, the transaction's 
aggregate certificate balance has decreased by 0.2% to $749.2 
million from $750.6 million at securitization. The 
certificates are collateralized by 37 mortgage loans ranging in size from 
less than 1% to 10% of the pool, with the top ten 
loans (excluding defeasance) constituting 63% of the pool. 
One loan, constituting 10% of the pool, has an investment-grade 
structured credit assessment.




Two loans, constituting 1.8% of the pool, are 
on the master servicer's watchlist. The watchlist includes 
loans that meet certain portfolio review guidelines established as part 
of the CRE Finance Council (CREFC) monthly reporting package. As 
part of Moody's ongoing monitoring of a transaction, the agency 
reviews the watchlist to assess which loans have material issues that 
could affect performance.




Moody's weighted average conduit LTV is 112%, essentially 
the same as at securitization. Moody's conduit component 
excludes loans with structured credit assessments, defeased and 
CTL loans, and specially serviced and troubled loans. Moody's 
value reflects a weighted average capitalization rate of 9.3%.




Moody's actual and stressed conduit DSCRs are 1.75X and 0.94X, 
respectively, unchanged from securitization. Moody's 
actual DSCR is based on Moody's NCF and the loan's actual 
debt service. Moody's stressed DSCR is based on Moody's 
NCF and a 9.25% stress rate the agency applied to the loan 
balance.




The loan with a structured credit assessment is the Veritas Multifamily 
Pool 1 Loan ($75 million -- 10.0% of the pool), 
which is secured by a portfolio of 61 apartment properties, with 
1,726 units, located in various neighborhoods in San Francisco, 
California. The loan represents a pari-passu interest in 
a $230.25 million mortgage. There is also a $249.75 
million B-note and $196.5 million of mezzanine financing. 
The properties range in size from 5 to 70 units and were built between 
1890 and 1976. The top five neighborhoods by unit count, 
which total 1,124 units, are: Downtown, Nob Hill, 
Civic Center, Russian Hill, and Pacific Heights. As 
of April 2016, the portfolio was 94.9% leased. 
Moody's structured credit assessment and stressed DSCR are aa2 (sca.pd) 
and 1.54X, respectively, unchanged from securitization.




The top three conduit loans represent 28% of the pool balance. 
The largest loan is the Twenty Ninth Street Loan ($75 million -- 
10.0% of the pool), which is secured by a fee and 
leasehold interest in 705,159 square feet (SF) within a 855,440 
SF one and two-level outdoor lifestyle center located in Boulder, 
Colorado. The loan represents a pari-passu interest in a 
$150 million mortgage loan. The loan is interest-only 
for its entire term. The collateral includes traditional retail 
space, seven ground leases and 136,452 SF of office space, 
of which Whole Food's occupies 45,598 SF. As of December 
2015, the property was over 99% leased. Denver Premium 
Outlets, a potential competitor to this loan, is expected 
to open in late 2017 and will be located about 20 miles away from the 
subject. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 84% and 1.17X, 
respectively, unchanged since the last review.




The second largest loan is the Panorama Corporate Center Loan ($74.5 
million -- 9.9% of the pool), which is secured 
by a six building, class A, office campus located in Centennial, 
Colorado. The loan represents a pari-passu interest in a 
$133 million mortgage loan. The collateral is west of I-25 
and includes over 780,000 SF of office space leased to nine tenants. 
The largest tenant, Comcast, leases over 324,000 SF 
and has various lease expirations, with the first in 2025. 
As of November 2015, the properties were 93.1% leased. 
Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 115% and 0.87X, 
respectively, unchanged since securitization.




The third largest loan is the Cedarbrook Plaza Loan ($58.5 
million -- 7.8% of the pool), which is secured 
by a 649,337 SF anchored shopping center located in Wyncote, 
Pennsylvania. The collateral includes 10 one and two story buildings 
and 2,412 parking spaces. As of April 2016, the occupancy 
was 92.1%. Moody's LTV and stressed DSCR are 114% 
and 0.95X, respectively, unchanged since securitization.




REGULATORY DISCLOSURES




For further specification of Moody's key rating assumptions and sensitivity 
analysis, see the sections Methodology Assumptions and Sensitivity 
to Assumptions of the disclosure form.




The analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and 
performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected 
collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments. As a 
second step, Moody's estimates expected collateral losses or cash 
flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement, 
loss allocation and other structural features, to derive the expected 
loss for each rated instrument.




Moody's did not use any stress scenario simulations in its analysis.




For ratings issued on a program, series or category/class of debt, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to each rating of a subsequently issued bond or note of the same series

are derived exclusively from existing ratings in accordance with Moody's 
rating practices. For ratings issued on a support provider, 
this announcement provides certain regulatory disclosures in relation 
to the credit rating action on the support provider and in relation to 
each particular credit rating action for securities that derive their

For provisional ratings, this announcement provides certain regulatory 
disclosures in relation to the provisional rating assigned, and 
in relation to a definitive rating that may be assigned subsequent to 
the final issuance of the debt, in each case where the transaction 
structure and terms have not changed prior to the assignment of the definitive 
rating in a manner that would have affected the rating. For further 
information please see the ratings tab on the issuer/entity page for the 
respective issuer on www.moodys.com.




For any affected securities or rated entities receiving direct credit 
support from the primary entity(ies) of this credit rating action, 
and whose ratings may change as a result of this credit rating action, 
the associated regulatory disclosures will be those of the guarantor entity.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
