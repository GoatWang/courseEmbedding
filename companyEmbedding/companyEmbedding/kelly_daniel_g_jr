Daniel G. Kelly, Jr. is senior counsel in Davis Polk's Corporate Department and a founding partner of the firm’s Northern California office. His practice focuses on mergers and acquisitions, capital markets transactions and joint ventures.

In this capacity, he regularly advises the board and management on legal and compliance issues and has represented these companies in a broad variety of transactions.

Mr. Kelly was a Notes and Comments Editor of the Columbia Law Review and a law clerk for the Chief Judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. He began his legal career at Davis Polk in 1977 and spent two years in our Paris office, from 1980 to 1982. Before rejoining the firm as a partner in 1999, Mr. Kelly was a senior officer of a major investment banking firm, the chief legal officer of a New York Stock Exchange-listed corporation and a partner of a large international law firm.
