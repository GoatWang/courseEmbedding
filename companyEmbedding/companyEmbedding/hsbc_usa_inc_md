Forward-looking statements are based on our current views and assumptions and speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect subsequent circumstances or events. For more information about factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements, see Item 1A, "Risk Factors," in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  HSBC USA Inc.  Executive Overview  Organization and Basis of Reporting HSBC USA Inc. ("HSBC USA" and, together with its subsidiaries, "HUSI") is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC North America Holdings Inc. ("HSBC North America"), which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC Holdings plc ("HSBC" and, together with its subsidiaries, "HSBC Group"). HUSI may also be referred to in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") as "we", "us" or "our".   Our operations are focused on the core activities of our four global businesses and the positioning of our activities towards international connectivity strategies, including what we believe are our unique capabilities to serve clients in the North American Free Trade Agreement trade corridor in order to improve profitability. We also continue to focus on cost optimization efforts to ensure realization of cost efficiencies. To date, we have identified and implemented various opportunities to reduce costs through organizational structure redesign, vendor spending, discretionary spending and other general efficiency initiatives which have resulted in workforce reductions. Additional cost reduction opportunities have been identified and are in the process of implementation. These efforts continue and, as a result, we may incur restructuring charges in future periods, the amount of which will depend upon the actions that ultimately are implemented. We also continue to evaluate our overall operations as we seek to optimize our risk profile and cost efficiencies as well as our liquidity, capital and funding requirements. This could result in further strategic actions that may include changes to our legal structure, asset levels, cost structure or product offerings in support of HSBC's strategic priorities.  HSBC USA Inc.   Compliance costs totaled $240 million in 2015, compared with $289 million and $302 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. While we continue to focus attention on cost mitigation efforts as discussed below, compliance related costs remain elevated due to the continuing remediation required by regulatory consent agreements and the implementation of the highest and most effective global standards in combating financial crime ("Global Standards").   During the first quarter of 2015, HSBC USA repaid $4,000 million of senior long-term debt previously issued to HSBC North America and HSBC Bank USA repaid $900 million of subordinated long-term debt previously issued to HSBC USA. In conjunction with these repayments, HSBC USA received a capital contribution of $4,000 million from its immediate parent, HSBC North America Inc. ("HNAI"), in exchange for one share of common stock and HSBC USA made capital contributions to its subsidiary, HSBC Bank USA, of $2,400 million in exchange for two shares of common stock and $2,500 million in exchange for 250 shares of non-cumulative preferred stock. These capital actions were taken to support our growth strategy and to strengthen the Basel III regulatory capital positions of both HSBC USA and HSBC Bank USA.   During the second quarter of 2015, HSBC USA exercised the option to call $560 million of junior subordinated debentures previously issued by HSBC USA to HSBC USA Capital Trusts I, II and III at the contractual call prices of 100.781 percent, 100.84 percent and 100.732 percent, respectively, which resulted in a net loss on extinguishment of approximately $11 million. The trusts used the proceeds to redeem the trust preferred securities previously issued to third party investors. During the second quarter of 2015, HSBC USA also redeemed all of its Adjustable Rate Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series D and its $2.8575 Cumulative Preferred Stock at their stated values of $100 per share and $50 per share, respectively, resulting in a total cash payment of $300 million. Under the Basel III final rule, the trust preferred securities and cumulative perpetual preferred stock will fully phase out of Tier 1 capital to Tier 2 capital by January 1, 2016. In addition, the trust preferred securities will start phasing out of Tier 2 capital in 2016 and fully phase out by January 1, 2022. In response to these rule changes, the capital instruments were redeemed and HSBC USA issued $850 million of Tier 2 subordinated debt to HSBC North America in the second quarter of 2015.  Performance, Developments and Trends Net income (loss) was income of $330 million in 2015 compared with income of $354 million and a loss of $338 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. Net income in 2015 reflects the impact of New York City tax reform which resulted in an increase in tax expense of $48 million. Net income in 2014 was significantly impacted by a tax reserve release as a result of the settlement of certain state and local tax audits which resulted in an income tax benefit of $183 million and the impact of New York State tax reform which resulted in an increase in tax expense of $75 million. Income (loss) before income tax was income of $560 million in 2015 compared with income of $298 million and a loss of $182 million in 2014 and 2013, respectively. The increase in income (loss) before income tax in 2015 compared with 2014 reflects lower operating expenses, higher net interest income and higher other revenues, partially offset by a higher provision for credit losses primarily related to oil and gas industry loan exposures.

HSBC USA Inc.  (2) Represents a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure.  Excluding the collective impact of the items in the table above, our adjusted performance for 2015 declined $113 million compared with 2014 as a higher provision for credit losses, largely commercial related, and lower other revenues driven primarily by lower securities gains and lower mortgage banking revenue was partially offset by higher net interest income and lower operating expenses. Excluding the collective impact of the items in the table above, our adjusted performance for 2014 decreased $190 million compared with 2013 as lower other revenues driven primarily by lower trading revenue and lower fair value option revenue as well as higher operating expenses driven by higher support services charges were partially offset by a lower provision for credit losses and higher net interest income.  HSBC USA Inc.  Basis of Reporting  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). In addition to the U.S. GAAP financial results reported in our consolidated financial statements, MD&A includes reference to the following information which is presented on a non-U.S. GAAP basis:  Year Ended December 31, 2015 2014 2013 (in millions) Net income (loss) - U.S. GAAP basis $ 330 $ 354 $ (338 ) Adjustments, net of tax: Loan impairment 124 112 29 Pension and other postretirement benefit costs 14 12 16 Loans held for sale 9 (6 ) - Reclassification of fair value measured financial assets during 2008 1 1 (17 ) Litigation expense (1 ) (79 ) 63 Securities (1 ) (2 ) 3 Tax valuation allowances (5 ) 5 - Property (10 ) (7 ) (10 ) Loan origination (14 ) (9 ) (10 ) Gain on sale of London Branch precious metals business to affiliate - 60 - Goodwill impairment - - 136 Other (4 ) (6 ) (18 ) Net income (loss) - Group Reporting Basis 443 435 (146 ) Tax expense (benefit) - Group Reporting Basis 312 (9 ) 219 Profit before tax - Group Reporting Basis $ 755 $ 426 $ 73  A summary of the differences between U.S. GAAP and Group Reporting Basis as they impact our results is presented below:  HSBC USA Inc.  upon regulatory guidance and bank industry practice in the U.S. As a result of this review, our emergence period was increased, resulting in an increase in loan impairment charges under U.S. GAAP.

What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.


The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

United States District Judge allowed class action to go forward against HSBC USA. Attorneys Julio J. Ramos, Steven M. Nunez and the Ward Hagen LLP obtained a significant legal victory in a class action against HSBC USA. Allegedly, the defendant maintained a correspondent banking account for HSBC Hong Kong. Correspondent banking is a practice in which the U.S. bank facilitates wire transfers between foreign financial institutions and their customers, even though the U.S. bank does not have a direct relationship with the institution's customers. Allegedly, between July and December 2013, thousands of investor victims of the WCM777 fraud, wire transferred over USD 37 million to HSBC Hong Kong after several United States regulators had commenced enforcement proceedings against WCM777 accounts in the United States. Allegedly, as its correspondent bank, HSBC USA processed many of these wire transfers.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Forward-Looking Statements  Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations ("MD&A") should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements, notes and tables included elsewhere in this report and with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012 (the "2012 Form 10-K"). MD&A may contain certain statements that may be forward-looking in nature within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, we may make or approve certain statements in future filings with the SEC, in press releases, or oral or written presentations by representatives of HSBC USA Inc. ("HSBC USA") that are not statements of historical fact and may also constitute forward-looking statements. Words such as "may," "will," "should," "would," "could," "appears," "believe," "intends," "expects," "estimates," "targeted," "plans," "anticipates," "goal" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements but should not be considered as the only means through which these statements may be made. These matters or statements will relate to our future financial condition, economic forecast, results of operations, plans, objectives, performance or business developments and will involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from that which were expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are based on our current views and assumptions and speak only as of the date they are made. HSBC USA Inc. undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect subsequent circumstances or events.  Executive Overview  HSBC USA Inc. ("HSBC USA" and, together with its subsidiaries, "HUSI") is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC North America Holdings Inc. ("HSBC North America"), which is an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of HSBC Holdings plc ("HSBC"). HUSI may also be referred to in MD&A as "we", "us" or "our". The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations excludes the results of our discontinued operations unless otherwise noted. See Note 2, "Discontinued Operations," in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion.  HSBC USA Inc.  The housing market continued the strong rebound in 2013 with overall home prices moving higher in many regions as demand increased and the supply of homes for sale remained restricted. However, the sharp decline in the share of foreclosed home sales currently being experienced, which is contributing to the increase in home sale prices, may not continue as the impact of servicers resuming foreclosure activities and the listing of the underlying properties for sale along with the recent increases in mortgage interest rates could slow down future price gains. In addition, certain courts and state legislatures have issued new rules or statutes relating to foreclosures. Scrutiny of foreclosure documentation has increased in some courts. Also, in some areas, officials are requiring additional verification of information filed prior to the foreclosure proceeding. The combination of these factors has led to a significant backlog of foreclosures which will take time to resolve. If a significant number of foreclosures come to market at the same time, due to the backlog or other delays in processing, it could have an adverse impact upon home prices. Performance, Developments and Trends The following table sets forth selected financial highlights of HSBC USA Inc. for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012 and as of September 30, 2013 and December 31, 2012.   Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2013 2012 2013 2012 (dollars are in millions) Income (loss) from continuing operations $ 4 $ (782 ) $ 367 $ (1,295 ) Rate of return on average: Total assets - % (1.6 )% .3 % (.9 )% Total common shareholder's equity (.4 ) (19.1 ) 2.6 (10.6 ) Net interest margin 1.26 1.22 1.29 1.31 Efficiency ratio 92.5 177.4 78.3 123.2 Commercial net charge-off ratio(1) .05 .18 .18 .35 Consumer net charge-off ratio(1) 1.19 .93 .94 1.31  (1) Excludes loans held for sale.  HSBC USA Inc. September 30, 2013 December 31, 2012 (dollars are in millions) Additional Select Ratios: Allowance as a percent of loans(1) .88 % 1.02 % Commercial allowance as a percent of loans(1) .65 .72 Consumer allowance as a percent of loans(1) 1.47 1.73 Consumer two-months-and-over contractual delinquency 6.92 6.92 Loans to deposits ratio(2) 77.48 71.35 Tier 1 capital to risk weighted assets 11.66 13.61 Tier 1 common equity to risk weighted assets 9.98 11.63 Total capital to risk weighted assets 16.30 19.52 Total shareholders' equity to total assets 9.28 9.32 Select Balance Sheet Data: Cash and interest bearing deposits with banks $ 31,429 $ 14,638 Trading assets 25,527 30,874 Securities available-for-sale 48,053 67,716 Loans: Commercial loans 48,509 44,150 Consumer loans 19,201 19,108 Total loans 67,710 63,258 Deposits 112,921 117,671  (1) Excludes loans held for sale.  (2) Represents period end loans, net of allowance for loan losses, as a percentage of domestic deposits equal to or less than $100,000.  Income from continuing operations was $4 million and $367 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, respectively, compared with a loss from continuing operations of $782 million and $1,295 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, respectively. Income from continuing operations before income tax was $15 million and $531 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, respectively, compared with a loss from continuing operations before income tax of $794 million and $938 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012, respectively. The significant improvement in both periods reflects lower operating expenses as the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012 include an expense of $800 million and $1,500 million, respectively, related to certain regulatory matters and a lower provision for credit losses which was partially offset by lower net interest income and in the year-to-date period, lower other revenues. Other revenues in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012 includes pre-tax gains of $103 million and $433 million, respectively, from the sale of certain retail branches to First Niagara. In addition, our results in all periods were impacted by the change in the fair value of our own debt attributable to credit spread for which we have elected fair value option which distorts comparability of the underlying performance trends of our business. The following table summarizes the impact of this item on our income from continuing operations before income tax for all periods presented:   Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2013 2012 2013 2012 (in millions) Income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax, as reported $ 15 $ (794 ) $ 531 $ (938 ) Fair value movement on own fair value option debt attributable to credit spread 63 179 52 269 Underlying income (loss) from continuing operations before income tax (1) $ 78 $ (615 ) $ 583 $ (669 )  (1) Represents a non-U.S. GAAP financial measure.  HSBC USA Inc.  Excluding the impact of the change in the fair value of our own debt attributable to credit spread for which we have elected fair value option accounting in the table above, our underlying income (loss) from continuing operations before tax for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013 increased $693 million and $1,252 million, respectively, compared with the prior year periods as as lower operating expenses and a lower provision for credit losses was partially offset by lower net interest income and lower other revenues.   Nine Months Ended Three Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2013 2012 2013 2012 (in millions) Gains (Losses) Insurance monoline structured credit products(1) $ 1 $ 16 $ 42 $ 6 Other structured credit products(1) 15 38 53 112 Mortgage whole loans held for sale (predominantly subprime)(2) (2 ) (9 ) 5 (12 ) Leverage acquisition finance loans(3) - 14 13 48 Total gains $ 14 $ 59 $ 113 $ 154  (1) Reflected in Trading revenue in the consolidated statement of income (loss).  (2) Reflected in Other income in the consolidated statement of income (loss).  (3) Reflected in Loss on instruments designated at fair value and related derivatives in the consolidated statement of income (loss).  See "Results of Operations" for a more detailed discussion of our operating trends. In addition, see "Balance Sheet Review" for further discussion on our receivable trends, "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for further discussion on funding and capital and "Credit Quality" for additional discussion on our credit trends.  HSBC USA Inc.  paid-in-capital, net of tax, of approximately $55 million upon close. The cash sale is currently expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2014. Had the sale occurred on September 30, 2013, the book value of our remaining Global Banking and Markets reporting unit would have been 91 percent of fair value. At September 30, 2013, assets and liabilities related to this business totaled approximately $11.0 billion each, while revenue associated with this business was approximately $37 million and $52 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2013 and 2012, respectively. We will continue to operate our metals trading business which is unaffected by this decision.  Basis of Reporting  Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("U.S. GAAP"). Unless noted, the discussion of our financial condition and results of operations included in MD&A are presented on a continuing operations basis of reporting. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current year presentation.   Three Months Ended September 30, Nine Months Ended September 30, 2013 2012 2013 2012 (in millions) Net income - U.S. GAAP basis $ 4 $ (782 ) $ 367 $ (1,092 ) Adjustments, net of tax: IFRSs reclassification of fair value measured financial assets during 2008 - (17 ) (17 ) (59 ) Securities 6 (3 ) 2 (4 ) Derivatives - 3 1 1 Loan impairment 3 (2 ) 14 8 Property (6 ) (7 ) (10 ) (16 ) Pension costs 3 (11 ) 10 (3 ) Transfer of credit card receivables to held for sale and subsequent sale - - - (31 ) Gain on sale of branches - 22 - 92 Litigation accrual 13 (13 ) 6 (10 ) Other (1 ) 13 (24 ) 21 Net income - IFRSs basis 22 (797 ) 349 (1,093 ) Tax expense (benefit) - IFRSs basis 9 (34 ) 151 390 Profit before tax - IFRSs basis $ 31 $ (831 ) $ 500 $ (703 )  The significant differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRSs impacting our results presented in the table above are discussed in more detail within "Basis of Reporting" in our 2012 Form 10-K. Except as noted below, there have been no significant changes since December 31, 2012 in the differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRSs impacting our results. With regard to loan impairment charges, prior to the second quarter of 2013, we concluded that for IFRSs the estimated average period of time from last current status to write-off for real estate secured loans collectively evaluated for impairment using a roll rate migration analysis was 10 months. In the second quarter of 2013, we updated our review under IFRSs to reflect the period of time after a loss event that a loan remains current before delinquency is observed. This review resulted in an estimated average period of time from a loss event occurring and its ultimate migration from current status through to delinquency and ultimately write-off for real estate secured loans collectively evaluated for impairment using a roll rate migration analysis of 12 months.

	Linked to a Basket of Three Financial Sector
	Stocks, due July 1, 2016









	  






	Summary


	 


	The Strategic Accelerated Redemption Securities

	®

	Linked
	to a Basket of Three Financial Sector Stocks, due July 1, 2016 (the “notes”) are our senior unsecured debt securities
	and are not a direct or indirect obligation of any third party. The notes are not deposit liabilities or other obligations of a
	bank and are not guaranteed or insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental agency of the United
	States or any other jurisdiction.

	The notes will rank equally with all of our other


	senior unsecured debt. Any payments
	due on the notes, including any repayment of principal, depends on the credit risk of HSBC and its ability to satisfy its obligations
	as they come due.

	The notes will be automatically called at the applicable Call Amount if the Observation Level of the Market
	Measure, which is the basket of three financial sector stocks described below (the “Basket”), on any Observation Date
	is equal to or greater than the Starting Value. If your notes are not called, you will lose all or a portion of the principal amount
	of your notes. Payments on the notes, including the amount you receive at maturity or upon an automatic call, will be calculated
	based on the $10 principal amount per unit and will depend on the performance of the Basket, subject to our credit risk. See “Terms
	of the Notes” below.


	 


	The Basket is comprised of Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase &
	Co. and Morgan Stanley. On the pricing date, Citigroup was given an initial weight of 33.34% and each of JPMorgan Chase & Co.
	and Morgan Stanley was given an initial weight of 33.33%.


	 


	The estimated initial value of the notes is less than the price
	you pay to purchase the notes. The estimated initial value was determined by reference to our or our affiliates’ internal
	pricing models and reflects our internal funding rate, which is the borrowing rate we pay to issue market-linked notes, and the
	market prices for hedging arrangements related to the notes (which may include call options, put options or other derivatives).
	This internal funding rate is typically lower than the rate we would use when we issue conventional fixed or floating rate debt
	securities. The difference in the borrowing rate, as well as the underwriting discount and the costs associated with hedging the
	notes, including the hedging related charge described below, reduced the economic terms of the notes (including the Call Amounts
	and Call Premiums). The notes are subject to an automatic call, and the initial estimated value is based on an assumed tenor of
	the notes.

	Investor Considerations


	 





	You may wish to consider an investment in the notes if:




	The notes may not be an appropriate investment for you if:







	§	

	You
	anticipate that the Observation Level of the Basket on any of the Observation Dates will be equal to or greater than the Starting
	Value and, in that case, you accept an early exit from your investment.



	§	

	You
	accept that the return on the notes will be limited to the return represented by the applicable Call Premium even if the percentage
	change in the value of the Basket is significantly greater than the applicable Call Premium.



	§	

	If
	the notes are not called, you accept that your investment will result in a loss, which could be significant, if the Ending Value
	is below the Threshold Value.



	§	

	You
	are willing to forgo the interest payments that are paid on traditional interest bearing debt securities.



	§	

	You
	are willing to forgo dividends or other benefits of owning shares of the Basket Stocks.



	§	

	You
	are willing to accept that a secondary market is not expected to develop for the notes, and understand that the market prices for
	the notes, if any, may be less than the principal amount and will be affected by various factors, including our actual and perceived
	creditworthiness, our internal funding rate and the fees charged, as described on page TS-2.



	§	

	You
	are willing to assume our credit risk, as issuer of the notes, for all payments under the notes, including the Call Amounts and
	the Redemption Amount.





	§	

	You
	wish to make an investment that cannot be automatically called prior to maturity.



	§	

	You
	believe that the value of the Basket will decrease from the Starting Value to the Ending Value.



	§	

	You
	anticipate that the Observation Level will be less than the Call Level on each Observation Date.



	§	

	You
	seek an uncapped return on your investment.



	§	

	You
	seek principal repayment or preservation of capital.



	§	

	You
	seek interest payments or other current income on your investment.



	§	

	You
	want to receive dividends or other distributions paid on the Basket Stocks.



	§	

	You
	seek an investment for which there will be a liquid secondary market.



	§	

	You
	are unwilling or are unable to take market risk on the notes or to take our credit risk as issuer of the notes.






	We urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting,
	and other advisors before you invest in the notes.

	Examples of Hypothetical Payments


	 


	The following examples are for purposes of illustration only.
	They are based on

	hypothetical

	values and show

	hypothetical

	returns on the notes. They illustrate the calculation
	of the Call Amount or Redemption Amount, as applicable, based on the hypothetical terms set forth below.

	The actual amount you
	receive and the resulting return will depend on the actual Observation Levels and the term of your investment.

	The following
	examples do not take into account any tax consequences from investing in the notes. These examples are based on:


	 






	1)


	the Starting Value of 100.00;




	 






	2)


	the Threshold Value of 100.00;




	 






	3)


	the Call Level of 100.00;




	 






	4)


	the term of the notes from June 26, 2015 to July 1, 2016 if the notes are not called on the first or second Observation Dates;




	 






	5)


	the Call Premium of 6.250% of the principal amount if the notes are called on the first Observation Date, 9.375% if called
	on the second Observation Date and 12.500% if called on the final Observation Date; and




	 






	6)


	Observation Dates occurring on December 18, 2015, March 18, 2016, and June 24, 2016 (the final Observation Date).




	 


	For hypothetical historical values of the
	Basket, see “The Basket” section below. For recent actual prices of the Basket Stocks, see “The Basket Stocks”
	section below. The Ending Value will not include any income generated by dividends paid on the Basket Stocks, which you would otherwise
	be entitled to receive if you invested in those stocks directly. In addition, all payments on the notes are subject to issuer credit
	risk.



	 





	Notes Are Called on an Observation Date




	 


	The notes will be called at $10.0000 plus the applicable Call
	Premium on one of the Observation Dates if the Observation Level is equal to or greater than the Call Level.


	 



	Example 1

	– The Observation Level on the first
	Observation Date is 110.00. Therefore, the notes will be called at $10.0000 plus the Call Premium of $0.6250 = $10.6250 per unit.
	After the notes are called, they will no longer remain outstanding and there will not be any further payments on the notes.


	 



	Example 2

	– The Observation Level on the first
	Observation Date is below the Call Level, but the Observation Level on the second Observation Date is 105.00. Therefore, the notes
	will be called at $10.0000 plus the Call Premium of $0.9375 = $10.9375 per unit. After the notes are called, they will no longer
	remain outstanding and there will not be any further payments on the notes.


	 



	Example 3

	– The Observation Levels on the first
	and second Observation Dates are below the Call Level, but the Observation Level on the third and final Observation Date is 105.00.
	Therefore, the notes will be called at $10.0000 plus the Call Premium of $1.2500 = $11.2500 per unit.

	Example 4

	– The notes are not called on any Observation
	Date and the Ending Value is less than the Threshold Value. The Redemption Amount will be less, and possibly significantly less,
	than the principal amount. For example, if the Ending Value is 80.0000, the Redemption Amount per unit will be:

	Risk Factors


	 



	We urge you to read the section “Risk Factors”
	in the product supplement and in the accompanying prospectus supplement. Investing in the notes is not equivalent to investing
	directly in the Basket Stocks. You should understand the risks of investing in the notes and should reach an investment decision
	only after careful consideration, with your advisers, with respect to the notes in light of your particular financial and other
	circumstances and the information set forth in this term sheet and the accompanying product supplement, prospectus supplement and
	prospectus.



	 



	In addition to the risks in the product supplement identified
	below, you should review “Risk Factors” in the accompanying prospectus supplement, including the explanation of risks
	relating to the notes described in the section “— Risks Relating to All Note Issuances.”



	 







	§



	If the notes are not called, your investment will result in a loss; there is no guaranteed return of principal.




	 







	§



	Your return on the notes may be less than the yield you could earn by owning a conventional fixed or floating rate debt security
	of comparable maturity.




	 







	§



	Payments on the notes are subject to our credit risk, and actual or perceived changes in our creditworthiness are expected
	to affect the value of the notes. If we become insolvent or are unable to pay our obligations, you may lose your entire investment.




	 







	§



	Your investment return is limited to the return represented by the applicable Call Premium and may be less than a comparable
	investment directly in the Basket Stocks.




	 







	§



	The estimated initial value of the notes is less than the public offering price and may differ from the market value of the
	notes in the secondary market, if any. We determined the estimated initial value by reference to our or our affiliates’ internal
	pricing models. These pricing models consider certain assumptions and variables, which can include volatility and interest rates.
	These pricing models rely in part on certain forecasts about future events, which may prove to be incorrect. Different pricing
	models and assumptions could provide valuations for the notes that are different from our estimated initial value. The estimated
	initial value reflects our internal funding rate we use to issue market-linked notes, as well as the mid-market value of the hedging
	arrangements related to the notes (which may include call options, put options or other derivatives).




	 







	§



	Our internal funding rate for the issuance of these notes is lower than the rate we would use when we issue conventional fixed
	or floating rate debt securities. This is one of the factors that may result in the market value of the notes being less than their
	estimated initial value. As a result of the difference between our internal funding rate and the rate we would use when we issue
	conventional fixed or floating rate debt securities, the estimated initial value of the notes may be lower if it were based on
	the levels at which our fixed or floating rate debt securities trade in the secondary market. In addition, if we were to use the
	rate we use for our conventional fixed or floating rate debt issuances, we would expect the economic terms of the notes to be more
	favorable to you.




	 







	§



	The price of your notes in the secondary market, if any, immediately after the pricing date will be less than the public offering
	price. The public offering price takes into account certain costs, principally the underwriting discount, the hedging costs described
	on page TS-14 and the costs associated with issuing the notes. The costs associated with issuing the notes will be used or retained
	by us or one of our affiliates. If you were to sell your notes in the secondary market, if any, the price you would receive for
	your notes may be less than the price you paid for them.




	 







	§



	The estimated initial value does not represent a minimum price at which we, MLPF&S or any of our respective affiliates
	would be willing to purchase your notes in the secondary market (if any exists) at any time. The price of your notes in the secondary
	market, if any, at any time after issuance will vary based on many factors, including the value of the Market Measure and changes
	in market conditions, and cannot be predicted with accuracy. The notes are not designed to be short-term trading instruments, and
	you should, therefore, be able and willing to hold the notes to maturity. Any sale of the notes prior to maturity could result
	in a loss to you.




	 







	§



	A trading market is not expected to develop for the notes. Neither we nor MLPF&S is obligated to make a market for, or
	to repurchase, the notes. There is no assurance that any party will be willing to purchase your notes at any price in any secondary
	market.




	 







	§



	Our business, hedging and trading activities, and those of MLPF&S and our respective affiliates (including trades in shares
	of the Basket Stocks), and any hedging and trading activities we, MLPF&S or our respective affiliates engage in for our clients’
	accounts, may affect the market value and return of the notes and may create conflicts of interest with you.




	 







	§



	Changes in the price of one Basket Stock may be offset by changes in the prices of the other Basket Stocks.




	 







	§



	You will have no rights of a holder of the Basket Stocks, and you will not be entitled to receive shares of the Basket Stocks
	or dividends or other distributions by the Underlying Companies.




	 







	§



	While we, MLPF&S or our respective affiliates may from time to time own securities of the Underlying Companies, we, MLPF&S
	and our respective affiliates do not control any Underlying Company, and are not responsible for any disclosure made by any Underlying
	Company.




	 







	§



	The payments on the notes will not be adjusted for all corporate events that could affect a Basket Stock. See “Description
	of the Notes—Anti-Dilution Adjustments” beginning on page PS-21 of product supplement STOCK STR-1.

	§



	There may be potential conflicts of interest involving the calculation agent. We have the right to appoint and remove the calculation
	agent.




	 







	§



	The U.S. federal income tax consequences of the notes are uncertain, and may be adverse to a holder of the notes. See “Summary
	Tax Consequences” below and “U.S. Federal Income Tax Summary” beginning on page PS-35 of product supplement STOCK
	STR-1.





	 




	Additional Risk Factors



	 




	The Basket Stocks are concentrated in one sector

	. All
	of the Basket Stocks are issued by companies in the financial services sector. Although an investment in the notes will not give
	holders any ownership or other direct interests in the Basket Stocks, the return on an investment in the notes will be subject
	to certain risks associated with a direct equity investment in companies in the financial services sector, including those discussed
	below. Accordingly, by investing in the notes, you will not benefit from the diversification which could result from an investment
	linked to companies that operate in multiple sectors. In addition, because the Basket Stocks are concentrated in one sector, their
	prices may increase or decrease at similar times and by similar magnitudes, and they may perform similarly over the term of the
	notes. You will be subject to risks relating to the relationship among the Basket Stocks.


	 



	Adverse conditions in the financial services sector may reduce
	your return on the notes

	. All of the Basket Stocks are issued by companies whose primary lines of business are directly associated
	with the financial services sector. The profitability of these companies is largely dependent on the availability and cost of capital
	funds, and can fluctuate significantly, particularly when market interest rates change. Credit losses resulting from financial
	difficulties of these companies’ customers can negatively impact the sector. In addition, adverse international economic,
	business, or political developments, including with respect to the insurance sector, or to real estate and loans secured by real
	estate, could have a major effect on the prices of the Basket Stocks. As a result of these factors, the value of the notes may
	be subject to greater volatility and be more adversely affected by economic, political, or regulatory events relating to the financial
	services sector.


	 



	Economic conditions have adversely impacted the stock prices
	of many companies in the financial services sector, and may do so during the term of the notes.

	In recent years, international
	economic conditions have resulted, and may continue to result, in significant losses among many companies that operate in the financial
	services sector. These conditions have also resulted, and may continue to result, in a high degree of volatility in the stock prices
	of financial institutions, and substantial fluctuations in the profitability of these companies. Numerous financial services companies
	have experienced substantial decreases in the value of their assets, taken action to raise capital (including the issuance of debt
	or equity securities), or even ceased operations. Further, companies in the financial services sector have been subject to unprecedented
	government actions and regulation, which may limit the scope of their operations and, in turn, result in a decrease in value of
	these companies. Any of these factors may have an adverse impact on the performance of the Basket Stocks. As a result, the prices
	of the Basket Stocks may be adversely affected by economic, political, or regulatory events affecting the financial services sector
	or one of the sub-sectors of the financial services sector. This in turn could adversely impact the market value of the notes and
	the payment on the notes.

	The Basket


	 


	The Basket is designed to allow investors to participate in
	the percentage changes of the Basket from the Starting Value to the Ending Value. The Basket Stocks are described in the section
	“The Basket Stocks” below. Each Basket Stock was assigned an initial weight on the pricing date, as set forth in the
	table below.


	 


	For more information on the calculation of the value of the
	Basket, please see the section entitled “Description of the Notes—Basket Market Measures” beginning on page PS-26
	of product supplement STOCK STR-1.


	 


	On the pricing date, for each Basket Stock, the Initial Component
	Weight, the Closing Market Price, the Component Ratio and the initial contribution to the Basket value were as follows:

	These were the Closing Market Prices of the Basket Stocks on the pricing date.




	 






	(2)


	Each Component Ratio equals the Initial Component Weight of the relevant Basket Stock (as a percentage) multiplied by 100,
	and then divided by the Closing Market Price of that Basket Stock on the pricing date and rounded to eight decimal places.




	 


	The calculation agent will calculate the value of the Basket
	on each Observation Date by summing the products of (a) the Closing Market Price, multiplied by its respective Price Multiplier,
	for each Basket Stock on that day and (b) the Component Ratio applicable to that Basket Stock. If a Market Disruption Event occurs
	as to any Basket Stock on any scheduled Observation Date, the Closing Market Price of that Basket Stock will be determined as more
	fully described in the section entitled “Description of the Notes—Basket Market Measures—Observation Level of
	the Basket” on page PS-28 of product supplement STOCK STR-1.

	While actual historical information on the Basket did

	The Basket Stocks


	 


	We have derived the following information about the Underlying
	Companies from publicly available documents. We have not independently verified the following information.


	 


	Because each Basket Stock is registered under the Securities
	Exchange Act of 1934, the Underlying Companies are required to file periodically certain financial and other information specified
	by the SEC. Information provided to or filed with the SEC by the Underlying Companies can be located at the Public Reference Section
	of the SEC, 100 F Street, N.E., Room 1580, Washington, D.C. 20549 or through the SEC’s web site at http://www.sec.gov by
	reference to the applicable CIK number set forth below.


	 


	This term sheet relates only to the notes and does not relate
	to any securities of the Underlying Companies. Neither we nor any of our affiliates have participated or will participate in the
	preparation of the Underlying Companies’ publicly available documents. Neither we nor any of our affiliates have made any
	due diligence inquiry with respect to the Underlying Companies in connection with the offering of the notes. Neither we nor any
	of our affiliates make any representation that the publicly available documents or any other publicly available information regarding
	the Underlying Companies are accurate or complete. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that all events occurring prior to the
	date of this term sheet, including events that would affect the accuracy or completeness of these publicly available documents
	that would affect the trading price of the Basket Stocks, have been or will be publicly disclosed. Subsequent disclosure of any
	events or the disclosure of or failure to disclose material future events concerning the Underlying Companies could affect the
	value of the Basket Stocks and therefore could affect your return on the notes. The selection of the Basket Stocks is not a recommendation
	to buy or sell shares of the Basket Stocks.


	 


	The tables set forth below show the quarterly high and low Closing
	Market Prices of the shares of the Basket Stocks on their primary exchange from the first quarter of 2008 through the pricing date.
	We obtained this historical data from Bloomberg L.P. We have not independently verified the accuracy or completeness of the information
	obtained from Bloomberg L.P. These historical trading prices may have been adjusted to reflect certain corporate actions such as
	stock splits and reverse stock splits.

	Supplement to the Plan of Distribution


	 


	We will deliver the notes against payment therefor in New York,
	New York on a date that is greater than three business days following the pricing date. Under Rule 15c6-1 of the Securities Exchange
	Act of 1934, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in three business days, unless the parties to any
	such trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the notes more than three business days prior to
	the original issue date will be required to specify alternative settlement arrangements to prevent a failed settlement.


	 


	The notes will not be listed on any securities exchange. In
	the original offering of the notes, the notes will be sold in minimum investment amounts of 100 units. If you place an order to
	purchase the notes, you are consenting to MLPF&S acting as a principal in effecting the transaction for your account.


	 


	MLPF&S may repurchase and resell the notes, with repurchases
	and resales being made at prices related to then-prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices, and these will include MLPF&S’s
	trading commissions and mark-ups. MLPF&S may act as principal or agent in these market-making transactions; however, it is
	not obligated to engage in any such transactions. At MLPF&S’s discretion, for a short, undetermined initial period after
	the issuance of the notes, MLPF&S may offer to buy the notes in the secondary market at a price that may exceed the estimated
	initial value of the notes. Any price offered by MLPF&S for the notes will be based on then-prevailing market conditions and
	other considerations, including the performance of the Basket, the remaining term of the notes, and the issuer’s creditworthiness.
	However, neither we nor any of our affiliates is obligated to purchase your notes at any price, or at any time, and we cannot assure
	you that we, MLPF&S or any of our respective affiliates will purchase your notes at a price that equals or exceeds the estimated
	initial value of the notes.


	 


	The value of the notes shown on your account statement provided
	by MLPF&S will be based on their estimate of the value of the notes if MLPF&S or one of its affiliates were to make a market
	in the notes, which it is not obligated to do. This estimate will be based upon the price that MLPF&S may pay for the notes
	in light of then-prevailing market conditions, and other considerations, as mentioned above, and will include transaction costs.
	At certain times, this price may be higher than or lower than the estimated initial value of the notes.


	 


	The distribution of the Note Prospectus in connection with these
	offers or sales will be solely for the purpose of providing investors with the description of the terms of the notes that was made
	available to investors in connection with their initial offering. Secondary market investors should not, and will not be authorized
	to, rely on the Note Prospectus for information regarding HSBC or for any purpose other than that described in the immediately
	preceding sentence.


	 



	Role of MLPF&S



	 


	MLPF&S will participate as selling agent in the distribution
	of the notes. Under our distribution agreement with MLPF&S, MLPF&S will purchase the notes from us as principal at the
	public offering price indicated on the cover of this term sheet, less the indicated underwriting discount.


	 


	Payments on the notes, including the amount you receive at maturity
	or upon an automatic call, will be calculated based on the $10 per unit principal amount and will depend on the performance of
	the Basket. In order to meet these payment obligations, at the time we issue the notes, we may choose to enter into certain hedging
	arrangements (which may include call options, put options or other derivatives) with MLPF&S or one of its affiliates. The terms
	of these hedging arrangements are determined by MLPF&S seeking bids from market participants, which could include one of our
	affiliates and MLPF&S and its affiliates. These hedging arrangements take into account a number of factors, including the issuer’s
	creditworthiness, interest rate movements, the volatility of the Basket Stocks, the tenor of the notes and the tenor of the hedging
	arrangements. The economic terms of the notes depend in part on the terms of the hedging arrangements.


	 


	MLPF&S has advised us that the hedging arrangements will
	include a hedging related charge of approximately $0.05 per unit, reflecting an estimated profit to be credited to MLPF&S from
	these transactions. Since hedging entails risk and may be influenced by unpredictable market forces, additional profits and losses
	from these hedging arrangements may be realized by MLPF&S or any third party hedge providers.


	 


	For further information, see “Risk Factors—General
	Risks Relating to the Notes” beginning on page PS-6 and “Use of Proceeds” on page PS-16 of product supplement
	STOCK STR-1.

	Summary Tax Consequences


	 


	You should consider the U.S. federal income tax consequences
	of an investment in the notes, including the following:


	 







	§



	There is no statutory, judicial, or administrative authority directly addressing the characterization of the notes.




	 







	§



	You agree with us (in the absence of an administrative determination, or judicial ruling to the contrary) to characterize and
	treat the notes for all tax purposes as pre-paid executory contracts with respect to the Basket that requires you to pay us at
	inception an amount equal to the purchase price of the notes and that entitles you to receive at maturity or upon earlier redemption
	an amount in cash linked to the level of the Basket.




	 







	§



	Under this characterization and tax treatment of the notes, a U.S. holder (as defined in the prospectus supplement) generally
	will recognize capital gain or loss upon receipt of a cash payment at maturity or upon a sale, exchange, redemption, retirement
	or other disposition of the notes. This capital gain or loss generally will be long-term capital gain or loss if you held the notes
	for more than one year, and otherwise will be short-term capital gain or loss. Accordingly, if the notes are called on the first
	or second Observation Date, your capital gain or loss generally will be short-term capital gain or loss. The deductibility of capital
	losses is subject to limitations.




	 







	§



	No assurance can be given that the IRS or any court will agree with this characterization and tax treatment.




	 


	You should consult your own tax advisor concerning the U.S.
	federal income tax consequences to you of acquiring, owning, and disposing of the notes, as well as any tax consequences arising
	under the laws of any state, local, foreign, or other tax jurisdiction and the possible effects of changes in U.S. federal or other
	tax laws. You should review carefully the discussion under the section entitled “U.S. Federal Income Tax Summary” beginning
	on page PS-35 of product supplement STOCK STR-1.



	 




	Validity of the Notes


	 


	In
	the opinion of Morrison & Foerster LLP, as counsel to the Issuer, when this term sheet has been attached to, and duly notated
	on, the master note that represents the notes pursuant to the Senior Indenture referred to in the prospectus supplement dated March
	5, 2015, and issued and paid for as contemplated herein, the notes offered by this term sheet will be valid, binding and enforceable
	obligations of the Issuer, entitled to the benefits of the Senior Indenture, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar
	laws affecting creditors’ rights generally, concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability
	(including, without limitation, concepts of good faith, fair dealing and the lack of bad faith). This opinion is given as of the
	date hereof and is limited to the laws of the State of New York, the Maryland General Corporation Law (including the statutory
	provisions, all applicable provisions of the Maryland Constitution and the reported judicial decisions interpreting the foregoing)
	and the federal laws of the United States of America. This opinion is subject to customary assumptions about the trustee’s
	authorization, execution and delivery of the Senior Indenture and the genuineness of signatures and to such counsel’s reliance
	on the Issuer and other sources as to certain factual matters, all as stated in the legal opinion dated March 5, 2015, which has
	been filed as Exhibit 5.3 to the Issuer’s registration statement on Form S-3 dated March 5, 2015.



	 




	Where You Can Find More Information


	 


	We have filed a registration statement (including a product
	supplement, a prospectus supplement, and a prospectus) with the SEC for the offering to which this term sheet relates. Before you
	invest, you should read the Note Prospectus, including this term sheet, and the other documents that we have filed with the SEC,
	for more complete information about us and this offering. You may get these documents without cost by visiting EDGAR on the SEC
	website at www.sec.gov. Alternatively, we, any agent, or any dealer participating in this offering will arrange to send you these
	documents if you so request by calling MLPF&S toll-free at 1-800-294-1322.


	 


	Market-Linked Investments Classification


	 





	 



	MLPF&S classifies certain market-linked investments (the
	“Market-Linked Investments”) into categories, each with different investment characteristics. The following description
	is meant solely for informational purposes and is not intended to represent any particular Enhanced Return Market-Linked Investment
	or guarantee any performance.



	 


	Enhanced Return Market-Linked Investments are short- to medium-term
	investments that offer you a way to enhance exposure to a particular market view without taking on a similarly enhanced level of
	market downside risk. They can be especially effective in a flat to moderately positive market (or, in the case of bearish investments,
	a flat to moderately negative market). In exchange for the potential to receive better-than market returns on the linked asset,
	you must generally accept market downside risk and capped upside potential. As these investments are not market downside protected,
	and do not assure full repayment of principal at maturity, you need to be prepared for the possibility that you may lose all or
	part of your investment.

	GENERAL



	 


	This pricing supplement relates to an offering
	of securities linked to the Reference Asset. The purchaser of a security will acquire a senior unsecured debt security of HSBC
	USA Inc. Although the offering of securities relates to the Reference Asset, you should not construe that fact as a recommendation
	as to the merits of acquiring an investment linked to the Reference Asset or any component security included in the Reference Asset
	or as to the suitability of an investment in the securities.


	 


	You should read this document together
	with the prospectus dated March 22, 2012, the prospectus supplement dated March 22, 2012 and the Equity Index Underlying Supplement
	dated March 22, 2012. If the terms of the securities offered hereby are inconsistent with those described in the accompanying Equity
	Index Underlying Supplement, prospectus supplement or prospectus, the terms described in this pricing supplement shall control.
	You should carefully consider, among other things, the matters set forth in “Risk Factors” beginning on page PS-5 of
	this pricing supplement, page S-3 of the prospectus supplement and page S-1 of the Equity Index Underlying Supplement, as the securities
	involve risks not associated with conventional debt securities. We urge you to consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting
	and other advisors before you invest in the securities. As used herein, references to the “Issuer”, “HSBC”,
	“we”, “us” and “our” are to HSBC USA Inc.


	 


	HSBC has filed a registration statement
	(including a prospectus, prospectus supplement and Equity Index Underlying Supplement) with the SEC for the offering to which this
	pricing supplement relates. Before you invest, you should read the prospectus, prospectus supplement and Equity Index Underlying
	Supplement in that registration statement and other documents HSBC has filed with the SEC for more complete information about HSBC
	and this offering. You may get these documents for free by visiting EDGAR on the SEC’s web site at www.sec.gov. Alternatively,

	PAYMENT AT MATURITY



	 


	On the Maturity Date, for each security
	you hold, we will pay you the Final Settlement Value, which is an amount in cash, as described below:


	 



	If the Reference Return is greater than
	zero

	, you will receive a cash payment on the Maturity Date, per $1,000 Principal Amount, calculated as follows:


	 


	$1,000 + ($1,000 ×
	Reference Return × Upside Participation Rate).


	 



	If the Reference Return is less than
	or equal to zero but greater than or equal to the Barrier Level,

	you will receive a cash payment on the Maturity Date of $1,000
	per $1,000 Principal Amount (zero return).


	 



	If the Reference Return is less than
	the Barrier Level,

	you will receive a cash payment on the Maturity Date, per $1,000 Principal Amount, calculated as follows:


	 


	$1,000 + ($1,000 ×
	Reference Return).


	 


	Under these circumstances, you will lose
	1% of the Principal Amount of your securities for each percentage point that the Reference Return is below zero. For example, if
	the Reference Return is -44%, you will suffer a 44% loss and receive 56% of the Principal Amount.

	You should be aware that if
	the Reference Return is less than the Barrier Level, you will lose up to 100% of your investment. Any payment on the securities
	is subject to the credit risk of HSBC.



	 



	Interest



	 


	The securities will not pay interest.



	 





	Business
	Day



	 


	A “business day” means any
	day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, that is neither a legal holiday nor a day on which banking institutions are authorized or
	required by law or regulation to close in the City of New York.


	 



	Payment
	When Offices or Settlement Systems Are Closed



	 


	If any payment is due on the securities
	on a day that would otherwise be a “business day” but is a day on which the office of a paying agent or a settlement
	system is closed, we will make the payment on the next business day when that paying agent or system is open. Any such payment
	will be deemed to have been made on the original due date, and no additional payment will be made on account of the delay.


	 



	Calculation
	Agent



	 


	We or one of our affiliates will act as
	calculation agent with respect to the securities.


	 



	Reference Sponsor



	 


	S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, a part of
	McGraw-Hill Financial, is the reference sponsor.

	INVESTOR SUITABILITY

	The securities may not be suitable for you if:







	}

	the level of the Reference Asset will increase over the term of the securities.


	 



	}

	RISK FACTORS



	 


	We urge you to read the section “Risk
	Factors” beginning on page S-3 in the accompanying prospectus supplement and on page S-2 of the accompanying Equity
	Index Underlying Supplement. Investing in the securities is not equivalent to investing directly in any of the stocks comprising
	the Reference Asset. You should understand the risks of investing in the securities and should reach an investment decision only
	after careful consideration, with your advisors, of the suitability of the securities in light of your particular financial circumstances
	and the information set forth in this pricing supplement and the accompanying Equity Index Underlying Supplement, prospectus supplement
	and prospectus.


	 


	In addition to the risks discussed below,
	you should review “Risk Factors” in the accompanying prospectus supplement and Equity Index Underlying Supplement including
	the explanation of risks relating to the securities described in the following sections:


	 







	}



	“—Risks Relating to All Note Issuances” in the prospectus supplement;




	 







	}



	“—General Risks Related to Indices” in the Equity Index Underlying Supplement;




	 


	You will be subject to significant risks
	not associated with conventional fixed-rate or floating-rate debt securities.


	 


	Your investment in the securities
	may result in a loss.


	 


	You will be fully exposed to the decline
	in the level of the Reference Asset if the Reference Return is below the Barrier Level of -43%. Accordingly, if the Reference Return
	is less than -43%, your Payment at Maturity will be less than the Principal Amount of your securities. You will lose up to 100%
	of your investment at maturity if the Reference Return is less than the Barrier Level.


	 


	Credit risk of HSBC USA Inc.


	 


	The securities are senior unsecured debt
	obligations of the Issuer, HSBC, and are not, either directly or indirectly, an obligation of any third party. As further described
	in the accompanying prospectus supplement and prospectus, the securities will rank on par with all of the other unsecured and unsubordinated
	debt obligations of HSBC, except such obligations as may be preferred by operation of law. Any payment to be made on the securities,
	including any return of principal at maturity, depends on the ability of HSBC to satisfy its obligations as they come due. As a
	result, the actual and perceived creditworthiness of HSBC may affect the market value of the securities and, in the event HSBC
	were to default on its obligations, you may not receive the amounts owed to you under the terms of the securities.


	 


	The amount payable on the securities
	is not linked to the level of the Reference Asset at any time other than the Final Valuation Date.


	 


	The Final Level will be based on the Official
	Closing Level of the Reference Asset on the Final Valuation Date, subject to postponement for non-trading days and certain market
	disruption events. Even if the level of the Reference Asset appreciates during the term of the securities other than on the Final
	Valuation Date but then decreases on the Final Valuation Date to a level that is less than the Initial


	 








	PS-

	5










	 






	 


	Level, the Payment at Maturity
	may be less, and may be significantly less, than it would have been had the Payment at Maturity been linked to the level of the
	Reference Asset prior to such decrease. Although the actual level of the Reference Asset on the Maturity Date or at other times
	during the term of the securities may be higher than the Final Level, the Payment at Maturity will be based solely on the Official
	Closing Level of the Reference Asset on the Final Valuation Date.


	 


	The securities will not bear interest.


	 


	As a holder of the securities, you will
	not receive interest payments.


	 


	Changes that affect the Reference
	Asset will affect the market value of the securities and the amount you will receive at maturity.


	 


	The policies of the reference sponsor concerning
	additions, deletions and substitutions of the constituents comprising the Reference Asset and the manner in which the reference
	sponsor takes account of certain changes affecting those constituents may affect the level of the Reference Asset. The policies
	of the reference sponsor with respect to the calculation of the Reference Asset could also affect the level of the Reference Asset.
	The reference sponsor may discontinue or suspend calculation or dissemination of the Reference Asset. Any such actions could affect
	the value of the securities and the return on the securities.


	 


	The securities are not insured or
	guaranteed by any governmental agency of the United States or any other jurisdiction.


	 


	The securities are not deposit liabilities
	or other obligations of a bank and are not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other governmental
	agency or program of the United States or any other jurisdiction. An investment in the securities is subject to the credit risk
	of HSBC, and in the event that HSBC is unable to pay its obligations as they become due, you may not receive the full Payment at
	Maturity of the securities.


	 



	The Estimated Initial Value of the securities, which was
	determined by us on the Pricing Date, is less than the price to public and may differ from the market value of the securities in
	the secondary market, if any.



	 


	The Estimated Initial Value of the securities
	was calculated by us on the Pricing Date and is less than the price to public. The Estimated Initial Value reflects our internal
	funding rate, which is the borrowing rate we use to issue market-linked securities, as well as the mid-market value of the embedded
	derivatives in the securities. This internal funding rate is typically lower than the rate we would use when we issue conventional
	fixed or floating rate debt securities. As a result of the difference between our internal funding rate and the rate we would use
	when we issue conventional fixed or floating rate debt securities, the Estimated Initial Value of the securities may be lower if
	it were based on the levels at which our fixed or floating rate debt securities trade in the secondary market. In addition, if
	we were to use the rate we use for our conventional fixed or floating rate debt issuances, we would expect the economic terms of
	the securities to be more favorable to you. We determined the value of the embedded derivatives in the securities by reference
	to our or our affiliates’ internal pricing models. These pricing models consider certain assumptions and variables, which
	can include volatility and interest rates. Different pricing models and assumptions could provide valuations for the securities
	that are different from our Estimated Initial Value. These pricing models rely in part on certain forecasts about future events,
	which may prove to be incorrect. The Estimated Initial Value does not represent a minimum price at which we or any of our affiliates
	would be willing to purchase your securities in the secondary market (if any exists) at any time.


	 



	The price of your securities in the secondary market, if
	any, immediately after the Pricing Date will be less than the price to public.



	 


	The price to public takes into account
	certain costs. These costs, which will be used or retained by us or one of our affiliates, include the underwriting discount, our
	affiliates’ projected hedging profits (which may or may not be realized) for assuming risks inherent in hedging our obligations
	under the securities and the costs associated with structuring and hedging our obligations under the securities. If you were to
	sell your securities in the secondary market, if any, the price you would receive for your securities may be less than the price
	you paid for them because secondary market prices will not take into account these costs. The price of your securities in the secondary
	market, if any, at any time after issuance will vary based on many factors, including the price of the Reference Asset and changes
	in market conditions, and cannot be predicted with accuracy. The securities are not designed to be short-term trading instruments,
	and you should, therefore, be able and willing to hold the securities to maturity. Any sale of the securities prior to maturity
	could result in a loss to you.


	 



	If we were to repurchase your securities immediately after
	the Original Issue Date, the price you receive may be higher than the Estimated Initial Value of the securities.



	 


	Assuming that all relevant factors
	remain constant after the Original Issue Date, the price at which HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. may initially buy or sell the
	securities in the secondary market, if any, and the value that we may initially use for customer account statements, if we
	provide any customer account statements at all, may exceed the Estimated Initial Value on the Pricing Date for a temporary
	period expected to be approximately 12 months after the Original Issue Date. This temporary price difference may exist
	because, in our discretion, we may elect to effectively reimburse to investors a portion of the estimated cost of hedging our
	obligations under the securities and other costs in connection with the securities that we will no longer expect to incur
	over the term of the securities. We will


	 








	PS-

	6










	 






	 


	make such discretionary
	election and determine this temporary reimbursement period on the basis of a number of factors, including the tenor of the securities
	and any agreement we may have with the distributors of the securities. The amount of our estimated costs which we effectively reimburse
	to investors in this way may not be allocated ratably throughout the reimbursement period, and we may discontinue such reimbursement
	at any time or revise the duration of the reimbursement period after the Original Issue Date of the securities based on changes
	in market conditions and other factors that cannot be predicted.


	 


	The securities lack liquidity.


	 


	The securities will not be listed on any
	securities exchange. HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. is not required to offer to purchase the securities in the secondary market, if
	any exists. Even if there is a secondary market, it may not provide enough liquidity to allow you to trade or sell the securities
	easily. Because other dealers are not likely to make a secondary market for the securities, the price at which you may be able
	to trade your securities is likely to depend on the price, if any, at which HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. is willing to buy the securities.


	 


	Potential conflicts of interest may
	exist.


	 


	HSBC and its affiliates play a variety
	of roles in connection with the issuance of the securities, including acting as calculation agent and hedging our obligations under
	the securities. In performing these duties, the economic interests of the calculation agent and other affiliates of ours are potentially
	adverse to your interests as an investor in the securities. We will not have any obligation to consider your interests as a holder
	of the securities in taking any action that might affect the value of your securities.


	 


	Uncertain tax treatment.


	 


	For a discussion of the U.S. federal income
	tax consequences of your investment in a security, please see the discussion under “U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”
	herein and the discussion under “U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

	ILLUSTRATIVE
	EXAMPLES



	 


	The following table and examples are provided
	for illustrative purposes only and are hypothetical. They do not purport to be representative of every possible scenario concerning
	increases or decreases in the level of the Reference Asset relative to its Initial Level. We cannot predict the actual Final Level.
	The assumptions we have made in connection with the illustrations set forth below may not reflect actual events, and the hypothetical
	Initial Level used in the table and examples below is not expected to be the actual Initial Level. You should not take this illustration
	or these examples as an indication or assurance of the expected performance of the Reference Asset or the return on your securities

	.

	The Final Settlement Value may be less than the amount that you would have received from a conventional debt security with
	the same stated maturity, including such a security issued by HSBC. The numbers appearing in the table below and following examples
	have been rounded for ease of analysis.


	 


	The table below illustrates the Final Settlement
	Value on a $1,000 investment in the securities for a hypothetical range of Reference Returns from -100% to +100%. The following
	results are based solely on the assumptions outlined below. The “Hypothetical Return on the Securities” as used below
	is the number, expressed as a percentage, that results from comparing the Final Settlement Value per $1,000 Principal Amount of
	securities to $1,000. The potential returns described here assume that your securities are held to maturity. You should consider
	carefully whether the securities are suitable to your investment goals. The following table and examples assume the following:

	Principal Amount:


	$1,000

	Barrier Level:

	The following examples indicate how the
	Final Settlement Value would be calculated with respect to a hypothetical $1,000 investment in the securities.


	 



	Example 1: The level of the Reference
	Asset increases from the Initial Level of 1,500 to a Final Level of 2,100.



	 




	 


	 




	Reference Return:


	40%





	Final Settlement Value:




	$1,440





	 


	Because the Reference Return is positive,
	the Final Settlement Value would be $1,440 per $1,000 Principal Amount, calculated as follows:


	 


	$1,000 + ($1,000 × Reference
	Return × Upside Participation Rate)


	 


	= $1,000 + ($1,000 × 40% ×
	110%)


	 


	= $1,440


	 


	Example 1 shows that you will receive the
	return of your principal investment plus a return equal to the Reference Return multiplied by the Upside Participation Rate when
	the Reference Return is positive.


	 



	Example 2: The level of the Reference
	Asset decreases from the Initial Level of 1,500 to a Final Level of 1,425.



	 




	 


	 




	Reference Return:


	-5.00%





	Final Settlement Value:




	$1,000





	 


	Because the Reference Return is less than
	zero but greater than the Barrier Level of -43%, the Final Settlement Value would be $1,000 per $1,000 Principal Amount (a zero
	return).


	 



	Example 3: The level of the Reference
	Asset decreases from the Initial Level of 1,500 to a Final Level of 600.



	 




	 


	 




	Reference Return:


	-60%





	Final Settlement Value:




	$400





	 


	Because the Reference Return is less than
	the Barrier Level of -43%, the Final Settlement Value would be $400 per $1,000 Principal Amount, calculated as follows:


	 


	$1,000 + ($1,000 ×
	Reference Return)


	 


	= $1,000 + ($1,000
	× -60.00%)


	 


	= $400


	 


	Example 3 shows that you are exposed on
	a 1-to-1 basis to declines in the level of the Reference Asset if the Reference Return is below the Barrier Level of -43%. YOU
	MAY LOSE UP TO 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF YOUR SECURITIES.

	THE

	S&P
	500

	®

	Index (“SPX”)




	 







	Description of the SPX


	 


	The SPX is a capitalization-weighted index
	of 500 U.S. stocks. It is designed to measure performance of the broad domestic economy through changes in the aggregate market
	value of 500 stocks representing all major industries.


	 


	The top 5 industry groups by market capitalization
	as of February 14, 2014 were: Information Technology, Financials, Health Care, Consumer Discretionary and Industrials.


	 


	In September 2012, S&P Dow Jones Indices
	LLC updated its index methodology so that, subject to several exceptions, shareholdings by specified types of insiders that represent
	more than 5% of the outstanding shares of a security are removed from the float for purposes of calculating the SPX.


	 




	For more information about
	the SPX, see “S&P 500

	®

	Index” on page S-6 of the accompanying Equity Index Underlying Supplement. 





	 



	Historical Performance of the SPX


	 


	The following graph sets forth the historical
	performance of the SPX based on the daily historical closing levels from January 1, 2008 through February 14, 2014. The closing
	level for the SPX on February 14, 2014 was 1,838.63. We obtained the closing levels below from the Bloomberg Professional

	®

	service. We have not undertaken any independent review of, or made any due diligence inquiry with respect to, the information obtained
	from the Bloomberg Professional

	®

	service.


	 









	 


	The historical levels
	of the SPX should not be taken as an indication of future performance, and no assurance can be given as to the Official Closing
	Level of the SPX on the Final Valuation Date.

	EVENTS OF DEFAULT
	AND ACCELERATION



	 


	If the securities have become immediately
	due and payable following an Event of Default (as defined in the accompanying prospectus) with respect to the securities, the calculation
	agent will determine the accelerated payment due and payable at maturity in the same general manner as described in “Payment
	at Maturity” in this pricing supplement. In that case, the scheduled trading day immediately preceding the date of acceleration
	will be used as the Final Valuation Date for purposes of determining the Reference Return, and the accelerated maturity date will
	be three business days after the accelerated Final Valuation Date. If a Market Disruption Event exists with respect to the Reference
	Asset on that scheduled trading day, then the accelerated Final Valuation Date for the Reference Asset will be postponed for up
	to five scheduled trading days (in the same manner used for postponing the originally scheduled Final Valuation Date). The accelerated
	maturity date will also be postponed by an equal number of business days.


	 


	If the securities have become immediately
	due and payable following an Event of Default, you will not be entitled to any additional payments with respect to the securities.
	For more information, see “Description of Debt Securities—Senior Debt Securities—Events of Default” in
	the accompanying prospectus.



	 





	SUPPLEMENTAL
	PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION (CONFLICTS OF INTEREST)



	 


	We have appointed HSBC Securities (USA)
	Inc., an affiliate of HSBC, as the agent for the sale of the securities. Pursuant to the terms of a distribution agreement, HSBC
	Securities (USA) Inc. will purchase the securities from HSBC at the price to public less the underwriting discount set forth on
	the cover page of this pricing supplement, for distribution to other registered broker-dealers, or will offer the securities directly
	to investors. HSBC Securities (USA) Inc. proposes to offer the securities at the price to public set forth on the cover page of
	this pricing supplement. HSBC USA Inc. or one of our affiliates may pay varying underwriting discounts of up to 2.75% per $1,000
	Principal Amount in connection with the distribution of the securities to other registered broker-dealers.


	 


	In addition, HSBC Securities (USA) Inc.
	or another of its affiliates or agents may use this pricing supplement in market-making transactions after the initial sale of
	the securities, but is under no obligation to make a market in the securities and may discontinue any market-making activities
	at any time without notice.


	 


	See “Supplemental Plan of Distribution
	(Conflicts of Interest)” on page S-49 in the prospectus supplement.


	 


	We expect that delivery of the securities
	will be made against payment for the securities on or about the Original Issue Date set forth on the inside cover page of this
	document, which is more than three business days following the Trade Date. Under Rule 15c6-1 under the Securities Exchange Act
	of 1934, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in three business days, unless the parties to that trade
	expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the securities more than three business days prior to the
	Original Issue Date will be required to specify an alternate settlement cycle at the time of any such trade to prevent a failed
	settlement, and should consult their own advisors.

	U.S. FEDERAL
	INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS



	 


	There is no direct legal authority as to
	the proper tax treatment of the securities, and therefore significant aspects of the tax treatment of the securities are uncertain
	as to both the timing and character of any inclusion in income in respect of the securities. Under one approach, a security should
	be treated as a pre-paid executory contract with respect to the Reference Asset. We intend to treat the securities consistent with
	this approach. Pursuant to the terms of the securities, you agree to treat the securities under this approach for all U.S. federal
	income tax purposes. Subject to the limitations described therein, and based on certain factual representations received from us,
	in the opinion of our special U.S. tax counsel, Morrison & Foerster LLP, it is reasonable to treat a security as a pre-paid
	executory contract with respect to the Reference Asset. Pursuant to this approach, we do not intend to report any income or gain
	with respect to the securities prior to their maturity or an earlier sale or exchange and we intend to treat any gain or loss upon
	maturity or an earlier sale or exchange as long-term capital gain or loss, provided that you have held the security for more than
	one year at such time for U.S. federal income tax purposes.


	 


	We will not attempt to ascertain whether
	any of the entities whose stock is included in, or owned by, the Reference Asset, as the case may be, would be treated as a passive
	foreign investment company (“PFIC”) or United States real property holding corporation (“USRPHC”), both
	as defined for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If one or more of the entities whose stock is included in, or owned by, the Reference
	Asset, as the case may be, were so treated, certain adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences might apply. You should refer
	to information filed with the SEC and other authorities by the entities whose stock is included in, or owned by, the Reference
	Asset, as the case may be, and consult your tax advisor regarding the possible consequences to you if one or more of the entities
	whose stock is included in, or owned by, the Reference Asset, as the case may be, is or becomes a PFIC or a USRPHC.


	 


	Withholding and reporting requirements
	under the legislation enacted on March 18, 2010 (as discussed beginning on page S-48 of the prospectus supplement) will generally
	apply to payments made after June 30, 2014. However, this withholding tax will not be imposed on payments pursuant to obligations
	outstanding on July 1, 2014. Additionally, withholding due to any payment being treated as a “dividend equivalent”
	(as discussed beginning on page S-47 of the prospectus supplement) will begin no earlier than January 1, 2016. Holders are urged
	to consult with their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this recently enacted legislation on their investment
	in the securities.


	 


	For a discussion of the U.S. federal income
	tax consequences of your investment in a security, please see the discussion under “U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations”
	in the accompanying prospectus supplement.

	VALIDITY OF THE SECURITIES



	 


	In the opinion of Morrison & Foerster
	LLP, as counsel to the Issuer, when the securities offered by this pricing supplement have been executed and delivered by the Issuer
	and authenticated by the trustee pursuant to the Senior Indenture referred to in the prospectus supplement dated March 22, 2012,
	and issued and paid for as contemplated herein, such securities will be valid, binding and enforceable obligations of the Issuer,
	entitled to the benefits of the Senior Indenture, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors’
	rights generally, concepts of reasonableness and equitable principles of general applicability (including, without limitation,
	concepts of good faith, fair dealing and the lack of bad faith). This opinion is given as of the date hereof and is limited to
	the laws of the State of New York, the Maryland General Corporation Law (including the statutory provisions, all applicable provisions
	of the Maryland Constitution and the reported judicial decisions interpreting the foregoing) and the federal laws of the United
	States of America. This opinion is subject to customary assumptions about the trustee’s authorization, execution and delivery
	of the Senior Indenture and the genuineness of signatures and to such counsel’s reliance on the Issuer and other sources
	as to certain factual matters, all as stated in the legal opinion dated July 27, 2012, which has been filed as Exhibit 5.1 to the
	Issuer’s Current Report on Form 8-K dated July 27, 2012.

GENERAL
  TERMS



This
  pricing supplement relates to six separate note offerings; each reference
  asset
  identified on the cover page represents a separate note offering. The purchaser
  of a note will acquire a security linked to a single reference asset (not
  to a
  basket or index of reference assets). You
  may
  participate in any one of the notes offerings or, at your election, in more
  than
  one. We reserve the right to withdraw, cancel or modify any offering and
  to
  reject orders in whole or in part. Although each note offering relates only
  to a
  single reference asset identified on the cover page, you should not construe
  that fact as a recommendation of the merits of acquiring an investment linked
  to
  any of those reference assets or as to the suitability of an investment in
  the
  notes. 
 
You
  should read this document together with the prospectus dated April 5, 2006,
  the
  prospectus supplement dated July 3, 2006 and the product supplement dated
  July
31, 2006. You should carefully consider, among other things, the matters
  set
  forth in ”Risk Factors” beginning on page PR-3 of this document, PS-3 of the
  product supplement and page S-3 of the prospectus supplement, as the notes
  involve risks not associated with conventional debt securities. We urge you
  to
  consult your investment, legal, tax, accounting and other advisers before
  you
  invest in the notes.

 

  



RISK
  FACTORS



The
  following highlights some, but not all, of the risk considerations relevant
  to
  investing in a note. Investing in the notes is not equivalent to investing
  directly in the reference assets. We urge you to read the section “Risk Factors”
beginning on page PS-3 of the product supplement and page S-3 of the prospectus
  supplement. As you review ”Risk Factors” in the prospectus supplement, you
  should pay particular attention to the following sections:
 





·

“—
  Risks Relating to All Note
  Issuances”






 



·

"—
  Additional Risks Relating to Notes with an Equity Security or Equity
  Index
  as the Reference Asset"




 



1.

The
  notes are not principal protected and you may lose some or all
  of your
  principal.




 
The
  principal amount of your investment is not protected and you may receive
  less,
  and possibly significantly less, than the amount you invested. You will lose
  some or all of your principal if both of the following are true: (a) between
  the
  initial valuation date and the final valuation date, inclusive, the market
  price
  (as defined below) of the reference asset on any day is below the barrier
  price
  and (b) the final price of the reference asset is lower than the initial
  price
  of the reference asset. A USD1,000 investment in the notes will pay USD1,000
  at
  maturity if, and only if, either of the following is true: (a) between the
  initial valuation date and the final valuation date, inclusive, the market
  price
  of the reference asset falls below the barrier price on any day, but the
  final
  price of the reference asset is equal to or greater than the initial price
  of
  the reference asset or (b) between the initial valuation date and the final
  valuation date, inclusive, the market price of the reference asset never
  falls
  below the barrier price on any day. If you receive the physical delivery
  amount
  at maturity, the market value of the shares of the reference asset you receive
  will be less than the principal amount of your notes and may be zero.
  Accordingly, you may lose the entire principal amount of your
  notes.
 
We
  cannot
  predict the final price of any reference asset on the final valuation
  date.
 



2.

You
  will not participate in any appreciation in the value of the reference
  asset.




 
You
  will
  not participate in any appreciation in the value of the reference asset.
  If the
  final price of the reference asset is greater than the initial price of the
  reference asset, the sum of any interest payments you receive during the
  term of
  the notes and the principal payment you receive at maturity will not reflect
  the
  performance of the reference asset. Under no circumstances, regardless of
  the
  extent to which the value of the reference asset appreciates, will your return
  exceed the applicable interest rate. Therefore, you may earn significantly
  less
  by investing in the notes than you would have earned by investing directly
  in
  the reference asset.
 



3.

Because
  the tax treatment of the notes is uncertain, the material U.S.
  federal
  income tax consequences of an investment in the notes are
  uncertain.




 
There
  is
  no direct legal authority as to the proper tax treatment of the notes, and
  therefore significant aspects of the tax treatment of the notes are uncertain,
  as to both the timing and character of any inclusion in income in respect
  of
  your note. Because of this uncertainty, we urge you to consult your tax advisor
  as to the tax consequences of your investment in a note. For a more complete
  discussion of the U.S. federal income tax consequences of your investment
  in a
  note, please see the discussion under ”Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax
  Considerations” beginning on page PR-4 of this pricing supplement and ”Certain
  U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations - Certain Equity-Linked Notes - Certain
  Notes Treated as a Put Option and a Deposit” in the prospectus
  supplement.
 
Please
  note that the prospectus, prospectus supplement, product supplement and this
  pricing supplement do not describe all the risks of an investment in the
  notes.
  We urge you to consult your own financial and legal advisors as to the risks
  entailed by an investment in the notes.

 

  



SUMMARY



Principal
  Payment at Maturity
 
Your
  payment at maturity for each note you hold will depend on the performance
  of the
  reference asset between the initial valuation date and the final valuation
  date,
  inclusive. A USD1,000 investment in the notes will pay USD1,000 at maturity
  unless: (a) the final price of the reference asset is lower than the initial
  price of the reference asset and (b) between the initial valuation date and
  the
  final valuation date, inclusive, the market price of the reference asset
  on any
  day is below the barrier price. If the conditions described in (a) and (b)
  are
  both true, at maturity you will receive the physical delivery amount (with
  any
  fractional shares to be paid in cash in an amount equal to the fractional
  shares
  multiplied by the final price). Under some circumstances to be determined
  by and
  at the sole option of HSBC USA Inc., we may pay investors, in lieu of the
  physical delivery amount, the cash equivalent of such shares with a per share
  price equal to the final price. However, we currently expect to deliver the
  physical delivery amount and not cash in lieu of the physical delivery amount
  in
  the event the conditions described above occur.

 






PR-3










As
  described in the product supplement, on any scheduled trading day on which
  the
  value of the reference asset must be calculated by the calculation agent,
  (i) if
  the relevant exchange is the NASDAQ Stock Market (“NASDAQ”), the market price of
  the reference asset will be the NASDAQ official closing price (NOCP) or (ii)
  if
  the NASDAQ is not the relevant exchange, the market price of the reference
  asset
  will be the official closing price of the relevant exchange, in each case
  as of
  the close of the regular trading session of such exchange and as reported
  in the
  official price determination mechanism for such exchange. If the reference
  asset
  is not listed or traded as described above for any reason other than a market
  disruption event, then the market price for the reference asset on any scheduled
  trading day will be the average, as determined by the calculation agent,
  of the
  bid prices for the reference asset obtained from as many dealers in the
  reference asset selected by the calculation agent as will make those bid
  prices
  available to the calculation agent. The number of dealers need not exceed
  three
  and may include the calculation agent or any of its or our
  affiliates.
 
To
  the
  extent a market disruption event exists on a day on which the final price
  is to
  be determined, the market price of the reference asset will be determined
  on the
  first following scheduled trading day on which a market disruption event
  does
  not exist with respect to the reference asset; provided that if a market
  disruption event exists on five consecutive scheduled trading days, that
  fifth
  scheduled trading day shall be the final valuation date, and the calculation
  agent shall determine the final price on such date.
 
In
  the
  event that the maturity date is postponed or extended as described under
  ”Specific Terms of the Notes - Maturity Date” in the product supplement, the
  related payment of principal will be made on the postponed or extended maturity
  date.
 
You
  may lose some or all of your principal if you invest in the
  notes.
 
Physical
  Delivery Amount
 
If
  the
  payment at maturity is in physical shares of the reference asset, you will
  receive a number of shares referred to as the ”physical delivery amount” (with
  any fractional shares to be paid in cash). The physical delivery amount will
  be
  calculated by the calculation agent by dividing the principal amount of your
  notes by the initial price of the reference asset. The physical delivery
  amount,
  the initial price of the reference asset and other amounts may change due
  to
  corporate actions.
 
Interest
 
The
  notes
  will pay interest at the interest rate specified on the front cover of this
  pricing supplement, and interest payments will be made on the interest payment
  dates specified on the front cover of this pricing supplement. However, if
  the
  first interest payment date is less than 15 days after the date of issuance,
  interest will not be paid on the first interest payment date, but will be
  paid
  on the second interest payment date. Interest will be computed on the basis
  of a
  360-day year of twelve 30-day months. For more information, see ”Description of
  the Notes - Fixed Rate Notes” in the prospectus supplement.

 



CERTAIN
  U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSIDERATIONS



You
  should carefully consider, among other things, the matters set forth in “Certain
  U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations” in the prospectus supplement. In the
  opinion of Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft LLP, special U.S. tax counsel to
  us, the following discussion summarizes certain of the material U.S. federal
  income tax consequences of the purchase, beneficial ownership, and disposition
  of each of the notes.
 
There
  are
  no regulations, published rulings or judicial decisions addressing the
  characterization for U.S. federal income tax purposes of securities with
  terms
  that are substantially the same as those of the notes. Under one approach,
  each
  note should be treated for federal income tax purposes as a put option written
  by you (the “Put Option”) that permits us to (1) sell the reference asset to you
  at the maturity date for an amount equal to the Deposit (as defined below),
  or
  (2) “cash settle” the Put Option (i.e., require you to pay us at the maturity
  date the difference between the Deposit and the value of the reference asset
  at
  such time), and a deposit with us of cash in an amount equal to the principal
  amount you invested (the “Deposit”) to secure your potential obligation under
  the Put Option. We intend to treat the notes consistent with this approach.
  Pursuant to the terms of the notes, you agree to treat the notes as cash
  deposits and put options with respect to the reference asset for all U.S.
  federal income tax purposes. We also intend to treat the Deposits as “short-term
  obligations” for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Please see the discussion
  under the heading “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations — U.S. Federal
  Income Tax Treatment of the Notes as Indebtedness for U.S. Federal Income
  Tax
  Purposes-Short-Term Debt Instruments” in the prospectus supplement for certain
  U.S. federal income tax considerations applicable to short-term obligations.
  However, because under certain circumstances Notes with an initial maturity
  of
  one year may be outstanding for more than one year, it is possible that the
  Deposits associated with these Notes may not be treated as short-term
  obligations. In that event, Notes with an initial maturity of one year would
  be
  described in “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations - U.S. Federal
  Income Tax Treatment of the Notes as Indebtedness for U.S. Federal Income
  Tax
  Purposes - Payments of Interest” in the prospectus supplement.
 
The
  description below of each reference asset includes a chart that indicates
  the
  yield on the Deposit and the Put Premium, as described in the prospectus
  supplement under the heading “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations —
Certain Equity-Linked Notes— Certain Notes Treated as a Put Option and a
  Deposit.” If the Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) were successful in
  asserting an alternative characterization for the notes, the timing and
  character of income on the notes might differ. We do not plan to request
  a
  ruling from the IRS regarding the tax treatment of the notes, and the IRS
  or a
  court may not agree with the tax treatment described in this pricing
  supplement.

REFERENCE
  ISSUER AND REFERENCE ASSET INFORMATION



All
  information on the reference assets and the reference issuers is derived
  from
  publicly available information. Companies with securities registered under
  the
  Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the ”Exchange Act”) are required to file
  periodically certain financial and other information specified by the SEC.
  Information provided to or filed with the SEC electronically can be accessed
  through a website maintained by the SEC. The address of the SEC’s website is
  http://www.sec.gov. Information provided to or filed with the SEC pursuant
  to
  the Exchange Act by a company issuing a reference asset can be located by
  reference to the SEC file number specified in the description of the relevant
  reference asset below. We make no representation that these publicly available
  documents are accurate or complete. For more information, we urge you to
  read
  the section ”Information Regarding the Reference Asset and the Reference Asset
  Issuer” in the product supplement.
 
Historical
  Performance of the Reference Assets
 
The
  description below of each reference asset includes a table that sets forth
  (to
  the extent available) the quarterly high and low intraday prices, as well
  as
  end-of-quarter closing prices, of that reference asset for each quarter in
  the
  period from January 1, 2002 through March 30, 2007 and for the period from
  April
2, 2007 through June 22, 2007. We obtained the data in these tables from
  Bloomberg Financial Service, without independent verification by us. All
  historical prices are denominated in USD and rounded to the nearest penny.
  Historical
  prices of the reference assets should not be taken as an indication of future
  performance of the reference assets.
 




HYPOTHETICAL
  EXAMPLES




 
The
  description below of each reference asset includes a table of hypothetical
  returns that is based on the assumptions outlined for each reference
  asset. Each table illustrates the hypothetical returns you would
  have
  earned from (i) a USD1,000 investment in the notes compared to
  (ii) a
  direct investment in the relevant reference asset (prior to the
  deduction
  of any applicable brokerage fees or charges). The following is
  a general
  description of how the hypothetical returns in each table were
  determined:
 
·    
  If
  the final price of the reference asset is greater than or equal
  to the
  initial price of the reference asset, you would receive USD1,000
  at
  maturity, regardless of whether the market price of the reference
  asset on
  any day was below the barrier price;
·    
  If
  the final price of the reference asset is lower than the initial
  price of
  the reference asset but the market price of the reference asset
  was not
  below the barrier price on any day between the initial valuation
  date and
  the final valuation date, inclusive, you would receive USD1,000
  at
  maturity; or
·    
  If
  the final price of the reference asset is lower than the initial
  price of
  the reference asset and the market price of the reference asset
  was below
  the barrier price on any day between the initial valuation date
  and the
  final valuation date, inclusive, you would receive the physical
  delivery
  amount (with any fractional shares to be paid in cash).
 
Each
  table of hypothetical returns is provided for illustration purposes
  only
  and is hypothetical. None purports to be representative of every
  possible
  scenario concerning increases or decreases in the price of the
  reference
  asset and the payment at maturity of the notes. We cannot predict
  the
  final price of the reference assets on the final valuation date.
  The
  assumptions we have made in connection with the illustrations set
  forth
  below may not reflect actual events. In addition, the examples
  assume that
  the reference asset has no dividend yield. You should not take
  these
  examples as an indication or assurance of the expected performance
  of the
  reference asset.
