Ridgemont Equity Partners Acquires HemaSource




Distributor of Consumable Medical Products Poised for Continued Growth






July 20, 2017 11:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



CHARLOTTE, N.C.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Ridgemont Equity Partners, a middle market private equity investor, 
      today announced the acquisition of HemaSource Intermediate Holdings, LLC 
      (“HemaSource,” or the “Company”), the leading technology-enabled 
      distributor of medical products to the plasma collection industry. 
      Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed.
    


      HemaSource, headquartered in West Jordan, Utah, distributes consumable 
      products across 1,300 SKUs from two strategically located distribution 
      centers. The Company utilizes a proprietary cloud-based inventory 
      management and business intelligence software solution to help its 
      customers gain supply chain efficiencies and decrease their plasma 
      collection costs. Plasma-derived therapeutics like IVIG, Albumin and 
      Factor VIII treat immunodeficiency diseases, neurological disorders and 
      hematology conditions.
    

      “HemaSource is an ideal investment for Ridgemont as we are active 
      investors in both value-added distribution and pharma services,” said 
      Scott Poole, Partner at Ridgemont. “The Company is well positioned given 
      the strong demand drivers for plasma-derived therapeutics, which fuels 
      the need for consumables during the plasma donation process. We’re 
      excited to partner with the HemaSource management team and continue to 
      grow the Company together.”
    

      “We believe that Ridgemont is the best partner for the HemaSource team 
      as we enter the next chapter of our business,” said Tom Jordan, CEO of 
      HemaSource. “Ridgemont distinguished themselves with their knowledge of 
      our business and the plasma end-markets. There are many exciting 
      initiatives to pursue ahead of us and we look forward to working with 
      Ridgemont to accomplish our goals.”
    

      Financing for the transaction was provided by NXT Capital, Barings, TIAA 
      Private Investments, an affiliate of Nuveen and Triangle Capital 
      Corporation (NYSE: TCAP). K&L Gates LLP provided legal services to 
      Ridgemont and William Blair & Company served as financial advisor to 
      Ridgemont.
