My sincere sympathy to you and your dear love ones. May you find comfort in these words found at 1Cor. 1:3 Praised be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of tender mercies and the God of all comfort, 4 who comforts us in all our trials so that we may be able to comfort others in any sort of trial with the comfort that we receive from God. The comfort that we can get from God regarding our decease is that at John 5:28-29 talks about a resurrection hope on earth. So the resurrection tells us about Jehovah's love and undeserved kindness. If you want to learn more, please go to JW.org.

Verified Patient Rating: 4.8 (21 patient reviews and ratings)


The following are reviews from patients of Dr. Edwards.

 


   

 


  
 "He listens to you and works with you to fix your problem. He reaches out to you and asks you for your opinion. He worked on my shoulder seven years ago. And it has not felt this good in years. I was working in North Dakota when I got crushed in trench. I was seeing a doctor up there. When I found out I needed surgery. I said I was going home to have it done. And I wanted Dr. Edwards. To do it because I trust him after the care he gave me with my shoulder. I recommend him to everyone I know." – Mark T.

 "I had two bad bad knees when I had came for my first visit with Dr. Edwards, he said I would need to have replacement surgery. So we get all scheduled and then the big day comes. I'm first on the the books in June 2016. Having watched on you tube the surgery hundreds of times here we go. Surgery went as planned  I can't say I remember recovery at all ( I wake slow) but I am seven weeks now with no pain NO PAIN !!!!! Now we will be planning the other knee and I hope and pray it will be a rerun of my first knee Thank you, Dr. Edwards for taking away 16 yrs of pain." – Pamela H.

 "I had left total knee replacement surgery on March 17, 2015. TO say I have my life back is an understatement!   

I had been putting up with knee pain for about 7 years. I didn't realize how much I was restricted in my normal activities until after I had surgery and was able to move again! I went from sitting on the couch all the time due to pain, to hiking, walking,doing yard work! Last weekend I took my dog hiking in Giant City State Park and had a glorious time! We climbed up rocks and down into stream beds.... I am 57 but I feel 40 again!

Thank you, Dr. Edwards for giving me my life back!" – Donna W.

 "I am 57 years old, but until I had my total knee replacement, I felt like I was 100! It was too painful for me to walk more than half a block, and I limped badly, which in turn, made my back hurt. So for the last 6 years, I pretty much sat on my couch or slept. All that changed on March 17, 2015. I was admitted to St. Francis Hospital in Cape Girardeau and received a total knee replacement. It was the HARDEST thing I have EVER done! But SOOOOO worth it! I am back to being ACTIVE! I walk my dogs a mile or more several times a week, I have lost weight since I am more active, and I don't scream out from sudden unexpected pain anymore! I can't wait to go shopping and antiquing this summer!Every day, and I mean EVERYDAY, I am thankful that Dr. Edwards was able to give me back my life! I would recommend him and his team to anyone who was contemplating knee replacement surgery!" - Donna W.

 "He was quick to review the x-rays from the hospital and identify how bad the break of her elbow was. He couldn't set it, it needed surgery. Immediately had a Cat Scan done and then scheduled her for surgery. He did an excellent job with her. She was a real trooper. He followed up with her until he felt she was ready for therapy. It only took one week of therapy and she was released. She has been doing great since. She has Downs so a lot bothers her, but when I explained to her that the surgery was going to fix her arm so she could ride her bike again, she was okay and never appeared nervous. She did great. She tells everyone that Dr. Edwards did a great job fixing her elbow." – Judy W.

 "Dr. Edwards and Kate are awesome! I was able to get an appointment quickly and, while the office is usually pretty busy, I never had to wait an unreasonable amount of time before it was my turn. I felt that Dr. Edwards listened to me and gave me choices for my plan of care. This is very important to patients that are in the health care field also; we are typically horrible patients that want to dictate our own care! I appreciate his apparent ease collaborating WITH me for what the best plan should be FOR me.  Thank you!" – Laura W.

 "I'd been having right knee problems for almost a year. I'd previously seen two other orthopedic doctors with no avail. I saw Dr. James Edwards and he told me he thought I had a torn meniscus. He ordered my MRI from my previous doctor to review. I'm scheduled to have surgery on the 10th of March. I'm so glad that Dr. James Edwards took the time to listen to me and got to the source of my pain." – Sharon D.

 "Dr. Edwards did an awesome job on my ACL in December of 2014. Dr. Edwards was in contact with me from my injury date all the way till my 12 month check up. He tried to make the process as easy as possible for me. The scarring is minimal and I have full movement back." – David S.

 "My knees were causing me really bad pain. I talked to my primary care physician and he sent me to Dr. James M. Edwards. He told me I have osteoarthritis in my knees. He gave me a cortisone shot in my left, and a Synvisc in my right. It made a world of difference for my knees and me. Dr. Edwards is the "best." He's caring and treats me as a person, not just money. I wouldn't have anyone else give me my injections." -- Brenda T.

 "Dr. James Edwards performed a left knee arthroscopy with partial medial and lateral menisectomy and chondroplasty. Before this surgery, I was experiencing marked pain with inability to ambulate. I am now totally pain free, and am able to walk without any problems. I was able to return to work the first week of August without any restrictions on my work. As I discussed with Dr. Edwards prior to surgery, my goal was to be free of pain and be able to walk again without any problems. My goal was accomplished thanks to Dr. Edwards and the entire hospital staff who rendered my care." -- Carol S.

 "I think that Dr. Edwards is a very caring and sweet doctor who cares about his patients. I have been seeing him for a few years, and would not trust anyone else. His staff is very nice and caring as well. I have referred a few people to go and see him with their problems. Thanks to you, Dr. Edwards and your staff." -- Debra Y.

 "Having not had a prior surgery, I had a lot of anxiety prior to my surgery. The staff and doctors answered all of my questions, which put me at ease. I am so thankful that I chose Advance Orthopedic Specialists to do my surgery. I'm healing right on schedule and look forward to returning to work ahead of schedule!" -- Bobby H.

 "In April, I had shoulder surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff.  My surgery was done at Physician Alliance Center. The staff there was super nice and helpful.  My visits to your office have been exceptional.  Everyone has been very helpful and takes time with you. My shoulder is better than new. If I would ever need your services again, I would not hesitate to request Dr Edwards." --Lewis T.

 "First surgery was total left hip replacement by Dr. Trueblood.  Received excellent care. Second, and most recent ( three months ago), surgery was left tibia IM nail. Dr. Edwards informed me of all that would happen and has given me excellent care also." --Dennis I. 
 Patient Rating:   
   

  
 "I had extensive shoulder surgery in February of 2012 due to labrum tear and other tears around shoulder. Now I have full range of motion and strength back in my shoulder with very little discomfort. My doctors and the staff at Advanced Orthopedic Specialists were very supportive and explained everything that would happen after surgery very well. I will return to Dr. Bowen and Dr. Edwards if I ever have orthopedic problems again. Thank you." -- Doug F.

GET DETAILSClickFIND A STOREDefining Moment At Wirtzfeld: The Story Of The Military Police Platoon, 2nd Infantry Division, In World War Iiby Edwards, James D.This book is intended to honor all veterans for their sacrifices on the battlefields of the European and Pacific theaters during World War II. It further honors military police everywhere who have served America in the honorable tradition of military service, exemplifying high levels of esprit de corps. It brings recognition to one of the oldest units in America's military history. More specifically, this book recognizes and pays tribute to a small group of men: the MP Platoon of the 2nd Infantry Division who fought in Europe in World War II. From  D-Day Plus 1  (the day after the initial wave of troops came ashore) at Omaha Beach, through the defeat of Hitler and Nazi Germany, to their final destination of Pilsen, Czechoslovakia, on May 7, 1945, and the conclusion of the war, this small group of men performed above and beyond their call of duty, earning the Meritorious Unit Service plaque for their contributions to the war effort. This MP unit had a large role in supporting and participating in combat operations and in the eventual defeat of a determined enemy.World War IICondition: Used - GoodHPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.

Edwards, James Ray
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Virginia:













Does Edwards, James Ray carry a valid contracting license?



In Virginia all remodeling and construction work with a cost of $1000 and up, requires a licensed contractor. There are three classes of license for contractors, from A to C. These are based on the size and scope of projects. 
Edwards, James Ray currently holds license 0412000182 (Interior Designer Certification), which was Active when we last checked. 











How important is contractor licensing in Virginia?



All applicants for A and B contractor licenses are required to complete a pre-license education course that has been approved by the Virginia Department of Professional and Occupational Regulation's Board for Contractors. Additionally contractors must prove at least 2 years of work experience in their specific trade. 











Your liability risk when hiring Edwards, James Ray



Licensed contractors in the state of Virginia are not required to carry general liabilty or workers' compensation insurance. It is always a good idea to only hire contractors that have current general liabilty and workers' compensation policies. Request copies of the insurance certifcates for each.











Financial recourse when hiring Edwards, James Ray



Virginia does offer support to homeowners for construction projects gone wrong. The Virginia Contractor Transaction Recovery Act provides relief to eligible consumers who have incurred losses through the improper or dishonest conduct of a licensed residential contractor. The Recovery Fund is supported entirely by assessments paid by licensed contractors, not by any tax revenues. Filing a claim does not guarantee payment.











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Virginia,be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids.Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal,and help guide you through the estimate process.Be wary of an abnormally low bid,they are not worth the risk.These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner,choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with.BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free).Just click here to get started.
