ITG Launches Fixed Income TCA
Jul 17 17
ITG announced the expansion of its transaction cost analysis (TCA) platform to the fixed income market. ITG’s new fixed income TCA provides institutional investors with execution insight to improve fund performance, meet best execution requirements and comply with a range of upcoming regulations including MiFID II and PRIIPs. ITG’s fixed income TCA is built on a robust market data set of more than 10 million daily quotes and trades, including ECN executions, inter-dealer quotes and FINRA’s TRACE trade information. As an independent fixed income TCA provider, ITG aggregates market data and transactions from multiple, often competitive sources, resulting in a deep data pool. ITG’s fixed income TCA currently covers major global corporate and sovereign bond markets, with bond futures and other debt asset classes to be added in coming quarters. The new fixed income TCA product is now available for post-trade analysis and reporting, with pre-trade capabilities in development.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

History[edit]
ITG was founded in 1987 as a division of Jefferies to provide automated equity trading to institutional investors.[5] That year, the company introduced POSIT, an anonymous electronic trade matching system, in conjunction with Barra.[6] POSIT remains among the most widely used matching systems.
In 1990, ITG launched QuantEX, a high-end trading system for institutional traders integrating analytics, routing, and trade management. ITG began to provide clients with pre- and post-trade tools and analytics in 1992.
ITG became a publicly traded company in 1994, listed on NASDAQ. The ITG Australia office opened in 1997, giving regional investors POSIT equity crossing. The firm expanded into Europe in 1998. In 1999, ITG completed its spin-off from Jefferies, giving it full independence.[7]
In 2000, the company’s Canada office opened. In 2002, ITG moved into the hedge fund market by acquiring Hoenig, a provider of trade execution and research services to alternative investment funds.[8] The firm then opened an office in Hong Kong.
ITG completed its purchase of Radical Corporation, a provider of direct access trading to the institutional brokerage and hedge fund community, in 2004.[9] The firm then opened a Japan office in 2005. The company moved to increase its transaction cost analysis offering when it acquired Plexus Group from JPMorgan Chase in 2006.[10] That same year, ITG acquired Macgregor, a provider of trade order management systems, for $230 million.[11] In 2007, it acquired RedSky Financial, a developer of futures and options trading technology.
In 2007 the company came under pressure from activist hedge fund D. E. Shaw to either sell off some of its assets or initiate a share buyback.[12] Shaw has since reduced its stake, citing satisfaction with ITG's RedSky purchase and an announced $50 million stock repurchase program.[13]
Offerings[edit]
ITG's offerings span the following capabilities:

Portfolio Management – tools to assist portfolio managers in optimizing investment performance as well as maintaining compliance with global regulatory, client and firm mandates.
Pre-Trade – tools to manage trading risk, increase efficiency, and improve performance.
Trade – electronic trading services which include broker-neutral, multi-asset execution management systems (EMS) and order management systems (OMS), algorithms and routers, POSIT crossing, FIX connectivity, and traditional desk services for the trading of single stocks, lists and programs, international securities, and specialized hedge fund services.
Post-Trade – post-trade processing tools for trade matching, settlement notification and clearing and analysis tools for trading cost evaluation.
Trading Research - Transaction cost analysis and consulting.
Investment Research - Fundamental, data-driven equity research.
Market Research - Healthcare and telecommunications primary research.
POSIT Alert – tool that alerts traders to block crossing opportunities and delivers them directly to desktops from order flow in POSIT and ITG Algorithms.

                Overview








Technology-Enabled Trading Solutions

ITG is a global financial technology company that helps leading brokers and asset managers improve returns for investors around the world. We empower traders to reduce the end-to-end cost of implementing investments via technology-enabled liquidity, execution, analytics and workflow solutions.
ITG has just under 1,000 employees in 14 offices in nine countries in Asia Pacific, Europe and North America. It offers execution services in more than 50 countries.
Innovation
ITG has been a pioneer in technology-enabled trading solutions since 1987, when we launched the first point-in-time anonymous block crossing network, POSIT. Now delivering approximately $57bn in block crossing opportunities in 37 countries to buy-side desktops daily, POSIT and POSIT Alert have saved investors more than $1 billion in trading costs through midpoint executions over the past ten years alone.
Other ITG innovations that remain category leaders today include the first system for managing large portfolio trading lists, transaction cost analysis for asset managers, and client self-directed trading algorithms. Today, a wide range of leading asset managers, from top-performing hedge funds to the world’s largest institutional investors—manage their trades with our Triton execution management system. ITG is also the industry leader in transaction cost analysis, with more than 75% of the world’s largest asset managers using our offering to help them benchmark their performance against peers and achieve best execution.. Our models-based trading algorithms execute trades in 39 countries via 30+ execution management systems; our dark aggregator algorithm, for example, handles order sizes 40x larger, on average, than other dark aggregators.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

  To BIVA or to BMV: That Is the Question
BIVA, ready to step in as Mexico's newest exchange, is betting that its technology will convert investors. 
Access to Mexico’s equity markets via the national exchange Bolsa de Valores (BMV) experienced several significant and disruptive infrastructure issues over the course of 2016. Highlighting the need for venue competition, local regulators are backing the creation of the Bolsa Institutional de Valores (BIVA)—an alternative venue serving domestic and international investors. BIVA is currently awaiting approval from the Ministry of Finance, expected this month, and anticipates a 3Q17 launch date. If successful, BIVA will be the first competitive exchange for LatAm markets.
