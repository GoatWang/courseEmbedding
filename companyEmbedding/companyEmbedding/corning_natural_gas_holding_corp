Consensus Ratings for Corning Natural Gas Holding Corp. (OTCMKTS:CNIG) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy).

Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

	Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting Compliance

	.

	 

	Section
	16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requires our directors and executive officers, and persons who own more
	than 10% of our common stock, to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) initial reports of ownership
	and reports of changes in ownership of our common stock. Our officers, directors and greater than 10% shareholders are required
	by the SEC to furnish us with copies of all Section 16(a) forms they file. Based solely on review of copies of reports furnished
	to us or written representations that no reports were required, we believe that all Section 16(a) filing requirements were met
	in the last fiscal year.


	 



	Code of Business Conduct and Ethics

	.  The Holding
	Company has adopted the Company’s Code of Business Conduct and Ethics that applies to all employees, including our chief
	executive officer and our chief financial officer, who also serves as our principal accounting officer.  This code is
	available on our website at

	www.corninggas.com

	.  Any amendments or waivers to the code that apply to our chief
	executive officer or chief financial officer will be promptly disclosed to our shareholders by posting that information on our
	website.


	 



	Audit Committee Report

	.

	 

	The Holding
	Company has a separately designated standing audit committee. In accordance with its written charter that was approved and
	adopted by our board, our audit committee assists the board in fulfilling its responsibility of overseeing the quality and
	integrity of our accounting, auditing and financial reporting practices.  A copy of the audit committee charter is
	available on our website at

	www.corninggas.com

	.  The audit committee is directly responsible for the
	appointment of our independent public accounting firm and is charged with reviewing and approving all services performed for
	us by the independent accounting firm and for reviewing the accounting firm’s fees.  The audit committee
	reviews the independent accounting firm’s internal quality control procedures, reviews all relationships between the
	independent accounting firm and the Holding Company and its subsidiaries in order to assess the accounting firm’s
	independence, and monitors compliance with our policy regarding non-audit services, if any, rendered by the independent
	accounting firm.  In addition, the audit committee ensures the regular rotation of the lead audit partner and
	concurring partner.  The audit committee reviews management’s programs to monitor compliance with our
	policies on business ethics and risk management.


	 


	The audit committee is currently comprised of Mr. Williamson, the
	committee’s chairman, Mr. Cook and Mr. William Mirabito.  Mr. Mirabito is an officer, director and shareholder of a
	company that has entered into a joint venture with Corning. The committee met four times in the last fiscal year.  Mr.
	Williamson, Mr. Cook and Mr. Mirabito are “independent directors” as defined in the New York Stock Exchange listing
	standards.  In addition, each member of the audit committee is able to read and understand financial statements, including
	balance sheets, income statements and cash flow statements. The board has determined that Mr. Williamson meets the qualifications
	for designation as a financial expert as defined in SEC rules through his experience as the chief executive officer of RGC Resources,
	Inc., a publicly-held company.  The audit committee reviews and reassesses its charter as needed from time to time and will
	obtain the approval of the board for any proposed changes to its charter.


	 


	The audit committee oversees management’s implementation of
	internal controls and procedures for financial reporting designed to ensure the integrity and accuracy of our financial statements
	and to ensure that we are able to timely record, process and report the information required for public disclosure.  In
	fulfilling its oversight responsibilities, the audit committee reviewed and discussed the financial statements with management
	and Freed Maxick CPA’s, P.C. (“Freed Maxick”), our independent accounting firm. The audit committee reviewed
	and discussed the audited financial statements of the Company for the years ended September 30, 2016 and September 30, 2015, with
	Freed Maxick. The audit committee also discussed with Freed Maxick, the matters required by AU Section 380, “Communication
	with Audit Committees” (Statement on Auditing Standards No. 61, as amended). The audit committee reviewed with
	Freed Maxick, which is responsible for expressing an opinion on the conformity of our audited financial statements with accounting
	principles generally accepted in the United States, its judgment as to the quality, not just the acceptability, of our accounting
	principles and other matters as are required to be discussed with the audit committee pursuant to generally accepted auditing standards.


	 


	In discharging its oversight responsibility as to the audit
	process, the audit committee obtained from our independent accounting firm a formal written statement describing all
	relationships between the independent accounting firm and us that might bear on the accounting firm’s independence
	consistent with the requirements of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board and discussed with the accounting firm any
	relationships that may impact its objectivity and independence.  In considering the accounting firm’s
	independence, the audit committee also considered whether the non-audit services performed by the accounting firms on our
	behalf were compatible with maintaining the independence of the accounting firm.


	 


	In reliance upon (1) the audit committee’s reviews and discussions
	with management and Freed Maxick, (2) management’s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial
	reporting, and (3) the receipt of an opinion from Freed Maxick dated December 29, 2016, stating that the Holding Company’s
	financial statements for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 are presented fairly, in all material respects, in conformity
	with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, the audit committee recommended to our board that these audited financial statements
	be included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, for filing with the SEC.

	Employment Agreements

	.


	 


	Pursuant to his employment agreement dated November 30, 2006, Mr.
	German continues to serve as president and chief executive officer of Corning Gas for 2017 under the automatic renewal provisions
	of his contract. The employment agreement provides for termination payments to Mr. German as follows:


	 



	If Mr. German terminates his employment for Good Reason (as defined in the employment agreement
	– generally a decrease in title, position or responsibilities, a decrease in salary or bonus or a reduction in benefits),
	then he will receive compensation and benefits until the effective date of his termination, plus a severance package equal to his
	then current annual salary.


	If Mr. German’s employment is terminated without cause, then he will receive compensation
	and benefits until the effective date of his termination, plus a severance package equal to his then current annual salary.


	If Mr. German’s employment is terminated for a Change in Control (as defined in the
	employment agreement), then he will receive compensation and benefits until the effective date of his termination, plus a severance
	package equal to three times his then current annual salary.  



	The employment agreement also contains standard confidentiality,
	non-competition and non-solicitation provisions for a period including Mr. German’s employment and the twelve months
	immediately following the date of the termination of his employment.


	 


	On April 17, 2012, Corning Gas entered into Change of Control Agreements
	(the “Agreements”) with all executive officers other than Mr. German. None of our other executive officers have employment
	agreements.


	 



	Change of Control Agreements.



	 


	On April 17, 2012, we entered into Change of Control Agreements
	with each of our named executive officers other than Mr. German: Ms. Sarhangi, Mr. Sleve, Mr. Cook, and Mr. Miller. Each agreement
	was effective as of April 20, 2012, and terminates on the first to occur of: (i) termination of the executive’s employment
	with the Company prior to a Change of Control (as defined in the agreements); (ii) one year from the date of a Change of Control;
	or (iii) May 1, 2017, but only if no Change of Control has occurred as of such date.


	 


	Under each agreement, upon termination of the
	executive’s employment with the Company within 12 months following a Change of Control, unless such termination is
	because of the executive’s death, or by the Company for Cause or Disability (each as defined in the agreements) or by
	the executive other than for Good Reason (as defined in the agreements), we will be required to pay to the executive the
	following: (i) the executive’s full salary through the date of termination and all other unpaid amounts to which the
	executive is entitled as of the date of termination under any plan or other arrangement of the Company, at the time such
	payments are due (and in any event within 90 days after the executive’s separation of service from the Company); and
	(ii) an amount equal to 1.0 multiplied by the executive’s annualized includable compensation for the base period
	(within the meaning of Section 280G of the Internal Revenue Code), subject to reduction if such payment is or will be subject
	to the excise tax imposed by Section 4999 of the Internal Revenue Code, which payment must be made in a lump sum within 90
	days after the executive’s separation from service.


	 


	The executives are not required to mitigate the amount of any payment
	under the Change of Control Agreements by seeking employment or otherwise. We also agreed to pay to each of the executives all
	legal fees and related expenses incurred by the executive in connection with enforcing the agreement, whether or not the executive
	prevails.

	Executive Employee Incentive Program.



	 


	Each year, the Board of Directors approves the performance goals
	and terms of an Executive Employee Incentive Program. The program is designed to (a) attract and retain high caliber executives
	who are capable of optimizing the Holding Company’s and the Company’s performance, and (b) reward our executive officers
	for the achievement of annual corporate and operational goals. Performance bonuses, if earned, are paid in cash during the first
	calendar quarter of the calendar year following the calendar year for which performance was measured, and are based upon the Board
	of Directors’ determination of the percentage of the goals that were met. Eligible employees include each of our named executive
	officers other than Mr. German: Ms. Sarhangi, Mr. Sleve, Mr. Cook, and Mr. Miller. Awards under the program are at the discretion
	of the Board of Directors and may be modified or discontinued at any time. No bonuses were awarded in fiscal 2016 because earnings
	targets were not met in 2015.


	 



	Benefit Plans

	.


	 


	We provide competitive welfare and retirement benefits to our executive
	officers as an important element of their compensation packages.  Our executives receive medical and dental coverage,
	life insurance, disability coverage and other benefits on the same basis as our other employees. Our executives are also eligible
	to participate in our employee savings and pension plans.


	 



	Corning Natural Gas Corporation Employees Savings Plan

	.  All
	employees of Corning Gas who work for more than 1,000 hours per year and who have completed one year of service may enroll in the
	savings plan at the beginning of each calendar quarter. Under the savings plan, participants may contribute up to 50% of their
	wages. Corning Gas matches one-half of the participant’s contributions up to a total of 3% of the participant’s wages.  Matching
	contributions vest in the participants’ accounts at a rate of 20% per year and become fully vested after five years. All
	participants may select one of ten investment plans, or a combination thereof, for their account. Distribution of amounts accumulated
	under the savings plan occurs upon the termination of employment or death of the participant.  The savings plan also
	contains loan and hardship withdrawal provisions.


	 



	Pension Plan

	.

	 

	We maintain a defined benefit pension
	plan,

	 

	the Retirement Plan for Salaried and Non-Union Employees of Corning Gas that covers substantially all of our
	employees.  We make annual contributions to the plan equal to amounts determined in accordance with the funding requirements
	of the Employee Retirement Security Act of 1974.  The benefit payable under the pension plan is calculated based upon
	the employee’s average salary for the four years immediately preceding his retirement.  As defined in the plan,
	the normal retirement age is 62. The compensation covered by the pension plan includes only base salary, identified in the summary
	compensation table as “salary.”


	 



	Outstanding Equity Awards at Fiscal Year End

	.


	 


	There are no outstanding equity awards at the fiscal year ended
	September 30, 2016. There were 9,000 options exercised and 3,000 options that expired during the fiscal year.


	 



	Director Compensation

	. For fiscal years 2015 and 2016, the
	Holding Company paid its directors with restricted stock grants of 375 shares per quarter. The shares awarded become unrestricted
	upon a director leaving the board.  Directors who also serve as officers are not compensated for their service as directors. 
	On February 27, 2015, shares were issued for the quarter ended December 31, 2014, on May 19, 2015, shares were issued for the quarter
	ended March 31, 2015, on August 17, 2015, shares were issued for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 and on December 1, 2015, shares
	were issued for the quarter ended September 30, 2015. On February 12, 2016, shares were issued for the quarter ended December 31,

	quarter ended June 30, 2016, and on December 5, 2016, shares were issued for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. Information
	regarding shares of restricted stock awarded to directors in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, is summarized below, at
	the amount recognized for financial statement reporting purposes in accordance with FASB ASC 718.
