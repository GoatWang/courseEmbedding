Community services and charity work[edit]
Yeung was the Charter President of "Lion Club of South Kowloon" in 1976. In 2008, Yeung set up "Albert Yeung Sau Shing Charity Foundation",[15] which is dedicated to supporting non-profit sports, educational and cultural activities.[1]
Yeung donated nearly 20 million dollars after the earthquake hit Sichuan in May 2008.[16] To recognise Beijing Olympic gold medalists' contributions to sports development in China, he also awarded 12.6 million dollars to the 63 athletes.[16]
The Jackie Chan and Albert Yeung Charity Foundation, founded by Chan and Yeung, donated RMB 10 million dollars to the Ministry of Civil Affairs of the PRC as a special fund to support the relief efforts after the earthquake in Wenchuan County, Sichuan Province in May 2008.[17]
Charitable foundation[edit]
In addition to setting up "Emperor Foundation Scholarship" for seven tertiary institutions in Hong Kong, Yeung has made donations to education funds in China, including the "Ministry of Justice, PRC Education Fund", the "China University of Political Science and Law – C.U.P.L. Mr Albert Yeung Education Fund", the "Peking University Education Foundation" and "Xiamen Education Fund" for students with top academic achievements or underprivileged background. He also invested and donated RMB 30 million to establish "Shanghai Institute of Visual Art, Fudan University – The Emperor School of Performing Arts" to cultivate new talents in China.[1]
Hong Kong[edit]
Yeung's charity works in Hong Kong include "Business Community Relief Fund for Victims of SARS" in 2003, "Together we care, Love for South Asia" Charity Show in 2005, "Walk for Hospice" in 2009 and "A Feast of Tastes 2010". The beneficiaries included The Community Chest, Tung Wah Group of Hospitals, World Vision of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Red Cross, the Socitey for the Promotion of Hospice Care and St. James' Settlement.[1]
Mainland[edit]
In 2007, on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China, Yeung contributed more than HKD 4 million to the official celebration event "Harbour Extravaganza", a firework display and gala dinner. He has been making donations to various foundations in China amounting to nearly HKD 200 million. His donations have helped to set up "Tung Wah Group Yeung Sing Memorial Long Stay Care Home" (1998), the "Jackie Chan and Albert Yeung Charity Foundation Baoding Child Care Centre" (2004), the "Hubei Hong Kong Emperor Elderly Care Centre", the "Jackie Chan and Albert Yeung Charity Foundation Baoding Elderly Care Centre" (2006), the "Albert Yeung Sau Shing Charity Foundation (Shunping) Elderly Care Centre" (2009) and the "Albert Yeung Sau Shing Charity Foundation (Xiongzhou) Elderly Care Centre" (2010).[1][18] He funded hospice services in Hubei, which made him win "The Most Influential Charity Project Nomination Award" in 2007.[1]
Cash awards totalling over RMB 10 million were also granted to Chinese gold medalists of 2008 Beijing Olympics.[19]
Court cases[edit]
Perverting the course of public justice conviction (1979)[edit]
On 10 February 1979, jockey Tony Cruz (Chinese: 告東尼), his brother and two other persons had an argument in a car park in the New Territories with Wai Kin-bong, who was knocked unconscious and hospitalised until 28 February. Wai was then Director and general manager of Tin Tin Daily News. The paper's owner Lau Tin-chau asked Yeung, a common friend of both Cruz and Wai, to try to resolve the tension between the two. Yeung visited Wai in hospital and offered him a "very substantial sum" of money either "not to give evidence against Mr. Cruz or to give evidence that would not 'nail him down'".[20] Remarkably, in circumstances where the magistrate found that Yeung had promised Wai he would "fix the police", Cruz was never charged. Yeung was convicted of perverting the course of justice and ultimately sentenced to nine months' imprisonment.[20]
Illegal bookmaking conviction (1986)[edit]
In 1986, Yeung was convicted of operating an illegal bookmaking syndicate and fined $50,000.[21]
Insider dealing (1993)[edit]
After a ten-day trial, on 8 June 1998, High Court judge Mr Justice Burrell, sitting as the Chairman of the Insider Dealing Tribunal together with two members, found Yeung culpable of insider dealing in shares of his listed Emperor (China Concept) Investments Ltd in October 1993. He was ordered to pay a total of HK$20,693,433 in fines and costs.[22]
Charged with criminal intimidation & false imprisonment (1994, Acquitted 1995)[edit]
Yeung was acquitted after the case against him folded when five prosecution witnesses suffered amnesia, the first of whom told Magistrate Paul Kelly he did not want to give evidence against Yeung because he was "very frightened". The magistrate acquitted Yeung but said he "cannot, with the same assurance, declare justice has been done".[21]
Defamation case against Google (2011)[edit]
On 8 August 2011 the South China Morning Post reported that Yeung had filed a writ for defamation against Google in the Hong Kong High Court on the grounds that it links to sites making libellous accusations against him.[23]

Community services and charity work[edit]
Yeung was the Charter President of "Lion Club of South Kowloon" in 1976. In 2008, Yeung set up "Albert Yeung Sau Shing Charity Foundation",[15] which is dedicated to supporting non-profit sports, educational and cultural activities.[1]
Yeung donated nearly 20 million dollars after the earthquake hit Sichuan in May 2008.[16] To recognise Beijing Olympic gold medalists' contributions to sports development in China, he also awarded 12.6 million dollars to the 63 athletes.[16]
The Jackie Chan and Albert Yeung Charity Foundation, founded by Chan and Yeung, donated RMB 10 million dollars to the Ministry of Civil Affairs of the PRC as a special fund to support the relief efforts after the earthquake in Wenchuan County, Sichuan Province in May 2008.[17]
Charitable foundation[edit]
In addition to setting up "Emperor Foundation Scholarship" for seven tertiary institutions in Hong Kong, Yeung has made donations to education funds in China, including the "Ministry of Justice, PRC Education Fund", the "China University of Political Science and Law – C.U.P.L. Mr Albert Yeung Education Fund", the "Peking University Education Foundation" and "Xiamen Education Fund" for students with top academic achievements or underprivileged background. He also invested and donated RMB 30 million to establish "Shanghai Institute of Visual Art, Fudan University – The Emperor School of Performing Arts" to cultivate new talents in China.[1]
Hong Kong[edit]
Yeung's charity works in Hong Kong include "Business Community Relief Fund for Victims of SARS" in 2003, "Together we care, Love for South Asia" Charity Show in 2005, "Walk for Hospice" in 2009 and "A Feast of Tastes 2010". The beneficiaries included The Community Chest, Tung Wah Group of Hospitals, World Vision of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Red Cross, the Socitey for the Promotion of Hospice Care and St. James' Settlement.[1]
Mainland[edit]
In 2007, on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China, Yeung contributed more than HKD 4 million to the official celebration event "Harbour Extravaganza", a firework display and gala dinner. He has been making donations to various foundations in China amounting to nearly HKD 200 million. His donations have helped to set up "Tung Wah Group Yeung Sing Memorial Long Stay Care Home" (1998), the "Jackie Chan and Albert Yeung Charity Foundation Baoding Child Care Centre" (2004), the "Hubei Hong Kong Emperor Elderly Care Centre", the "Jackie Chan and Albert Yeung Charity Foundation Baoding Elderly Care Centre" (2006), the "Albert Yeung Sau Shing Charity Foundation (Shunping) Elderly Care Centre" (2009) and the "Albert Yeung Sau Shing Charity Foundation (Xiongzhou) Elderly Care Centre" (2010).[1][18] He funded hospice services in Hubei, which made him win "The Most Influential Charity Project Nomination Award" in 2007.[1]
Cash awards totalling over RMB 10 million were also granted to Chinese gold medalists of 2008 Beijing Olympics.[19]
Court cases[edit]
Perverting the course of public justice conviction (1979)[edit]
On 10 February 1979, jockey Tony Cruz (Chinese: 告東尼), his brother and two other persons had an argument in a car park in the New Territories with Wai Kin-bong, who was knocked unconscious and hospitalised until 28 February. Wai was then Director and general manager of Tin Tin Daily News. The paper's owner Lau Tin-chau asked Yeung, a common friend of both Cruz and Wai, to try to resolve the tension between the two. Yeung visited Wai in hospital and offered him a "very substantial sum" of money either "not to give evidence against Mr. Cruz or to give evidence that would not 'nail him down'".[20] Remarkably, in circumstances where the magistrate found that Yeung had promised Wai he would "fix the police", Cruz was never charged. Yeung was convicted of perverting the course of justice and ultimately sentenced to nine months' imprisonment.[20]
Illegal bookmaking conviction (1986)[edit]
In 1986, Yeung was convicted of operating an illegal bookmaking syndicate and fined $50,000.[21]
Insider dealing (1993)[edit]
After a ten-day trial, on 8 June 1998, High Court judge Mr Justice Burrell, sitting as the Chairman of the Insider Dealing Tribunal together with two members, found Yeung culpable of insider dealing in shares of his listed Emperor (China Concept) Investments Ltd in October 1993. He was ordered to pay a total of HK$20,693,433 in fines and costs.[22]
Charged with criminal intimidation & false imprisonment (1994, Acquitted 1995)[edit]
Yeung was acquitted after the case against him folded when five prosecution witnesses suffered amnesia, the first of whom told Magistrate Paul Kelly he did not want to give evidence against Yeung because he was "very frightened". The magistrate acquitted Yeung but said he "cannot, with the same assurance, declare justice has been done".[21]
Defamation case against Google (2011)[edit]
On 8 August 2011 the South China Morning Post reported that Yeung had filed a writ for defamation against Google in the Hong Kong High Court on the grounds that it links to sites making libellous accusations against him.[23]

Community services and charity work[edit]
Yeung was the Charter President of "Lion Club of South Kowloon" in 1976. In 2008, Yeung set up "Albert Yeung Sau Shing Charity Foundation",[15] which is dedicated to supporting non-profit sports, educational and cultural activities.[1]
Yeung donated nearly 20 million dollars after the earthquake hit Sichuan in May 2008.[16] To recognise Beijing Olympic gold medalists' contributions to sports development in China, he also awarded 12.6 million dollars to the 63 athletes.[16]
The Jackie Chan and Albert Yeung Charity Foundation, founded by Chan and Yeung, donated RMB 10 million dollars to the Ministry of Civil Affairs of the PRC as a special fund to support the relief efforts after the earthquake in Wenchuan County, Sichuan Province in May 2008.[17]
Charitable foundation[edit]
In addition to setting up "Emperor Foundation Scholarship" for seven tertiary institutions in Hong Kong, Yeung has made donations to education funds in China, including the "Ministry of Justice, PRC Education Fund", the "China University of Political Science and Law – C.U.P.L. Mr Albert Yeung Education Fund", the "Peking University Education Foundation" and "Xiamen Education Fund" for students with top academic achievements or underprivileged background. He also invested and donated RMB 30 million to establish "Shanghai Institute of Visual Art, Fudan University – The Emperor School of Performing Arts" to cultivate new talents in China.[1]
Hong Kong[edit]
Yeung's charity works in Hong Kong include "Business Community Relief Fund for Victims of SARS" in 2003, "Together we care, Love for South Asia" Charity Show in 2005, "Walk for Hospice" in 2009 and "A Feast of Tastes 2010". The beneficiaries included The Community Chest, Tung Wah Group of Hospitals, World Vision of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Red Cross, the Socitey for the Promotion of Hospice Care and St. James' Settlement.[1]
Mainland[edit]
In 2007, on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of Hong Kong's return to China, Yeung contributed more than HKD 4 million to the official celebration event "Harbour Extravaganza", a firework display and gala dinner. He has been making donations to various foundations in China amounting to nearly HKD 200 million. His donations have helped to set up "Tung Wah Group Yeung Sing Memorial Long Stay Care Home" (1998), the "Jackie Chan and Albert Yeung Charity Foundation Baoding Child Care Centre" (2004), the "Hubei Hong Kong Emperor Elderly Care Centre", the "Jackie Chan and Albert Yeung Charity Foundation Baoding Elderly Care Centre" (2006), the "Albert Yeung Sau Shing Charity Foundation (Shunping) Elderly Care Centre" (2009) and the "Albert Yeung Sau Shing Charity Foundation (Xiongzhou) Elderly Care Centre" (2010).[1][18] He funded hospice services in Hubei, which made him win "The Most Influential Charity Project Nomination Award" in 2007.[1]
Cash awards totalling over RMB 10 million were also granted to Chinese gold medalists of 2008 Beijing Olympics.[19]
Court cases[edit]
Perverting the course of public justice conviction (1979)[edit]
On 10 February 1979, jockey Tony Cruz (Chinese: 告東尼), his brother and two other persons had an argument in a car park in the New Territories with Wai Kin-bong, who was knocked unconscious and hospitalised until 28 February. Wai was then Director and general manager of Tin Tin Daily News. The paper's owner Lau Tin-chau asked Yeung, a common friend of both Cruz and Wai, to try to resolve the tension between the two. Yeung visited Wai in hospital and offered him a "very substantial sum" of money either "not to give evidence against Mr. Cruz or to give evidence that would not 'nail him down'".[20] Remarkably, in circumstances where the magistrate found that Yeung had promised Wai he would "fix the police", Cruz was never charged. Yeung was convicted of perverting the course of justice and ultimately sentenced to nine months' imprisonment.[20]
Illegal bookmaking conviction (1986)[edit]
In 1986, Yeung was convicted of operating an illegal bookmaking syndicate and fined $50,000.[21]
Insider dealing (1993)[edit]
After a ten-day trial, on 8 June 1998, High Court judge Mr Justice Burrell, sitting as the Chairman of the Insider Dealing Tribunal together with two members, found Yeung culpable of insider dealing in shares of his listed Emperor (China Concept) Investments Ltd in October 1993. He was ordered to pay a total of HK$20,693,433 in fines and costs.[22]
Charged with criminal intimidation & false imprisonment (1994, Acquitted 1995)[edit]
Yeung was acquitted after the case against him folded when five prosecution witnesses suffered amnesia, the first of whom told Magistrate Paul Kelly he did not want to give evidence against Yeung because he was "very frightened". The magistrate acquitted Yeung but said he "cannot, with the same assurance, declare justice has been done".[21]
Defamation case against Google (2011)[edit]
On 8 August 2011 the South China Morning Post reported that Yeung had filed a writ for defamation against Google in the Hong Kong High Court on the grounds that it links to sites making libellous accusations against him.[23]
