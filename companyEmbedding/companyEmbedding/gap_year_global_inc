The Gap, Inc.,[6] commonly known as Gap Inc. or Gap, (stylized as GAP) is an American worldwide clothing and accessories retailer.
It was founded in 1969 by Donald Fisher and Doris F. Fisher and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. The company operates five primary divisions: the namesake banner, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Intermix, and Athleta. Gap Inc. is the largest specialty retailer in the United States, and is 3rd in total international locations, behind Inditex Group and H&M.[7] As of September 2008, the company has approximately 135,000 employees and operates 3,727 stores worldwide, of which 2,406 are located in the U.S.[8]
The Fisher family remains deeply involved in the company, collectively owning much of its stock.[9] Donald Fisher served as Chairman of the Board until 2004, playing a role in the ouster of then-CEO Millard Drexler in 2002, and remained on the board until his death on September 27, 2009. Fisher's wife and their son, Robert J. Fisher, also serve on Gap's board of directors. Robert succeeded his father as chairman in 2004 and also served as CEO on an interim basis following the resignation of Paul Pressler in 2007, before being succeeded by Glenn K. Murphy up until 2014. On February 1, 2015, Art Peck took over as CEO.[10]

History[edit]
Donald and Doris Fisher, who had a difficult time finding jeans that fit, opened the first Gap store on Ocean Avenue in San Francisco on August 21, 1969; its merchandise consisted of Levi's and LP records.[11] They had raised US$63,000 to open the store,[12] and reached US$2 million in sales in the second full year of operation. In 1970, Gap opened its second store in San Jose, California; its back room serves as the company's first replenishment warehouse. In 1971, Gap established its corporate headquarters in Burlingame, California with four employees. By 1973, the company had over 25 locations and had expanded into the East Coast market with a store in the Echelon Mall in Voorhees, New Jersey. In 1974, Gap began to sell private-label merchandise.
In the 1990s, Gap assumed an upscale identity and revamped its inventory under the direction of Millard Drexler.[13] However, Drexler was removed from his position after 19 years of service in 2002 after over-expansion, a 29-month slump in sales, and tensions with the Fisher family. Drexler refused to sign a non-compete agreement and eventually became CEO of J. Crew. One month after his departure, merchandise that he had ordered was responsible for a strong rebound in sales.[14][15][16] Robert J. Fisher recruited Paul Pressler as the new CEO; he was credited with closing under-performing locations and paying off debt. However, his focus groups failed to recover the company's leadership in its market.
In 2007, Gap announced that it would "focus [its] efforts on recruiting a chief executive officer who has deep retailing and merchandising experience ideally in apparel, understands the creative process and can effectively execute strategies in large, complex environments while maintaining strong financial discipline". That January, Pressler resigned after two disappointing holiday sales seasons and was succeeded by Robert J. Fisher on an interim basis.[17][18][19] He began working with the company in 1980 and joined the board in 1990, and would later assume several senior executive positions, including president of Banana Republic and the Gap units.[20] The board's search committee was led by Adrian Bellamy, chairman of The Body Shop International and included founder Donald Fisher. On February 2, Marka Hansen, the former head of the Banana Republic division, replaced Cynthia Harriss as the leader of the Gap division. The executive president for marketing and merchandising Jack Calhoun became interim president of Banana Republic.[21] In May, Old Navy laid off approximately 300 managers in lower volume locations to help streamline costs. That July, Glenn Murphy, previously CEO of Shoppers Drug Mart in Canada, was announced as the new CEO of Gap, Inc. New lead designers were also brought on board to help define a fashionable image, including Patrick Robinson for Gap Adult, Simon Kneen for Banana Republic, and Todd Oldham for Old Navy. Robinson was hired as chief designer in 2007, but was dismissed in May 2011 after sales failed to increase. However, he enjoyed commercial success in international markets.[22][23][24]
In October 2011, Gap Inc. announced plans to close 189 US stores, nearly 21 percent, by the end of 2013; however, it also plans to expand its presence in China.[25][26] The company announced it would open its first stores in Brazil in the Fall of 2013.[27]
In January 2015, Gap Inc announced plans to close their subsidiary Piperlime in order to focus on their core brands. The first and only Piperlime store, based in SoHo, New York City, closed in April.[28]
Corporate identity[edit]
Logo[edit]
Gap Inc. owns a trademark to its name, "Gap". The Gap's original trademark was a service mark for retail clothing store services. The application was filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on February 29, 1972, by The Gap Stores; registration was granted on October 10, 1972. The first use of the trademark was on August 23, 1969, and expanded to commercial usage on October 17, 1969. A second application was filed by Gap Stores, Inc. on September 12, 1974, this time for a trademark filed for shirts. The first usage for shirts and clothing products was on June 25, 1974. Trademark registration was granted on December 28, 1976. Both the service mark and trademark are registered and owned by Gap (Apparel), LLC of San Francisco, California.
On October 4, 2010, in an effort to establish a contemporary presence, Gap introduced a new logo. It was designed with the Helvetica font and reduced the prominence of the brand's iconic blue box. After much public outcry, the company reverted to its previous "blue box" logo on October 12, after less than a week in use.[29][30] Marka Hansen, the executive who oversaw the logo change, resigned February 1, 2011.[31]

Brands[edit]
Banana Republic, a small safari-themed clothing retailer, was purchased by Gap in 1983 and was rebranded as an upscale clothing retailer in the late 1980s. Old Navy was launched in 1994 as a value chain with a specialty flair. Forth & Towne, the company's fourth traditional retail concept, was launched on August 24, 2005, featuring apparel targeted toward women 35 years and older.[32] On February 26, 2007, after an 18-month trial period, it was discontinued, and the 19 stores were closed.[33] A fifth brand, the online clothing and accessories retailer Piperlime, was created in 2006; however, as of April 2015, the brand has been retired.[34] A sixth brand, Athleta, a women's athletic wear line, was added in 2009.[35] Intermix, a multi-brand fashion retailer founded in 1993, was acquired by Gap Inc. in 2012.[36]

Marketing[edit]




A Gap location in Westfield Valley Fair, San Jose, CA.


The Gap originally targeted the younger generation when it opened, with its name referring to the generation gap of the time.[38] It originally sold everything that Levi Strauss & Co made in every style, size, and color, and organized the stock by size. The Gap was the first of many shops that carried only Levi's. In 1973, Gap started making their own jeans as a way to differentiate themselves from department stores.[39] Gap's current marketing works to appeal to a broad demographic of customers, whereas Banana Republic presents a sophisticated image and Old Navy focuses "fun, fashion, and value" for families and younger customers. While the company has been criticized for blandness and uniformity in its selling environments, it maintains that it tailors its stores "to appeal to unique markets" by developing multiple formats and designs.[40] The domain www.gap.com attracts over 18 million visitors annually, according to a 2008 Compete.com survey.[41] The brand is being criticized in the UK because the merchandise that is offered to the UK customers cost double the prices (or even a direct $/£ swap) found in the United States. Gap also does not offer XXL or larger sizes in the UK stating the UK market does not require them in contrast to market leader NEXT who offer a variety of larger sizes in the UK.
International presence[edit]




Gap in Hillcrest Mall


Gap operates company-owned stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Indonesia, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Mexico as of May 2016; it also has franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap, Banana Republic, or Old Navy stores in 43 countries.[42] As of May 2016, Gap Inc. operates 3,727 company-owned and franchise locations.[43] In January 2008, Gap signed a deal with Marinopoulos Group to open Gap and Banana Republic stores in Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Cyprus, and Croatia.[44] In February 2009, Elbit Imaging, Ltd. secured a franchise to open and operate Gap and Banana Republic stores in Israel.[45] In August 2010, the company opened its first store in Melbourne, Australia at Chadstone Shopping Centre.[citation needed] In September 2011, Komax opened the first Gap store in Chile, due to a franchise.[46] In October 2011, the first GAP store opened in Warsaw, Poland,[47] but shut it down and two other locations in Wrocław and Katowice in 2015. Gap now has a store in New Delhi, India which opened in May 2015. On 20 February 2016, Gap launched stores in Mumbai at Oberoi Mall and Infinity-2.
In May 2016, Gap Inc. announced it would shutter all Old Navy stores in Japan in response to poor Q1 performance for Old Navy and consistent losses across the organization.[48]
In 2017, Gap closed all its stores in Israel.
Product Red[edit]

In 2006, Gap took part in the Product Red campaign with the launch of a special RED collection, including a T-shirt manufactured in Lesotho from African cotton. The expanded Gap Product Red collection was released on October 13, 2006. 50 to 100 percent of the profits went to the Global Fund, depending on the item.[49] The company continued the products into 2007, especially in the lead up to Valentine's Day, using slogans such as "Admi(RED)" and "Desi(RED)." National Labor Committee for Worker and Human Rights activists criticized Gap's partnerships because Gap has historically been accused of sweatshop-like conditions.[50] Product Red has contributed over $45 million to the Global Fund, more than any other private donation received to date. Other launch partners included American Express, Apple Inc., Converse, Hallmark, Emporio Armani, and Motorola.
Labour controversies[edit]
In 2003, a class action lawsuit against Gap and 21 other companies alleged that sweatshop workers in Saipan were not paid for overtime work, were subjected to forced abortion, and were required to work in unsafe working conditions.[51] A settlement of 20 million dollars was reached whereby The Gap did not admit liability.[52]
In 2007, Ethisphere Magazine chose Gap from among thousands of companies evaluated as one of 100 "World's Most Ethical Companies."[53] In May 2006, adult and child employees of Western, a supplier in Jordan, were found to have worked up to 109 hours per week and to have gone six months without being paid. Some employees claimed they had been raped by managers.[54] Most of these allegations were directed at Wal-Mart (who mostly ignored the claims), while Gap immediately looked into the matter to remedy the situation.[54][not in citation given]
On October 28, 2007, BBC footage showed child labor in Indian Gap factories.[55] The company denied knowledge of the happenings; it subsequently removed and destroyed the single piece of clothing in question, a smock blouse, from a British store. Gap promised to investigate breaches in its ethical policy.[56]
Bangladeshi and international labor groups in 2011 put forth a detailed safety proposal which entailed the establishment of independent inspections of garment factories. The plan called for inspectors to have the power to close unsafe factories. The proposal entailed a legally binding contract between suppliers, customers and unions. At a meeting in 2011 in Dhaka, major European and North American retailers, including Gap, rejected the proposal. Further efforts by unions to advance the proposal after numerous and deadly factory fires have been rejected.[57] After the 2013 Savar building collapse, Kohl's became a founding member of the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety.
On February 19, 2014, Glenn Murphy, CEO of Gap Inc., announced Gap will raise the minimum wages for its 65,000 U.S. store employees.[58]

The Gap, Inc.,[6] commonly known as Gap Inc. or Gap, (stylized as GAP) is an American worldwide clothing and accessories retailer.
It was founded in 1969 by Donald Fisher and Doris F. Fisher and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. The company operates five primary divisions: the namesake banner, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Intermix, and Athleta. Gap Inc. is the largest specialty retailer in the United States, and is 3rd in total international locations, behind Inditex Group and H&M.[7] As of September 2008, the company has approximately 135,000 employees and operates 3,727 stores worldwide, of which 2,406 are located in the U.S.[8]
The Fisher family remains deeply involved in the company, collectively owning much of its stock.[9] Donald Fisher served as Chairman of the Board until 2004, playing a role in the ouster of then-CEO Millard Drexler in 2002, and remained on the board until his death on September 27, 2009. Fisher's wife and their son, Robert J. Fisher, also serve on Gap's board of directors. Robert succeeded his father as chairman in 2004 and also served as CEO on an interim basis following the resignation of Paul Pressler in 2007, before being succeeded by Glenn K. Murphy up until 2014. On February 1, 2015, Art Peck took over as CEO.[10]

History[edit]
Donald and Doris Fisher, who had a difficult time finding jeans that fit, opened the first Gap store on Ocean Avenue in San Francisco on August 21, 1969; its merchandise consisted of Levi's and LP records.[11] They had raised US$63,000 to open the store,[12] and reached US$2 million in sales in the second full year of operation. In 1970, Gap opened its second store in San Jose, California; its back room serves as the company's first replenishment warehouse. In 1971, Gap established its corporate headquarters in Burlingame, California with four employees. By 1973, the company had over 25 locations and had expanded into the East Coast market with a store in the Echelon Mall in Voorhees, New Jersey. In 1974, Gap began to sell private-label merchandise.
In the 1990s, Gap assumed an upscale identity and revamped its inventory under the direction of Millard Drexler.[13] However, Drexler was removed from his position after 19 years of service in 2002 after over-expansion, a 29-month slump in sales, and tensions with the Fisher family. Drexler refused to sign a non-compete agreement and eventually became CEO of J. Crew. One month after his departure, merchandise that he had ordered was responsible for a strong rebound in sales.[14][15][16] Robert J. Fisher recruited Paul Pressler as the new CEO; he was credited with closing under-performing locations and paying off debt. However, his focus groups failed to recover the company's leadership in its market.
In 2007, Gap announced that it would "focus [its] efforts on recruiting a chief executive officer who has deep retailing and merchandising experience ideally in apparel, understands the creative process and can effectively execute strategies in large, complex environments while maintaining strong financial discipline". That January, Pressler resigned after two disappointing holiday sales seasons and was succeeded by Robert J. Fisher on an interim basis.[17][18][19] He began working with the company in 1980 and joined the board in 1990, and would later assume several senior executive positions, including president of Banana Republic and the Gap units.[20] The board's search committee was led by Adrian Bellamy, chairman of The Body Shop International and included founder Donald Fisher. On February 2, Marka Hansen, the former head of the Banana Republic division, replaced Cynthia Harriss as the leader of the Gap division. The executive president for marketing and merchandising Jack Calhoun became interim president of Banana Republic.[21] In May, Old Navy laid off approximately 300 managers in lower volume locations to help streamline costs. That July, Glenn Murphy, previously CEO of Shoppers Drug Mart in Canada, was announced as the new CEO of Gap, Inc. New lead designers were also brought on board to help define a fashionable image, including Patrick Robinson for Gap Adult, Simon Kneen for Banana Republic, and Todd Oldham for Old Navy. Robinson was hired as chief designer in 2007, but was dismissed in May 2011 after sales failed to increase. However, he enjoyed commercial success in international markets.[22][23][24]
In October 2011, Gap Inc. announced plans to close 189 US stores, nearly 21 percent, by the end of 2013; however, it also plans to expand its presence in China.[25][26] The company announced it would open its first stores in Brazil in the Fall of 2013.[27]
In January 2015, Gap Inc announced plans to close their subsidiary Piperlime in order to focus on their core brands. The first and only Piperlime store, based in SoHo, New York City, closed in April.[28]
Corporate identity[edit]
Logo[edit]
Gap Inc. owns a trademark to its name, "Gap". The Gap's original trademark was a service mark for retail clothing store services. The application was filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on February 29, 1972, by The Gap Stores; registration was granted on October 10, 1972. The first use of the trademark was on August 23, 1969, and expanded to commercial usage on October 17, 1969. A second application was filed by Gap Stores, Inc. on September 12, 1974, this time for a trademark filed for shirts. The first usage for shirts and clothing products was on June 25, 1974. Trademark registration was granted on December 28, 1976. Both the service mark and trademark are registered and owned by Gap (Apparel), LLC of San Francisco, California.
On October 4, 2010, in an effort to establish a contemporary presence, Gap introduced a new logo. It was designed with the Helvetica font and reduced the prominence of the brand's iconic blue box. After much public outcry, the company reverted to its previous "blue box" logo on October 12, after less than a week in use.[29][30] Marka Hansen, the executive who oversaw the logo change, resigned February 1, 2011.[31]

Brands[edit]
Banana Republic, a small safari-themed clothing retailer, was purchased by Gap in 1983 and was rebranded as an upscale clothing retailer in the late 1980s. Old Navy was launched in 1994 as a value chain with a specialty flair. Forth & Towne, the company's fourth traditional retail concept, was launched on August 24, 2005, featuring apparel targeted toward women 35 years and older.[32] On February 26, 2007, after an 18-month trial period, it was discontinued, and the 19 stores were closed.[33] A fifth brand, the online clothing and accessories retailer Piperlime, was created in 2006; however, as of April 2015, the brand has been retired.[34] A sixth brand, Athleta, a women's athletic wear line, was added in 2009.[35] Intermix, a multi-brand fashion retailer founded in 1993, was acquired by Gap Inc. in 2012.[36]

Marketing[edit]




A Gap location in Westfield Valley Fair, San Jose, CA.


The Gap originally targeted the younger generation when it opened, with its name referring to the generation gap of the time.[38] It originally sold everything that Levi Strauss & Co made in every style, size, and color, and organized the stock by size. The Gap was the first of many shops that carried only Levi's. In 1973, Gap started making their own jeans as a way to differentiate themselves from department stores.[39] Gap's current marketing works to appeal to a broad demographic of customers, whereas Banana Republic presents a sophisticated image and Old Navy focuses "fun, fashion, and value" for families and younger customers. While the company has been criticized for blandness and uniformity in its selling environments, it maintains that it tailors its stores "to appeal to unique markets" by developing multiple formats and designs.[40] The domain www.gap.com attracts over 18 million visitors annually, according to a 2008 Compete.com survey.[41] The brand is being criticized in the UK because the merchandise that is offered to the UK customers cost double the prices (or even a direct $/£ swap) found in the United States. Gap also does not offer XXL or larger sizes in the UK stating the UK market does not require them in contrast to market leader NEXT who offer a variety of larger sizes in the UK.
International presence[edit]

Gap now has a store in New Delhi, India which opened in May 2015. On 20 February 2016, Gap launched stores in Mumbai at Oberoi Mall and Infinity-2.
In May 2016, Gap Inc. announced it would shutter all Old Navy stores in Japan in response to poor Q1 performance for Old Navy and consistent losses across the organization.[48]
In 2017, Gap closed all its stores in Israel.

In 2006, Gap took part in the Product Red campaign with the launch of a special RED collection, including a T-shirt manufactured in Lesotho from African cotton. The expanded Gap Product Red collection was released on October 13, 2006. 50 to 100 percent of the profits went to the Global Fund, depending on the item.[49] The company continued the products into 2007, especially in the lead up to Valentine's Day, using slogans such as "Admi(RED)" and "Desi(RED)." National Labor Committee for Worker and Human Rights activists criticized Gap's partnerships because Gap has historically been accused of sweatshop-like conditions.[50] Product Red has contributed over $45 million to the Global Fund, more than any other private donation received to date. Other launch partners included American Express, Apple Inc., Converse, Hallmark, Emporio Armani, and Motorola.
Labour controversies[edit]
In 2003, a class action lawsuit against Gap and 21 other companies alleged that sweatshop workers in Saipan were not paid for overtime work, were subjected to forced abortion, and were required to work in unsafe working conditions.[51] A settlement of 20 million dollars was reached whereby The Gap did not admit liability.[52]
In 2007, Ethisphere Magazine chose Gap from among thousands of companies evaluated as one of 100 "World's Most Ethical Companies."[53] In May 2006, adult and child employees of Western, a supplier in Jordan, were found to have worked up to 109 hours per week and to have gone six months without being paid. Some employees claimed they had been raped by managers.[54] Most of these allegations were directed at Wal-Mart (who mostly ignored the claims), while Gap immediately looked into the matter to remedy the situation.[54][not in citation given]
On October 28, 2007, BBC footage showed child labor in Indian Gap factories.[55] The company denied knowledge of the happenings; it subsequently removed and destroyed the single piece of clothing in question, a smock blouse, from a British store. Gap promised to investigate breaches in its ethical policy.[56]
Bangladeshi and international labor groups in 2011 put forth a detailed safety proposal which entailed the establishment of independent inspections of garment factories. The plan called for inspectors to have the power to close unsafe factories. The proposal entailed a legally binding contract between suppliers, customers and unions. At a meeting in 2011 in Dhaka, major European and North American retailers, including Gap, rejected the proposal. Further efforts by unions to advance the proposal after numerous and deadly factory fires have been rejected.[57] After the 2013 Savar building collapse, Kohl's became a founding member of the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety.
On February 19, 2014, Glenn Murphy, CEO of Gap Inc., announced Gap will raise the minimum wages for its 65,000 U.S. store employees.[58]

The Gap, Inc.,[6] commonly known as Gap Inc. or Gap, (stylized as GAP) is an American worldwide clothing and accessories retailer.
It was founded in 1969 by Donald Fisher and Doris F. Fisher and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. The company operates five primary divisions: the namesake banner, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Intermix, and Athleta. Gap Inc. is the largest specialty retailer in the United States, and is 3rd in total international locations, behind Inditex Group and H&M.[7] As of September 2008, the company has approximately 135,000 employees and operates 3,727 stores worldwide, of which 2,406 are located in the U.S.[8]
The Fisher family remains deeply involved in the company, collectively owning much of its stock.[9] Donald Fisher served as Chairman of the Board until 2004, playing a role in the ouster of then-CEO Millard Drexler in 2002, and remained on the board until his death on September 27, 2009. Fisher's wife and their son, Robert J. Fisher, also serve on Gap's board of directors. Robert succeeded his father as chairman in 2004 and also served as CEO on an interim basis following the resignation of Paul Pressler in 2007, before being succeeded by Glenn K. Murphy up until 2014. On February 1, 2015, Art Peck took over as CEO.[10]

History[edit]
Donald and Doris Fisher, who had a difficult time finding jeans that fit, opened the first Gap store on Ocean Avenue in San Francisco on August 21, 1969; its merchandise consisted of Levi's and LP records.[11] They had raised US$63,000 to open the store,[12] and reached US$2 million in sales in the second full year of operation. In 1970, Gap opened its second store in San Jose, California; its back room serves as the company's first replenishment warehouse. In 1971, Gap established its corporate headquarters in Burlingame, California with four employees. By 1973, the company had over 25 locations and had expanded into the East Coast market with a store in the Echelon Mall in Voorhees, New Jersey. In 1974, Gap began to sell private-label merchandise.
In the 1990s, Gap assumed an upscale identity and revamped its inventory under the direction of Millard Drexler.[13] However, Drexler was removed from his position after 19 years of service in 2002 after over-expansion, a 29-month slump in sales, and tensions with the Fisher family. Drexler refused to sign a non-compete agreement and eventually became CEO of J. Crew. One month after his departure, merchandise that he had ordered was responsible for a strong rebound in sales.[14][15][16] Robert J. Fisher recruited Paul Pressler as the new CEO; he was credited with closing under-performing locations and paying off debt. However, his focus groups failed to recover the company's leadership in its market.
In 2007, Gap announced that it would "focus [its] efforts on recruiting a chief executive officer who has deep retailing and merchandising experience ideally in apparel, understands the creative process and can effectively execute strategies in large, complex environments while maintaining strong financial discipline". That January, Pressler resigned after two disappointing holiday sales seasons and was succeeded by Robert J. Fisher on an interim basis.[17][18][19] He began working with the company in 1980 and joined the board in 1990, and would later assume several senior executive positions, including president of Banana Republic and the Gap units.[20] The board's search committee was led by Adrian Bellamy, chairman of The Body Shop International and included founder Donald Fisher. On February 2, Marka Hansen, the former head of the Banana Republic division, replaced Cynthia Harriss as the leader of the Gap division. The executive president for marketing and merchandising Jack Calhoun became interim president of Banana Republic.[21] In May, Old Navy laid off approximately 300 managers in lower volume locations to help streamline costs. That July, Glenn Murphy, previously CEO of Shoppers Drug Mart in Canada, was announced as the new CEO of Gap, Inc. New lead designers were also brought on board to help define a fashionable image, including Patrick Robinson for Gap Adult, Simon Kneen for Banana Republic, and Todd Oldham for Old Navy. Robinson was hired as chief designer in 2007, but was dismissed in May 2011 after sales failed to increase. However, he enjoyed commercial success in international markets.[22][23][24]
In October 2011, Gap Inc. announced plans to close 189 US stores, nearly 21 percent, by the end of 2013; however, it also plans to expand its presence in China.[25][26] The company announced it would open its first stores in Brazil in the Fall of 2013.[27]
In January 2015, Gap Inc announced plans to close their subsidiary Piperlime in order to focus on their core brands. The first and only Piperlime store, based in SoHo, New York City, closed in April.[28]
Corporate identity[edit]
Logo[edit]
Gap Inc. owns a trademark to its name, "Gap". The Gap's original trademark was a service mark for retail clothing store services. The application was filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on February 29, 1972, by The Gap Stores; registration was granted on October 10, 1972. The first use of the trademark was on August 23, 1969, and expanded to commercial usage on October 17, 1969. A second application was filed by Gap Stores, Inc. on September 12, 1974, this time for a trademark filed for shirts. The first usage for shirts and clothing products was on June 25, 1974. Trademark registration was granted on December 28, 1976. Both the service mark and trademark are registered and owned by Gap (Apparel), LLC of San Francisco, California.
On October 4, 2010, in an effort to establish a contemporary presence, Gap introduced a new logo. It was designed with the Helvetica font and reduced the prominence of the brand's iconic blue box. After much public outcry, the company reverted to its previous "blue box" logo on October 12, after less than a week in use.[29][30] Marka Hansen, the executive who oversaw the logo change, resigned February 1, 2011.[31]

Brands[edit]
Banana Republic, a small safari-themed clothing retailer, was purchased by Gap in 1983 and was rebranded as an upscale clothing retailer in the late 1980s. Old Navy was launched in 1994 as a value chain with a specialty flair. Forth & Towne, the company's fourth traditional retail concept, was launched on August 24, 2005, featuring apparel targeted toward women 35 years and older.[32] On February 26, 2007, after an 18-month trial period, it was discontinued, and the 19 stores were closed.[33] A fifth brand, the online clothing and accessories retailer Piperlime, was created in 2006; however, as of April 2015, the brand has been retired.[34] A sixth brand, Athleta, a women's athletic wear line, was added in 2009.[35] Intermix, a multi-brand fashion retailer founded in 1993, was acquired by Gap Inc. in 2012.[36]

Marketing[edit]




A Gap location in Westfield Valley Fair, San Jose, CA.


The Gap originally targeted the younger generation when it opened, with its name referring to the generation gap of the time.[38] It originally sold everything that Levi Strauss & Co made in every style, size, and color, and organized the stock by size. The Gap was the first of many shops that carried only Levi's. In 1973, Gap started making their own jeans as a way to differentiate themselves from department stores.[39] Gap's current marketing works to appeal to a broad demographic of customers, whereas Banana Republic presents a sophisticated image and Old Navy focuses "fun, fashion, and value" for families and younger customers. While the company has been criticized for blandness and uniformity in its selling environments, it maintains that it tailors its stores "to appeal to unique markets" by developing multiple formats and designs.[40] The domain www.gap.com attracts over 18 million visitors annually, according to a 2008 Compete.com survey.[41] The brand is being criticized in the UK because the merchandise that is offered to the UK customers cost double the prices (or even a direct $/£ swap) found in the United States. Gap also does not offer XXL or larger sizes in the UK stating the UK market does not require them in contrast to market leader NEXT who offer a variety of larger sizes in the UK.
International presence[edit]




Gap in Hillcrest Mall


Gap operates company-owned stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Indonesia, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Mexico as of May 2016; it also has franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap, Banana Republic, or Old Navy stores in 43 countries.[42] As of May 2016, Gap Inc. operates 3,727 company-owned and franchise locations.[43] In January 2008, Gap signed a deal with Marinopoulos Group to open Gap and Banana Republic stores in Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Cyprus, and Croatia.[44] In February 2009, Elbit Imaging, Ltd. secured a franchise to open and operate Gap and Banana Republic stores in Israel.[45] In August 2010, the company opened its first store in Melbourne, Australia at Chadstone Shopping Centre.[citation needed] In September 2011, Komax opened the first Gap store in Chile, due to a franchise.[46] In October 2011, the first GAP store opened in Warsaw, Poland,[47] but shut it down and two other locations in Wrocław and Katowice in 2015. Gap now has a store in New Delhi, India which opened in May 2015. On 20 February 2016, Gap launched stores in Mumbai at Oberoi Mall and Infinity-2.
In May 2016, Gap Inc. announced it would shutter all Old Navy stores in Japan in response to poor Q1 performance for Old Navy and consistent losses across the organization.[48]
In 2017, Gap closed all its stores in Israel.
Product Red[edit]

In 2006, Gap took part in the Product Red campaign with the launch of a special RED collection, including a T-shirt manufactured in Lesotho from African cotton. The expanded Gap Product Red collection was released on October 13, 2006. 50 to 100 percent of the profits went to the Global Fund, depending on the item.[49] The company continued the products into 2007, especially in the lead up to Valentine's Day, using slogans such as "Admi(RED)" and "Desi(RED)." National Labor Committee for Worker and Human Rights activists criticized Gap's partnerships because Gap has historically been accused of sweatshop-like conditions.[50] Product Red has contributed over $45 million to the Global Fund, more than any other private donation received to date. Other launch partners included American Express, Apple Inc., Converse, Hallmark, Emporio Armani, and Motorola.
Labour controversies[edit]
In 2003, a class action lawsuit against Gap and 21 other companies alleged that sweatshop workers in Saipan were not paid for overtime work, were subjected to forced abortion, and were required to work in unsafe working conditions.[51] A settlement of 20 million dollars was reached whereby The Gap did not admit liability.[52]
In 2007, Ethisphere Magazine chose Gap from among thousands of companies evaluated as one of 100 "World's Most Ethical Companies."[53] In May 2006, adult and child employees of Western, a supplier in Jordan, were found to have worked up to 109 hours per week and to have gone six months without being paid. Some employees claimed they had been raped by managers.[54] Most of these allegations were directed at Wal-Mart (who mostly ignored the claims), while Gap immediately looked into the matter to remedy the situation.[54][not in citation given]
On October 28, 2007, BBC footage showed child labor in Indian Gap factories.[55] The company denied knowledge of the happenings; it subsequently removed and destroyed the single piece of clothing in question, a smock blouse, from a British store. Gap promised to investigate breaches in its ethical policy.[56]
Bangladeshi and international labor groups in 2011 put forth a detailed safety proposal which entailed the establishment of independent inspections of garment factories. The plan called for inspectors to have the power to close unsafe factories. The proposal entailed a legally binding contract between suppliers, customers and unions. At a meeting in 2011 in Dhaka, major European and North American retailers, including Gap, rejected the proposal. Further efforts by unions to advance the proposal after numerous and deadly factory fires have been rejected.[57] After the 2013 Savar building collapse, Kohl's became a founding member of the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety.
On February 19, 2014, Glenn Murphy, CEO of Gap Inc., announced Gap will raise the minimum wages for its 65,000 U.S. store employees.[58]

The Gap, Inc.,[6] commonly known as Gap Inc. or Gap, (stylized as GAP) is an American worldwide clothing and accessories retailer.
It was founded in 1969 by Donald Fisher and Doris F. Fisher and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. The company operates five primary divisions: the namesake banner, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Intermix, and Athleta. Gap Inc. is the largest specialty retailer in the United States, and is 3rd in total international locations, behind Inditex Group and H&M.[7] As of September 2008, the company has approximately 135,000 employees and operates 3,727 stores worldwide, of which 2,406 are located in the U.S.[8]
The Fisher family remains deeply involved in the company, collectively owning much of its stock.[9] Donald Fisher served as Chairman of the Board until 2004, playing a role in the ouster of then-CEO Millard Drexler in 2002, and remained on the board until his death on September 27, 2009. Fisher's wife and their son, Robert J. Fisher, also serve on Gap's board of directors. Robert succeeded his father as chairman in 2004 and also served as CEO on an interim basis following the resignation of Paul Pressler in 2007, before being succeeded by Glenn K. Murphy up until 2014. On February 1, 2015, Art Peck took over as CEO.[10]

History[edit]
Donald and Doris Fisher, who had a difficult time finding jeans that fit, opened the first Gap store on Ocean Avenue in San Francisco on August 21, 1969; its merchandise consisted of Levi's and LP records.[11] They had raised US$63,000 to open the store,[12] and reached US$2 million in sales in the second full year of operation. In 1970, Gap opened its second store in San Jose, California; its back room serves as the company's first replenishment warehouse. In 1971, Gap established its corporate headquarters in Burlingame, California with four employees. By 1973, the company had over 25 locations and had expanded into the East Coast market with a store in the Echelon Mall in Voorhees, New Jersey. In 1974, Gap began to sell private-label merchandise.
In the 1990s, Gap assumed an upscale identity and revamped its inventory under the direction of Millard Drexler.[13] However, Drexler was removed from his position after 19 years of service in 2002 after over-expansion, a 29-month slump in sales, and tensions with the Fisher family. Drexler refused to sign a non-compete agreement and eventually became CEO of J. Crew. One month after his departure, merchandise that he had ordered was responsible for a strong rebound in sales.[14][15][16] Robert J. Fisher recruited Paul Pressler as the new CEO; he was credited with closing under-performing locations and paying off debt. However, his focus groups failed to recover the company's leadership in its market.
In 2007, Gap announced that it would "focus [its] efforts on recruiting a chief executive officer who has deep retailing and merchandising experience ideally in apparel, understands the creative process and can effectively execute strategies in large, complex environments while maintaining strong financial discipline". That January, Pressler resigned after two disappointing holiday sales seasons and was succeeded by Robert J. Fisher on an interim basis.[17][18][19] He began working with the company in 1980 and joined the board in 1990, and would later assume several senior executive positions, including president of Banana Republic and the Gap units.[20] The board's search committee was led by Adrian Bellamy, chairman of The Body Shop International and included founder Donald Fisher. On February 2, Marka Hansen, the former head of the Banana Republic division, replaced Cynthia Harriss as the leader of the Gap division. The executive president for marketing and merchandising Jack Calhoun became interim president of Banana Republic.[21] In May, Old Navy laid off approximately 300 managers in lower volume locations to help streamline costs. That July, Glenn Murphy, previously CEO of Shoppers Drug Mart in Canada, was announced as the new CEO of Gap, Inc. New lead designers were also brought on board to help define a fashionable image, including Patrick Robinson for Gap Adult, Simon Kneen for Banana Republic, and Todd Oldham for Old Navy. Robinson was hired as chief designer in 2007, but was dismissed in May 2011 after sales failed to increase. However, he enjoyed commercial success in international markets.[22][23][24]
In October 2011, Gap Inc. announced plans to close 189 US stores, nearly 21 percent, by the end of 2013; however, it also plans to expand its presence in China.[25][26] The company announced it would open its first stores in Brazil in the Fall of 2013.[27]
In January 2015, Gap Inc announced plans to close their subsidiary Piperlime in order to focus on their core brands. The first and only Piperlime store, based in SoHo, New York City, closed in April.[28]
Corporate identity[edit]
Logo[edit]
Gap Inc. owns a trademark to its name, "Gap". The Gap's original trademark was a service mark for retail clothing store services. The application was filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on February 29, 1972, by The Gap Stores; registration was granted on October 10, 1972. The first use of the trademark was on August 23, 1969, and expanded to commercial usage on October 17, 1969. A second application was filed by Gap Stores, Inc. on September 12, 1974, this time for a trademark filed for shirts. The first usage for shirts and clothing products was on June 25, 1974. Trademark registration was granted on December 28, 1976. Both the service mark and trademark are registered and owned by Gap (Apparel), LLC of San Francisco, California.
On October 4, 2010, in an effort to establish a contemporary presence, Gap introduced a new logo. It was designed with the Helvetica font and reduced the prominence of the brand's iconic blue box. After much public outcry, the company reverted to its previous "blue box" logo on October 12, after less than a week in use.[29][30] Marka Hansen, the executive who oversaw the logo change, resigned February 1, 2011.[31]

Brands[edit]
Banana Republic, a small safari-themed clothing retailer, was purchased by Gap in 1983 and was rebranded as an upscale clothing retailer in the late 1980s. Old Navy was launched in 1994 as a value chain with a specialty flair. Forth & Towne, the company's fourth traditional retail concept, was launched on August 24, 2005, featuring apparel targeted toward women 35 years and older.[32] On February 26, 2007, after an 18-month trial period, it was discontinued, and the 19 stores were closed.[33] A fifth brand, the online clothing and accessories retailer Piperlime, was created in 2006; however, as of April 2015, the brand has been retired.[34] A sixth brand, Athleta, a women's athletic wear line, was added in 2009.[35] Intermix, a multi-brand fashion retailer founded in 1993, was acquired by Gap Inc. in 2012.[36]

Marketing[edit]




A Gap location in Westfield Valley Fair, San Jose, CA.


The Gap originally targeted the younger generation when it opened, with its name referring to the generation gap of the time.[38] It originally sold everything that Levi Strauss & Co made in every style, size, and color, and organized the stock by size. The Gap was the first of many shops that carried only Levi's. In 1973, Gap started making their own jeans as a way to differentiate themselves from department stores.[39] Gap's current marketing works to appeal to a broad demographic of customers, whereas Banana Republic presents a sophisticated image and Old Navy focuses "fun, fashion, and value" for families and younger customers. While the company has been criticized for blandness and uniformity in its selling environments, it maintains that it tailors its stores "to appeal to unique markets" by developing multiple formats and designs.[40] The domain www.gap.com attracts over 18 million visitors annually, according to a 2008 Compete.com survey.[41] The brand is being criticized in the UK because the merchandise that is offered to the UK customers cost double the prices (or even a direct $/£ swap) found in the United States. Gap also does not offer XXL or larger sizes in the UK stating the UK market does not require them in contrast to market leader NEXT who offer a variety of larger sizes in the UK.
International presence[edit]




Gap in Hillcrest Mall


Gap operates company-owned stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Indonesia, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Mexico as of May 2016; it also has franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap, Banana Republic, or Old Navy stores in 43 countries.[42] As of May 2016, Gap Inc. operates 3,727 company-owned and franchise locations.[43] In January 2008, Gap signed a deal with Marinopoulos Group to open Gap and Banana Republic stores in Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Cyprus, and Croatia.[44] In February 2009, Elbit Imaging, Ltd. secured a franchise to open and operate Gap and Banana Republic stores in Israel.[45] In August 2010, the company opened its first store in Melbourne, Australia at Chadstone Shopping Centre.[citation needed] In September 2011, Komax opened the first Gap store in Chile, due to a franchise.[46] In October 2011, the first GAP store opened in Warsaw, Poland,[47] but shut it down and two other locations in Wrocław and Katowice in 2015. Gap now has a store in New Delhi, India which opened in May 2015. On 20 February 2016, Gap launched stores in Mumbai at Oberoi Mall and Infinity-2.
In May 2016, Gap Inc. announced it would shutter all Old Navy stores in Japan in response to poor Q1 performance for Old Navy and consistent losses across the organization.[48]
In 2017, Gap closed all its stores in Israel.
Product Red[edit]

In 2006, Gap took part in the Product Red campaign with the launch of a special RED collection, including a T-shirt manufactured in Lesotho from African cotton. The expanded Gap Product Red collection was released on October 13, 2006. 50 to 100 percent of the profits went to the Global Fund, depending on the item.[49] The company continued the products into 2007, especially in the lead up to Valentine's Day, using slogans such as "Admi(RED)" and "Desi(RED)." National Labor Committee for Worker and Human Rights activists criticized Gap's partnerships because Gap has historically been accused of sweatshop-like conditions.[50] Product Red has contributed over $45 million to the Global Fund, more than any other private donation received to date. Other launch partners included American Express, Apple Inc., Converse, Hallmark, Emporio Armani, and Motorola.
Labour controversies[edit]
In 2003, a class action lawsuit against Gap and 21 other companies alleged that sweatshop workers in Saipan were not paid for overtime work, were subjected to forced abortion, and were required to work in unsafe working conditions.[51] A settlement of 20 million dollars was reached whereby The Gap did not admit liability.[52]
In 2007, Ethisphere Magazine chose Gap from among thousands of companies evaluated as one of 100 "World's Most Ethical Companies."[53] In May 2006, adult and child employees of Western, a supplier in Jordan, were found to have worked up to 109 hours per week and to have gone six months without being paid. Some employees claimed they had been raped by managers.[54] Most of these allegations were directed at Wal-Mart (who mostly ignored the claims), while Gap immediately looked into the matter to remedy the situation.[54][not in citation given]
On October 28, 2007, BBC footage showed child labor in Indian Gap factories.[55] The company denied knowledge of the happenings; it subsequently removed and destroyed the single piece of clothing in question, a smock blouse, from a British store. Gap promised to investigate breaches in its ethical policy.[56]
Bangladeshi and international labor groups in 2011 put forth a detailed safety proposal which entailed the establishment of independent inspections of garment factories. The plan called for inspectors to have the power to close unsafe factories. The proposal entailed a legally binding contract between suppliers, customers and unions. At a meeting in 2011 in Dhaka, major European and North American retailers, including Gap, rejected the proposal. Further efforts by unions to advance the proposal after numerous and deadly factory fires have been rejected.[57] After the 2013 Savar building collapse, Kohl's became a founding member of the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety.
On February 19, 2014, Glenn Murphy, CEO of Gap Inc., announced Gap will raise the minimum wages for its 65,000 U.S. store employees.[58]

The Gap, Inc.,[6] commonly known as Gap Inc. or Gap, (stylized as GAP) is an American worldwide clothing and accessories retailer.
It was founded in 1969 by Donald Fisher and Doris F. Fisher and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. The company operates five primary divisions: the namesake banner, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Intermix, and Athleta. Gap Inc. is the largest specialty retailer in the United States, and is 3rd in total international locations, behind Inditex Group and H&M.[7] As of September 2008, the company has approximately 135,000 employees and operates 3,727 stores worldwide, of which 2,406 are located in the U.S.[8]
The Fisher family remains deeply involved in the company, collectively owning much of its stock.[9] Donald Fisher served as Chairman of the Board until 2004, playing a role in the ouster of then-CEO Millard Drexler in 2002, and remained on the board until his death on September 27, 2009. Fisher's wife and their son, Robert J. Fisher, also serve on Gap's board of directors. Robert succeeded his father as chairman in 2004 and also served as CEO on an interim basis following the resignation of Paul Pressler in 2007, before being succeeded by Glenn K. Murphy up until 2014. On February 1, 2015, Art Peck took over as CEO.[10]

History[edit]
Donald and Doris Fisher, who had a difficult time finding jeans that fit, opened the first Gap store on Ocean Avenue in San Francisco on August 21, 1969; its merchandise consisted of Levi's and LP records.[11] They had raised US$63,000 to open the store,[12] and reached US$2 million in sales in the second full year of operation. In 1970, Gap opened its second store in San Jose, California; its back room serves as the company's first replenishment warehouse. In 1971, Gap established its corporate headquarters in Burlingame, California with four employees. By 1973, the company had over 25 locations and had expanded into the East Coast market with a store in the Echelon Mall in Voorhees, New Jersey. In 1974, Gap began to sell private-label merchandise.
In the 1990s, Gap assumed an upscale identity and revamped its inventory under the direction of Millard Drexler.[13] However, Drexler was removed from his position after 19 years of service in 2002 after over-expansion, a 29-month slump in sales, and tensions with the Fisher family. Drexler refused to sign a non-compete agreement and eventually became CEO of J. Crew. One month after his departure, merchandise that he had ordered was responsible for a strong rebound in sales.[14][15][16] Robert J. Fisher recruited Paul Pressler as the new CEO; he was credited with closing under-performing locations and paying off debt. However, his focus groups failed to recover the company's leadership in its market.
In 2007, Gap announced that it would "focus [its] efforts on recruiting a chief executive officer who has deep retailing and merchandising experience ideally in apparel, understands the creative process and can effectively execute strategies in large, complex environments while maintaining strong financial discipline". That January, Pressler resigned after two disappointing holiday sales seasons and was succeeded by Robert J. Fisher on an interim basis.[17][18][19] He began working with the company in 1980 and joined the board in 1990, and would later assume several senior executive positions, including president of Banana Republic and the Gap units.[20] The board's search committee was led by Adrian Bellamy, chairman of The Body Shop International and included founder Donald Fisher. On February 2, Marka Hansen, the former head of the Banana Republic division, replaced Cynthia Harriss as the leader of the Gap division. The executive president for marketing and merchandising Jack Calhoun became interim president of Banana Republic.[21] In May, Old Navy laid off approximately 300 managers in lower volume locations to help streamline costs. That July, Glenn Murphy, previously CEO of Shoppers Drug Mart in Canada, was announced as the new CEO of Gap, Inc. New lead designers were also brought on board to help define a fashionable image, including Patrick Robinson for Gap Adult, Simon Kneen for Banana Republic, and Todd Oldham for Old Navy. Robinson was hired as chief designer in 2007, but was dismissed in May 2011 after sales failed to increase. However, he enjoyed commercial success in international markets.[22][23][24]
In October 2011, Gap Inc. announced plans to close 189 US stores, nearly 21 percent, by the end of 2013; however, it also plans to expand its presence in China.[25][26] The company announced it would open its first stores in Brazil in the Fall of 2013.[27]
In January 2015, Gap Inc announced plans to close their subsidiary Piperlime in order to focus on their core brands. The first and only Piperlime store, based in SoHo, New York City, closed in April.[28]
Corporate identity[edit]
Logo[edit]
Gap Inc. owns a trademark to its name, "Gap". The Gap's original trademark was a service mark for retail clothing store services. The application was filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on February 29, 1972, by The Gap Stores; registration was granted on October 10, 1972. The first use of the trademark was on August 23, 1969, and expanded to commercial usage on October 17, 1969. A second application was filed by Gap Stores, Inc. on September 12, 1974, this time for a trademark filed for shirts. The first usage for shirts and clothing products was on June 25, 1974. Trademark registration was granted on December 28, 1976. Both the service mark and trademark are registered and owned by Gap (Apparel), LLC of San Francisco, California.
On October 4, 2010, in an effort to establish a contemporary presence, Gap introduced a new logo. It was designed with the Helvetica font and reduced the prominence of the brand's iconic blue box. After much public outcry, the company reverted to its previous "blue box" logo on October 12, after less than a week in use.[29][30] Marka Hansen, the executive who oversaw the logo change, resigned February 1, 2011.[31]

Brands[edit]
Banana Republic, a small safari-themed clothing retailer, was purchased by Gap in 1983 and was rebranded as an upscale clothing retailer in the late 1980s. Old Navy was launched in 1994 as a value chain with a specialty flair. Forth & Towne, the company's fourth traditional retail concept, was launched on August 24, 2005, featuring apparel targeted toward women 35 years and older.[32] On February 26, 2007, after an 18-month trial period, it was discontinued, and the 19 stores were closed.[33] A fifth brand, the online clothing and accessories retailer Piperlime, was created in 2006; however, as of April 2015, the brand has been retired.[34] A sixth brand, Athleta, a women's athletic wear line, was added in 2009.[35] Intermix, a multi-brand fashion retailer founded in 1993, was acquired by Gap Inc. in 2012.[36]

Marketing[edit]




A Gap location in Westfield Valley Fair, San Jose, CA.


The Gap originally targeted the younger generation when it opened, with its name referring to the generation gap of the time.[38] It originally sold everything that Levi Strauss & Co made in every style, size, and color, and organized the stock by size. The Gap was the first of many shops that carried only Levi's. In 1973, Gap started making their own jeans as a way to differentiate themselves from department stores.[39] Gap's current marketing works to appeal to a broad demographic of customers, whereas Banana Republic presents a sophisticated image and Old Navy focuses "fun, fashion, and value" for families and younger customers. While the company has been criticized for blandness and uniformity in its selling environments, it maintains that it tailors its stores "to appeal to unique markets" by developing multiple formats and designs.[40] The domain www.gap.com attracts over 18 million visitors annually, according to a 2008 Compete.com survey.[41] The brand is being criticized in the UK because the merchandise that is offered to the UK customers cost double the prices (or even a direct $/£ swap) found in the United States. Gap also does not offer XXL or larger sizes in the UK stating the UK market does not require them in contrast to market leader NEXT who offer a variety of larger sizes in the UK.
International presence[edit]




Gap in Hillcrest Mall


Gap operates company-owned stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Indonesia, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Mexico as of May 2016; it also has franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap, Banana Republic, or Old Navy stores in 43 countries.[42] As of May 2016, Gap Inc. operates 3,727 company-owned and franchise locations.[43] In January 2008, Gap signed a deal with Marinopoulos Group to open Gap and Banana Republic stores in Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Cyprus, and Croatia.[44] In February 2009, Elbit Imaging, Ltd. secured a franchise to open and operate Gap and Banana Republic stores in Israel.[45] In August 2010, the company opened its first store in Melbourne, Australia at Chadstone Shopping Centre.[citation needed] In September 2011, Komax opened the first Gap store in Chile, due to a franchise.[46] In October 2011, the first GAP store opened in Warsaw, Poland,[47] but shut it down and two other locations in Wrocław and Katowice in 2015. Gap now has a store in New Delhi, India which opened in May 2015. On 20 February 2016, Gap launched stores in Mumbai at Oberoi Mall and Infinity-2.
In May 2016, Gap Inc. announced it would shutter all Old Navy stores in Japan in response to poor Q1 performance for Old Navy and consistent losses across the organization.[48]
In 2017, Gap closed all its stores in Israel.
Product Red[edit]

In 2006, Gap took part in the Product Red campaign with the launch of a special RED collection, including a T-shirt manufactured in Lesotho from African cotton. The expanded Gap Product Red collection was released on October 13, 2006. 50 to 100 percent of the profits went to the Global Fund, depending on the item.[49] The company continued the products into 2007, especially in the lead up to Valentine's Day, using slogans such as "Admi(RED)" and "Desi(RED)." National Labor Committee for Worker and Human Rights activists criticized Gap's partnerships because Gap has historically been accused of sweatshop-like conditions.[50] Product Red has contributed over $45 million to the Global Fund, more than any other private donation received to date. Other launch partners included American Express, Apple Inc., Converse, Hallmark, Emporio Armani, and Motorola.
Labour controversies[edit]
In 2003, a class action lawsuit against Gap and 21 other companies alleged that sweatshop workers in Saipan were not paid for overtime work, were subjected to forced abortion, and were required to work in unsafe working conditions.[51] A settlement of 20 million dollars was reached whereby The Gap did not admit liability.[52]
In 2007, Ethisphere Magazine chose Gap from among thousands of companies evaluated as one of 100 "World's Most Ethical Companies."[53] In May 2006, adult and child employees of Western, a supplier in Jordan, were found to have worked up to 109 hours per week and to have gone six months without being paid. Some employees claimed they had been raped by managers.[54] Most of these allegations were directed at Wal-Mart (who mostly ignored the claims), while Gap immediately looked into the matter to remedy the situation.[54][not in citation given]
On October 28, 2007, BBC footage showed child labor in Indian Gap factories.[55] The company denied knowledge of the happenings; it subsequently removed and destroyed the single piece of clothing in question, a smock blouse, from a British store. Gap promised to investigate breaches in its ethical policy.[56]
Bangladeshi and international labor groups in 2011 put forth a detailed safety proposal which entailed the establishment of independent inspections of garment factories. The plan called for inspectors to have the power to close unsafe factories. The proposal entailed a legally binding contract between suppliers, customers and unions. At a meeting in 2011 in Dhaka, major European and North American retailers, including Gap, rejected the proposal. Further efforts by unions to advance the proposal after numerous and deadly factory fires have been rejected.[57] After the 2013 Savar building collapse, Kohl's became a founding member of the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety.
On February 19, 2014, Glenn Murphy, CEO of Gap Inc., announced Gap will raise the minimum wages for its 65,000 U.S. store employees.[58]

The Gap, Inc.,[6] commonly known as Gap Inc. or Gap, (stylized as GAP) is an American worldwide clothing and accessories retailer.
It was founded in 1969 by Donald Fisher and Doris F. Fisher and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. The company operates five primary divisions: the namesake banner, Banana Republic, Old Navy, Intermix, and Athleta. Gap Inc. is the largest specialty retailer in the United States, and is 3rd in total international locations, behind Inditex Group and H&M.[7] As of September 2008, the company has approximately 135,000 employees and operates 3,727 stores worldwide, of which 2,406 are located in the U.S.[8]
The Fisher family remains deeply involved in the company, collectively owning much of its stock.[9] Donald Fisher served as Chairman of the Board until 2004, playing a role in the ouster of then-CEO Millard Drexler in 2002, and remained on the board until his death on September 27, 2009. Fisher's wife and their son, Robert J. Fisher, also serve on Gap's board of directors. Robert succeeded his father as chairman in 2004 and also served as CEO on an interim basis following the resignation of Paul Pressler in 2007, before being succeeded by Glenn K. Murphy up until 2014. On February 1, 2015, Art Peck took over as CEO.[10]

History[edit]
Donald and Doris Fisher, who had a difficult time finding jeans that fit, opened the first Gap store on Ocean Avenue in San Francisco on August 21, 1969; its merchandise consisted of Levi's and LP records.[11] They had raised US$63,000 to open the store,[12] and reached US$2 million in sales in the second full year of operation. In 1970, Gap opened its second store in San Jose, California; its back room serves as the company's first replenishment warehouse. In 1971, Gap established its corporate headquarters in Burlingame, California with four employees. By 1973, the company had over 25 locations and had expanded into the East Coast market with a store in the Echelon Mall in Voorhees, New Jersey. In 1974, Gap began to sell private-label merchandise.
In the 1990s, Gap assumed an upscale identity and revamped its inventory under the direction of Millard Drexler.[13] However, Drexler was removed from his position after 19 years of service in 2002 after over-expansion, a 29-month slump in sales, and tensions with the Fisher family. Drexler refused to sign a non-compete agreement and eventually became CEO of J. Crew. One month after his departure, merchandise that he had ordered was responsible for a strong rebound in sales.[14][15][16] Robert J. Fisher recruited Paul Pressler as the new CEO; he was credited with closing under-performing locations and paying off debt. However, his focus groups failed to recover the company's leadership in its market.
In 2007, Gap announced that it would "focus [its] efforts on recruiting a chief executive officer who has deep retailing and merchandising experience ideally in apparel, understands the creative process and can effectively execute strategies in large, complex environments while maintaining strong financial discipline". That January, Pressler resigned after two disappointing holiday sales seasons and was succeeded by Robert J. Fisher on an interim basis.[17][18][19] He began working with the company in 1980 and joined the board in 1990, and would later assume several senior executive positions, including president of Banana Republic and the Gap units.[20] The board's search committee was led by Adrian Bellamy, chairman of The Body Shop International and included founder Donald Fisher. On February 2, Marka Hansen, the former head of the Banana Republic division, replaced Cynthia Harriss as the leader of the Gap division. The executive president for marketing and merchandising Jack Calhoun became interim president of Banana Republic.[21] In May, Old Navy laid off approximately 300 managers in lower volume locations to help streamline costs. That July, Glenn Murphy, previously CEO of Shoppers Drug Mart in Canada, was announced as the new CEO of Gap, Inc. New lead designers were also brought on board to help define a fashionable image, including Patrick Robinson for Gap Adult, Simon Kneen for Banana Republic, and Todd Oldham for Old Navy. Robinson was hired as chief designer in 2007, but was dismissed in May 2011 after sales failed to increase. However, he enjoyed commercial success in international markets.[22][23][24]
In October 2011, Gap Inc. announced plans to close 189 US stores, nearly 21 percent, by the end of 2013; however, it also plans to expand its presence in China.[25][26] The company announced it would open its first stores in Brazil in the Fall of 2013.[27]
In January 2015, Gap Inc announced plans to close their subsidiary Piperlime in order to focus on their core brands. The first and only Piperlime store, based in SoHo, New York City, closed in April.[28]
Corporate identity[edit]
Logo[edit]
Gap Inc. owns a trademark to its name, "Gap". The Gap's original trademark was a service mark for retail clothing store services. The application was filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office on February 29, 1972, by The Gap Stores; registration was granted on October 10, 1972. The first use of the trademark was on August 23, 1969, and expanded to commercial usage on October 17, 1969. A second application was filed by Gap Stores, Inc. on September 12, 1974, this time for a trademark filed for shirts. The first usage for shirts and clothing products was on June 25, 1974. Trademark registration was granted on December 28, 1976. Both the service mark and trademark are registered and owned by Gap (Apparel), LLC of San Francisco, California.
On October 4, 2010, in an effort to establish a contemporary presence, Gap introduced a new logo. It was designed with the Helvetica font and reduced the prominence of the brand's iconic blue box. After much public outcry, the company reverted to its previous "blue box" logo on October 12, after less than a week in use.[29][30] Marka Hansen, the executive who oversaw the logo change, resigned February 1, 2011.[31]

Brands[edit]
Banana Republic, a small safari-themed clothing retailer, was purchased by Gap in 1983 and was rebranded as an upscale clothing retailer in the late 1980s. Old Navy was launched in 1994 as a value chain with a specialty flair. Forth & Towne, the company's fourth traditional retail concept, was launched on August 24, 2005, featuring apparel targeted toward women 35 years and older.[32] On February 26, 2007, after an 18-month trial period, it was discontinued, and the 19 stores were closed.[33] A fifth brand, the online clothing and accessories retailer Piperlime, was created in 2006; however, as of April 2015, the brand has been retired.[34] A sixth brand, Athleta, a women's athletic wear line, was added in 2009.[35] Intermix, a multi-brand fashion retailer founded in 1993, was acquired by Gap Inc. in 2012.[36]

Marketing[edit]




A Gap location in Westfield Valley Fair, San Jose, CA.


The Gap originally targeted the younger generation when it opened, with its name referring to the generation gap of the time.[38] It originally sold everything that Levi Strauss & Co made in every style, size, and color, and organized the stock by size. The Gap was the first of many shops that carried only Levi's. In 1973, Gap started making their own jeans as a way to differentiate themselves from department stores.[39] Gap's current marketing works to appeal to a broad demographic of customers, whereas Banana Republic presents a sophisticated image and Old Navy focuses "fun, fashion, and value" for families and younger customers. While the company has been criticized for blandness and uniformity in its selling environments, it maintains that it tailors its stores "to appeal to unique markets" by developing multiple formats and designs.[40] The domain www.gap.com attracts over 18 million visitors annually, according to a 2008 Compete.com survey.[41] The brand is being criticized in the UK because the merchandise that is offered to the UK customers cost double the prices (or even a direct $/£ swap) found in the United States. Gap also does not offer XXL or larger sizes in the UK stating the UK market does not require them in contrast to market leader NEXT who offer a variety of larger sizes in the UK.
International presence[edit]




Gap in Hillcrest Mall


Gap operates company-owned stores in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Italy, Indonesia, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Mexico as of May 2016; it also has franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate Gap, Banana Republic, or Old Navy stores in 43 countries.[42] As of May 2016, Gap Inc. operates 3,727 company-owned and franchise locations.[43] In January 2008, Gap signed a deal with Marinopoulos Group to open Gap and Banana Republic stores in Greece, Romania, Bulgaria, Cyprus, and Croatia.[44] In February 2009, Elbit Imaging, Ltd. secured a franchise to open and operate Gap and Banana Republic stores in Israel.[45] In August 2010, the company opened its first store in Melbourne, Australia at Chadstone Shopping Centre.[citation needed] In September 2011, Komax opened the first Gap store in Chile, due to a franchise.[46] In October 2011, the first GAP store opened in Warsaw, Poland,[47] but shut it down and two other locations in Wrocław and Katowice in 2015. Gap now has a store in New Delhi, India which opened in May 2015. On 20 February 2016, Gap launched stores in Mumbai at Oberoi Mall and Infinity-2.
In May 2016, Gap Inc. announced it would shutter all Old Navy stores in Japan in response to poor Q1 performance for Old Navy and consistent losses across the organization.[48]
In 2017, Gap closed all its stores in Israel.
Product Red[edit]

In 2006, Gap took part in the Product Red campaign with the launch of a special RED collection, including a T-shirt manufactured in Lesotho from African cotton. The expanded Gap Product Red collection was released on October 13, 2006. 50 to 100 percent of the profits went to the Global Fund, depending on the item.[49] The company continued the products into 2007, especially in the lead up to Valentine's Day, using slogans such as "Admi(RED)" and "Desi(RED)." National Labor Committee for Worker and Human Rights activists criticized Gap's partnerships because Gap has historically been accused of sweatshop-like conditions.[50] Product Red has contributed over $45 million to the Global Fund, more than any other private donation received to date. Other launch partners included American Express, Apple Inc., Converse, Hallmark, Emporio Armani, and Motorola.
Labour controversies[edit]
In 2003, a class action lawsuit against Gap and 21 other companies alleged that sweatshop workers in Saipan were not paid for overtime work, were subjected to forced abortion, and were required to work in unsafe working conditions.[51] A settlement of 20 million dollars was reached whereby The Gap did not admit liability.[52]
In 2007, Ethisphere Magazine chose Gap from among thousands of companies evaluated as one of 100 "World's Most Ethical Companies."[53] In May 2006, adult and child employees of Western, a supplier in Jordan, were found to have worked up to 109 hours per week and to have gone six months without being paid. Some employees claimed they had been raped by managers.[54] Most of these allegations were directed at Wal-Mart (who mostly ignored the claims), while Gap immediately looked into the matter to remedy the situation.[54][not in citation given]
On October 28, 2007, BBC footage showed child labor in Indian Gap factories.[55] The company denied knowledge of the happenings; it subsequently removed and destroyed the single piece of clothing in question, a smock blouse, from a British store. Gap promised to investigate breaches in its ethical policy.[56]
Bangladeshi and international labor groups in 2011 put forth a detailed safety proposal which entailed the establishment of independent inspections of garment factories. The plan called for inspectors to have the power to close unsafe factories. The proposal entailed a legally binding contract between suppliers, customers and unions. At a meeting in 2011 in Dhaka, major European and North American retailers, including Gap, rejected the proposal. Further efforts by unions to advance the proposal after numerous and deadly factory fires have been rejected.[57] After the 2013 Savar building collapse, Kohl's became a founding member of the Alliance for Bangladesh Worker Safety.
On February 19, 2014, Glenn Murphy, CEO of Gap Inc., announced Gap will raise the minimum wages for its 65,000 U.S. store employees.[58]

GAP INTRODUCES INSPIRATIONAL MARKETING CAMPAIGN TO CELEBRATE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF GLOBAL LAUNCH OF GAP (PRODUCT) RED


Anne Hathaway, John Legend and Wyclef Jean join Terrence Howard, Natalie Maines and Abigail Breslin to help launch the new (2 WEEKS) T-Shirt and latest  Gap (PRODUCT) RED collections



 SAN FRANCISCO – Oct. 3, 2007 – Gap is proud to introduce  its latest marketing campaign for (PRODUCT) RED, a for-benefit brand designed  to help eliminate AIDS in Africa. Captured by acclaimed photographer Annie  Leibovitz and featuring a diverse cast of socially-conscious celebrities, the  new campaign underscores the idea that it is possible for an individual to  change the world.    “Since launching last year, (PRODUCT) RED has contributed more than $45  million to the Global Fund to finance programs that help women and children  affected by HIV/AIDS in Africa,” said Marka Hansen, president of Gap Brand  North America. “Gap is honored to be a partner of (PRODUCT) RED and we’re  excited to continue creating special, limited edition collections that help  raise awareness of the epidemics facing Africa, while inspiring people to make  a difference in the lives of others.”    Built around a theme of change, Gap’s latest print campaign features  celebrities photographed as individuals or together with special friends and  loved ones. Each individual in the campaign wears a Gap (PRODUCT) RED item in  a way that expresses their own personal style. Thought-provoking questions,  such as “Can the shirt off your back change the world?” and “Can the next  generation change the world?” accompany the images, helping capture the  emotion and power of the individuals in the campaign. Three new celebrities  appear in the campaign – actress Anne Hathaway; Grammy Award-winning artist  John Legend surrounded by the African Children’s Choir; and Grammy  Award-winning musician and producer Wyclef Jean embracing his daughter  Angelina. The campaign also reintroduces a series of images that debuted this  summer of Terrence Howard and his three children Hunter, Aubrey and Heaven;  Natalie Maines alongside her sons Beckett and Slade; and Abigail Breslin with  her friend Curious George.    Developed by Laird + Partners, Gap’s creative agency, the print campaign is  running in November issues of magazines including Vogue, Vanity Fair, Harper’s  Bazaar, Elle, Glamour, Lucky, Marie Claire, GQ and Details. The campaign will  also appear in the The New York Times and weekly magazines including US  Weekly, Rolling Stone and Entertainment Weekly. In addition, the campaign will  be featured in Gap stores, online, and outdoor in select markets.    As part of Gap’s partnership with (PRODUCT) RED, half the profits from Gap’s  sales of Gap (PRODUCT) RED collections go directly to the Global Fund to help  finance AIDS programs in Africa with a focus on women and children. This  month, Gap will introduce the (2 WEEKS) T-shirt, a limited edition T-shirt  featuring a compelling message about the direct impact that contributions from  the sale of this T-shirt will make to the Global Fund. These funds will  support programs which provide HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment in  Africa. Contributions from the sale of the (2 WEEKS) T-shirt are equivalent to  the average cost of 2 weeks of antiretroviral (ARV) medicine in Africa which,  along with appropriate nutrition and care, enables people living with HIV to  lead healthy, normal lives. To celebrate the debut of this special item,  Gap’s new ad campaign features Anne Hathaway and John Legend wearing the (2  WEEKS) T-shirt. The T-shirt will be available at gap.com beginning Oct. 5 and  will be available in select Gap stores nationwide later this month.    One year ago, Gap introduced its first (PRODUCT) RED collection for men and  women comprised of items rooted in classic Gap product categories such as  T-shirts, hoodies, jeans and accessories. Earlier this year, babyGap and  GapKids introduced (PRODUCT) RED collections made especially for babies and  kids including bodysuits for babies with playful “(RED)” words like  DELIVE(RED) and DIAPE(RED), and T-shirts with kid-inspired graphics and  embellishments. All of these items are branded Gap (PRODUCT) RED and feature  subtle, distinct details inspired by (RED).    About Gap Inc.

About (RED)™ and (PRODUCT) RED(RED)’s primary objective  is to engage the private sector in raising awareness and funds for the Global  Fund, to help fight AIDS in Africa.

Current partners are: American Express (U.K. only), Apple, Converse, Gap,  Emporio Armani, and Motorola. MySpace.com is the first media sponsor in the  United Kingdom and MTV Networks is the first media sponsor in the US.    Since its launch in the spring of 2006, (RED) has contributed more than $45  million to the Global Fund. (RED) money is already at work in Swaziland,  Rwanda and Ghana and has already helped provide more than three hundred  thousand HIV positive mothers with the treatment needed to help ensure that  their children are born healthy and helped put more than 30,000 people on  lifesaving antiretroviral medicine.

Gap Inc. Announces Strategic Initiatives to Increase Productivity and Profitability of Namesake Brand


Fleet Optimization to Better Reflect How Customers Shop; Headquarter Workforce Reduction to Speed Decision Making



SAN FRANCISCO – June 15, 2015 – Gap Inc. (NYSE: GPS) today announced a series of strategic actions to position Gap brand for improved business performance and build for the future. Following a thorough evaluation of its business and operations, Gap plans to right-size its specialty store fleet and streamline its headquarter workforce, primarily in North America, as part of the comprehensive effort to deliver more consistent and compelling product collections and engage customers across all channels.
“Returning Gap brand to growth has been the top priority since my appointment four months ago – and Jeff and his team bring a sense of urgency to this work,” said Art Peck, Gap Inc. chief executive officer. “Customers are rapidly changing how they shop today, and these moves will help get Gap back to where we know it deserves to be in the eyes of consumers.”
In order to drive productivity improvements and showcase the brand in the most successful locations, Gap will close about 175 specialty stores in North America over the next few years, with about 140 closures occurring this fiscal year. These changes will not impact Gap Outlet and Gap Factory Stores. In parallel with these moves, the brand will close a limited number of European stores during this period.
Following the fleet optimization effort, the brand will continue to serve North American customers through about 800 Gap stores – comprised of 500 Gap specialty locations and 300 Gap outlet stores – as well as its dynamic online channels, better reflecting the way today’s customers shop across specialty, outlet and online. The brand will continue to have a robust global presence in more than 50 countries and with about 1,600 company-operated and franchise locations globally.
“Our customers and employees want Gap to win,” said Jeff Kirwan, global president for Gap. “We’re focused on offering consistent, on-brand product collections and enhancing the customer experience across all of our channels, including a smaller, more vibrant fleet of stores."
Since Kirwan was appointed to lead Gap in December 2014, he’s rebuilt the leadership team and implemented an aggressive agenda designed to strengthen the brand and successfully compete on the global stage. The team is driving towards a clear, on-brand product aesthetic framework focused on optimistic and elevated American style, while also rebuilding the brand’s product operating model to increase speed, predictability and responsiveness, and enable greater competitiveness.
To speed decision making and responsiveness, Kirwan also announced decisions meant to align Gap’s organization in support of its new product operating model. This will result in the reduction of the brand’s headquarter workforce, primarily in North America, by approximately 250 roles during fiscal year 2015.
Kirwan added, “These decisions are very difficult, knowing they will affect a number of our valued employees, but we are confident they are necessary to help create a winning future for our employees, our customers and our shareholders.”
The company estimates an annualized sales loss of approximately $300 million associated with the store closures. Additionally, the company estimates one-time costs primarily associated with these actions to be in the range of approximately $140 million to $160 million, of which about $55 million to $75 million is non-cash. These costs are expected to be recognized primarily in the second quarter of fiscal year 2015 and include lease buyouts, asset impairments primarily related to the Gap fleet, inventory and fabric write-offs, and employee related costs associated with organizational changes.
The company estimates annualized savings from these actions to be approximately $25 million, beginning in 2016.
Excluding the estimated pre-tax costs of $140 million to $160 million referenced above, or approximately $0.21 to $0.24 per diluted share, the company is reaffirming its guidance for fiscal year 2015 to be in the range of $2.75 to $2.80. This guidance is provided to enhance visibility into the company’s expectations regarding its ongoing business excluding the Gap brand optimization effort.
Gap Inc. Investor Meeting
The company will outline its business priorities at an investor meeting on Tuesday, June 16 at its headquarters in San Francisco. A live webcast of the presentations will take place from approximately 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. Pacific Time and will be accessible on Gap Inc.’s Financial News and Events page at www.gapinc.com/investors. In addition, audio of this meeting can be accessed by calling 1-855-5000-GPS or 855-500-0477 for domestic callers and 913-643-0954 for international callers. The conference passcode is 9911599. A replay of the event will be available on www.gapinc.com.
Forward-Looking Statements
This press release contains forward-looking statements within the “safe harbor” provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All statements other than those that are purely historical are forward-looking statements. Words such as “expect,” “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “intend,” “plan,” “project,” and similar expressions also identify forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements include statements regarding the following:

improving business performance;
driving productivity improvements;
number of future Gap brand stores, and number of Gap brand store closures;
rebuilding Gap brand’s product operating model;
workforce reductions;
financial impact of store closures and workforce reductions, including sales impact, annualized savings, and the amount, type, and timing of expected one-time costs; and
earnings per share for fiscal year 2015.

Because these forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, there are important factors that could cause the company’s actual results to differ materially from those in the forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, the following:

the risk that the company or its franchisees will be unsuccessful in gauging apparel trends and changing consumer preferences;
the risk that changes in global economic conditions or consumer spending patterns could adversely impact the company’s results of operations;
the highly competitive nature of the company’s business in the United States and internationally;
the risk that if the company is unable to manage its inventory effectively, its gross margins will be adversely affected;
the risks to the company’s business, including its costs and supply chain, associated with global sourcing and manufacturing;
the risks to the company’s reputation or operations associated with importing merchandise from foreign countries, including failure of the company’s vendors to adhere to its Code of Vendor Conduct;
the risk that trade matters could increase the cost or reduce the supply of apparel available to the company and adversely affect its business, financial condition, and results of operations;
the risk that the company’s franchisees’ operation of franchise stores is not directly within the company’s control and could impair the value of its brands;
 the risk that the company will be unsuccessful in renewing, modifying, or terminating leases for existing store locations effectively;
the risk that the company is subject to data or other security breaches that may result in increased costs, violations of law, significant legal and financial exposure, and a loss of confidence in the company’s security measures, which could have an adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and reputation;
the risk that the failure to attract and retain key personnel, or effectively manage succession, could have an adverse impact on the company’s results of operations;
the risk that the company’s investments in omni-channel shopping initiatives may not deliver the results the company anticipates;
the risk that comparable sales and margins will experience fluctuations;
the risk that updates or changes to the company’s information technology (“IT”) systems may disrupt its operations;
the risk that natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, or other catastrophic events could adversely affect the company’s operations and financial results, or those of its franchisees or vendors;
the risk that changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape could adversely affect the company’s financial condition, strategies, and results of operations;
the risk that the company does not repurchase some or all of the shares it anticipates purchasing pursuant to its repurchase program; and
the risk that the company will not be successful in defending various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, claims, and audits.

Additional information regarding factors that could cause results to differ can be found in the company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 31, 2015, as well as the company’s subsequent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
These forward-looking statements are based on information as of June 15, 2015. The company assumes no obligation to publicly update or revise its forward-looking statements even if experience or future changes make it clear that any projected results expressed or implied therein will not be realized.

 GLOBAL GAP YEAR PROGRAM REVIEWS





Shawn Childs
Global Gap Year 2010








“I felt much more prepared and invested in my college courses than many of my peers. TBB taught me to take an active role in my education and to be an advocate for myself. I was able to relate to the information on a much more practical, realistic level. I sought out classes that had a reputation for being more focused on student-involvement and steered away from larger, lecture style-courses. This is a bit of advice that I would pass on to anyone entering college as it’s by far the best way to feel comfortable with and fully understand the relevance of the information being taught, as well as becoming more confident in yourself.”



Janet Childs, Mother of Shawn
Global Gap Year 2010

“Shawn’s priorities in college are much more focused than most college freshmen’s. She met with advisors repeatedly to pinpoint the most efficient path to achieving her major and minors all within 3 1/2 years.”

Gap's New Retail Approach and How It's Affecting Sales


In light of changing buyer expectations and behaviors (as well as a shifting global economy), Gap has made deliberate moves towards a radically different retail strategy.

Not long ago, Gap and its related retailers were among the most popular destinations for back-to-school shoppers. With apparel and accessory options at various price points for all age groups, the classic brand once enjoyed spiked sales and soaring profits during the late summer and early fall.However, Gap's most recent sales numbers appear to show a shift away from its favored status in the hearts (and wallets) of shoppers. Although the company aggressively advertised and discounted throughout back-to-school season, sales remained stagnant. The lone bright spot during the month was the "positive momentum" gained by its Old Navy stores.Recent changes to Gap, Inc.'s retail strategy are raising the question of whether the brand is making the right choices to remain competitive. Could its August sales slump be an indicator of more bad news to come?What Has Been Changing at Gap, Inc.? The company's multi-pronged approach shows several deviations from its previous approach, including:Expansion in Asia. The growing apparel markets in the East have attracted the retailer, which is set to open 40 stores in India and 110 in China over the next year. Rising incomes and massive populations in the region make it an area of enormous potential for Gap and its related lifestyle brands.Acquisition of new brands. Shoppers have been familiar with Gap brands Banana Republic and Old Navy for years, but the company has continued to acquire new online and virtual brands, such as Piperlime, Athleta, and Intermix. This has diversified its offerings as well as its target audiences.Fewer brick and mortars. In 2011, Gap closed the doors to 21% of its stores in the United States. At the time, the retailer cited higher efficiency and profit margins as the objective for its store closings.Online sales focus. At the same time, Gap has been placing a greater emphasis on sales through Gap.com, which also conveniently links to its other brands for a seamless and all-encompassing shopping experience for its brand enthusiasts. Although these tactics have met with varying levels of success, their impact on the brand's long-term growth and global reputation will continue to unfold over the next several years. This will certainly serve as a lesson to its competitors as they formulate their global strategies, both virtually and online. How Balancing Physical & Virtual Locations Helps Companies When companies like Gap operate brick and mortar retail establishments in addition to ecommerce websites, the balancing act between the two can be a challenge. However, when businesses achieve this, it yields a number of benefits to the corporation and its customers alike, including:Personal connections. The ability to walk into a store, try on clothes, and talk with retail associates is something many shoppers value. When too few physical stores remain within an individual's area, he or she may choose companies with a stronger brick and mortar presence.Touch points. Brands that meet their customers wherever they are stand the best chance of remaining competitive in a multidimensional economy. Those unlikely to visit a mall or shopping center may be more apt to make a purchase from an online retailer, while online advertising and sales efforts may be lost on those preferring a more traditional shopping experience.Purchasing options. Online and in-store shopping each present their own advantages and disadvantages, which may apply to the same shoppers at different times during the same day, month, or week. Someone who needs a new outfit the next day can't afford to wait for a purchase to ship, whereas someone with a busy work schedule may be unable to walk into a store during its business hours. In addition, an online purchase remains impossible for those seeking to pay with cash.When providing online and in-store shopping options, one of the most important components of the retail experience is the point of sale. A business offering a wide range of payment options and making the process as quick and uncomplicated as possible will enjoy the highest numbers of converted and returning customers.One way to achieve this is by utilizing high-quality point-of-sale systems. Businesses of all sizes can accept a wide range of payment types with new mobile payment options such as Square and PayPal, which attach directly to one's mobile device and allow them to complete transactions anywhere they travel. For online businesses, comprehensive POS systems such as Shopify make completing purchases an attractive prospect for customers.For Gap and other retailers combining brick and mortar and ecommerce locations, it is crucial to make every aspect of the customer's experience more convenient, enjoyable, and memorable. With a balanced, versatile, and streamlined approach to business, brands of all sizes can achieve sustained growth in their chosen markets.Do you think Gap, Inc.'s recent business strategies will ultimately help or harm the brand?

By offering immersion opportunities in local communities around the globe, Global Gap offers a unique way to explore new places, learn about important global issues and help out on worthwhile volunteer projects.
The Global Gap program is designed for high school graduates taking a year off before university. The program consists of a four week orientation and Care program in Ghana, followed by one-to-two month programs in each of South Africa, Peru, Nepal and Thailand. In each of these countries, volunteers will work closely with our local staff members on projects that lend insight into important issues in developing countries like housing, education, environmental conservation, and human rights.
The Global Gap program is tailored for a maximum of 15 volunteers and minimum of 5. The agenda is:

Volunteer Profile 
Kayla Lehne
 5 countries, 6 incredible people and 8 unforgettable months, I can't believe this year has come to a close. I've learned more about myself and the greater world in the last eight months than I would have ever imagined. And I wanted to thank everyone who has given me so much love and support, personally and financially, along the way because I wouldn't be in this place without you. And for the memories and lessons that I have learned I cannot express my gratitude. Read more... 



Choose a Global Gap Year stage:





Ghana

Stage 1: Orientation and Care Work  All Global Gap participants meet in Accra, Ghana for a one week orientation. Then they spend an additional three weeks in Akuapem Hills, North of Accra, working on a Care placement.




South Africa

Stage 2: Building & Choice of Project  Twice the size of Texas, South Africa's position at the southern tip of Africa has created a diversity of lifestyles and environments. At the start of the 21st century, South Africa is leading the way in African politics and is seen as an inspiration to other countries. With eleven national languages and a variety of religions South Africa truly is the 'Rainbow Nation'.




Peru

Stage 3: Education  Peru is a fascinating and beautiful country with an extensive Pacific coastline, a vast area of Amazon rainforest and the magnificent Andes. Peru provides an opportunity for volunteers to experience much of what South America offers within just one country.






Nepal

Stage 4: Choice of Project  Nepal is a small yet stunning land of snow-capped mountains, majestic Buddhist temples, and the ancient capital city of Kathmandu. Although Nepal is known for the Himalayas and Mount Everest, it is actually one of the most bio-diverse countries on the planet.




Thailand

Stage 5:Conservation
 Thailand is a great introduction to South East Asia. It's a beautiful country with pristine beaches, exotic food and golden temples. However, anyone doing international volunteer work in Thailand will go beyond the country that tourists see and discover an incredibly friendly people with a unique culture.

Volunteer & Intern Abroad Projects for All Ages

 
 International service projects for all ages Anyone (16+)   
Our standard Volunteer Abroad projects are for anyone 16 and older to undertake valuable service work to benefit the communities in which we work.

Care 
Care volunteers work in orphanages, care centers, kindergartens, and special needs clinics around the world. You will help children get ready in the morning, play games, assist with homework and mealtimes, etc. These are very well-rounded volunteer placements that allow you to bring your own interests and passions in to share with the children.

 
Teaching 
Teaching volunteers work alongside local teachers in any of the destinations where we work. You do not need to have previous experience, just energy, enthusiasm, and patience. You can teach English to students or adults, and if you have the necessary skills you could also volunteer to teach French, IT, music, or sports.

 
Conservation & Environment 
Conservation and Environment projects focus on preserving some of the most beautiful and vulnerable ecosystems around the world. Whether you are volunteering in a rainforest, on the coast, or in a nature reserve, you will be working alongside our dedicated local staff to protect the area and raise awareness about the importance of conservation.



Sports 
Sports volunteer programs are popular with those who have a background in playing or coaching soccer, basketball, volleyball, water sports and more. Sports bring people together and help build strong communities, as well as contribute to the creation of healthy, happy individuals.

 
Archaeology 
Archaeology placements allow volunteers to explore an exciting new culture through history. You can also gain valuable, first-hand experience in the field of international archaeology. These placements do not require any previous experience or field work. Take a step back in time while working on Roman ruins in Romania or walk the trails of the Inca Empire in Peru.

 
Building 
Building volunteer placements involve some of the most important work needed in developing communities, including setting up basic infrastructure. Volunteering to building schools, libraries, and homes lays a foundation that supports locals even after your volunteer work abroad has ended.



Farming 
Farming volunteers get their hands dirty helping schools and communities raise crops to support themselves. Farming volunteers also have an important role to play promoting responsible and sustainable farming practices in the communities in which they are working.

 
Creative & Performing Arts 
Creative & Performing Arts placements are great for those who have a background in music, dance or drama and a passion for sharing their skills with another community. Volunteers impart their knowledge about their art form while learning the local traditions in their destination country.

Journalism 
International interns on a Journalism program learn directly from experienced journalists how to further their own writing and reporting skills. Volunteers who intern abroad on a Journalism project work at a range of print and broadcast placements including newspapers, magazines, as well as radio and TV stations.

 
Microfinance
