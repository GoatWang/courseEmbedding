Who is DCLI?


Direct ChassisLink, Inc. (DCLI) was originally formed in 1974 as Maersk Container Service Company (MCSC), a maintenance and repair organization responsible for repairing containers, chassis, and refrigeration unit generator sets. In the late 1990’s the group was reorganized to accommodate an ever growing fleet of chassis and containers under the name Maersk Equipment Service Company (MESC).
In 2007 with the continued growth of the chassis fleet, Maersk shifted container and refrigerator unit related repairs to another division and MESC became focused solely on chassis maintenance and leasing.
In 2009 Maersk determined to divest itself of its chassis interests and MESC began using the DCLI brand and actively marketing chassis on a fee per day basis to motor carriers.
In 2016, DCLI was acquired by the private equity firm EQT.
DCLI is an operating chassis leasing company. DCLI provides chassis to Marine Terminal Operators (MTO), Non-Vessel Operating Common Carriers (NVOCC), Motor Carriers, Steam Ship Lines (SSL), and Beneficial Cargo Owners (BCO) throughout the United States with 160 locations on or near key port facilities and other intermodal hubs.  DCLI has grown from 64,000 to approximately 120,000 owned and managed chassis in the past two years. The company has developed unique partnerships with terminal operators and motor carrier organizations.
In 2014, DCLI acquired REZ-1 Inc., a Wellesley, MA based Asset Management and IT Services provider, which manages several different equipment programs for railroads including Union Pacific, CSX, and Norfolk Southern.
DCLI has aggressively grown its fleet through strategic acquisitions of entire or partial marine carrier chassis fleets and the purchase of new container chassis. Today DCLI is a leading provider of chassis leasing nationwide.

Announcement




Naturally Wholesome Products LLC is voluntarily recalling gallon and pint containers of Half & Half labeled under the brand name Wholesome Country Creamery due to the presence of Alkaline Phosphatase found in samples during routine testing. Naturally Wholesome Products LLC has received no reports of illnesses related to the affected product and is removing the product from the market out of the abundance of caution.All gallon and pint containers involved in this recall have a batch code of 4052917 or 2060517. Distribution of the affected product was limited in scope. No other Naturally Wholesome Products LLC products are affected by this recall.The company initiated this voluntary recall because, in routine testing, samples of the affected product were found to contain Alkaline Phosphatase, an enzyme naturally present in raw milk but not in milk that has been properly pasteurized. The North Carolina Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, during a follow-up investigation of the plant, identified 2 batches of Half & Half that were not pasteurized per the requirements of the Pasteurized Milk Ordinance.The recall involves 244 units of the affected product which was distributed only in North Carolina. The company is actively notifying customers and is in the process of retrieving the affected product.How to Identify The Recalled ProductThis recall includes only gallon and pint containers of Half & Half that carry the Wholesome Country Creamery brand name. The containers have a small white sticker reading: 4052917 or 2060517.No other Naturally Wholesome Products LLC products are included in this recall.Naturally Wholesome Products LLC has ceased distribution of the affected product and recovery is actively underway. Consumers who have this product should not consume it. They should discard it and may return the product container to the place of purchase for a full refund or exchange. Consumers with questions can contact the company at (336) 468-1520.Because the presence of Alkaline Phosphatase in milk suggests the milk may not have been pasteurized sufficiently, it is possible that pathogens present in the raw milk to begin with, including Salmonella, Campylobacter, Listeria, and/or E. coli, have survived and, if ingested, could cause gastrointestinal infection and its potential ensuing complications.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC
