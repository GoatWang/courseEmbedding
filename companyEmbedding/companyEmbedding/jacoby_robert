WHERE TO MEASURE:

BUST: Measure under your arms at the fullest part of your bust. Keep tape level across your shoulder blades.

NATURAL WAIST: Measure around your natural waistline, keeping tape comfortably loose.

HIPS: Stand with your feet together and measure around the fullest part of your hips, about 8" from your natural waist.

THE CORRECT FIT: Please use the size chart to determine the best fit for you. If your measurements fall between sizes, please order the next larger size. For best results, take measurements over your undergarments. If possible, have someone else measure you, as it is more accurate. As always, our customer service representatives at Sundance will be happy to help you with any questions that you may have.
