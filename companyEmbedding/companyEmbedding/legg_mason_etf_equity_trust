Overview 










HIGHLIGHTS




The Legg Mason Low Volatility High Dividend ETF (LVHD) seeks to track the investment results of an underlying index composed of equity securities of U.S. companies with relatively high yield and low price and earnings volatility.


LVHD may benefit investors who want income but are concerned about the volatility that can come from traditional equity income investments.


The QS Low Volatility High Dividend Index (the Index):

The Index starts with the largest 3,000 U.S. stocks as determined by the Solactive U.S. Broad Market Index, an index calculated and published by Solactive AG composed of 3,000 U.S. large-cap, mid-cap and small-cap companies.
Based on historical and projected data using QS Investors' proprietary methodology,
The index screens for profitable companies that have the potential to pay relatively high sustainable dividend yields.
Yields of the remaining securities are then scored higher or lower based on the attractiveness of their price and earnings volatility.
The portfolio is constructed of the highest scoring securities subject to concentration limits: no individual component of the Index will exceed 2.5%, no individual sector (as defined by QS) will exceed 25%, and real estate investment trust (“REIT”) components as a whole will not exceed 15%. The number of component securities in the Index is anticipated to range from 50 to 100.
The Underlying Index’s components are reconstituted annually and rebalanced quarterly.

The QS Low Volatility High Dividend Index (the “Index”) seeks to provide more stable income through investment in stocks of profitable U.S. companies with relatively high dividend yields and lower price and earnings volatility. The Index is based on a proprietary methodology created and sponsored by QS Investors, LLC (“QS”). The Index is composed of stocks of U.S. companies across a wide range of market capitalizations, including the largest 3,000 U.S. stocks as determined by the Solactive US Broad Market Index. Stocks in the Index must have demonstrated profitability over the last four fiscal quarters as a whole. Stocks whose yields are not supported by earnings are excluded from the Index. The methodology calculates a composite “stable yield” score, with the yield of stocks with relatively high price and earnings volatility adjusted downward and the yield of stocks with relatively low price and earnings volatility adjusted upward. QS anticipates that the number of component securities in the Index will range from 50 to 100. As initially constituted and balanced, no individual component of the Index will exceed 2.5% of the Index, no individual sector (as defined by QS) will exceed 25% of the Index, and real estate investment trust (“REITs”) components as a whole will not exceed 15% of the Index. The Index’s components are reconstituted annually and rebalanced quarterly. The composition of the Index after annual reconstitution and rebalancing may fluctuate and exceed the aforementioned limits due to market movements. The components of the Underlying Index, and the degree to which these components represent certain sectors and industries, may change over time. 






		What I Should Know 
Before Investing




The Fund is newly organized, with a limited history of operations. Equity securities are subject to price fluctuation and possible loss of principal. Dividends are not guaranteed, and a company may reduce or eliminate its dividend at any time. In rising markets, the value of large-cap stocks may not rise as much as smaller-cap stocks. Small- and mid-cap stocks involve greater risks and volatility than large-cap stocks. The Fund may focus its investments in certain industries, increasing its vulnerability to market volatility. Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are closely linked to the performance of the real estate markets. REITs are subject to illiquidity, credit and interest rate risks, and risks associated with small and mid-cap investments. There is no guarantee that the Fund will achieve a high degree of correlation to the index it seeks to track. The Fund does not seek to outperform the index it tracks, and does not seek temporary defensive positions when markets decline or appear overvalued. Derivatives, such as options and futures, can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance.

 Performance 






Performance








Performance shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Market price returns are based upon the mid-point of the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO) when the ETF’s NAV is determined, which is typically 4 p.m. Eastern time (US). These returns will not represent your returns had you traded shares at other times.
Shareholders may pay more than net asset value when they buy Fund shares and receive less than net asset value when they sell those shares, because shares are bought and sold at current market prices. 


*Distribution rate is calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution amount paid, excluding special distributions, divided by the closing market price or NAV.

IMPORTANT HOLDINGS INFORMATION: Portfolio holdings are based on total portfolio, and are subject to change at any time. Holdings are provided for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to purchase or sell any security.

 Distributions 






Distributions









Distributions are not guaranteed and are subject to change.








The per share distribution amounts presented above reflect the distribution rates that were paid to shareholders on the indicated payable dates. The character of distributions for certain funds may have been subsequently adjusted for tax purposes. Shareholders can determine which funds may have reclassified the tax character of distributions by visiting the Tax Center in Account Services. Information on reclassifications for distributions paid during the current calendar year will not be available until the first quarter of the following year.
IMPORTANT INFORMATION: All investments involve risk, including loss of principal. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please see each product’s webpage for specific details regarding investment objective, risks, performance and other important information. Review this information carefully before you make any investment decision. Investors cannot invest directly in an index, and unmanaged index returns do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges.
Carefully consider a fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing. Please view the prospectus or summary prospectus for this and other information. Read it carefully. 
Authorized participants ("APs") may acquire shares in the primary market directly from the ETFs and may tender their shares for redemption directly to the ETFs, at net asset value per share only in Creation Units or Creation Unit Aggregations. Once created, shares of the funds generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a Creation Unit.
Retail investors buy and sell shares of ETFs at market price (not NAV) in the secondary market throughout the trading day. These shares are not individually available for purchase or redemption directly from the ETF. Market price returns are based upon the mid-point of the National Best Bid and Offer (NBBO) when the ETF’s NAV is determined, which is typically 4 p.m. Eastern time (US). 
Legg Mason Investor Services, LLC (LMIS) serves as the distributor of Creation Units for the ETFs on an agency basis. LMIS does not maintain a secondary market in the funds' shares. 
If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the United States or if you are a non-U.S. entity, the ETF's ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) will generally be subject to a 30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate applies. For further information, please see each fund’s prospectus.
Redemption payments will be effected within the specified number of calendar days following the date on which a request for redemption in proper form is made.  The funds generally intend to effect deliveries of creation units and portfolio securities on a basis of trade date “T” plus three business days (“T+3”).  Please see each fund’s statement of additional information (SAI) for more information.

If you are neither a resident nor a citizen of the United States or if you are a non-U.S. entity, the ETF's ordinary income dividends (which include distributions of net short-term capital gains) will generally be subject to a 30% U.S. federal withholding tax, unless a lower treaty rate applies. For further information, please see each fund's prospectus.
Redemption payments will be effected within the specified number of calendar days following the date on which a request for redemption in proper form is made.  The funds generally intend to effect deliveries of creation units and portfolio securities on a basis of trade date plus three business days (T+3).  Please see each fund's statement of additional information (SAI) for more information.  

*Selling your ETF shares at a gain will trigger a taxable event. An ETF is a pooled investment vehicle with shares that can be bought or sold through the trading day on a stock exchange at a market determined price. A traditional mutual fund is also a pooled investment vehicle; however shares of a traditional mutual fund are bought or sold at the fund's net asset value, which is calculated at the end of the trading day.  Both products generally represent a portfolio of securities, derivative instruments, currencies or commodities. The risks of owning an ETF or traditional mutual fund generally reflects the risks of owning the underlying investments. ETFs and traditional mutual funds also have management fees and operating expenses that increase their costs. The differences between the ETFs and traditional mutual funds could significantly impact performance. These differences include but are not limited to investment strategy, regulatory requirements, tax implications, fees and expenses, cash flows, trading structure and transparency requirements.
Authorized participants ("APs") may acquire shares in the primary market directly from the ETFs and may tender their shares for redemption directly to the ETFs, at net asset value per share only in Creation Units or Creation Unit Aggregations. Once created, shares of the funds generally trade in the secondary market in amounts less than a Creation Unit. Retail investors buy and sell shares of ETFs at market price (not NAV) in the secondary market throughout the trading day. These shares are not individually available for purchase or redemption directly from the ETF.

ETF Watch: Legg Mason Launches Emerging Market Fund

November 18, 2016 




 
ETF.com Staff 





 



  


Today Legg Mason is rolling out an ETF on Bats that targets the emerging market space using the same basic low-volatility, high-dividend methodology the firm has introduced in two other funds. The Legg Mason Emerging Markets Low Volatility High Dividend ETF (LVHE) completes a three-fund suite and comes with an expense ratio of 0.50%.
Bats Global Markets is the parent company of ETF.com.
Problems To Solve
“When we come up with equity solutions, a lot of times it’s because we see a problem. When we came up with the low-vol, high-div series, it was really to solve two things. One was the challenge of getting income in this market, which in the last seven years has been really hard,” said Mike LaBella, a portfolio manager with Legg Mason subsidiary QS Investors.
The other problem to be solved was economic anxiety, he noted.
“A lot of our clients really have had to hold on to equities longer than they thought; people are living longer; return expectations on fixed income are pretty low. We just finished this 30-year bull market where bonds rallied for 30 years, and now we’re just sitting at this bottom where yields have nowhere to go but up. That means investors have to hold more equity, and that comes with a lot of risk,” LaBella added.
Such investors tend to be very sensitive to volatility, but in searching for income and holding more equities, many people did not focus on the additional risk they were taking on because of that, he noted.
“If they’re in a decumulation phase, they easily can draw past their income and right into their principal, which can force them into a sell-low/hold-high investment strategy, which is not exactly a key to succss. We call that ‘dollar-cost ravaging,'” LaBella said.
Index Construction
LVHE’s underlying index is derived from the MSCI Emerging Markets IMI Index, and looks to target the components of that selection universe offering above-average dividend yields and below-average earnings volatility and price volatility. Volatility and dividend yield are also used to adjust the weightings of the individual securities, according to the prospectus.
The earnings volatility evaluation is fairly unique, according to LaBella.
“We want to make sure that the companies in this portfolio have predictable earnings. We want to make sure they have established business models, that they’re a bit more mature, that they will be able to continue to service that high dividend that they’re paying,” he added.
In keeping with LVHE’s low-volatility objective, the index also hedges away currency risk, which LaBella says is a strategic, not a tactical, decision. And in the interests of quality, the index methodology screens out stocks that have not been profitable for the preceding four fiscal quarters in aggregate.
“There’s an enormous amount of companies out there, which, over the years, have been increasing their dividend, but their earnings haven’t been increasing along with it. That means their payout ratios have been rising significantly, and many of them have risen way over 100%, which means they’re paying out more in dividends than they’re seeing in profitability and earnings. We don’t want any of that,” LaBella said.
ComponentsLVHE’s index also has diversification-based weighting requirements that limit the influence of any single security, country, region or sector, the prospectus noted. Ultimately, LaBella says, the index includes some 70 to 120 names.
Sometimes they aren’t always the names you’d expect. LaBella notes that energy companies are well-known for their high dividends, but points out that the earnings in the energy space crashed a few years ago. However, their dividends have continued to grow. As a result, such companies do not tend to make it into the indexes, and the U.S. index does not include any energy companies.
In general, LaBella describes the portfolio as one with a high yield, but relatively low market beta. As a result, it will capture a bit less upside when the markets are rising but offer more protection when markets turn downward, he said.
Legg Mason rolled out its U.S.-focused Legg Mason Low Volatility High Dividend ETF (LVHD) at the end of 2015, and the fund has since accumulated some $98 million in assets under management. The developed-market Legg Mason International Low Volatility High Dividend ETF (LVHI) launched in July and has about $3 million in assets under management.
“This is really rounding out the suite that we started launching back in December 2015,” LaBella said in reference to LVHE’s launch.

Pricing & Performance
















MUTUAL FUNDS - IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: Performance shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. For performance data including the effects of sales charges, Class A and A2 shares reflect the maximum front-end sales charge of 5.75% for equity funds, 4.25% for most fixed-income funds and 2.5% for the following funds: Western Asset Adjustable Rate Income Fund, Western Asset Intermediate Maturity California Municipals Fund, Western Asset Intermediate Maturity New York Municipals Fund, Western Asset Intermediate-Term Municipals Fund, Western Asset Short Duration High Income Fund, and Western Asset Short-Term Bond Fund. One-year returns for Class C shares reflect a CDSC of 1.0%, except for ClearBridge Value Trust which reflects a CDSC of 0.95%. Due to market volatility, current performance may be higher or lower than performance shown. Class FI, I and IS shares are sold at net asset value with no initial or contingent deferred sales charge, but higher initial minimum investment requirements apply. Effective July 1, 2011, Class B shares are closed to new purchases; however Class B exchange privileges will remain in effect. Royce Funds are sold at net asset value with no initial or contingent deferred sales charge.

							Performance for other share classes will vary due to differences in sales charge structure and class expenses. All classes of shares are not available through all distribution channels. Total returns assume the reinvestment of all distributions at net asset value and the deduction of all Fund expenses. Total return figures are based on the NAV per share applied to shareholder subscriptions and redemptions, which may differ from the NAV per share disclosed in Fund shareholder reports. Performance shown excluding sales charges would have been lower, if the applicable sales charge been reflected. Had fees not been waived in various periods performance would have been lower. All classes of shares may not be available to all investors or through all distribution channels.

							A Fund's 30-day SEC Yield is based on yield to maturity of a Fund's investments over a 30-day period and not on the dividends paid by the Fund, which may differ; and is subject to change.
Different minimums may apply to clients of certain service agents. See the Fund's prospectus for additional information.
For further information on Fund expenses, see the individual Fund page or the Fund's prospectus. Please go to the end of this page for additional performance related information regarding Legg Mason BW Alternative Credit Fund Class IS, Legg Mason BW Dynamic Large Cap Value Fund Class IS, and certain Royce funds.  
An investor cannot invest directly in an index. Unmanaged index returns do not reflect any fees, expenses or sales charges.
Daily Change($) indicates change in the net asset value from the previous business day.
MONEY MARKET FUNDS - IMPORTANT PERFORMANCE INFORMATION:
The performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results, and current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown.  Average annual total returns and calendar year returns assuming reinvestment of all distributions at net asset value and the deduction of all fund expenses. Performance would have been lower if fees had not been reimbursed or waived in various periods. Performance for other share classes will vary due to differences in sales charge structure and class expenses. All classes of shares are not available through all distribution channels.
The Current SEC 7-day yield represents net interest income generated by the investments for the past 7 days and assumes that the same income is generated each week over a 365-day period. The 7-day yield more closely reflects current fund earnings than does total returns. Yields for other share classes may vary due to differences in sales charge structure and class expenses. The Fund's yields reflect expense reimbursements or fee waivers, if any, absent these expense reimbursements and/or fee waivers, performance would have been lower.
Please see each fund's individual page for more information regarding fees and expenses.
Daily Change indicates change in the net asset value from the previous business day.
An investment in a money market fund is neither insured nor guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Although a money market fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in the fund.














IMPORTANT INFORMATION: All investments involve risk, including loss of principal. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please see each product’s web page for specific details regarding investment objective, risks, performance and other important information. Review this information carefully before you make any investment decision.
Carefully consider a fund’s investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing. Please view the prospectus or summary prospectus for this and other information. Read it carefully.
FINANCIAL ADVISORS: Please note that not all share classes may be available for sale at your firm. Please call the Legg Mason Sales Desk 1-800-822-5544 or your Legg Mason Sales contact for more information.






IMPORTANT PREDECESSOR PERFORMANCE INFORMATION: Each share class is invested in the same portfolio of securities, therefore annual total returns for newer share classes would differ from those returns for older share classes only to the extent of fees and charges associated with that share class. For an indication of a Fund's fees and charges, see the Fund's expense ratio and maximum sales charge disclosures or the fee table provided in a Fund's prospectus. 
Legg Mason BW Alternative Credit Fund Class IS: This fund is the successor to an institutional account (the "Predecessor"). The performance in the accompanying chart and table is that of the Predecessor. On December 2, 2013, the Predecessor transferred its assets to the fund in exchange for the fund's Class IS shares. The investment policies, portfolio managers objectives, guidelines and restrictions of the fund are in all material respects equivalent to those of the Predecessor. As a mutual fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the fund is subject to certain restrictions to which the Predecessor was not subject. Had the Predecessor been registered under the 1940 Act, its investment performance may have been adversely affected. The performance information reflects the gross expenses of the Predecessor adjusted to reflect the higher fees and expenses of Class IS of the fund. The performance is shown net of annual management fees and other expenses which reflects the application of the Class IS expense limitation agreement. If the expense limitation agreement were not applicable, expenses would be higher and performance lower.
Legg Mason BW Dynamic Large Cap Value Fund Class IS: This fund is the successor to a private fund (the "Predecessor"). The performance in the accompanying bar chart and table is that of the Predecessor. On October 31, 2014, the Predecessor transferred its assets to the fund in exchange for the fund's Class IS shares. The investment policies, objectives, guidelines and restrictions of the fund are in all material respects equivalent to those of the Predecessor. In addition, the Predecessor's portfolio managers are the current portfolio managers of the fund. As a mutual fund registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, the fund is subject to certain restrictions under the 1940 Act and the Internal Revenue Code to which the Predecessor was not subject. Had the Predecessor been registered under the 1940 Act and been subject to the provisions of the 1940 Act and the Code, its investment performance could have been adversely affected, but these restrictions are not expected to have a material effect on the fund's investment program. The performance information reflects the gross expenses of the Predecessor adjusted to reflect the higher fees and expenses of Class IS of the fund. The performance is shown net of an annual management fee of 0.55% and other expenses of 0.10% which reflects the application of the Class IS expense limitation agreement. If the expense limitation agreement were not applicable, expenses would be higher and performance lower.
Royce Funds: Performance prior to the date of commencement of certain Fund's Investment Class shares (Royce Small-Cap Leaders Fund - 3/15/2007, Royce Low-Priced Stock Fund - 3/15/2007, Royce Heritage Fund - 3/15/2007, Royce Small-Cap Value Fund - 3/15/2007, Royce Smaller-Companies Growth Fund - 3/15/2007, Royce Dividend Value Fund - 9/14/2007 and Royce Global Value Fund - 8/31/10) reflects Service Class results; Service Class shares (Royce Pennsylvania Mutual Fund - 11/08/05, Royce Micro-Cap Fund - 8/30/02, Royce Micro-Cap Opportunity Fund - 5/22/00, Royce Premier Fund - 9/3/02, Royce Special Equity Fund - 10/2/03, Royce Total Return Fund - 1/3/02) reflects Investment Class results; Consultant Class shares (Royce Pennsylvania Mutual Fund - 6/17/97, Royce Micro-Cap Fund - 5/1/98, Royce Total Return Fund - 10/16/01, Royce Heritage Fund - 12/7/01, Royce Premier Fund - 6/2/03, Royce Special Equity Fund - 6/2/03, Royce Small-Cap Value - 3/30/06, Royce Small-Cap Value Fund- 3/30/06 and Royce Global Value Fund - 4/29/11) reflects Investment/Service Class results; Institutional Class shares (Royce Micro-Cap Opportunity Fund - 12/12/01, Royce Premier Fund - 9/17/02, Royce Special Equity Fund - 7/25/03, Royce Total Return Fund - 3/4/03, Royce Small-Cap Value Fund - 6/1/06, Royce Smaller-Companies Growth Fund - 5/10/06 and Royce Low-Priced Stock Fund - 1/3/06) reflects Investment/Service Class results.

If the Service Class's annual distribution expense had been reflected, total returns prior to the Service Class's inception would have been lower.

          3. The BlackRock Diversified Income Portfolio is composed of exchange-traded products (ETPs)—primarily exchange-traded funds (ETFs)—but may contain other investment vehicles, such as mutual funds.
	
    

          ETFs are subject to market fluctuation and the risks of their underlying investments. ETFs are subject to management fees and other expenses. Unlike mutual funds, ETF shares are bought and sold at market price, which may be higher or lower than their NAV, and are not individually redeemed from the fund.
	
    

Exchange-traded products (ETPs) are subject to market volatility and the risks of their underlying securities, which may include the risks associated with investing in smaller companies, foreign securities, commodities, and fixed income investments. Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets. ETPs that target a small universe of securities, such as a specific region or market sector, are generally subject to greater market volatility, as well as to the specific risks associated with that sector, region, or other focus. ETPs that use derivatives, leverage, or complex investment strategies are subject to additional risks. The return of an index ETP is usually different from that of the index it tracks because of fees, expenses, and tracking error. An ETP may trade at a premium or discount to its net asset value (NAV) (or indicative value in the case of exchange-traded notes). The degree of liquidity can vary significantly from one ETP to another and losses may be magnified if no liquid market exists for the ETP's shares when attempting to sell them. Each ETP has a unique risk profile, detailed in its prospectus, offering circular, or similar material, which should be considered carefully when making investment decisions.

Barron’s 2017 Best Online Broker Ranking
Fidelity takes the top spot, with Interactive Brokers and TD Ameritrade right on its heels


 







By

Theresa W. Carey

 Biography




 




March 18, 2017


The bull market is on sale for online brokerage customers. In the run-up to our 22nd annual ranking of Barron’s Best Online Brokers, two developments topped all others: The three major indexes—the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Standard & Poor’s 500, and the Nasdaq Composite—all set record highs, and six brokers slashed commissions and other fees. At the 16 brokers we reviewed this year, the average monthly cost of trading for an occasional investor had fallen 25% since early 2016, to $47.51 from $63.45. That means...

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
