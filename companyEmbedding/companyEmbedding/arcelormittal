Main content


                Steel products
              

In 2015, ArcelorMittal produced nearly 15 million tons of raw steel in the United States. Our principal products include a broad range of flat, long and tubular products to serve the automotive, construction, energy, appliance, container and machinery markets. More than 95 percent of ArcelorMittal’s raw steel production in the U.S. is from flat operations, which are primarily integrated facilities. All of our products are available in standard carbon grades as well as high-strength, low-alloy grades for more demanding applications.




                                Flat products
                              

Hot-rolled
All coiled flat-rolled steel is initially hot-rolled by passing a slab through a multi-stand rolling mill to reduce its thickness to less than 5⁄8 inch. Hot-rolled steel destined for the sheet market can be either shipped as black band or cleaned in an acid bath and sold as pickled band. These products are used in non-critical surface applications such as automotive frames and wheels, construction products, pipe, off-highway equipment and guardrails.
Cold-rolled
Cold-rolled sheet is hot-rolled coil that has been further processed through a pickler and then passed through a rolling mill without reheating until the desired gauge, or thickness, and other physical properties have been achieved. Cold-rolling reduces gauge and hardens the steel. Further processing through an annealing furnace and a temper mill improves ductility and formability. Cold-rolling can also impart various surface finishes and textures. Cold-rolled sheet is used in, among other things, steel applications that demand higher surface quality, such as exposed automobile and appliance panels. Cold-rolled sheet prices are usually higher than hot-rolled steel prices. For certain applications, cold-rolled sheet is coated or painted.
Coated
Either hot-rolled or cold-rolled coil may be coated with zinc, aluminum or a combination thereof to render it corrosion resistant. Hot-dip galvanized, galvannealed, Galvalume, electrogalvanized and aluminized products are types of coated steel. These are also among the highest value-added sheet products because they require the greatest degree of processing and usually have the strictest quality requirements. Coated steel products are generally used in applications such as automobiles, household appliances, roofing and siding, heating and air conditioning equipment, air ducts, switch boxes, chimney flues, awnings and grain bins.
Plate
Plate is steel that is generally more than 3⁄16 inch thick. It can be made on either a coiled plate mill, up to one-inch thick, or a discrete plate mill. The coiled plate, or discrete plate, is then cut into sections for specific end uses. Commodity steel plate is used in a variety of applications, such as storage tanks, ships and railcars, large diameter pipe and machinery parts. More specialized steel plate, such as high-strength, low-alloy, heat-treated or alloy plate, can have superior strength and performance characteristics for particular applications such as the manufacture of construction, mining and logging equipment; pressure vessels and oil and gas transmission lines; and the fabrication of bridges and buildings. Quenched and tempered plate is harder and stronger and can be used in products, such as military armor and hard rock mining equipment.
Tin
Tin mill sheet steel is used to produce food packaging and other containers. It is available as black plate, tin plate and tin-free steel. Black plate is an uncoated thin gauge cold-rolled steel; tin plate is black plate, electrolytically plated with metallic tin; and tin-free steel is black plate that has been electrolytically plated with metallic chromium and chromium oxides. Both tin plate and tin-free steel undergo a plating process whereby the molecules from the positively charged tin or chromium anode attach to the negatively charged sheet steel. The thickness of the coating is readily controlled through regulation of the voltage and speed of the sheet through the plating area.




                                Long products
                              

Rail

Billets and blooms are fed through rollers that form rail. Rail is produced in a number of sections determined by their weight per yard and relative strengths. Rail is sold to railroad companies and regional transit authorities for new track projects and for the repair of existing track.




                                Tubular products
                              

Specialty steel tubing
Apart from welded and seamless steel tubes, available in a wide spectrum of carbon and alloy grades, tubular product solutions can also be tailored to meet the specific needs of customers through an extensive range of services, including cutting, end finishing, heat treating and steel slitting. There are also drawn-over-mandrel (DOM) and cold drawing capabilities available for the most demanding applications. Tubular products serve a variety of markets including automotive, industrial and construction equipment, hydraulic cylinders, agricultural equipment and mineral mining equipment.




                                Welded products
                              

Tailor blanks
Tailored blanks play a significant role in providing “tailor made” solutions to automotive customers. A tailored blank, which can be a straight line or curvilinear product, is created by laser welding together steels of various grades, thicknesses and/or different coatings. Tailored blanks help improve the performance of car parts in a vehicle while reducing weight and enhancing safety.

                Steel products
              

In 2015, ArcelorMittal produced nearly 15 million tons of raw steel in the United States. Our principal products include a broad range of flat, long and tubular products to serve the automotive, construction, energy, appliance, container and machinery markets. More than 95 percent of ArcelorMittal’s raw steel production in the U.S. is from flat operations, which are primarily integrated facilities. All of our products are available in standard carbon grades as well as high-strength, low-alloy grades for more demanding applications.




                                Flat products
                              

Hot-rolled
All coiled flat-rolled steel is initially hot-rolled by passing a slab through a multi-stand rolling mill to reduce its thickness to less than 5⁄8 inch. Hot-rolled steel destined for the sheet market can be either shipped as black band or cleaned in an acid bath and sold as pickled band. These products are used in non-critical surface applications such as automotive frames and wheels, construction products, pipe, off-highway equipment and guardrails.
Cold-rolled
Cold-rolled sheet is hot-rolled coil that has been further processed through a pickler and then passed through a rolling mill without reheating until the desired gauge, or thickness, and other physical properties have been achieved. Cold-rolling reduces gauge and hardens the steel. Further processing through an annealing furnace and a temper mill improves ductility and formability. Cold-rolling can also impart various surface finishes and textures. Cold-rolled sheet is used in, among other things, steel applications that demand higher surface quality, such as exposed automobile and appliance panels. Cold-rolled sheet prices are usually higher than hot-rolled steel prices. For certain applications, cold-rolled sheet is coated or painted.
Coated
Either hot-rolled or cold-rolled coil may be coated with zinc, aluminum or a combination thereof to render it corrosion resistant. Hot-dip galvanized, galvannealed, Galvalume, electrogalvanized and aluminized products are types of coated steel. These are also among the highest value-added sheet products because they require the greatest degree of processing and usually have the strictest quality requirements. Coated steel products are generally used in applications such as automobiles, household appliances, roofing and siding, heating and air conditioning equipment, air ducts, switch boxes, chimney flues, awnings and grain bins.
Plate
Plate is steel that is generally more than 3⁄16 inch thick. It can be made on either a coiled plate mill, up to one-inch thick, or a discrete plate mill. The coiled plate, or discrete plate, is then cut into sections for specific end uses. Commodity steel plate is used in a variety of applications, such as storage tanks, ships and railcars, large diameter pipe and machinery parts. More specialized steel plate, such as high-strength, low-alloy, heat-treated or alloy plate, can have superior strength and performance characteristics for particular applications such as the manufacture of construction, mining and logging equipment; pressure vessels and oil and gas transmission lines; and the fabrication of bridges and buildings. Quenched and tempered plate is harder and stronger and can be used in products, such as military armor and hard rock mining equipment.
Tin
Tin mill sheet steel is used to produce food packaging and other containers. It is available as black plate, tin plate and tin-free steel. Black plate is an uncoated thin gauge cold-rolled steel; tin plate is black plate, electrolytically plated with metallic tin; and tin-free steel is black plate that has been electrolytically plated with metallic chromium and chromium oxides. Both tin plate and tin-free steel undergo a plating process whereby the molecules from the positively charged tin or chromium anode attach to the negatively charged sheet steel. The thickness of the coating is readily controlled through regulation of the voltage and speed of the sheet through the plating area.

Rail

Billets and blooms are fed through rollers that form rail. Rail is produced in a number of sections determined by their weight per yard and relative strengths. Rail is sold to railroad companies and regional transit authorities for new track projects and for the repair of existing track.




                                Tubular products
                              

Specialty steel tubing
Apart from welded and seamless steel tubes, available in a wide spectrum of carbon and alloy grades, tubular product solutions can also be tailored to meet the specific needs of customers through an extensive range of services, including cutting, end finishing, heat treating and steel slitting. There are also drawn-over-mandrel (DOM) and cold drawing capabilities available for the most demanding applications. Tubular products serve a variety of markets including automotive, industrial and construction equipment, hydraulic cylinders, agricultural equipment and mineral mining equipment.




                                Welded products
                              

Tailor blanks
Tailored blanks play a significant role in providing “tailor made” solutions to automotive customers. A tailored blank, which can be a straight line or curvilinear product, is created by laser welding together steels of various grades, thicknesses and/or different coatings. Tailored blanks help improve the performance of car parts in a vehicle while reducing weight and enhancing safety.

Using resources judiciously






        By-product sales
      



Using the by-products generated during the steelmaking process makes good business sense, as well as reducing the environmental impact


We try to use all the materials produced during the process of steelmaking, whether they are prime steel products or materials commonly seen as waste. ArcelorMittal’s shared services team coordinates sales of by-products from the steelmaking process, with the aim of generating revenue from these products.
As well as making good business sense, making the most of the by-products of steelmaking is the right thing to do in terms of material stewardship, by recycling as much as possible and minimising the impact of steelmaking on the environment. Through their work on by-products, the shared services team drives collaboration between ArcelorMittal’s mills and customers.
By-products include all forms of slag from both integrated and mini mills in granulated or ground form, tar and tar distillates, benzole, ammonium sulphate, mill scales and sludges, coke breeze and various dusts collected throughout the various steel production stages.
We also operate a number of slag dumps, which were accumulated before ArcelorMittal owned various steel plants. These may be rich in iron and carbon-bearing materials and can be re-used in our steelmaking facilities. This lowers the need to buy materials, reducing the company’s external material and supply chain footprint.

An unparalled partner for automotive manufacturers






 




Product offeringArcelorMittal’s extensive product offering includes a MartINsite® line, with tensile strengths ranging from 900 MPa to 1700 MPa, which helps today’s automakers shed weight from simpler shapes that can be manufactured by roll forming. Usibor®, a press hardened steel grade, supports weight reduction in more advanced shapes that require higher tensile strength. And, S-in motion offers weight reduction solutions for 43 key vehicle parts for the front, side and rear body structure plus additional solutions for hang-on doors, chassis and exhaust parts.

Our offer
Commercial Steel(CS)Typically produced using low carbon content, CS is used in applications with more limited forming requirements.Drawing Steel(DS)
DS is a readily available specification which offers good formability. DS is aluminum killed and typically has lower carbon or controlled processing resulting in improved formability.Deep Drawing Steel(DDS)A specification of steel with excellent formability characteristics which is recommended for difficult forming applications. DDS is also available in standard and extra low carbon forms. It is sometimes produced using ultra low carbon (ULC) or interstitial free (IF) steels.Extra Deep Drawing Steel(EDDS)A highly formable specification of steel ideal for the most difficult forming applications where other steels lack sufficient ductility. This product is produced using IF steel, requiring the use of a degasser in steelmaking as well as close control of alloy additions.Bake Hardenable(BH)These specifications are unique in that they are designed to increase yield strength after the paint curing process, providing the benefit of both superior formability over traditional high strength steels and higher part strength than previously described specifications. They acquire their added strength via the amount of strain generated in the part during stamping, and through the time and temperature inherent in the paint curing process.High Strength Low Alloy(HSLA)HSLA specifications offer higher strengths for applications where forming requirements are not as severe as previously described specifications. The product is sold to guaranteed mechanical properties of yield strength, tensile strength and elongation. The strength is obtained not only through carbon and manganese but also through the addition of one or more microalloys (Cb, Ti, V) coupled with controlled processing.Carbon Manganese(CMn)Carbon steels containing more than 1.2 percent up to approximately 1.8 percent manganese are referred to as Carbon Manganese steels. The manganese content in carbon steels is increased for the purpose of increasing depth of hardening and improving strength and toughness.Dual Phase(DP)DP steels offer an outstanding combination of strength and initial drawability as a result of their microstructure, in which a hard martensitic or bainitic phase is dispersed in a soft ferritic phase. These steels have high strain hardening capacity. As a result, finished part mechanical properties, especially yield strength, are superior to those of the initial blank. These steels have excellent fatigue strength and good energy absorption capacity, making them suitable for use in structural parts and reinforcements.Transformation Induced Plasticity Steels(TRIP)TRIP steels offer an outstanding combination of strength and ductility as a result of their microstructure. They are suitable for structural and reinforcement parts of complex shape. The microstructure of these steels is composed of islands of hard residual austenite and carbide-free bainite dispersed in a soft ferritic matrix. Austenite is transformed into martensite during plastic deformation, making it possible to achieve greater initial elongations. High strain hardening capacity and high mechanical strengths lend these steels excellent energy absorption capacity. TRIP steels also exhibit a strong bake hardening effect following deformation, which further improves their crash performance. TRIP steels are particularly well suited for automotive structural and safety parts such as cross members, longitudinal beams, B-pillar reinforcements, sills and bumper reinforcements.Press Hardened Steel - Usibor®(PHS) – Usibor®PHS are designed to be heat treated and then quenched during the hot stamping process. The mechanical properties of the final part make significant weight savings possible. The very high yield strength of these steels after heat treatment and hot stamping make them suitable for anti-intrusion components such as fender beams, door reinforcements and B-pillars. Usibor® has an aluminum-silicon pre-coating and was developed to protect the metal from oxidation (scale) and decarburization during the hot stamping process. The coating offers excellent resistance to oxidation resulting from the hot stamping heat treatment process. Final parts using this forming technology have improved corrosion resistance after painting.Martensitic Steels(MART)ArcelorMittal’s martINsite® ultra high strength steels consist of fully martensitic microstructures offering some of the highest strength levels available in the marketplace. These steels offer much higher strengthto-weight ratios than conventional cold rolled steels. Although limited in formability, alternative available manufacturing technologies such as roll-forming are used to fabricate these grades. Typical applications for martINsite® gradesMild steelsProduct Characteristics
ArcelorMittal offers a wide range of Mild steels. Depending on the formability requirements the appropriate sheet steel grade may be selected. Steel grades range from Commercial Steel (CS), which have the reasonable formability to grades like Extra Deep Drawing Steel Plus (EDDS Plus) which offers superior formability.
All of these grades are low carbon grades. Some of the highly formable steels contain ultra-low levels of carbon and are fully stabilized with microalloying elements like titanium and/or niobium.
These steels are also commonly known as interstitial-free steels, i.e. these steels have no free, interstitially available, carbon or nitrogen.
Application
These steels are the most widely used grades in the automotive industry. They offer excellent formability and can be used for a range of parts from simple small brackets to complicated shapes like wheelhouses and floor-pans. The lower strength of these steels, can limit their applications where dent resistance, durability and high strength requirements are essential. These grades have excellent manufacturability and can be easily joined using conventional welding techniques. Except for CS, all others grades are available as exposed quality steels, also.

History[edit]
2006-2008: Formation and scalebacks[edit]
ArcelorMittal was created by the takeover of Western European steel maker Arcelor (Spain, France, and Luxembourg) by Indian-owned multinational steel maker Mittal Steel in 2006, at a cost of €40.37 per share, approximately $33 billion total. Mittal Steel launched a hostile takeover bid which replaced a previous planned merger between Arcelor and Severstal, which had lacked sufficient shareholder approval. The resulting merged business was named ArcelorMittal and was headquartered in Luxembourg.[5][6] The resulting firm produced approximately 10% of the world's steel, and was by far the world's largest steel company. Total revenues in 2007 were $105 billion.[7][8]
The company earned revenues of $105 billion in 2007.[8] By February 2008, the company had 320,000 employees in 60 countries.[8] In October 2008, the market capitalisation of ArcelorMittal was over $30 billion,[9] after peaking at $32.5 billion in September 2008.[2] At the end of 2008, the company reported operating income of around $12 billion.[10]
In December 2008, ArcelorMittal announced several plant closings, including the Bethlehem Steel plant in Lackawanna, New York, and LTV Steel in Hennepin, Illinois.[citation needed] After purchase of Kryvorizhstal, Ukraine's largest steel producer, employment was scaled back from 57,000 employees to 30,000.[citation needed]
2011-2014: Losses and Senegal agreement[edit]
In 2010, the company's operating income had fallen to $4.9 billion, with sales down 10 percent from the year earlier, and income down 50 percent as steel prices slumped.[10] In 2011, the company began curtailing its European production to match the reduced demand for steel.[10] It also sold Skyline Steel and Astralloy to a rival, Nucor, for $605 million.[10] On 26 January 2011, the stainless steel division split off as a new company, Aperam.[citation needed] As of 2012[update], due to overcapacity and reduced demand in Europe it had idled 9 of 25 blast furnaces;[10] in October 2012 it permanently shut down two blast furnaces at Florange, France.[11] On October 31, 2012, the company reported a third-quarter loss of $709 million as compared to a $659 million profit for the same period a year ago, citing the slow down in China's economy.[12] In 2012 ArcelorMittal had $22 billion of debt.[10]
In January 2013, ArcelorMittal bid $1.5 billion to acquire ThyssenKrupp AG's rolling mill in Calvert, Alabama, United States.[13] On February 26, 2014, ThyssenKrupp sold their Calvert carbon steel facility to ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel for $1.55 billion,[14] as a new joint venture.[15] The facility was renamed AM/NS Calvert through the 50/50 joint partnership with Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp.[16] The firm also entered into a $2.2 billion contract to develop an iron ore deposit in Senegal. This included construction of a 750 km (466 mi) railway line. After stalling on the contract and failing to build according to schedule the Government of Senegal sued.[17] In September 2013, the government of Senegal won a court case before an international tribunal to rescind a $2.2 billion deal with ArcelorMittal after the company suspended work on an iron ore mine in the country.[18] In June 2014, the International Chamber of Commerce's arbitration court in Paris awarded Senegal $150 million.[17]
Dealing with price and demand fluctuations in the steel market, from 2012 to 2014 ArcelorMittal restructured its European division by reducing employee numbers and closing plants.[19] In May, 2014, ArcelorMittal, citing economic self-interest, declared its opposition to sanctions on Russia.[20] As of June 2014, ArcelorMittal accounted for 7 percent of world steel production. After being shut out of the Chinese steel industry in 2005 along with other foreign companies, in 2014 the company announced it was planning new plants in China.[21] In 2014, the company had an annual crude steel production of 98.1 million tons.[3]
2008-2016: Price fixing convictions[edit]
Following an investigation first launched in 2008, in August 2016 the South African Competition Commission found the company guilty of price fixing. ArcelorMittal was fined US$110.9 million, and as part of the settlement also agreed to invest R4.64 billion in capital over five years.[22] According to the findings, the firm had been part of a 17 steel member groups nicknamed "Club Zürich" that later became known as "Club Europe." Between January 1984 and September 2002, the companies fixed the market, prices, and exchanged confidential corporate information. According to a European Union Commission Vice-President, it was "amazing" how the cartel "abused nearly the entire European construction market for such a long time and for such a vital product."[23] Fines were particularly high for the firm owing to two prior convictions.[citation needed]
2015-2016: Recent acquisitions[edit]
In 2015, the company had a net loss of $7.9 billion.[24] Between February 2015 and February 2016, share value dropped 60%, making the company the "worst performer" in the FTSEurofirst300 index. The CEO said the company had performed poorly in 2015 due to "Chinese exports depressing prices."[2] Early in 2016,[24] the company announced it had raised $3 billion in new investment capital to help reduce debt[25] to $11.7 billion of debt.[24] In early 2016[24] the company also announced a program to boost core profit by $3 billion by 2020 "through a mixture of cost-cutting, increased production and a focus on higher-value forms of steel." Chairman Lakshmi Mittal announced doubled earnings the following year in May 2017.[26] Along with the increase in capital, the company also sold its 35% stake in Gestamp Automacion for $979 million, with the goal of reducing ArcelorMittal's debt to less than $12 billion.[2] By February 2016, the company made about 6% of the world's steel.[2] It ranked 108th in the 2016 Fortune Global 500 ranking of the world's biggest corporations.[4]
In February 2017 ArcelorMittal announced its first annual profits in five years.[27] In February 2017, ArcelorMittal and Votorantim announced plans to combine their long steel operations in Brazil. Under the deal, Votorantim Siderurgia became a subsidiary of ArcelorMittal Brasil.[27] In late May 2017, ArcelorMittal and the Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) agreed on preliminary terms to form a $913 million joint venture to export a fifth of the auto-grade steel made by the venture.[28] In March 2017, the company proposed a new USD $6.5 billion steel project in Karnataka, after entering into a pact with the Karnataka government[29] in February 2017.[30] In April 2017, Sanjeev Gupta's Liberty House Group announced it had agreed to acquire ArcelorMittal's Georgetown Steelworks in South Carolina.[29] It is ranked 123 in the 2017 Fortune Global 500 ranking of the world's biggest corporations.[4]
By March 2017, ArcelorMittal was leading a consortium bidding for Ilva.[31] An Italian company, Ilva owns the Taranto steelworks in southern Italy, which has Europe's largest steel output. The steelworks had been accused of toxic emissions linked to local cancer rates, and had been nationalized by the government years prior.[32] The buyers were the AM Investco consortium, which beyond ArcelorMittal included Marcegaglia and Banca Intesa Sanpaolo.[32] In May 2017, ArcelorMittal was announced as the preferred bidder over a different consortium led by JSW Steel, after it was able to pledge a production increase and guarantee employment levels. The final decision was waiting on Italy’s ministry of economic development.[33] On June 5, 2017, ArcelorMittal won approval to purchase Ilva for €1.8 billion. In its bid, AM Investco had pledged to make investments into Ilva of €2.4bn until 2023.[32]
Products and activities[edit]

The company is involved in research and development, mining, and steel.[34] ArcelorMittal in 2016 produced around 90 million tons of steel.[27] As of May 2017, the company made 200 unique steel grades for automotive purposes, half of which were introduced since 2007.[35] Among the steel varieties are Usibor 2000, which the company announced in June 2016 and released later that year. Upon release, the high-strength automotive steel was said to be about one-third stronger than other steels then available for carmaking.[25]
Company structure[edit]
Lakshmi Mittal (owner of Mittal Steel) is the chairman and CEO. His family owns 40% of the shares and voting shares in the company.[36] After a $3 billion rights issue earlier in April 2016, the company by the 21 April 2016 had a share value of 16,616 million euros, distributed in 3,065,710,869 shares.[37]

History[edit]
2006-2008: Formation and scalebacks[edit]
ArcelorMittal was created by the takeover of Western European steel maker Arcelor (Spain, France, and Luxembourg) by Indian-owned multinational steel maker Mittal Steel in 2006, at a cost of €40.37 per share, approximately $33 billion total. Mittal Steel launched a hostile takeover bid which replaced a previous planned merger between Arcelor and Severstal, which had lacked sufficient shareholder approval. The resulting merged business was named ArcelorMittal and was headquartered in Luxembourg.[5][6] The resulting firm produced approximately 10% of the world's steel, and was by far the world's largest steel company. Total revenues in 2007 were $105 billion.[7][8]
The company earned revenues of $105 billion in 2007.[8] By February 2008, the company had 320,000 employees in 60 countries.[8] In October 2008, the market capitalisation of ArcelorMittal was over $30 billion,[9] after peaking at $32.5 billion in September 2008.[2] At the end of 2008, the company reported operating income of around $12 billion.[10]
In December 2008, ArcelorMittal announced several plant closings, including the Bethlehem Steel plant in Lackawanna, New York, and LTV Steel in Hennepin, Illinois.[citation needed] After purchase of Kryvorizhstal, Ukraine's largest steel producer, employment was scaled back from 57,000 employees to 30,000.[citation needed]
2011-2014: Losses and Senegal agreement[edit]
In 2010, the company's operating income had fallen to $4.9 billion, with sales down 10 percent from the year earlier, and income down 50 percent as steel prices slumped.[10] In 2011, the company began curtailing its European production to match the reduced demand for steel.[10] It also sold Skyline Steel and Astralloy to a rival, Nucor, for $605 million.[10] On 26 January 2011, the stainless steel division split off as a new company, Aperam.[citation needed] As of 2012[update], due to overcapacity and reduced demand in Europe it had idled 9 of 25 blast furnaces;[10] in October 2012 it permanently shut down two blast furnaces at Florange, France.[11] On October 31, 2012, the company reported a third-quarter loss of $709 million as compared to a $659 million profit for the same period a year ago, citing the slow down in China's economy.[12] In 2012 ArcelorMittal had $22 billion of debt.[10]
In January 2013, ArcelorMittal bid $1.5 billion to acquire ThyssenKrupp AG's rolling mill in Calvert, Alabama, United States.[13] On February 26, 2014, ThyssenKrupp sold their Calvert carbon steel facility to ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel for $1.55 billion,[14] as a new joint venture.[15] The facility was renamed AM/NS Calvert through the 50/50 joint partnership with Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp.[16] The firm also entered into a $2.2 billion contract to develop an iron ore deposit in Senegal. This included construction of a 750 km (466 mi) railway line. After stalling on the contract and failing to build according to schedule the Government of Senegal sued.[17] In September 2013, the government of Senegal won a court case before an international tribunal to rescind a $2.2 billion deal with ArcelorMittal after the company suspended work on an iron ore mine in the country.[18] In June 2014, the International Chamber of Commerce's arbitration court in Paris awarded Senegal $150 million.[17]
Dealing with price and demand fluctuations in the steel market, from 2012 to 2014 ArcelorMittal restructured its European division by reducing employee numbers and closing plants.[19] In May, 2014, ArcelorMittal, citing economic self-interest, declared its opposition to sanctions on Russia.[20] As of June 2014, ArcelorMittal accounted for 7 percent of world steel production. After being shut out of the Chinese steel industry in 2005 along with other foreign companies, in 2014 the company announced it was planning new plants in China.[21] In 2014, the company had an annual crude steel production of 98.1 million tons.[3]
2008-2016: Price fixing convictions[edit]
Following an investigation first launched in 2008, in August 2016 the South African Competition Commission found the company guilty of price fixing. ArcelorMittal was fined US$110.9 million, and as part of the settlement also agreed to invest R4.64 billion in capital over five years.[22] According to the findings, the firm had been part of a 17 steel member groups nicknamed "Club Zürich" that later became known as "Club Europe." Between January 1984 and September 2002, the companies fixed the market, prices, and exchanged confidential corporate information. According to a European Union Commission Vice-President, it was "amazing" how the cartel "abused nearly the entire European construction market for such a long time and for such a vital product."[23] Fines were particularly high for the firm owing to two prior convictions.[citation needed]
2015-2016: Recent acquisitions[edit]
In 2015, the company had a net loss of $7.9 billion.[24] Between February 2015 and February 2016, share value dropped 60%, making the company the "worst performer" in the FTSEurofirst300 index. The CEO said the company had performed poorly in 2015 due to "Chinese exports depressing prices."[2] Early in 2016,[24] the company announced it had raised $3 billion in new investment capital to help reduce debt[25] to $11.7 billion of debt.[24] In early 2016[24] the company also announced a program to boost core profit by $3 billion by 2020 "through a mixture of cost-cutting, increased production and a focus on higher-value forms of steel." Chairman Lakshmi Mittal announced doubled earnings the following year in May 2017.[26] Along with the increase in capital, the company also sold its 35% stake in Gestamp Automacion for $979 million, with the goal of reducing ArcelorMittal's debt to less than $12 billion.[2] By February 2016, the company made about 6% of the world's steel.[2] It ranked 108th in the 2016 Fortune Global 500 ranking of the world's biggest corporations.[4]
In February 2017 ArcelorMittal announced its first annual profits in five years.[27] In February 2017, ArcelorMittal and Votorantim announced plans to combine their long steel operations in Brazil. Under the deal, Votorantim Siderurgia became a subsidiary of ArcelorMittal Brasil.[27] In late May 2017, ArcelorMittal and the Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) agreed on preliminary terms to form a $913 million joint venture to export a fifth of the auto-grade steel made by the venture.[28] In March 2017, the company proposed a new USD $6.5 billion steel project in Karnataka, after entering into a pact with the Karnataka government[29] in February 2017.[30] In April 2017, Sanjeev Gupta's Liberty House Group announced it had agreed to acquire ArcelorMittal's Georgetown Steelworks in South Carolina.[29] It is ranked 123 in the 2017 Fortune Global 500 ranking of the world's biggest corporations.[4]
By March 2017, ArcelorMittal was leading a consortium bidding for Ilva.[31] An Italian company, Ilva owns the Taranto steelworks in southern Italy, which has Europe's largest steel output. The steelworks had been accused of toxic emissions linked to local cancer rates, and had been nationalized by the government years prior.[32] The buyers were the AM Investco consortium, which beyond ArcelorMittal included Marcegaglia and Banca Intesa Sanpaolo.[32] In May 2017, ArcelorMittal was announced as the preferred bidder over a different consortium led by JSW Steel, after it was able to pledge a production increase and guarantee employment levels. The final decision was waiting on Italy’s ministry of economic development.[33] On June 5, 2017, ArcelorMittal won approval to purchase Ilva for €1.8 billion. In its bid, AM Investco had pledged to make investments into Ilva of €2.4bn until 2023.[32]
Products and activities[edit]

The company is involved in research and development, mining, and steel.[34] ArcelorMittal in 2016 produced around 90 million tons of steel.[27] As of May 2017, the company made 200 unique steel grades for automotive purposes, half of which were introduced since 2007.[35] Among the steel varieties are Usibor 2000, which the company announced in June 2016 and released later that year. Upon release, the high-strength automotive steel was said to be about one-third stronger than other steels then available for carmaking.[25]
Company structure[edit]
Lakshmi Mittal (owner of Mittal Steel) is the chairman and CEO. His family owns 40% of the shares and voting shares in the company.[36] After a $3 billion rights issue earlier in April 2016, the company by the 21 April 2016 had a share value of 16,616 million euros, distributed in 3,065,710,869 shares.[37]

History[edit]
2006-2008: Formation and scalebacks[edit]
ArcelorMittal was created by the takeover of Western European steel maker Arcelor (Spain, France, and Luxembourg) by Indian-owned multinational steel maker Mittal Steel in 2006, at a cost of €40.37 per share, approximately $33 billion total. Mittal Steel launched a hostile takeover bid which replaced a previous planned merger between Arcelor and Severstal, which had lacked sufficient shareholder approval. The resulting merged business was named ArcelorMittal and was headquartered in Luxembourg.[5][6] The resulting firm produced approximately 10% of the world's steel, and was by far the world's largest steel company. Total revenues in 2007 were $105 billion.[7][8]
The company earned revenues of $105 billion in 2007.[8] By February 2008, the company had 320,000 employees in 60 countries.[8] In October 2008, the market capitalisation of ArcelorMittal was over $30 billion,[9] after peaking at $32.5 billion in September 2008.[2] At the end of 2008, the company reported operating income of around $12 billion.[10]
In December 2008, ArcelorMittal announced several plant closings, including the Bethlehem Steel plant in Lackawanna, New York, and LTV Steel in Hennepin, Illinois.[citation needed] After purchase of Kryvorizhstal, Ukraine's largest steel producer, employment was scaled back from 57,000 employees to 30,000.[citation needed]
2011-2014: Losses and Senegal agreement[edit]
In 2010, the company's operating income had fallen to $4.9 billion, with sales down 10 percent from the year earlier, and income down 50 percent as steel prices slumped.[10] In 2011, the company began curtailing its European production to match the reduced demand for steel.[10] It also sold Skyline Steel and Astralloy to a rival, Nucor, for $605 million.[10] On 26 January 2011, the stainless steel division split off as a new company, Aperam.[citation needed] As of 2012[update], due to overcapacity and reduced demand in Europe it had idled 9 of 25 blast furnaces;[10] in October 2012 it permanently shut down two blast furnaces at Florange, France.[11] On October 31, 2012, the company reported a third-quarter loss of $709 million as compared to a $659 million profit for the same period a year ago, citing the slow down in China's economy.[12] In 2012 ArcelorMittal had $22 billion of debt.[10]
In January 2013, ArcelorMittal bid $1.5 billion to acquire ThyssenKrupp AG's rolling mill in Calvert, Alabama, United States.[13] On February 26, 2014, ThyssenKrupp sold their Calvert carbon steel facility to ArcelorMittal and Nippon Steel for $1.55 billion,[14] as a new joint venture.[15] The facility was renamed AM/NS Calvert through the 50/50 joint partnership with Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp.[16] The firm also entered into a $2.2 billion contract to develop an iron ore deposit in Senegal. This included construction of a 750 km (466 mi) railway line. After stalling on the contract and failing to build according to schedule the Government of Senegal sued.[17] In September 2013, the government of Senegal won a court case before an international tribunal to rescind a $2.2 billion deal with ArcelorMittal after the company suspended work on an iron ore mine in the country.[18] In June 2014, the International Chamber of Commerce's arbitration court in Paris awarded Senegal $150 million.[17]
Dealing with price and demand fluctuations in the steel market, from 2012 to 2014 ArcelorMittal restructured its European division by reducing employee numbers and closing plants.[19] In May, 2014, ArcelorMittal, citing economic self-interest, declared its opposition to sanctions on Russia.[20] As of June 2014, ArcelorMittal accounted for 7 percent of world steel production. After being shut out of the Chinese steel industry in 2005 along with other foreign companies, in 2014 the company announced it was planning new plants in China.[21] In 2014, the company had an annual crude steel production of 98.1 million tons.[3]
2008-2016: Price fixing convictions[edit]
Following an investigation first launched in 2008, in August 2016 the South African Competition Commission found the company guilty of price fixing. ArcelorMittal was fined US$110.9 million, and as part of the settlement also agreed to invest R4.64 billion in capital over five years.[22] According to the findings, the firm had been part of a 17 steel member groups nicknamed "Club Zürich" that later became known as "Club Europe." Between January 1984 and September 2002, the companies fixed the market, prices, and exchanged confidential corporate information. According to a European Union Commission Vice-President, it was "amazing" how the cartel "abused nearly the entire European construction market for such a long time and for such a vital product."[23] Fines were particularly high for the firm owing to two prior convictions.[citation needed]
2015-2016: Recent acquisitions[edit]
In 2015, the company had a net loss of $7.9 billion.[24] Between February 2015 and February 2016, share value dropped 60%, making the company the "worst performer" in the FTSEurofirst300 index. The CEO said the company had performed poorly in 2015 due to "Chinese exports depressing prices."[2] Early in 2016,[24] the company announced it had raised $3 billion in new investment capital to help reduce debt[25] to $11.7 billion of debt.[24] In early 2016[24] the company also announced a program to boost core profit by $3 billion by 2020 "through a mixture of cost-cutting, increased production and a focus on higher-value forms of steel." Chairman Lakshmi Mittal announced doubled earnings the following year in May 2017.[26] Along with the increase in capital, the company also sold its 35% stake in Gestamp Automacion for $979 million, with the goal of reducing ArcelorMittal's debt to less than $12 billion.[2] By February 2016, the company made about 6% of the world's steel.[2] It ranked 108th in the 2016 Fortune Global 500 ranking of the world's biggest corporations.[4]
In February 2017 ArcelorMittal announced its first annual profits in five years.[27] In February 2017, ArcelorMittal and Votorantim announced plans to combine their long steel operations in Brazil. Under the deal, Votorantim Siderurgia became a subsidiary of ArcelorMittal Brasil.[27] In late May 2017, ArcelorMittal and the Steel Authority of India Ltd (SAIL) agreed on preliminary terms to form a $913 million joint venture to export a fifth of the auto-grade steel made by the venture.[28] In March 2017, the company proposed a new USD $6.5 billion steel project in Karnataka, after entering into a pact with the Karnataka government[29] in February 2017.[30] In April 2017, Sanjeev Gupta's Liberty House Group announced it had agreed to acquire ArcelorMittal's Georgetown Steelworks in South Carolina.[29] It is ranked 123 in the 2017 Fortune Global 500 ranking of the world's biggest corporations.[4]
By March 2017, ArcelorMittal was leading a consortium bidding for Ilva.[31] An Italian company, Ilva owns the Taranto steelworks in southern Italy, which has Europe's largest steel output. The steelworks had been accused of toxic emissions linked to local cancer rates, and had been nationalized by the government years prior.[32] The buyers were the AM Investco consortium, which beyond ArcelorMittal included Marcegaglia and Banca Intesa Sanpaolo.[32] In May 2017, ArcelorMittal was announced as the preferred bidder over a different consortium led by JSW Steel, after it was able to pledge a production increase and guarantee employment levels. The final decision was waiting on Italy’s ministry of economic development.[33] On June 5, 2017, ArcelorMittal won approval to purchase Ilva for €1.8 billion. In its bid, AM Investco had pledged to make investments into Ilva of €2.4bn until 2023.[32]
Products and activities[edit]

The company is involved in research and development, mining, and steel.[34] ArcelorMittal in 2016 produced around 90 million tons of steel.[27] As of May 2017, the company made 200 unique steel grades for automotive purposes, half of which were introduced since 2007.[35] Among the steel varieties are Usibor 2000, which the company announced in June 2016 and released later that year. Upon release, the high-strength automotive steel was said to be about one-third stronger than other steels then available for carmaking.[25]
Company structure[edit]
Lakshmi Mittal (owner of Mittal Steel) is the chairman and CEO. His family owns 40% of the shares and voting shares in the company.[36] After a $3 billion rights issue earlier in April 2016, the company by the 21 April 2016 had a share value of 16,616 million euros, distributed in 3,065,710,869 shares.[37]

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
