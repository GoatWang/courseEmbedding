In a just published Form 13, filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Microbot Medical Inc. (NASDAQ:MBOT) reported that Gadot Harel has picked up 3,820,664 of common stock as of 2017-06-20.
The acquisition brings the aggregate amount owned by Gadot Harel to a total of 3,820,664 representing a 11.09% stake in the company.
For those not familiar with the company, Microbot Medical Inc., formerly StemCells, Inc., is a medical device company. The Company specializes in the researching, designing, developing and commercializing transformational micro-robotic medical technologies leveraging the artificial and natural lumens within the human body. It is engaged in developing its two product candidates: the Self Cleaning Shunt (SCS) for the treatment of hydrocephalus and normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), and TipCAT, a self-propelling, semi-disposable endoscope that the Company is developing for use in colonoscopy procedures. Its ViRob technology is an autonomous crawling micro-robot, which can be controlled remotely or within the body. The Microbot SCS device is a robotic system designed as the ventricular catheter portion of a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt system. The Company’s TipCAT is an endoscope that provides see and treat capabilities within tubular lumens in the human body, such as the colon, blood vessels and the urinary tract.
A glance at Microbot Medical Inc. (NASDAQ:MBOT)’s key stats reveals a current market capitalization of $39.38 Million based on $28.38 Million shares outstanding and a price at last close of $1.43 per share.
Looking at insider activity, there are a few transactions worth noting.
Specifically, on 2016-03-14, Schiffman picked up 166,000 at a purchase price of $0.30. This brings their total holding to 1,599,717 as of the date of the filing.
On the sell side, the most recent transaction saw Lewkowicz unload 71,224 shares at a sale price of $1.67. This brings their total holding to 3,078,214.
It’s possible to gauge a company’s potential by tracking the activity of its major holders, as well as checking in on insider activity such as those transactions listed above. We’ll be keeping an Microbot Medical Inc. (NASDAQ:MBOT) as things move forward to see if its progress aligns with these transactions.
