With company having unique models and business goals, Core-Mark wants to ensure the establishment of a long-term relationship with their clients.
Much as many of the largest distributing companies do, Core-Mark provides a variety of services and following are a few examples of the various business units that Core-Mark employs to be able to influence many different sectors of the market.
Business Units:

History[edit]
Core-Mark was started in San Francisco in 1888 by the Glaser brothers.[2] After multi-generational ownership, the Glaser family sold the company to David Gillespie in 1974, who took the company public by listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 1984. By late 1987, private equity firms were an integral part of the ownership and the company went private in 1989. Core-Mark remained private until June 2002 when it was sold to Fleming Companies, Inc. Less than one year later, in April 2003, Fleming filed for bankruptcy, taking Core-Mark with them. By August 2004, Core-Mark had emerged from the Fleming bankruptcy under the direction of President and CEO J. Michael Walsh. The company went public again in 2005 and listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. Walsh remained the CEO until his retirement in January 2013. His successor, Thomas B. Perkins, continues to lead the company.

History[edit]
Core-Mark was started in San Francisco in 1888 by the Glaser brothers.[2] After multi-generational ownership, the Glaser family sold the company to David Gillespie in 1974, who took the company public by listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange in 1984. By late 1987, private equity firms were an integral part of the ownership and the company went private in 1989. Core-Mark remained private until June 2002 when it was sold to Fleming Companies, Inc. Less than one year later, in April 2003, Fleming filed for bankruptcy, taking Core-Mark with them. By August 2004, Core-Mark had emerged from the Fleming bankruptcy under the direction of President and CEO J. Michael Walsh. The company went public again in 2005 and listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange. Walsh remained the CEO until his retirement in January 2013. His successor, Thomas B. Perkins, continues to lead the company.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
