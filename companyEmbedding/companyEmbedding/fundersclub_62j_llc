Background


We believe people are our greatest asset and have forged bonds with entrepreneurs and leadership teams across the technology industry ecosystem.
During the past two decades we have established relationships at leading research universities, government laboratories, incubators, and most importantly close ties with our entrepreneurs. Access through these channels affords  us powerful visibility to identify and capitalize on transformative technology themes before they become mainstream.  Signatures Capital is focused on leading edge trends driven by innovation, and we seek to partner with best-in-class entrepreneurs bringing bold ideas and products to market. Signatures Capital has committed to donate a significant portion of its carried interest via FundersClub (15%, or 60% of its carried interest) to charitable causes to increase the social impact of its activities.ABOUT BOBBYBobby
