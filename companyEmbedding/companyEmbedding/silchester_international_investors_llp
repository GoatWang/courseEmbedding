Silchester International Investors investment philosophy























We focus on maximising intrinsic value which we define as the earnings, assets and dividends provided by our companies and aggregated within the portfolio. We implement this by a strong price discipline - lower multiples of earnings, assets and dividends means more earnings, assets and dividends at the outset - and by a quality appraisal which seeks to identify companies capable of increasing earnings, assets and dividends by their own efforts. We believe that a successful accumulation of intrinsic value leads to a good investment return. Silchester believes that this approach, a focus on one product, our independence as an investment firm and our commitment to limiting client assets and client numbers are important strengths.

SILCHESTER  |  Roman origins
















© English Heritage
      





“Behind the legions rose the cities on which Roman civilisation depended: rustic   miniatures of Rome, even in this remote frontier land, with neat   chess-board-pattern streets, forums and temples, porticoed town-halls and   amphitheatres, public baths, aqueducts and drains.  The capital of the   Catuvellauni became Verulamium, or, in modern English, St. Albans; that of the   Atrebates of the Thames valley Calleva Atrebatum or Silchester; that of the   Iceni Venta Icenorum or Caistor-next Norwich; that of the Dumnonii Isca   Dumnonorum or Exeter.  Even the wild Silures of Wales built Venta Silures or   Caerwent and boasted of the little garrison-town of Caerleon with its golden   roofs and towers.  In these minute but elegant tribal capitals traders built   shops, and tribesmen brought their crops and cattle to markets and assembled at   sacred seasons to sacrifice to their local gods”.
- The Story of England ‘Makers of the Realm’ - Arthur   Bryant, Harper Collins

Kiltearn Partners
Kiltearn Partners LLP was incorporated in 2011 by Murdo Murchison and his founding partners, with the support of Silchester International Investors. 
Kiltearn offers a single global equity program, managed with a disciplined value investment philosophy. Kiltearn's Chief Investment Officer, Murdo Murchison, was a senior investment professional with Templeton Global Advisers for 15 years, latterly as the second manager after Sir John Templeton of the firm’s flagship product, the Templeton Growth Fund. In that environment, he had the opportunity to successfully implement a disciplined value investment philosophy with a global mandate. The formation of Kiltearn has allowed Murdo and his partners to implement the same time-tested value philosophy in a firm which offers a strong alignment of interests between the partners of Kiltearn and its institutional clients.
      
Kiltearn Partners LLP is based in Edinburgh, Scotland, with a client service/marketing office in Pittsburgh, U.S.A.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year




How many days after the end-of-quarter date before doing the backtest? (0 - 60) 

DAYS





      Or use day whenever the filing was submitted to the SEC
      (or the last filing when using a group of funds):
Starting Quarter

      By default backtester will test your strategy using all available dates going back to 2001 (for subscribers only).
      You can optionally adjust when the backtest actually starts.
