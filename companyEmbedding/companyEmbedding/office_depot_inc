Whether it’s at home or in a business setting, the perfect office ambience requires a variety of essentials for everyday tasks. And even your desk accessories can express your style and personality. A desk, chair and computer are just the start of a productive workspace. Whether you work in a cubicle, a private office or a shared workstation, Office Depot has the desk and office accessories you need to stay focused and efficient. Need file sorters or other desktop organizers? Desk organizers help to keep items neat and accessible. And accessorizing your space with lamps is both decorative and functional. Check out the wide selection offered by Office Depot to fit your needs and to outfit a well-put-together office with stylish accessories including clocks and other must-have necessities.
Not sure where to start?
The volume of detail involved in planning a home or small office can be overwhelming and knowing where to start is often the hardest part. Whether you need guidance with selecting the right furniture to fit your space, taste and budget or you simply can't spare the time to tackle the project by yourself, Office Depot is here to help bring your vision to life. Choose from any number of service offerings ranging from assistance with product selection all the way to delivery and assembly, and our Furniture Services Account Managers will help you navigate the nuances of getting your office up and running.
Office Accessories
Your office is your home away from home. And for many small business owners, the office is actually in your home! Create a pleasant environment in either setting with just the right accessories. Display one or more framed art pieces to personalize your office or cubicle. Whether you like inspirational quotes, photographs or abstract drawings, you'll find the perfect print. Remember that wall clocks are for much more than telling time. Select clocks in attention-grabbing colors with super-sized digits to bring a bright palette to your walls or select from a variety clocks with modern, clean lines. You'll also find an assortment of practical office accessories, including coat and umbrella hooks for cubicle partitions, to help your workspace stay neat. And remember to give guests a place to hang coats with hooks, racks and hangers too.
Office Décor
Find everything needed to turn a drab office into a stylish one! Do so with mirrors and wall art in a variety of styles, along with artificial plants for a pop of green. Add fountains, area rugs and fireplaces for a sophisticated ambience.
Which type of lamp do you prefer?
Lamps
Brighten any space with the inviting glow of a floor lamp or focus illumination on a work surface with a clip-on, clamp, desk or table lamp. Ceiling lamps, under-cabinet lights and track lighting enhance brightness throughout a room, and lamp sets make it easy to create a cohesive look. Daylight lamps deliver bright, natural light that mimics the sun, and magnifier lamps make short work of small text and details. From traditional to modern, rich woods and sleek metals, you'll find a variety of lamps and lighting to keep your office well lit.
Floor Lamps
Floor lamps can be the perfect solution for primary or secondary lighting. Is your desk too small for a lamp? Choose a floor lamp with an adjustable neck to direct light to exactly where it’s needed. You'll also find height-adjustable and multi-light styles. If you prefer indirect lighting, a torchiere floor lamp is a popular alternative to ceiling-mounted fixtures. These floor lamp models shine upward to provide softer lighting.
Desk Lamps
Whether you're staying late at the office or simply need more light on a document at any time of day, use a desk lamp to direct light where you need it most. From Banker's lamps and task lamps to models with hinged, curving or spiral necks, you'll find the perfect desk lamp at Office Depot in whatever style, height or color you require.
Light Bulbs
If lamps are must-have office accessories, then light bulbs are must-have lamp accessories! From standard to "greener" bulbs, there are a range of lighting options to outfit lamps and lighting fixtures. Choose from traditional incandescent, compact fluorescent, full spectrum or halogen bulbs and LED light bulbs in many wattages. You'll also find fluorescent tubes and floodlight bulbs.

Desk Accessories

View all 1218 items






















Keep essential office supplies, tools and paperwork neatly arranged, well-organized and within easy reach with office desk accessories. Made to prioritize workplace organization, the desk accessories in this collection help streamline professional spaces, so tasks and responsibilities can be completed efficiently. Enhance the workday by selecting from a wide variety of organization accessories.
Desk Organizers And Desk Organizer Collections
All-in-one desk organizers combine multiple compartments, slots and storage features, making them well-suited for work areas with limited space. Desk organizer collections are made up of multiple pieces that all coordinate with one another, so you can present a unified, seamless appearance while staying organized.
Drawer Organizers And Desk Trays
Eliminate clutter and disorder in any office drawer with a drawer organizer that keeps concealed supplies neatly contained within various compartments. Stackable or fixed desk trays make sure that paperwork can be catalogued and sorted through quickly.
File Organizers And Wall File Organizers
Between file folders, bound documents and loose paperwork, it can be difficult to keep track of assignments throughout the day. With a desktop file organizer or a mounted wall file holder, documents can be sorted into different workflows and rapidly retrieved as needed.
Magazine Holders
Create a guest-friendly reception room or waiting area with a magazine holder, which keeps periodicals, journals, magazines and other literature options clearly visible and easy to grab. Select a floor-standing rack to house a number of magazine titles, or consider a single-pocket desktop holder for simple distribution of brochures and pamphlets.
Business Card Holders
Stay prepared at networking events and professional meetings with business card holders. A business card wallet houses multiple copies of a business card, so they can easily be handed out at events with every handshake. A business card organizer makes it simple to catalog business cards collected from associates and professionals for later reference.

Pens, Pencils & Markers






Pens, Pencils & Markers

View all 4531 items




















Whether you're at home, work, or school, you'll most likely need to express yourself through written communication. Pens, pencils and markers are useful everyday tools to help you get through all of your written tasks, whether you're jotting down a quick note, filling out an important form or working on a project or assignment. Browse our extensive selection of writing utensils and accessories and stock up on what you will need for daily use.
Pens
No matter what your needs, the right pens and pen refills are within your grasp. Ballpoint pens in stick or retractable styles are available in a variety of ink colors for everyday use. Take your pick from disposable ballpoint stick pens, refillable executive models and everything in between.
For smooth, flowing ink performance, try some rollerball pens. Select from a number of point sizes for either thin, fine lines or broad, bold lines to make a statement. If smooth, consistent strokes are what you’re looking for, a felt tip will do the trick. You’ll find felt tip pens in various ink colors and point sizes, so you can use the pen that best suits the needs of the tasks at hand.
Gel pens are a great pick for long-lasting, quick drying, vibrant ink. Options include gel pens with fade-, water-resistant and acid-free ink, so they're safe to use on even your most important documents. If you prefer a stylish, long-lasting pen with ink that flows smoothly, fountain pens and ink cartridges are an elegant, long-term writing solution. For special hobby or craft writing applications, try calligraphy pens in disposable or refillable styles.
Specialty pens are also available for tasks that go beyond everyday writing needs such as counterfeit detectors for currency and security pens that can be attached to desks and tabletops to help prevent loss.
Pencils
A wide array of pencils makes it easy to find what you need including wood and mechanical pencils. When selecting pencils, consider the various tip sizes, colors and styles. Stock up on standard No. 2 wood pencils, fine mechanical pencils, and colorfully designed pencils that will add interest to any desk or classroom.
Markers and Highlighters
Whatever your needs, you’ll find the right markers and highlighters here. Choose from permanent markers in a variety of colors and point sizes for long-lasting ink performance. If you're looking to focus on important lines of text, opt for colorful highlighter pens that will help you draw attention to the right passages.
For those important presentations, overhead and chart markers can add color and interest to your next meeting. For whiteboards, wet and dry erase markers will help make sure that you get your point across. Choose from a collection of art and specialty markers for arts, crafts and other applications to help you express yourself on different surfaces.
Correction Fluid and Tape and Erasers
For correcting written mistakes in ink, pick up some correction fluid, pens and tape. These tools will allow you to easily cover ink marks and then write corrections over them.
For correcting mistakes in pencil, you’ll want to keep an assortment of erasers on hand, from pencil-top to cube and pen erasers as well as refills, so that you can easily erase and correct those occasional written errors.
Pencil Sharpeners
Keep all of your pencils ready for use with pencil sharpeners. For quick and smooth sharpening, choose electric or battery-operated models. With an array of features and styles, you're sure to find the right sharpener for your desk at home or in a busy office or classroom. For those who prefer manual pencil sharpeners choose a mountable sharpener to place in a prominent location in your office or classroom or a lightweight, compact handheld model that will easily fit into a purse, briefcase or bag.

Binders & Accessories

View all 3024 items




















Binders and binder accessories, such as binder rings, are a great way to store and organize loose papers. They make it easy to flip through documents to find the specific information you need, so you can scan it to make a digital backup or photocopy it to keep a hardcopy close at hand. Check out a wide selection of office supplies to find a variety of items that help keep things organized in the office or at home.
Binders
Binders provide a simple paperwork storage solution and come in many sizes to suit your needs. If your binders are stored on a shelf, look for spine label holders that identify which one has the documents needed. Inside pockets provide added storage space, and sheet lifters help make sure papers aren't damaged by the binder's rings.
Dividers And Tabs
Dividers and tabs help you organize documents within your binder more easily, so you can find what you need in a flash. Look for tabbed dividers that are easy to label, or consider untabbed dividers for extra flexibility.
Sheet Protectors
Important documents can be exposed to challenging conditions, even in a binder. Sheet protectors help shield against dirt, liquids and other dangers, so documents stay legible.
Clipboards
Clipboards are designed for people who are always on the move. They hold important documents securely and serve as a mobile writing surface for taking notes almost anywhere.
Report Covers And Portfolios
Your big proposal took a lot of time to prepare, so use a report cover to help make sure it looks neat and professional when submitted to your boss.
Laminating
Frequently handled documents can be laminated for extra protection against wear and tear. Lamination can help shield against liquids and other stains as well, so your papers stay neat and legible.
Binder Accessories
Accessories can help increase the versatility of your binders. Use a pouch to keep writing tools close at hand, or labels to make sure you can find information more easily.
Specialty Binders
If shelf space is limited in your office, look for hanging binders that can be placed in a filing cabinet. When there's a need for tracking financial transactions, ledgers and post binders provide easy organization.
Binding
Creating a professional-looking report for a presentation can help win that big new client. Binding combs give a clean, finished look that can set you apart.

  "Office Depot is very appreciative of the David Weekley Homes ‘Partners        of Choice’ award. Honors such as this showcase Office Depot’s continued        customer-centric philosophy" 



BOCA RATON, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Office Depot, Inc. (NASDAQ: ODP), a leading global provider of office 
      products, services, and solutions, and parent company of Office 
      Depot and OfficeMax, today was recognized for its outstanding product 
      quality and service by David Weekley Homes, the nation’s largest 
      privately held home builder. This marks the tenth consecutive year that 
      Office Depot has received the esteemed “A,A Partners of Choice” award 
      given this year to only 15 of the home builder’s suppliers.
    

      “Office Depot is very appreciative of the David Weekley Homes ‘Partners 
      of Choice’ award. Honors such as this showcase Office Depot’s continued 
      customer-centric philosophy,” said Steve Calkins, executive vice 
      president, business solutions division for Office Depot, Inc. “We are 
      committed to providing great value on supplies and services to help our 
      customers efficiently operate and grow their business.”
    

      Now in its twelfth year, the “Partners of Choice” award is handed out to 
      suppliers based on their quality and service as rated by David Weekley 
      Homes' team members on a quarterly basis. The award is based on a 
      comprehensive supplier evaluation platform, the heart of which is the 
      “National Trading Partner Survey.” Approximately 200 companies 
      participate in the program that allows team members to rate the 
      suppliers’ effectiveness in delivering quality and service to the 
      organization.
    

      “Due to the length and breadth of our process there are no shortcuts to 
      success,” said Bill Justus, vice president supply chain services for 
      David Weekley Homes and executive sponsor of the supplier evaluation 
      platform. “As an award winner, our friends at Office Depot had to 
      successfully manage thousands of transactions throughout the year. 
      Through their actions they have proven to be world-class in delivering 
      quality and service to our team.”
    

      In compiling the results of the National Trading Partner Survey, each 
      company’s numeric scores are averaged, and then an alpha rating is 
      assigned relative to its ranking as compared with all of Weekley’s other 
      national trading partners. Alpha ratings range from A to F in 20 percent 
      increments. The “Partners of Choice” Award is presented to suppliers who 
      maintained either an “A,A” rating for both quality and service for the 
      previous twelve months or an “A” rating in either quality or service.
    

      Office Depot has been a partner of David Weekley Homes since 2002, 
      providing office 
      supplies and services.

BOCA RATON, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Office Depot, Inc. (NASDAQ: ODP), a leading global provider of office 
      products, services, and solutions, through its Office Depot and 
      OfficeMax brands, today announced the launch of the WorkPro® Flex 
      collection. The new product line offers flexible, multi-use table tops 
      and legs that are ideal for desks, training rooms, conference tables and 
      other unique needs of businesses.
    


      Available today exclusively at Office Depot and OfficeMax retail 
      locations and online at officedepot.com/workproflex, 
      the collection addresses the increasing demand for entrepreneurs and 
      businesses of all sizes to maximize the use of each and every part of 
      the office.
    

      “Businesses are changing how they use office space, and flexibility is 
      more important than ever,” said Petter Knutrud, senior vice president of 
      merchandising for Office Depot, Inc. “On a given day, the same room – 
      and furniture – may need to serve as a conference room, a training room, 
      and a space for a small team breakout session. Office Depot understands 
      the value of office space and the need for adaptability and is excited 
      to launch the WorkPro Flex collection in order to help businesses meet 
      their workspace needs and inspire creativity and collaboration.”
    

      The WorkPro Flex collection provides everything businesses need to 
      transform their office:
    


Flexibility: With more flexibility than traditional furniture 
        systems, the collection gives users complete freedom to configure 
        workspaces in ways that meet their changing needs. Choose from five 
        versatile table shapes, two professional finishes and three leg 
        styles, including a sit-to-stand height-adjustable option. Set up your 
        flexible office furniture in minutes, and quickly change or 
        reconfigure the tables whenever a new need arises.
      

Quality: Each element of the collection has been carefully 
        designed by furniture experts to ensure the highest quality and 
        optimal function. From heavy gauge tubular steel legs to scratch- and 
        impact-resistant melamine tops, these heavy-duty work surfaces deliver 
        durability, functionality, and quality craftsmanship that is built to 
        last. All pieces in the collection also meet or exceed ANSI/BIFMA 
        performance quality standards for safety and durability established by 
        the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the Business and 
        Institutional Furniture Manufacturers Association (BIFMA).
      

Surprising Affordability: Commercial-grade furniture is often 
        out of reach for many businesses given the high price tag, but with 
        the new collection, you no longer have to choose between quality and 
        affordability.
      

Customization: Whether you’re looking for furniture for a 
        multi-user open floor plan, a private office space, or meeting rooms, 
        the WorkPro Flex collection offers a versatile foundation of options.

First Quarter Division Results


North American Retail Division


      Retail Division sales were $1.4 billion in the first quarter of 2017 
      compared to $1.5 billion in the prior year period. The decline in sales 
      was due to the impact of planned store closures over the past twelve 
      months and a 5% decline in comparable store sales in the quarter versus 
      the prior year due primarily to lower store traffic.

      Retail Division operating income was $112 million, or 8.2% of sales, in 
      the first quarter of 2017, compared to $102 million, or 6.8% of sales, 
      in the first quarter of 2016. Both operating income and margins for the 
      quarter increased versus the prior year, despite lower sales, due 
      primarily to cost savings and efficiencies realized from the company’s 
      store closure program and Comprehensive Business Review. The improvement 
      was driven by an increase in gross margin rate and a decrease in 
      selling, general and administrative expenses including payroll and 
      advertising that more than offset the negative flow-through impact of 
      lower sales.
    

      During the first quarter the company closed 2 stores and ended the 
      quarter with a total of 1,439 retail stores in the North American Retail 
      Division.
    

North American Business Solutions Division


      Business Solutions Division sales were $1.3 billion in the first quarter 
      of 2017, a decline of 4% in constant currency compared to the first 
      quarter of 2016. The sales decline was driven by the Contract channel as 
      sales in the Direct channel were approximately flat compared to the 
      prior year period. The sales decline in the Contract channel was 
      primarily due to customer attrition during the period of business 
      disruption related to the prolonged acquisition attempt in 2016. In the 
      Direct channel, online sales increased but were offset by the ongoing 
      reduction in catalog sales through our call centers, as well as 
      increased utilization from the company’s buy online-pick up in store 
      program, whereby sales are reported in the North American Retail 
      Division.

      Business Solutions Division operating income was $58 million, or 4.4% of 
      sales, in the first quarter of 2017 compared to $46 million, or 3.4% of 
      sales, in the first quarter of 2016. The increase in both operating 
      income and margin was primarily driven by cost savings and efficiencies 
      including lower selling, general and administrative expenses, which, 
      coupled with a flat gross margin rate, more than offset the negative 
      flow-through impact of lower sales.
    

Sale of Australia, New Zealand and South Korea Businesses


      As recently announced, Office Depot reached an agreement to sell its 
      business in Australia and New Zealand, which is expected to close within 
      the next few months upon conclusion of the regulatory review. The 
      company also announced on April 26, 2017 the completed sale of its 
      business in South Korea. The company’s international business located in 
      mainland China continues to be actively marketed for sale.
    

      The company’s sourcing and trading operations in Asia, which management 
      plans to retain, contributed $3 million in sales and an operating loss 
      of $1 million in the first quarter of 2017. These results are reported 
      as an “Other” segment outside of the North American segments.
    

Corporate Results


      Corporate includes support staff services and certain other expenses 
      that are not allocated to the company’s operating divisions. Unallocated 
      expenses decreased to $22 million in the first quarter of 2017 compared 
      to $24 million in the first quarter of 2016.
    

Balance Sheet and Cash Flow


      As of April 1, 2017, Office Depot had $0.7 billion in cash and cash 
      equivalents and approximately $1.0 billion available under the Amended 
      and Restated Credit Agreement, for total available liquidity of 
      approximately $1.7 billion. Total debt was $381 million, excluding $792 
      million of non-recourse debt related to the credit-enhanced timber 
      installment notes.
    

      For the first quarter of 2017, cash provided by operating activities of 
      continuing operations was $88 million, including the impact of $19 
      million in OfficeMax merger–related costs and $19 million in 
      restructuring costs. Capital expenditures were $30 million in the first 
      quarter of 2017, $7 million of which were related to the merger 
      integration.
    

      During the first quarter, the company paid a quarterly cash dividend of 
      $0.025 per share on March 15, 2017 for approximately $13 million.
    

      Office Depot repurchased approximately 2 million shares at a total cost 
      of $10 million in the first quarter of 2017. Since the share repurchase 
      program began in May 2016, Office Depot has repurchased approximately 39 
      million shares at a total cost of $142 million, with $108 million 
      remaining available for repurchase under the current $250 million 
      buyback authorization.
    

Outlook (2)


      Office Depot continues to expect total company sales in 2017 to be lower 
      than 2016, primarily due to the impact of planned store closures, prior 
      year contract customer losses, continued challenging market conditions 
      and returning to a 52 week fiscal year. However, the company expects the 
      rate of sales decline to improve throughout 2017 based on improvements 
      in customer retention, implementation of new customer wins and continued 
      growth in the contract channel sales pipeline.
    

      The company expects to be substantially complete with the OfficeMax 
      integration and realize the majority of the remaining synergy benefits 
      by the end of 2017. Merger integration expenses are estimated to total 
      approximately $45 million in 2017 with approximately $25 million in 
      capital expenditures.
    

      Office Depot announced a number of cost saving programs in 2016 and 
      expects to deliver over $250 million in annual benefits by the end of 
      2018. About half of these benefits are anticipated to be realized in 
      2017. In addition, the company estimates it will incur up to 
      approximately $125 million in costs to implement the cost saving 
      programs. With more than one-third of these costs already incurred in 
      2016, the company anticipates the majority of the remaining costs to be 
      incurred in 2017.
    

      The company continues to expect adjusted operating income of 
      approximately $500 million in fiscal 2017, including funding a number of 
      strategic initiatives to grow the business throughout the year. The 2017 
      target is a comparable year-over-year increase of about 10%, excluding 
      the $15 million estimated 53rd week operating income benefit 
      realized in 2016.
    

      In 2017, capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $200 
      million including investments to support the company’s critical 
      priorities and the Store of the Future test format. Depreciation and 
      amortization is expected to be approximately $150 million in 2017.
    

      Office Depot anticipates free cash flow(3) from continuing 
      operations to be more than $300 million in 2017.
    

      The company anticipates an estimated cash tax rate of 15% as the company 
      continues to utilize available tax operating loss carry forwards and 
      credits and expects a non-GAAP effective tax rate of approximately 41% 
      in fiscal 2017, dependent on the mix and timing of income.
    

(2) The company’s outlook for 2017 included in this release, 
      includes expected adjusted operating income, a non-GAAP number, which 
      excludes charges or credits not indicative of our core operations, which 
      may include but not be limited to merger integration expenses, 
      restructuring charges, executive transition costs, asset impairments, 
      and other significant items that currently cannot be predicted. The 
      exact amount of these charges or credits are not currently determinable, 
      but may be significant. Accordingly, the company is unable to provide 
      equivalent reconciliations from GAAP to non-GAAP for these financial 
      measures.


(3) Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by 
      operating activities less capital expenditures.

OFFICE DEPOT, INC.

GAAP to Non-GAAP Reconciliations

(Unaudited)


      We report our results in accordance with accounting principles generally 
      accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). We also review certain financial 
      measures excluding impacts of transactions that are not related to our 
      core operations (“non-GAAP”). Management believes that the presentation 
      of these non-GAAP financial measures enhances the ability of its 
      investors to analyze trends in its business and provides a means to 
      compare periods that may be affected by various items that might obscure 
      trends or developments in its business. Management uses both GAAP and 
      non-GAAP measures to assist in making business decisions and assessing 
      overall performance. Non-GAAP measures help to evaluate programs and 
      activities that are intended to attract and satisfy customers, separate 
      from expenses and credits directly associated with Merger, 
      restructuring, and certain similar items. Certain non-GAAP measures are 
      also used for short and long-term incentive programs.
    

      Our measurement of these non-GAAP financial measures may be different 
      from similarly titled financial measures used by others and therefore 
      may not be comparable. These non-GAAP financial measures should not be 
      considered superior to the GAAP measures, but only to clarify some 
      information and assist the reader. We have included reconciliations of 
      this information to the most comparable GAAP measures in the tables 
      included within this material.
    

      The Company’s outlook for 2017 adjusted operating income excludes 
      charges or credits not indicative of our core operations, which may 
      include but not be limited to merger integration expenses, restructuring 
      charges, asset impairments, and other significant items that currently 
      cannot be predicted. The exact amount of these charges or credits are 
      not currently determinable, but may be significant. Accordingly, the 
      company is unable to provide a reconciliation to an equivalent operating 
      income outlook for 2017.

Note: The company released a majority of its deferred tax asset 
      valuation allowances in the U.S. for GAAP purposes in the third quarter 
      of 2016. The non-GAAP tax calculation removed the U.S. valuation 
      allowances beginning in 2015 because of cumulative income on a non-GAAP 
      basis. Additionally, the 2016 GAAP tax rate reflects impacts of the 
      Staples merger costs; such impacts are excluded for the non-GAAP tax 
      rate.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
