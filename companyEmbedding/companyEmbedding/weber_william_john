WEBER, William John (Rev.) - Encyclopedia Dubuque


















Encyclopedia

"Encyclopedia Dubuque is the online authority for all things Dubuque, written by the people who know the city best.”Marshall Cohen—researcher and producer, CNN

WEBER, William John (Rev.)

From Encyclopedia Dubuque

Jump to: navigation, search

 WEBER, William John. (Dubuque, IA- ).  Weber, founder of the Dubuque Rugby Club in 1970, graduated from the UNIVERSITY OF DUBUQUE Theological Seminary. He then graduated with a B.S. in psychology from Iowa State University in 1971. During seminary, he lived for six years as a non-vowed monk, attached to the New Melleray Trappist Monastery in Iowa. He worked and lived for those seminary years in relationship with their sister Trappistine convent, Our Lady of the Mississippi Abbey, whose chaplain, as well as the abbess, provided spiritual direction and mentoring.
In 1979 Weber was one of two ministers who spread the message of religion among those who lived in the Times Square area of New York City.  Living in a room at the Lamb's Club, once a famous off-Broadway actor's club purchased by the church in 1976, Weber was supported entirely by donations including those received from Dubuque churches. For five years he served in rescue and recovery efforts with addicts, prostitutes, teenage runaways and the homeless.
In 1984, Weber founded the New York Fellowship, an interdenominational ministry, which provided spiritual direction, counseling and pastoral care to leaders in the business and professional communities of the New York City area.
For more than a dozen years, Weber served as Chaplain for the World Series Champion New York Yankees. He was the co-founder of more than twenty-five inner-city ministries, including the East Harlem Little League, Youth Impact, Pregnancy Help, Brooklyn Little League, and Kids to Camp Program. He also was co-founder of the Amistad Mission Clinic and Orphanage in Bolivia.
