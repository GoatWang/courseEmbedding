Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1852 edition. Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper. Original Publisher: New York, D. Appleton and company 134 pages.  Bookseller Inventory # 453705629

        JUN-06-2012
      

        Gary E. Hendrickson Named Valspar Chairman
      

William L. Mansfield to Retire from Company's Board of DirectorsMinneapolis, Minn. - June 6, 2012 - The Valspar Corporation (NYSE:VAL) today announced that its Board of Directors elected Gary E. Hendrickson, Valspar's president and chief executive officer, to the additional role of chairman of the board, effective immediately. Hendrickson succeeds William L. Mansfield, who is retiring from the Board of Directors after serving as chairman since August 2007, as chief executive officer from 2005 to 2011 and as president from 2005 to 2008."Gary's proven leadership, deep understanding of the coatings industry and his vision for Valspar's long-term growth make him uniquely qualified to lead our Board," said Jeffrey H. Curler, chair of the Board's nominating and governance committee and the company's lead director. "His appointment completes the transition plan we have had in place since Gary became CEO a year ago. We thank Bill for his many contributions to Valspar and wish him well in his retirement."Hendrickson has served as president and as chief executive officer since June 2011. Prior to becoming CEO, he was Valspar's president and chief operating officer for three years.

William L. 1985 Watches: 50s vintage chronograph
William L. 1985 wants to democratize watches, breaking traditional codes by providing affordable quality watches. 
Design was inspired by an iconic 50s vintage Swiss chronograph, while modernizing the lines into a current one, with always attention to details. Oppositions, paradoxes that come together to create a unique product. 
William L. 1985 was founded by Guillaume Laidet, a young timepieces aficionado who use to work in the Swiss watch industry. After several years at the service of some of the most prestigious watchmaking companies, he decided to start his own brand, aiming at offering meaningful collections inspired by a 50s vintage chronograph that he inherited from his grand-grand-uncle. 
This family jewel, once restored, quickly caught the eyes of his friends but the price, for most of them, was a real deal breaker. This is exactly why William L. 1985 was born: to offer quality timepieces with classic designs for a very attractive price point.
For nearly a year and thanks to his many contacts within the watchmaking industry, Guillaume developed a modern and affordable version of his vintage chronograph. No pretending here! The brand does not hide its Chinese production. Each piece is conceived in Paris and manufactured in Shenzhen, enabling William L. 1985 to compete in this price range. 
To initiate his project, Guillaume naturally chose the crowdfunding option and rapidly got very positive feedbacks and more importantly a community that shares its philosophy and gathered around him. 
Thanks to you, it is now together that we continue to build William L. 1985 history...
