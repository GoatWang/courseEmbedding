Executive Leadership

 











					Executive Leadership	

HomeExecutive Leadership 






Nevada Gold & Casinos’ Executive Team brings together the strength and combined experience of a talented group of executives with diverse backgrounds and expertise.  Our management has extensive, hands-on, in-depth knowledge and experience with successful gaming operations, both large and small, in numerous domestic and international jurisdictions.  They are committed to personal service and attention to detail in all of their endeavors, and will continue to execute the corporate vision for enhancing shareholder value.
Nevada Gold Casinos has experienced significant recent growth and is now positioned for continued strong cash flow generation providing a solid foundation for future opportunities.
Michael P. Shaunnessy – President and CEO

Mr. Shaunnessy was appointed President and CEO of the Company in December 2012. Before joining Nevada Gold & Casinos, he was the Executive Vice President of Operations of MGM Resorts International. In that capacity he was the chief operating and financial officer overseeing all operations of MGM’s Railroad Pass and Gold Strike casino hotel properties, both in the Las Vegas area.
Prior to joining MGM, Mr. Shaunnessy served as Vice President of Administration of Monarch Casino Resorts, Inc. and Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Director of Full House Resorts, Inc., both publicly listed casino companies. Earlier in his career, Mr. Shaunnessy was Vice President of Finance for Primadonna Resorts, Inc., a Nevada-based casino and hospitality company, and served in various capacities with Aztar Corporation, formerly Ramada, Inc. A certified public accountant, he earned a B.A. in Business Administration from Lewis University and an M.S. in Accountancy from Northern Illinois University.
James Meier – CFO

Mr. Meier joined Nevada Gold as Vice President of Finance and CFO in November 2014. With over 15 years working with publicly traded companies including small cap gaming companies, his diversified experience includes card rooms, acquisitions, strategic planning and financial analysis, internal controls and SEC reporting, as well as hands-on experience in casino accounting and regulatory compliance.  A CPA and CMA, Mr. Meier earned his Master’s Degree from University of Nevada, Las Vegas and his Bachelor of Science degree in Business Administration from Minnesota State University.
Victor H. Mena — Vice President of Washington Operations

Mr. Mena has been involved in the Hospitality Industry since 1979 and has been involved in the Gaming Industry for the last 12 years. His career has spanned all aspects of the Restaurant Industry and has grown into him developing and running 9 mini-casinos in the state of Washington for Nevada Gold. In 2009 Washington Gold Casinos, a wholly-owed subsidiary of Nevada Gold, acquired its first 3 mini-casinos and appointed Mr. Mena as Chief Operating Officer of the properties.
As President of Operations, Mr. Mena was instrumental in the creation and development of these properties. In 2010 Nevada Gold acquired an additional 6 mini-casinos and Mr. Mena was instrumental in the turnaround of these newly acquired assets. In 2011 another mini-casino was added to the Washington Gold portfolio bringing the total to 10 locations. In October of 2012 Nevada Gold added Mr. Mena to their team as Vice President of Washington Operations.
Ernest E. East — Vice President and Chief Regulatory & Compliance Officer

Mr. East has more than 20 years of gaming experience. From 1998 until 2004 he was Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Chief Compliance Officer of Hyatt Gaming Services, LLC. He was most recently Chief Legal Officer of Global Trust Management, LLC, and prior to that, he was the Senior Vice President, General Counsel and Corporate Secretary of Sierra Pacific Resources. Mr. East also served as Executive Vice President, Secretary and General Counsel of Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts.

Harvard Economist Harry Dent Warns: “$700 Gold by 2018" | Economy and Markets












































































































Harvard Economist Warns “$700 Gold by 2018″


									By Harry Dent							



Investors are fleeing to gold in a desperate attempt to weather the recent market volatility… but is this long time “safe-haven” actually poised to collapse wiping out trillions of dollars of wealth in the process?
One highly respected Harvard economist is stating an emphatic “yes!”.
“While many economists will argue that gold is not in a bubble… and insist it will soar to $2,000, $5,000 and even $10,000, my research has said otherwise” says Harvard economist Harry Dent in his latest report. “I’ve never been more certain of anything in over 30 years of economic forecasting.”
Market volatility, worries over the Europe Central Bank, negative interest rates, and China are among a laundry list of events that are driving panicked masses to buy the yellow metal. But this is only inflating the gold bubble that is poised to pop at any moment, he says.
>>Related: Harvard Economist Warns: Get Out of Gold IMMEDIATELY and Buy This Instead
Dent, who pioneered a whole new science of economic forecasting in the early 1980’s has been able to accurately predict almost every major economic event over the past 30 years. —including the collapse of Japan, The Great Tech Boom of the 1990’s, and the 2008 market crash.
Now his latest prediction his proving controversial among financial circles across the country.
Traditionally investors flock to gold as a way to hedge against inflation. But according to Dent’s research, we’re about to see the exact opposite happen.
Dent warns that we are about to experience an economic crisis far worse than 2008 — the full-blown collapse of the stock market and massive deflation.
And that investors who attempt to hide their money in the “safe haven” of gold, could damage their wealth to an even greater degree.
>>Related: How To Get Rich From Deflation
This scenario was practically preordained — as far back as the mid-1990s when the bubble in stocks began and real estate followed and Baby Boomers were heading for their peak spending years into 2007.
“When you understand this event, including the fundamental reasons driving it, you need not panic. You will see there’s a tremendous upside to what will unfold over this decade and beyond.” Says Dent. “After all, when you’re able to know what’s coming – and position yourself accordingly – the years ahead could be prosperous times.”
What is Dent saying the one investment you need to buy right now to protect yourself, instead of gold is? Click here to watch his new presentation and find out.

        CASIN is an inhibitor of Cdc42 GTPase, a small GTPase of the Rho-subfamily that plays important roles in cytoskeleton organization, cell cycle progression, signal transduction, and vesicle trafficking. CASIN generated a rejuvenated phenotype of Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), reversing the aging-related and polarity phenotype of aged HSCs to that of young HSCs in vivo..
