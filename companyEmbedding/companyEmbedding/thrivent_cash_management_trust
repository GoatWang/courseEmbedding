A Happy Retirement Starts with a Smart Approach
You want a comfortable retirement. We have the tools to help you get there. Retirement accounts through Thrivent Mutual Funds can be part of building your nest egg for the long haul. We do this by offering three things:



The potential for growth with tax advantages



A variety of investment options



Earnings that can compound over time



Learn about our Retirement Accounts






Our Retirement Accounts


Traditional IRA

Traditional IRA
An individual retirement account in which contributions may be tax deductible. Earnings in your account accumulate tax deferred.  Distributions are taxed on withdrawal from the account.
Why it might be for you:

No Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) contribution limits
You think you will be in a lower tax bracket in retirement
You aren’t currently covered by an employer-sponsored plan

Learn moreLearn more about traditional IRAs



Roth IRA

Roth IRA
An individual retirement account to which you make after-tax contributions and if you meet certain qualifications, can take earnings out tax-free.
Why it might be for you:

Your 2016 adjusted gross income is less than $132,000 (2017: $133,000) for single tax filers or $194,000 (2017: $196,000) for joint filers
You think you will be in a higher tax bracket in retirement
You want to let your money remain invested as long as you want without being required to start withdrawals at a certain age

Simple is Putting All of Your Retirement Assets into One Place
The days of working for a single company your entire career have long passed. Chances are, you’ll have worked at a number of businesses by the time you retire. Which means that, like most people, you could have IRA and 401(k) assets scattered across several accounts and firms. Now may be the time to consider taking control of these important assets by rolling them into an IRA offered by Thrivent Mutual Funds.2 Potential benefits include:


Investment flexibility
Thrivent Mutual Funds provides a variety of investment options, some of which may not be available in your employer’s plan.
Easier management
When all of your retirement savings are in one place, it's easier to manage your accounts and monitor your progress.


Continue tax advantages
Like your 401(k) or other retirement plan, a Thrivent Mutual Fund IRA offers important tax benefits.
Of course, your best option may be to leave your assets where they are. Keep in mind that rolling over assets to an IRA is just one of multiple options for your retirement plan. 









Important Considerations





When considering moving your retirement assets it’s important to review your needs and circumstances, and consider the following factors:
Investment Options & Fees
Compare the options you currently have with those available with Thrivent Mutual Funds, including investment fees and other expenses.
Services Offered
Plans and providers potentially offer a variety of account services you may want. Compare current services and conveniences to those available with Thrivent Mutual Funds.
Distribution Flexibility
Both IRAs and employer-sponsored plans may offer distribution options you want or need. Compare access to early withdrawals, loans, employer stock considerations, required minimum distributions and distribution frequency.
Creditor protections
Generally, employer sponsored plans have unlimited protection from creditors under federal law. IRA assets are less protected and laws vary by state.
LEARN MORE



Options for Moving Assets

Options for Moving Assets
Have your employer-sponsored retirement plan assets sent directly to your Thrivent Mutual Funds IRA with a Direct Rollover.
Or, take receipt of your retirement assets and deposit them into your IRA within 60 days with an Indirect Rollover. Keep in mind you will incur a mandatory 20% tax withholding for distributions from employer qualified plans and you are limited to one indirect rollover per 12 month period for all your retirement assets.
With an IRA to IRA Transfer you can move your retirement assets from your current IRA to a Thrivent Mutual Fund IRA. 
If you’re looking at a Thrivent Mutual Fund Roth IRA, consider moving your retirement assets from your employer-sponsored plan or traditional IRA with a Roth IRA Conversion. You may have to pay federal or state income taxes on all or part of the conversion amount.
LEARN MORELink to Making Sense of Rollovers and Transfers.










Ready to Rollover?
Follow these simple steps to make it happen and start investing with Thrivent Mutual Funds.



Research and gather what’s needed from your current plan sponsor or IRA custodian.



Identify and set up a Thrivent Mutual Fund IRA for your assets.



Complete the rollover request form on-line or in paper.



Send the request to Thrivent Mutual Funds to initiate the movement of your assets.






2You can roll over assets from an employer-sponsored retirement plan to an IRA if you experience one of the following triggering events (as permitted by the plan document): termination of service, retirement, reaching age 59½, disability, plan termination, death, or proceeds received from former spouse’s retirement plan due to a divorce.

Invest in the Next Generation
Custodial and education accounts are a great way to look after future generations. We offer the tools you need to help take care of a kid’s future the same way you take care of your own.
Things to keep in mind:
 


Time is on your side.
One of your greatest assets is your time. Starting early in saving is critical to lessening the financial impact that may occur when college starts.


Once it’s theirs, it’s theirs.
When an account is created in a child’s name, the fund can only be used for that child’s benefit.


They could gain access at age 18.
Through the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) or Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA), the child can access the money usually between the ages of 18-21.







Consider This

In 2015, the average student loan debt was $30,100 per borrower.

Accounts for Kids


Coverdell Education Savings Account

Coverdell Education Savings Account
Grow money tax deferred and withdraw proceeds tax-free for qualified education expenses. And unlike 529 savings plans, a Coverdell account can be used towards qualified primary and secondary school costs in addition to college costs.
Learn moreLearn more about Coverdell Education Savings Accounts



Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA)

Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA)
Establish and manage an investment account for a child, for education or other qualified expenses. These accounts are irrevocable gifts that ensure the assets will be used to benefit a child. Since the money does not have a specified purpose, no penalties are imposed if used for something other than education. These accounts may previously have been referred to or known as Uniform Gifts to Minors (UGMAs).

Rollovers: 401ks & IRAs | Thrivent Mutual Funds














































Skip to main content












Mutual Fund Accounts for the Things That Matter


Rollovers: Moving Your 401k and Retirement Assets
When getting a new job or retiring you may want to move your accumulated retirement assets, including your 401ks, to a consolidated account. Consider moving your assets to an IRA with Thrivent Mutual Funds. There are several ways available depending on where the assets currently are held and how the request is completed. Beyond rollovers, you should understand your options, weigh the pros and cons and make a choice that is right for your goals and circumstances.













Potentially have more control over assets with continued tax deferral









Increased flexibility on early withdrawals*









Diversify your assets with a variety of Thrivent mutual funds 














Direct & Indirect Rollover

Direct Rollover: move assets directly into your Thrivent Mutual Funds IRA from your employer plan. You don't take receipt of the funds, so no federal tax withholding is required. And, the one-rollover-per-year rule does not apply.
Indirect Rollover: take receipt of your retirement assets and deposit them into your IRA within 60 days. Keep in mind 20% tax withholding is mandatory for distributions from employer qualified plans. And, you can have only one indirect rollover within a 12 month period, but only for an IRA.

*IRAs provide increased flexibility on early withdrawals due to additional IRS exceptions to the 10% early withdrawal penalty for IRA distributions. Examples include first time home purchase and qualified higher education expenses. See IRS Publication 590B for more details.  However, by rolling over to an IRA, you lose the option for penalty-free distribution from 401(k) plans after the age of 55.

While diversification can help reduce market risk, it does not eliminate it.  Diversification does not assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market.

It Takes a Village to Raise a College Graduate

                            With the rising costs of college, families are taking a multigenerational approach to planning for education and other life goals.
                        





It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.
With the costs of higher education trending higher each year, paying for college has become a top-tier life expense, alongside other big-ticket goals like buying a home and planning for retirement. However, education costs have now skyrocketed to the extent that saving for both of those life goals—retirement and home-buying—has become hampered in some families.

Some parents are cutting back on retirement savings contributions to help fund their children’s education.  At the same time, children are entering their 20’s with student loan debt, which in some cases is delaying the purchase of their first home. Even grandparents have modified life goals, choosing to help grandchildren with education expenses now, rather than leaving a larger legacy later.
In short, paying for education has officially become a multigenerational concern. But with a little advance planning, families can make some savvy moves to help prepare for the costs of college. 





The Growing Cost of Education



According to the College Board's latest “Trends in Higher Education" report, the continued increase in average published tuition and fees at colleges and universities is now outpacing the growth in family incomes, financial aid and many consumer goods and services. It now costs, on average, $45,370 per year for tuition, fees, room and board, for a four-year private college. Assuming a college-cost inflation rate of 3%, today’s 8-year-old child may need $255,090 come college time in 2027.
“For parents, the number-one goal from a financial planning perspective is still retirement, but close behind is paying for a child’s education,” says Marc Dextraze, Executive Director, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions.




It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.

One option, says Dextraze, is for parents to start saving early with a 529 college savings plan.  “Having a head start on the costs means less sacrifice later on, avoiding the heavy burden of parental loans," he says. For the child, “Having all or most of their college funding in place means they have more options, like being able to select the college that best fits their interests and goals, as opposed to the college that offers the most aid. And graduating with less student debt means having the ability to pursue the next chapter of their lives with more financial freedom."
Named after Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, a 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings vehicle which allows you to save, or even pay in advance, for college expenses. Earnings in a 529 plan can be tax deferred, and the withdrawals are exempt from federal and state income taxes if you use the funds for qualified expenses such as tuition, fees, room and board and supplies. Many states also offer state tax deductions or tax credits on top of that.





Making Education a Family Affair



Motivated by persistent news headlines about the growing costs of education, grandparents, relatives and even family friends have also begun creating 529 accounts in a child’s name. Not only do 529 plans offer potential tax advantages, they allow the family member or friend to give the gift of education and a young adulthood free from student debt.
“Today it definitely takes a village to send a child to college," says Jennifer Tierney, Vice President, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions and 529 plans product manager. “It's so important to plan ahead. For grandparents, aunts and uncles, family friends, it just makes sense to leverage the benefits that 529 plans provide to a child and from a tax-perspective, to themselves.”

A Flexible Way to Save and Invest for College



The appeal of 529 plans may derive from their benefits and flexibility.
There are no income restrictions, no required minimum distributions, no limits on the number of accounts the same person or entity can own, generally no maximum age limits for establishing an account, and high contribution limits. Virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child, grandchild, niece, nephew, spouse, even a friend.1
According to Chris Stack, a managing consultant at Savingforcollege.com, one of the most overlooked benefits is the daily access and liquidity of the 529 account, as opposed to a UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act) or UGMA (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act) account or other strategy. “With 529s, grandparents or extended family give themselves an option, but not an obligation, to apply their funds to help pay college costs," he says. 


Another significant benefit of 529 plans is tax-free compounding. “Earning on an account’s growth, rather than paying taxes on the earnings, provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality," Stack says. “Having the ability to withdraw the principal and tax-deferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit, especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account."
Stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible. While as soon as the child is born is ideal, he said, some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future."
Says Dextraze, “At the end of the day, the idea is to harmonize all of your goals, taking whatever tax advantages you can through the various kinds of plans out there, including 401Ks, 529s and others. It’s using all of the available tools. That’s how you reach your goals.”


Morgan Stanley offers many 529s from some of the nation’s leading mutual fund companies. You can choose from a range of investment strategies depending on the specific plan, the age of the beneficiary, your financial objectives and risk tolerance. Talk with your Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor, or find one using the locator below, for more information. 
















1 Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes, and beneficiary changes may result in an immediate tax liability if the new beneficiary is not a member of the old beneficiary’s family. Contribution limits vary by state. Refer to the individual plan for specific guidelines.


Disclosures
An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses associated with 529 plans and municipal fund securities before investing. More information about municipal fund securities is available in the issuer's official statement – the 529 Plan Program Disclosure – which is available from your Financial Advisor. It should be read carefully before investing.
Investments are subject to market risk and may fluctuate in value. Before investing, investors should consider whether tax or other benefits are only available for investments in the investor’s home-state 529 college savings plan. Assets can accumulate and be withdrawn federally tax-free only if they are used to pay for qualified expenses. Earnings on nonqualified distributions will be subject to income tax and a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some states offer favorable tax treatment and other benefits to their residents only if they invest in the state’s own Qualified Tuition Program. Investors should consult with their financial and tax advisor before investing in any 529 plan, or contact their state tax division for more information. Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes.
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (“Morgan Stanley”), its affiliates and Morgan Stanley Financial Advisors do not provide tax or legal advice. Clients should consult their personal tax advisor for tax-related matters and their attorney for legal matters.

Thrivent Code of Ethics  �


I.
INTRODUCTION  This Code of Ethics (�Code�) is adopted in compliance with the requirements of U.S. securities laws applicable to registered investment advisers and registered investment companies. Registered investment advisers are
required by Rule 204A-1 under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (�Advisers Act�), to establish, maintain and enforce a code of ethics which, among other things, sets forth the standards of business conduct required of
their �supervised persons� as defined in Advisers Act Section�202(a)(25) and �access persons� as defined in Rule 204A-1 and requires them to comply with the Federal Securities Laws.1 Similarly, each registered
investment company and its investment advisers and principal underwriter must adopt a code of ethics pursuant to Rule 17j-1 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (�1940 Act�) containing provisions reasonably necessary
to prevent �access persons� as defined in Rule 17j-1 from engaging in any act, practice, or course of business prohibited under the anti-fraud provisions of the rule (Rule 204A-1 and Rule 17j-1, collectively, �Rules�).
 In conformity with the Rules, this Code has been adopted by the following entities: Thrivent Financial for Lutherans and Thrivent Asset Management, LLC
(each an �Adviser�; collectively, the �Advisers�), and the Thrivent Mutual Funds, Thrivent Series Fund, Inc. and Thrivent Financial Securities Lending Trust (each a �Fund�; collectively, the
�Funds� and together with the Advisers, the �Regulated Companies� or �Thrivent�). (An individual series or a portfolio of a Fund is herein sometimes referred to as a �Fund
Portfolio�.)  The Board of Directors/Trustees (�Fund Board�) of each Fund, including a majority of the Directors/Trustees who are
not interested persons of a Fund (�Independent Fund Directors�), must approve the code of ethics of the Funds, as well as the code of ethics of each Fund Adviser, each Fund sub-adviser and the principal underwriter and any material
changes to such codes. The Fund Board must base its approval of a code of ethics and any material changes on its determination that the code contains provisions reasonably necessary to prevent �access persons� as defined in Rule 17j-1 from
engaging in acts, practices or courses of business prohibited by the anti-fraud provisions of the rule.  Abusive personal investment activities by access
persons are prohibited not only by the Rules, but also by other provisions of the federal securities laws. For example, a Fund manager who engages in Front Running (as hereinafter defined) or makes investment decisions for a Fund with the intent to
benefit personally would, in addition to violating Rule 17j-1, violate the antifraud provisions of Section�17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (�Securities Act�), Section�10(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (�Exchange Act�) and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5. If a Fund and its portfolio manager purchase or sell securities in the same company, the portfolio manager may have engaged in a �joint transaction�
with the Fund in 
 �
�


 1
 Advisers Act Rule 204A-1 defines the term �Federal Securities Laws� to include: (1) the Securities Act of
1933, as amended; (2) the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended; (3) the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; (4) the 1940 Act; (5) the Advisers Act; (6) Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999; (7) any rules adopted by the SEC under those
statutes; (8) the Bank Secrecy Act, as it applies to funds and investment advisers; and (9) any rules adopted under relevant provisions of the Bank Secrecy Act by the SEC or the Department of the Treasury.  �
1 



violation of 1940 Act Section�17(d) and related Rule 17d-1. If a portfolio manager causes a Fund to purchase particular securities in exchange for any
compensation (in the form of securities, private investment opportunities, favorable trading terms, or other similar benefits), the manager would violate 1940 Act Section�17(e), which prohibits any portfolio manager or other fund insider,
acting as agent, from receiving compensation from outside sources in exchange for the purchase or sale of any property to or from an investment company. An investment adviser whose portfolio manager or other employees engage in abusive investing
would violate Advisers Act Section�206, which prohibits investment advisers from engaging in certain fraudulent conduct and imposes a strict fiduciary duty on all advisers.  Penalties for violation of these laws can be severe and extend to all Thrivent Financial for Lutherans� affiliates and their officers and directors as well as to the individual.  The provisions of the codes of ethics of the subadvisers described in attached Appendix _ (�Subadviser Codes�) are incorporated by reference into this
Code and are applicable to the directors, officers and employees of each respective subadviser who are �access persons� (as defined in Rule 17j-1) of a Fund. Violations of applicable Subadviser Codes by any such access persons also violate
this Code.  If you have any questions concerning this Code, please contact the relevant Chief Compliance Officer of the Regulated Companies
(�CCO�) or a designated person within the Asset Management Law Department of the General Counsel�s Office (�GCO�) (individually and collectively, �Compliance�). CCO for each Adviser means the
Chief Compliance Officer as designated on the Adviser�s Form ADV, Part 1, Schedule A, or the CCO�s designee, as applicable. For the Funds, it means the CCO approved by the Fund Board or that CCO�s designee.  �


II.
FIDUCIARY DUTY  The Securities and Exchange Commission
(�SEC�) and the Supreme Court have consistently opined that an investment adviser owes a �fiduciary duty� to its advisory clients. As fiduciaries, we have affirmative duties of care, honesty, loyalty and good faith to act
in the best interests of our clients, including the Funds and their shareholders and individual accounts (collectively, �Clients�).  Our
Clients� interests are paramount and must come before our personal interests. Our Access Persons and Supervised Persons are also expected to behave as fiduciaries with respect to Clients. This means that each must render disinterested advice,
protect Client assets (including nonpublic information about a Client or a Client�s account) and act always in the best interest of our Clients. When acting in a fiduciary capacity, Thrivent will adhere to the highest standards of care and
diligence in conducting our activities. We must be particularly sensitive to situations in which the interests of Clients conflict with those of Thrivent, striving always to identify and avoid material conflicts of interest or to disclose those
conflicts which cannot be avoided.  We seek to foster a reputation for integrity and professionalism. That reputation is a vital business asset and it is
our responsibility to take the actions needed to help preserve that reputation. For that reason, we have established a Code of Conduct, with the expectation that 
 �
2 



everyone acting on behalf of Thrivent will understand and follow its principles. To further these goals, we have also adopted this Code and implemented
policies and procedures to prevent fraudulent, deceptive and manipulative practices and to ensure compliance with the Federal Securities Laws and the fiduciary duties owed to our Clients.  �


III.
PERSONS COVERED BY THE CODE  This Code applies to all Supervised Persons of the Advisers2 and all Access Persons3 of the Regulated Companies.  The Advisers Act defines Supervised Person to include �any partner, officer, director (or other person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions), or employee of an investment adviser, or other
person who provides investment advice on behalf of the investment adviser and is subject to the supervision and control of the investment adviser.� Contractors and consultants may, in certain circumstances, be deemed to be Supervised Persons.
All Supervised Persons, including independent directors of the Advisers, are required to comply with the Federal Securities Laws, to acknowledge receipt of this Code and to report any violations of this Code promptly to the CCO or the CCO�s
designee. However, Supervised Persons who are not also Access Persons are not required to file periodic reports of personal securities transactions and holdings.  All Access Persons are required to satisfy the above requirements applicable to Supervised Persons. In addition, Access Persons are required to file periodic reports of their personal securities transactions and
holdings and are generally required to pre-clear personal securities transactions unless specifically exempt from pre-clearance under this Code.  Under the Advisers Act, �access person� is defined as �[a]ny of your supervised persons . . . [w]ho
has access to nonpublic information regarding any clients� purchase or sale of securities, or nonpublic information regarding the portfolio holdings of any reportable fund, or . . . is involved in making securities recommendations to clients,
or who has access to such recommendations that are nonpublic. . . . If providing investment advice is your primary business, all of your directors, officers and partners are presumed to be access persons.�4 The presumption is
rebuttable, meaning that an adviser may demonstrate that independent directors are not access persons depending upon their activities. �Access person� is defined slightly differently under the 1940 Act, and contains a presumption that all
of a Fund�s directors and officers are access persons of the Fund.5  � �


 2
 See Advisers Act Section�202(a)(25) for definition of �supervised person�. Note that independent
directors of advisers are not excluded from this statutory definition. 


 3
 See Advisers Act Rule 204A-1(e)(1) and 1940 Act Rule 17j-1(a)(1) for definitions of �access person�.



 4
 Advisers Act Rule 204A-1(e)(1). Providing investment advice is not the primary business of Thrivent Financial
for Lutherans 


 5
 See 1940 Act Rule 17j-1(a)(1) which, in pertinent part, defines �access person� as follows:
 i. Any Advisory Person of a Fund or of a Fund's investment adviser. If an investment adviser's primary business is
advising Funds or other advisory clients, all of the investment adviser's directors, officers, and general partners are presumed to be Access Persons of any Fund advised by the investment adviser. All of a Fund's directors, officers, and general
partners are presumed to be Access Persons of the Fund.  �
3 


Based on these defined terms, for any Adviser whose primary business is other than providing investment advice, Thrivent
may automatically exclude from its Access Persons those officers or directors who are not involved in, and have no access to, non-public investment recommendations. For any Adviser whose primary business is rendering investment advice, the CCO is
authorized to decide, after consultation with counsel, whether an officer or director may be excluded from its Access Persons.  For purposes of this Code,
Thrivent deems the following to be Access Persons:  �


�
�
�
 any Officer, Director or Trustee of a Fund;  �


�
�
�
 any Officer, Director or Manager of an Adviser, unless the CCO, in consultation with counsel, has determined that a Director, Officer or Manager of any Adviser (the
primary business of which is other than providing investment advice) neither makes, participates in nor obtains information regarding the purchase or sale of Reportable Securities by a Client, and is not involved in any investment recommendations
relating to the purchase or sale of Reportable Securities;  �


�
�
�
 any Officer or Director of the Principal Underwriter and any Employee of a Fund or Adviser who, in connection with his or her regular functions or duties, makes,
participates in, or obtains or has access to information regarding, the purchase or sale of Reportable Securities by a Client, or whose functions relate to the making of any recommendations with respect to the purchases or sales; including,
specifically;  �


�
�
�
 Certain employees of the Investment Division and other employees located in physical proximity (�Securities Department�);
 �


�
�
�
 Certain employees in the Fund Accounting Administration and Fund Accounting Operations Departments of Investment Accounting (�Fund Accounting�);
 �


�
�
�
 Certain employees in the GCO;  �


�
�
�
 Certain employees in Information Technology;  �


�
�
�
 Members of the Portfolio Compliance and Valuation Committee;  �


�
�
�
 any Officer, Director, Trustee or Employee of a Regulated Company who has access to nonpublic information regarding any Client�s purchase or sale of
securities, or nonpublic information regarding the portfolio holdings of any Fund,  � *����*����*����*����*  ii. Any director, officer or general partner of a principal underwriter who, in the ordinary course of business, makes, participates in or obtains information regarding, the purchase or sale of Covered Securities by
the Fund for which the principal underwriter acts, or whose functions or duties in the ordinary course of business relate to the making of any recommendation to the Fund regarding the purchase or sale of Covered Securities.  �
4 




�
�
�
 any natural person in a control relationship to a Fund or Adviser who obtains information concerning recommendations made to a Fund with regard to the purchase or
sale of Reportable Securities by a Fund; and  �


�
�
�
 any other person who the CCO determines to be an Access Person.  Each Supervised Person and/or Access Person shall be notified of his or her status under this Code and be provided with a copy of this Code and any amendments and shall provide an acknowledgement of such receipt.
Your receipt of this Code for your review and signature means that you are a Supervised Person and/or Access Person to whom the Code applies. Should you have any doubt as to whether this Code applies to you, you should contact your CCO.
 �


IV.
DEFINED TERMS  As used in the Code, the following terms have
the following meanings:  �

involved in making, or has access to, non-public securities recommendations to Clients. In addition, the definition of �access person� under Rule 17j-1 includes the defined term �advisory person� which covers, among other
things, any director, officer, or employee of the Funds or the Advisers �who, in connection with his or her regular functions or duties, makes, participates, in or obtains information regarding, the purchase or sale of Covered Securities by a
Fund, or whose functions relate to the making of any recommendations with respect to such purchases or sales.� Since together these terms cover all relevant personnel, for purposes of this Code, the term Access Person means and includes any

transactions unless explicitly exempt under Section VIII.  �

V.
STANDARDS OF BUSINESS CONDUCT  �


�
A.
General  Each Supervised Person and/or Access Person shall
adhere to the highest ethical standards and shall, at all times:  �


�
1.
place the interests of Clients before his/her personal interests;  �


�
2.
conduct all personal securities transactions in a manner consistent with this Code, to avoid any actual or potential conflicts of interest, or any abuse of position of trust and
responsibility; and  �


�
3.
never use their positions, or any investment opportunities presented by virtue of their positions, to personal advantage or to the detriment of a Client. 
To assure compliance with these standards of conduct and the Federal Securities Laws, we have adopted, and
agreed to be governed by, the provisions of this Code in addition to the procedures contained in applicable compliance manuals.10 However, Access Persons and Supervised Persons are expected to comply not merely with the �letter of
the law�, but with the spirit of the laws, this Code and applicable compliance manuals, policies and procedures.  �
�


 9
 The SEC staff has refused to grant no-action relief with respect to a request to exempt UIT-ETFs from the reporting
requirements of adviser and fund codes of ethics and strongly urged advisers and funds to treat open-end ETFs and UIT ETFs consistently. See National Compliance Services, Inc., pub. avail (Nov. 20, 2005). 


 10
 Applicable compliance manuals include the Adviser�s policies and procedures adopted pursuant to Advisers Act Rule
206(4)-7 and the Funds� policies and procedures adopted pursuant to 1940 Act Rule 38a-1, as they may exist from time to time.  �
8 




�
 B.
 Unlawful Actions11  It is unlawful for any affiliated person of or principal underwriter for a Fund, or any affiliated person of an investment adviser of or principal
underwriter for a Fund, in connection with the purchase or sale, directly or indirectly, by the person of a Security Held or to be Acquired by the Fund:  �


�
1.
To employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud the Fund;  �


�
2.
To make any untrue statement of a material fact to the Fund or omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made to the Fund, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading;  �


�
3.
To engage in any act, practice or course of business that operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit on the Fund; or  �


�
4.
To engage in any manipulative practice with respect to the Fund.  �


VI.
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST  Supervised Persons and/or Access
Persons must avoid engaging in any activity which might reflect poorly upon themselves or Thrivent or which would impair their ability to discharge their duties with respect to us and our Clients. Access Persons must provide disinterested advice and
any relevant potential personal or business conflicts of interest must be disclosed to the CCO and, where appropriate, �Information Wall� procedures may be utilized to avoid potential conflicts of interest.  �


�
A.
Fair Treatment. Access Persons must avoid taking any action which would favor one Client or group of Clients over another in violation of our fiduciary duties and applicable
law. Access Persons must comply with relevant provisions of our compliance manuals designed to detect, prevent or mitigate such conflicts.  �


�
 B.
 Gifts. No Supervised Person and/or Access Person shall accept a gift, favor, or service from any person or
company that, to the actual knowledge of such Access Person, does business or is seeking to do business with a Regulated Company, that creates a real or perceived conflict of interest or is lavish or extravagant.12
 �


�
C.
Market Timing/Short-Term Investing. Access Persons must refrain from knowingly placing trades in any mutual fund after it closes while obtaining that day�s price for the
fund shares.  �


�
D.
Duty of Care. When acting as fiduciaries, the Advisers have a duty to perform their services carefully. Negligence in the performance of investment advisory
 �


11
The term �Unlawful Actions� is defined in Rule 17j-1(b). 


12
Supervised Persons and Access Persons are also subject to the Thrivent Financial Gift and Business Entertainment Policy. See www.thriventcodeofconduct.com.
 �
9 




�
 
activities may result in liability to the injured Client. Clients expect that Adviser personnel will perform their responsibilities with the care and skill
that is appropriate under the circumstances. This responsibility requires, among other things, that securities recommendations be made on the basis of adequate investigation and that any recommended investment is suitable to the particular Client in
light of the nature and objectives of that Client.  �


�
E.
Transactions with Clients. No Supervised Person and/or Access Person shall buy or sell any security or other property in which such person has a beneficial interest
from or to a Client, provided that this item shall not be construed to prohibit a person from being a shareholder of a Fund or the contract owner of a variable annuity, life insurance or any other product that is funded or issued by a Fund.
 �


�
F.
Service as Outside Director. No Investment Personnel shall serve on the board of directors of any company that is subject to the reporting obligations of Exchange Act
Section�12 or 15, or in any similar capacity, absent prior authorization from the CCO, in consultation with counsel, based upon a determination that the board service would be consistent with the interests of Clients. If such board service is
authorized, such Investment Personnel shall be isolated from the investment making decisions of the Funds or other Clients with regard to securities of the company on whose board the individual serves. Supervised Persons may not serve on a
creditors� committee absent prior authorization from the Chief Investment Officer in consultation with counsel and, if so authorized, may be subject to strict information barriers. This restriction shall not apply to any Independent Fund
Director or any independent director, manager or trustee of an Adviser that is not, in fact, an Access Person as defined above.  �


VII.
PERSONAL TRADING RESTRICTIONS  �


�
 A.
 Restrictions for Access Persons13  �


�
1.
Open Client Orders. Front-running is illegal and prohibited under this Code. No Access Person will be granted pre-clearance for the purchase or sale of any Reportable
Security on a day that any Client or Adviser has a pending �buy� or �sell� order in the same Reportable Security until the order is withdrawn or executed. The price paid or received by a Client account for any security should not
be affected by a buying or selling interest on the part of an Access Person, or otherwise result in an inappropriate advantage to the Access Person.  �


�
2.
IPO and Limited Offering Restrictions. No Access Person, other than an Independent Fund Director, shall purchase, directly or indirectly, in an
 �


13
Certain substantive restrictions are required by law while others are based on best practices recommended by the Investment Company Institute under Rule 17j-1 or by the Investment
Advisers Association under Rule 204A-1.  �
10 




�
 
Initial Public Offering or a Limited Offering of any Reportable Security in which he or she has, or by reason of such transaction would acquire, Beneficial
Ownership without the prior written approval of Compliance. Any such approval will take into account, among other factors, whether the investment opportunity should be reserved for a Client and whether the opportunity is being offered to such person
because of his or her position with Thrivent. Once pre-approval has been granted, the pre-approved transaction must be executed within 48 hours or such other period specified by Compliance. An Access Person who has been authorized to acquire
interests in such securities must disclose their interests if involved in considering an investment in such securities for a Client. Any decision to acquire the issuer�s securities on behalf of a Client shall be subject to review by Access
Persons with no personal interest in the issuer. If the purchase of a Limited Offering is approved, the Access Person must disclose his or her position in the issuer of the security whenever he or she is involved to any material extent in any
subsequent consideration of the securities of such issuer by or on behalf of a Client and the determination of whether to make such investment must be made or reviewed by Investment Personnel having no personal interest in the issuer.
 �


�
3.
Short Sales. No Access Person shall effect a short sale of a Covered Security unless such transaction is a short sale transaction known as a short sale �against the
box� (i.e., the Access Person owns the security which is subject to the short sale); provided, however, that an Access Person may effect a short sale of an ETF in a transaction that is not �against the box.�
 �


�
4.
Forfeitures. Any profits derived from securities transactions in violation of this Code shall be forfeited and may be paid to one or more Clients for the benefit of
the Client(s) or, if the Client is a Reportable Fund, its shareholders, if such a payment is determined by the CCO, in consultation with the relevant Adviser�s CLO, to be appropriate under the circumstances, or to a charitable organization
selected by the Adviser, as applicable. Gifts accepted in violation of the Code shall be forfeited, if practicable, and/or dealt with in any manner determined appropriate and in the best interests of Clients. No profits shall be forfeited from
securities transactions by an Access Person pre-cleared in good faith. Good faith pre-clearance does not include transactions pre-cleared by Access Persons who knowingly submit requests for pre-clearance while in possession of material,
non-public information with respect to the security or any Adviser�s advisory recommendations relating to the security.  �


�
5.
 Reporting Violations. Any Access Person or Supervised Person who believes that a violation of this Code has taken place must promptly report
that violation to the CCO or to the CCO�s designee. To the extent that such reports are provided to a designee, the designee shall provide periodic updates to the CCO with respect to violations reported. Access

Persons and Supervised Persons may make these reports anonymously and no adverse action shall be taken against any such person making such a report in good
faith.  �


�
6.
Waivers. The CCO, in consultation with the relevant Adviser�s Chief Legal Officer (�CLO�), may grant waivers of any substantive restriction in
appropriate circumstances (e.g., personal hardship) and will maintain records necessary to justify such waivers.  �


�
7.
Brokerage Accounts. Access Persons, other than Independent Fund Directors, must disclose all brokerage accounts to the CCO and instruct their broker to provide
timely duplicate account statements and confirms to the CCO. The CCO may restrict the brokerage firms with whom any Supervisory or Access Person may maintain a brokerage account.  �


�
B.
Additional Restriction for Investment Personnel  The
following personal trading restriction must be complied with in addition to all those pertaining to Access Persons.  �


�
1.
60-Day Holding Period  No Investment Personnel shall profit, directly or
indirectly, from the purchase and sale or sale and purchase of the same or equivalent Reportable Security within any 60 calendar-day period. In the event an Investment Personnel engages in such transactions, the later transaction shall, if
practicable, be rescinded. Nothing in this restriction shall be deemed to prohibit avoidance of loss through trading within a period shorter than 60 calendar days, subject to the prohibition on Front-running. This prohibition applies to all
Reportable Securities unless excepted below.  Note: The 60-day rule covers �equivalent� securities; therefore, the rule would prohibit
options transactions on or short sales of a security within 60 days of its purchase. Also the 60-day rule is applied on a �last in - first out� basis. For example, if Investment Personnel purchases ABC stock on January�1, 2006, and
makes a subsequent purchase of ABC stock on December�1, 2007, he or she may not sell any shares of ABC stock until January�31, 2008. The �clock� restarts each time a trade is made in the security.  �

Security by Investment Personnel are subject to the 60-day holding period, except:  �


�
a.
In cases of immediate and heavy financial need where funds are not readily available from other sources, Investment Personnel may request approval for the sale of Reportable
Securities from Compliance. The request must be in writing and set forth the circumstances of the request, and must not exceed the amount needed to meet the financial hardship, including anticipated income taxes. Compliance has no obligation to
grant the request.  �

Portfolio Manager may not purchase the security until the following Tuesday.  �
13 




�
 
within a period of seven (7)�calendar days before any transaction in such Reportable Security, provided that, such person is unaware that
such Reportable Security is under consideration by a Portfolio Manager.  �

Simple is Putting All of Your Retirement Assets into One Place
The days of working for a single company your entire career have long passed. Chances are, you’ll have worked at a number of businesses by the time you retire. Which means that, like most people, you could have IRA and 401(k) assets scattered across several accounts and firms. Now may be the time to consider taking control of these important assets by rolling them into an IRA offered by Thrivent Mutual Funds.2 Potential benefits include:


Investment flexibility
Thrivent Mutual Funds provides a variety of investment options, some of which may not be available in your employer’s plan.
Easier management
When all of your retirement savings are in one place, it's easier to manage your accounts and monitor your progress.


Continue tax advantages
Like your 401(k) or other retirement plan, a Thrivent Mutual Fund IRA offers important tax benefits.
Of course, your best option may be to leave your assets where they are. Keep in mind that rolling over assets to an IRA is just one of multiple options for your retirement plan. 









Important Considerations





When considering moving your retirement assets it’s important to review your needs and circumstances, and consider the following factors:
Investment Options & Fees
Compare the options you currently have with those available with Thrivent Mutual Funds, including investment fees and other expenses.
Services Offered
Plans and providers potentially offer a variety of account services you may want. Compare current services and conveniences to those available with Thrivent Mutual Funds.
Distribution Flexibility
Both IRAs and employer-sponsored plans may offer distribution options you want or need. Compare access to early withdrawals, loans, employer stock considerations, required minimum distributions and distribution frequency.
Creditor protections
Generally, employer sponsored plans have unlimited protection from creditors under federal law. IRA assets are less protected and laws vary by state.

Options for Moving Assets

Options for Moving Assets
Have your employer-sponsored retirement plan assets sent directly to your Thrivent Mutual Funds IRA with a Direct Rollover.
Or, take receipt of your retirement assets and deposit them into your IRA within 60 days with an Indirect Rollover. Keep in mind you will incur a mandatory 20% tax withholding for distributions from employer qualified plans and you are limited to one indirect rollover per 12 month period for all your retirement assets.
With an IRA to IRA Transfer you can move your retirement assets from your current IRA to a Thrivent Mutual Fund IRA. 
If you’re looking at a Thrivent Mutual Fund Roth IRA, consider moving your retirement assets from your employer-sponsored plan or traditional IRA with a Roth IRA Conversion. You may have to pay federal or state income taxes on all or part of the conversion amount.
LEARN MORELink to Making Sense of Rollovers and Transfers.










Ready to Rollover?
Follow these simple steps to make it happen and start investing with Thrivent Mutual Funds.



Research and gather what’s needed from your current plan sponsor or IRA custodian.



Identify and set up a Thrivent Mutual Fund IRA for your assets.



Complete the rollover request form on-line or in paper.



Send the request to Thrivent Mutual Funds to initiate the movement of your assets.






2You can roll over assets from an employer-sponsored retirement plan to an IRA if you experience one of the following triggering events (as permitted by the plan document): termination of service, retirement, reaching age 59½, disability, plan termination, death, or proceeds received from former spouse’s retirement plan due to a divorce.

Invest in the Next Generation
Custodial and education accounts are a great way to look after future generations. We offer the tools you need to help take care of a kid’s future the same way you take care of your own.
Things to keep in mind:
 


Time is on your side.
One of your greatest assets is your time. Starting early in saving is critical to lessening the financial impact that may occur when college starts.


Once it’s theirs, it’s theirs.
When an account is created in a child’s name, the fund can only be used for that child’s benefit.


They could gain access at age 18.
Through the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) or Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA), the child can access the money usually between the ages of 18-21.







Consider This

In 2015, the average student loan debt was $30,100 per borrower.

Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA)

Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA)
Establish and manage an investment account for a child, for education or other qualified expenses. These accounts are irrevocable gifts that ensure the assets will be used to benefit a child. Since the money does not have a specified purpose, no penalties are imposed if used for something other than education. These accounts may previously have been referred to or known as Uniform Gifts to Minors (UGMAs).

Mutual Fund Accounts for the Things That Matter


Rollovers: Moving Your 401k and Retirement Assets
When getting a new job or retiring you may want to move your accumulated retirement assets, including your 401ks, to a consolidated account. Consider moving your assets to an IRA with Thrivent Mutual Funds. There are several ways available depending on where the assets currently are held and how the request is completed. Beyond rollovers, you should understand your options, weigh the pros and cons and make a choice that is right for your goals and circumstances.













Potentially have more control over assets with continued tax deferral









Increased flexibility on early withdrawals*









Diversify your assets with a variety of Thrivent mutual funds 














Direct & Indirect Rollover

Direct Rollover: move assets directly into your Thrivent Mutual Funds IRA from your employer plan. You don't take receipt of the funds, so no federal tax withholding is required. And, the one-rollover-per-year rule does not apply.
Indirect Rollover: take receipt of your retirement assets and deposit them into your IRA within 60 days. Keep in mind 20% tax withholding is mandatory for distributions from employer qualified plans. And, you can have only one indirect rollover within a 12 month period, but only for an IRA.

*IRAs provide increased flexibility on early withdrawals due to additional IRS exceptions to the 10% early withdrawal penalty for IRA distributions. Examples include first time home purchase and qualified higher education expenses. See IRS Publication 590B for more details.  However, by rolling over to an IRA, you lose the option for penalty-free distribution from 401(k) plans after the age of 55.

While diversification can help reduce market risk, it does not eliminate it.  Diversification does not assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market.

It Takes a Village to Raise a College Graduate

                            With the rising costs of college, families are taking a multigenerational approach to planning for education and other life goals.
                        





It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.
With the costs of higher education trending higher each year, paying for college has become a top-tier life expense, alongside other big-ticket goals like buying a home and planning for retirement. However, education costs have now skyrocketed to the extent that saving for both of those life goals—retirement and home-buying—has become hampered in some families.

Some parents are cutting back on retirement savings contributions to help fund their children’s education.  At the same time, children are entering their 20’s with student loan debt, which in some cases is delaying the purchase of their first home. Even grandparents have modified life goals, choosing to help grandchildren with education expenses now, rather than leaving a larger legacy later.
In short, paying for education has officially become a multigenerational concern. But with a little advance planning, families can make some savvy moves to help prepare for the costs of college. 





The Growing Cost of Education



According to the College Board's latest “Trends in Higher Education" report, the continued increase in average published tuition and fees at colleges and universities is now outpacing the growth in family incomes, financial aid and many consumer goods and services. It now costs, on average, $45,370 per year for tuition, fees, room and board, for a four-year private college. Assuming a college-cost inflation rate of 3%, today’s 8-year-old child may need $255,090 come college time in 2027.
“For parents, the number-one goal from a financial planning perspective is still retirement, but close behind is paying for a child’s education,” says Marc Dextraze, Executive Director, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions.




It takes a village to raise a child, but in 2017 it may take an extended family to educate one.

One option, says Dextraze, is for parents to start saving early with a 529 college savings plan.  “Having a head start on the costs means less sacrifice later on, avoiding the heavy burden of parental loans," he says. For the child, “Having all or most of their college funding in place means they have more options, like being able to select the college that best fits their interests and goals, as opposed to the college that offers the most aid. And graduating with less student debt means having the ability to pursue the next chapter of their lives with more financial freedom."
Named after Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code, a 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings vehicle which allows you to save, or even pay in advance, for college expenses. Earnings in a 529 plan can be tax deferred, and the withdrawals are exempt from federal and state income taxes if you use the funds for qualified expenses such as tuition, fees, room and board and supplies. Many states also offer state tax deductions or tax credits on top of that.





Making Education a Family Affair



Motivated by persistent news headlines about the growing costs of education, grandparents, relatives and even family friends have also begun creating 529 accounts in a child’s name. Not only do 529 plans offer potential tax advantages, they allow the family member or friend to give the gift of education and a young adulthood free from student debt.
“Today it definitely takes a village to send a child to college," says Jennifer Tierney, Vice President, Morgan Stanley Wealth Management Investment Solutions and 529 plans product manager. “It's so important to plan ahead. For grandparents, aunts and uncles, family friends, it just makes sense to leverage the benefits that 529 plans provide to a child and from a tax-perspective, to themselves.”

A Flexible Way to Save and Invest for College



The appeal of 529 plans may derive from their benefits and flexibility.
There are no income restrictions, no required minimum distributions, no limits on the number of accounts the same person or entity can own, generally no maximum age limits for establishing an account, and high contribution limits. Virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child, grandchild, niece, nephew, spouse, even a friend.1
According to Chris Stack, a managing consultant at Savingforcollege.com, one of the most overlooked benefits is the daily access and liquidity of the 529 account, as opposed to a UTMA (Uniform Transfers to Minors Act) or UGMA (Uniform Gifts to Minors Act) account or other strategy. “With 529s, grandparents or extended family give themselves an option, but not an obligation, to apply their funds to help pay college costs," he says. 


Another significant benefit of 529 plans is tax-free compounding. “Earning on an account’s growth, rather than paying taxes on the earnings, provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality," Stack says. “Having the ability to withdraw the principal and tax-deferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit, especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account."
Stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible. While as soon as the child is born is ideal, he said, some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future."
Says Dextraze, “At the end of the day, the idea is to harmonize all of your goals, taking whatever tax advantages you can through the various kinds of plans out there, including 401Ks, 529s and others. It’s using all of the available tools. That’s how you reach your goals.”


Morgan Stanley offers many 529s from some of the nation’s leading mutual fund companies. You can choose from a range of investment strategies depending on the specific plan, the age of the beneficiary, your financial objectives and risk tolerance. Talk with your Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor, or find one using the locator below, for more information. 
















1 Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes, and beneficiary changes may result in an immediate tax liability if the new beneficiary is not a member of the old beneficiary’s family. Contribution limits vary by state. Refer to the individual plan for specific guidelines.


Disclosures
An investor should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses associated with 529 plans and municipal fund securities before investing. More information about municipal fund securities is available in the issuer's official statement – the 529 Plan Program Disclosure – which is available from your Financial Advisor. It should be read carefully before investing.
Investments are subject to market risk and may fluctuate in value. Before investing, investors should consider whether tax or other benefits are only available for investments in the investor’s home-state 529 college savings plan. Assets can accumulate and be withdrawn federally tax-free only if they are used to pay for qualified expenses. Earnings on nonqualified distributions will be subject to income tax and a 10% federal income tax penalty. Some states offer favorable tax treatment and other benefits to their residents only if they invest in the state’s own Qualified Tuition Program. Investors should consult with their financial and tax advisor before investing in any 529 plan, or contact their state tax division for more information. Some plans may have age, residency or other restrictions and may charge a fee for beneficiary changes.
Morgan Stanley Smith Barney LLC (“Morgan Stanley”), its affiliates and Morgan Stanley Financial Advisors do not provide tax or legal advice. Clients should consult their personal tax advisor for tax-related matters and their attorney for legal matters.

Fidelity Cash Management Account FAQs

















          The Fidelity Cash Management Account is a brokerage account designed for spending and cash management. It is not intended to serve as your main account for securities trading. Customers interested in securities trading should consider a Fidelity Account®.
	
    

          The Cash Balance in the Fidelity Cash Management Account is swept to an FDIC-insured account at one or more Program Banks where it earns a variable rate of interest. The deposit at the Program Bank is not covered by SIPC. The deposit is eligible for FDIC insurance subject to FDIC insurance coverage limits. For more information about FDIC insurance coverage, please visit the FDIC website at www.FDIC.gov. As referenced in the FDIC Insured Deposit Sweep Disclosure Document for the Fidelity Cash Management Account, customers are responsible for monitoring their total assets at each of the Program Banks to determine the extent of available FDIC insurance. All FDIC insurance coverage is in accordance with FDIC rules. See the list of eligible Program Banks.
	
    

          1. All Fidelity ATM withdrawal fees will be waived for your Fidelity® Cash Management Account. In addition, your account will automatically be reimbursed for all ATM fees charged by other institutions while using a Fidelity® Visa® Gold Check Card linked to your account at any ATM displaying the Visa®, Plus®, or Star® logos. The reimbursement will be credited to the account the same day the ATM fee is debited from the account. Please note, there is a foreign transaction fee of one percent that is not waived, which will be included in the amount charged to your account. The Fidelity® Visa® Gold Check Card is issued by PNC Bank, N.A. and the check card program is administered by BNY Mellon Investment Servicing Trust Company. Those entities are not affiliated with each other or with Fidelity Investments. Visa is a registered trademark of Visa International Service Association, and is used by PNC Bank pursuant to license from Visa U.S.A. Inc.
	
    

          2. The Fidelity® Cash Management Account's uninvested cash balance is swept to one or more program banks where it earns a variable rate of interest and is eligible for FDIC insurance. At a minimum, there are five banks available to accept these deposits, making customers eligible for nearly $1,250,000 of FDIC insurance. If the number of available banks changes, or you elect not to use, and/or have existing assets at, one or more of the available banks, the actual amount could be higher or lower. For more information on FDIC insurance coverage, please visit www.FDIC.gov. Customers are responsible for monitoring their total assets at each of the Program Banks to determine the extent of available FDIC insurance coverage in accordance with FDIC rules. Refer to the FDIC-Insured Cash (Core) Disclosure Statement and list of eligible Program Banks for details. The deposits at Program Banks are not covered by SIPC.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
