Chain Pickerel Management and Fishing in Pennsylvania
Caught in PA
Lukas Diehl, caught and released what very well could have been the new state record chain pickerel in Feb. 2013.  The fish was weighed on an unofficial scale he had with him while on the ice. It weighed 9 lbs. and was 33 inches long.  This would have beat the current (2013) state record that stands at 8 lbs., 14 oz.
Ming Dao poses with a nice pickerel he caught in January 2004 at Lake Ontelaunee, Berks County. Photo by Vic Attardo.
Brendan Lee of the Greentown area with a 27 inch very healthy chain pickerel taken from Promised Land State Park, Upper Lake on 3/1/2014
Robert Balint caught this 27 inch chain pickerel on February 24, 2008 at Frances Slocum State Park. He caught it on a tip-up, using a medium shiner.
