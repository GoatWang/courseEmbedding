Class Specifications

Discipline: PathologySubject Definition: Genetics, Medical; GenomicsNLM Class: QZ 50LC Class: RB155Abstract: Genomic and Precision Medicine: Translation and Implementation highlights the various points along the continuum from health to disease where genomic information is impacting clinical decision-making and leading to more personalization of health care. The book pinpoints the challenges, barriers, and solutions that have been, or are being, brought forward to enable translation of genome based technologies into health care. A variety of infrastructure (data systems and EMRs), policy (regulatory, reimbursement, privacy), and research (comparative effectiveness research, learning health system approaches) strategies are also discussed. Readers will find this volume to be an invaluable resource for the translational genomics and implementation science that is required to fully realize personalized health care.

JOIN THE LISTClickFIND A STOREGenomic And Precision Medicine: Foundations, Translation, And Implementationby Ginsburg, Geoffrey S. (Edt)/ Willard, Huntington F. (Edt)Genomic and Precision Medicine: Foundations, Translation, and Implementation highlights the various points along the continuum from health to disease where genomic information is impacting clinical decision-making and leading to more personalization of health care.  The book pinpoints the challenges, barriers, and solutions that have been, or are being, brought forward to enable translation of genome based technologies into health care. A variety of infrastructure (data systems and EMRs), policy (regulatory, reimbursement, privacy), and research (comparative effectiveness research, learning health system approaches) strategies are also discussed. Readers will find this volume to be an invaluable resource for the translational genomics and implementation science that is required to fully realize personalized health care.Provides a comprehensive volume on the translation and implementation of biology into health care provisionPresents succinct commentary and key learning points that will assist readers with their local needs for translation and implementationIncludes an up-to-date overview on major  translational events  in genomic and personalized medicine, along with lessons learned GeneticsCondition: --HPB condition ratingsNew: Item is brand new, unused and unmarked, in flawless condition.Fine/Like New (F): No defects, little usage.
