Deutsche Bank sees yesterday's modest selloff as a classic sell the news event, as investors focused on potential headwinds in H2 and beyond; the firm believes moderating volumes as well as risks to industrial production in H2 and beyond will limit share upside for UNP over the medium term. Bernstein analyst David Vernonis is more upbeat, saying investors are ignoring UNP's strong fundamentals and focusing excessively on the company's earnings call comments about continued "competitive pressures" in its coal and intermodal businesses that were "neither new nor particularly harsh." For his part, Jim Cramer says UNP is his favorite railroad stock, citing strong Q2 results and company guidance he finds "too conservative."

Mad Money with Jim Cramer

Cramer's lightning round: Owning this software stock is a high-quality problem

It's that time again! Jim Cramer rang the lightning round bell, which means he gave his take on callers' favorite stocks at rapid speed:
Adobe: "That's a high-quality problem. [CEO] Shantanu Narayen is out there working for you every minute, and he's working for my charitable trust. Sometimes I think, 'Why can't we own all of 'em – an Adobe and a Microsoft and a FANG?' But you can't. You've got to be diversified."
Energizer: "You know, it's just OK. I prefer, actually, to own Procter & Gamble, where you've got a fabulous, engaged investor, Nelson Peltz, in there. You've got a pretty good management team. Procter's the way to go. I like that yield, too."

Blackberry: "It's got intellectual property, it's got cash, but it doesn't have momentum. I think it's probably correctly priced is the way I would look at that."
Cheesecake Factory: "Well, first of all, it's [trading at] 17 times earnings. Second, it's actually profitable. Let's not make it sound like it's not. It was not a great quarter, I do prefer Darden, but I'm not going to short a company that's actually done a pretty good job over the years."
Ensco: "No. I mean, we've got enough problems owning on-shore, who wants off-shore drilling? It's the wrong call."
Schneider National: "I liked them. I thought it was fine. I've got to tell you, Union Pacific on this decline is more impressive to me, but I think you're fine with that."
Triton International: "Look, I listened to Union Pacific and CSX['s post-earnings conference calls], and intermodal is very, very strong, so it's certainly got the wind at its back, but the specifics of Triton, I'm not sure."

Union Pacific Sees Higher Volumes In Second Half But Near-Flat Q3 



(Union Pacific)


JASON MA
7/20/2017


 Reprints




Union Pacific (UNP) expects volumes to improve later this year but be "closer to flat" in the current quarter, after topping second-quarter estimates early Thursday.
XAutoplay: On | OffThe results followed rival CSX (CSX), which beat views but delivered a few shocks to investors earlier this week.
Estimates: Union Pacific's EPS to climb 17% to $1.37 as revenue grows 8% to $5.16 billion, according to Zacks Investment Research.
Results: EPS of $1.45 on revenue of $5.25 billion. Freight revenue rose 11% on volume growth, increased fuel surcharge revenue, core pricing gains and positive mix of traffic. Business volumes increased 5% with gains in coal, industrial products, agricultural products and intermodal more than offsetting declines in chemicals and automotive.
"Absolute business volumes should be stronger in the second half than the first half, although year-over-year comparisons will be more challenging," said CEO Lance Fritz in a statement.
Management later said coal volumes in Q3 will be relatively stable vs. a year earlier.
Stock: Shares dropped 1.5% to 106.19 on the stock market today, after slipping 1.3% Wednesday as CSX tanked 5.1%. CSX fell 1.9% Thursday. Kansas City Southern (KSU), which reports Friday, rose 0.5%, and Norfolk Southern (NSC), which reports July 26, lost 1.8%.
During a quarterly conference call Wednesday, CSX's new CEO, E. Hunter Harrison, revealed that he only sees his role as an interim chief, calling himself a "short-timer."
And late Tuesday, the company topped quarterly estimates, led by gains in coal, and added $500 million to its share repurchase plan but hinted future returns may more cautious as CSX pursues an investment-grade debt rating.

INTERVIEW-Trump administration's NAFTA demands make sense -Union Pacific CEO

Nick Carey

Thursday, 20 Jul 2017 |  3:03  PM ETReuters



SHARES











DETROIT, July 20 (Reuters) - The list of priorities U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer released this week for the renegotiation of NAFTA with Mexico and Canada is reasonable and in line with what the Trump administration has promised to focus on, the head of America's largest railroad said on Thursday.
"It was a very reasonable document," Union Pacific Corp Chief Executive Lance Fritz said in an interview about a list of priorities released this week by Lighthizer. "From our perspective, he (Lighthizer) hit all of the elements that weve heard from the administration and they make sense."
Republican U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to exit the North American Free Trade Agreement if it is not renegotiated in favor of the United States. Talks with Mexico and Canada on revisions to the treaty, which came into effect in 1994, are due to start in mid-August.

The top priority for the talks listed by Lighthizer's office was shrinking the U.S. trade deficit with Canada and Mexico.
Union Pacific's Fritz said that Lighthizer's focus on intellectual property, labor laws and dispute resolution mechanisms all make sense.
"What makes most sense to us is elements (of Lighthizer's priorities) focusing on the streamlining of freight across the border," he added.
About 40 percent of Union Pacific's freight volume is based on international trade and about 12 percent is based on cross-border trade with Mexico.
Fritz said that Mexico should continue to be a "good driver" for Union Pacific's growth.
The CEO spoke to Reuters after Union Pacific posted a better-than-expected second-quarter profit that was lifted in part by a 25-percent jump in coal revenue.
Major U.S. railroads have seen a resurgence in coal volumes this year, following two years of precipitous declines as many utilities switched to burning cheaper natural gas and as unseasonable weather resulted in large stockpiles of unburned coal. Union Pacific said on Thursday that coal volumes in the third quarter should be relatively flat versus the same period in 2016.
"We expect coal to be a bit more stable moving forward and that's dependent on natural gas pricing and to some degree weather," Fritz said. "The large inventory overhang has largely been consumed and that's the good news."

Union Pacific Surprises Again - Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Union Pacific Surprises AgainJul.20.17 | About: Union Pacific (UNP) Jonathan Weber Value, dividend investing, Growth, growth at reasonable priceSummaryUnion Pacific performed pretty well in Q2.The company returns a lot of cash to its owners.Union Pacific's shares look attractive at the current level.Union Pacific (UNP) performs well operationally, shares are rather attractively valued and investors get high shareholder returns. The combination of these factors makes the company's shares attractive. 

Union Pacific is chugging along very well, the company has left the slump in transportation volumes and revenues for sure: 

UNP data by YCharts That revenue slump, which saw the bottom late last year, has driven the company's share price lower substantially, but Union Pacific is now finally coming back: 

Union Pacific's revenues grew by a whopping 10 percent during the second quarter, which was primarily the result of higher transportation volumes: 

Total volumes were up five percent year over year, primarily driven by higher coal volumes and higher industrial products volumes. Especially coal volumes, which have been slumping significantly for a while, are making their way back up and thus driving the volume growth at Union Pacific as well as other railroads.
 So far the third quarter results are not bad volume wise either, last week volumes were up 4% year over year, in July volumes are up two percent year over year so far. Union Pacific has also been able to push some price increases through to its customers, which explains why revenues grew at a faster pace than volumes. Those revenue gains are especially valuable, as they represent pure additional gross profit: Price increases do not go along with additional variable costs, thus the revenues Union Pacific generates in this way help increase the company's margins. 

It is thus not surprising that the company's operating ratio was down (which is good, as it means lower expenses relative to revenues), whilst earnings per share grew by a whopping 24% year over year to hit a new Q2 record of $1.45. Despite the fact that Union Pacific's revenues are still trailing behind the peak levels seen a couple of years ago, the company is already hitting new record profits, thanks to an improved cost profile as well as due to the impact of a lower share count. 

That lower share count is the product of ongoing share repurchases at Union Pacific, which has spent $1.7 billion on buybacks so far this year. Union Pacific's share count is down four percent year over year, which may doesn't sound like very much, but which has a big impact if that pace is kept up for a while: 

UNP Shares Outstanding data by YCharts
 Over the last ten years Union Pacific's share count dropped from more than 1.05 billion shares to just above 800 million (a level that should be broken in the next couple of months with Union Pacific repurchasing about 8 million shares per quarter right now), which has increased each share's portion of the company's earnings by about 30% since 2007.  As Union Pacific's earnings are growing, investors can expect that the company's high shareholder returns will grow as well, or at least remain at the current level. The company's dividend, which yields 2.2% right now and which was raised by ten percent last fall offers some above market average income, although the dividend alone is not a reason to buy the stock -- the combination of growth potential, dividend (and dividend growth) and potential for share price increases makes the company's shares attractive though. Takeaway Union Pacific has produced record second quarter earnings, and the company's results looked pretty strong overall. With high shareholder returns, a positive outlook and whilst trading at just 20 times trailing earnings shares of Union Pacific look attractive, especially when we add in the above average dividend yield.

U.S. back-to-school shipments returning to normal: Union Pacific CEO | Reuters

Lance Fritz, chief executive of Union Pacific Corp, said trans-Pacific volumes overall remain one of the company's softer areas because of overcapacity issues, but back-to-school related shipments were showing signs of rebounding. "Our consumption of goods in the United States and in the world took a little bit of a pause, and that's how they got into an overcapacity situation," Fritz told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. "It's exhibiting normal seasonality this year, which is good." That could augur well for the key back-to-school shopping season as it shows stores have the confidence to build stock. Back-to-school is the second-most important selling season for U.S. retailers after the end-of-year holidays.  Thomson Reuters' Same Store Sales Index, which tracks sales from stores open at least one year, indicates a 1 percent growth rate for the third quarter of 2017, which covers the back-to-school season through August and September. That would match 2016's back-to-school performance and mark the strongest showing so far this year, according to Jharonne Martis, director of consumer research for Thomson Reuters. Same-store sales fell by 0.1 percent during the first quarter, and are on pace for a 0.6 percent gain in the second quarter.     About 40 percent of Union Pacific's overall volumes stems from international trade, Fritz said. About 12 percent of that relates to Mexico and most of the rest is associated with trans-Pacific traffic. Inbound shipping container traffic at the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the two largest West Coast ports and key hubs for Union Pacific's international intermodal business, also point to recovering volumes.  After slumping in February, traffic has built for three consecutive months. May volumes at Los Angeles were the highest since January and at Long Beach were the highest since August 2015.  Fritz also said the company's energy-related volumes were also seeing strength, particularly demand for shipping of hydraulic fracturing supplies and coal.

A Union Pacific Railroad train crosses the Loup River just west of Columbus. This bridge is part of a pilot project undertaken by Union Pacific and the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to monitor the structural integrity of the bridge.


LIZ MORALES, Columbus Telegram



















































Union Pacific already inspects most of its bridges twice a year, which is double the amount mandated by the Federal Railroad Administration.However, the Omaha-based company is always looking to improve safety, which is why it has partnered with the University of Nebraska-Lincoln to continuously monitor a bridge near Columbus.The goal is to come up with an easily deployable and cost-effective method of detecting bridge problems, such as structural cracks, at early stages when they can easily be fixed and before they cause any problems.
“We want to know about potential problems between regular inspections, and if there’s a way to detect issues we want to take advantage of that,” said Union Pacific’s Director of Bridge Maintenance Todd Martindale.At the Columbus bridge, postgraduate students in UNL's Civil Engineering program are using sensors on the bridge's steel support members to collect data and try to detect anomalies.The project has been going on for several months.The team of students first installed sensors on specific bridge components, and after testing, created an analytical bridge model. This serves as the baseline, allowing them to revisit the site and continue collecting data. Any change in behavior could signify a potential defect.The project so far has not detected any anomalies, "which is a good thing," said Daniel Linzell, chair of UNL's Department of Engineering.Linzell said the bridge project not only seeks to gather data but also come up with new ways to package and use that data.And while the goal is not necessarily to produce a commercial process or project, it is not purely an academic study."My goal is to put something together that they (UP) will use," Linzell said.Of course, any system like that would supplement, not supplant, human inspectors.
"This doesn't mean we are taking human beings out of the process," he said. "Humans still need to be involved."But humans can inspect bridges at most a few times a year. If anything goes wrong between inspections, it could be months before it's discovered.By monitoring bridges with sensors, "Theoretically, there's always an 'inspector' there," Linzell said.In addition to the safety factor, there is also the issue of efficiency in where to deploy both physical and financial resources for Union Pacific, which has about 18,000 bridges spread out over more than 32,000 miles of track.
"We have a pretty large inventory of bridges, and we try to make smart decisions on where to spend our money," Martindale said.A system that constantly monitors bridges and identifies potential problems could help the railroad, "prioritize where we're going to do our work."The bridge in Columbus, which crosses the Loup River just west of the city, was selected for a number of reasons.That includes its age (it was built in 1908), its construction (steel plates and girders) and the fact that it is used a lot by trains with varying loads and weights.It's also on a main line and "representative of other bridges in the system," Martindale said.The bridge-monitoring project with UNL has no set time frame, so it will continue until one or both sides decide it is no longer worthwhile.Union Pacific also is doing a similar project with the University of Michigan, which is monitoring two bridges near Memphis, Tennessee.And it has collaborated with a company, SENSR Monitoring Technologies, on a system to detect movement or impact to a bridge pier.

Union Pacific Surprises Again - Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Union Pacific Surprises AgainJul.20.17 | About: Union Pacific (UNP) Jonathan Weber Value, dividend investing, Growth, growth at reasonable priceSummaryUnion Pacific performed pretty well in Q2.The company returns a lot of cash to its owners.Union Pacific's shares look attractive at the current level.Union Pacific (UNP) performs well operationally, shares are rather attractively valued and investors get high shareholder returns. The combination of these factors makes the company's shares attractive. 

Union Pacific is chugging along very well, the company has left the slump in transportation volumes and revenues for sure: 

UNP data by YCharts That revenue slump, which saw the bottom late last year, has driven the company's share price lower substantially, but Union Pacific is now finally coming back: 

Union Pacific's revenues grew by a whopping 10 percent during the second quarter, which was primarily the result of higher transportation volumes: 

Total volumes were up five percent year over year, primarily driven by higher coal volumes and higher industrial products volumes. Especially coal volumes, which have been slumping significantly for a while, are making their way back up and thus driving the volume growth at Union Pacific as well as other railroads.
 So far the third quarter results are not bad volume wise either, last week volumes were up 4% year over year, in July volumes are up two percent year over year so far. Union Pacific has also been able to push some price increases through to its customers, which explains why revenues grew at a faster pace than volumes. Those revenue gains are especially valuable, as they represent pure additional gross profit: Price increases do not go along with additional variable costs, thus the revenues Union Pacific generates in this way help increase the company's margins. 

It is thus not surprising that the company's operating ratio was down (which is good, as it means lower expenses relative to revenues), whilst earnings per share grew by a whopping 24% year over year to hit a new Q2 record of $1.45. Despite the fact that Union Pacific's revenues are still trailing behind the peak levels seen a couple of years ago, the company is already hitting new record profits, thanks to an improved cost profile as well as due to the impact of a lower share count. 

That lower share count is the product of ongoing share repurchases at Union Pacific, which has spent $1.7 billion on buybacks so far this year. Union Pacific's share count is down four percent year over year, which may doesn't sound like very much, but which has a big impact if that pace is kept up for a while: 

UNP Shares Outstanding data by YCharts
 Over the last ten years Union Pacific's share count dropped from more than 1.05 billion shares to just above 800 million (a level that should be broken in the next couple of months with Union Pacific repurchasing about 8 million shares per quarter right now), which has increased each share's portion of the company's earnings by about 30% since 2007.  As Union Pacific's earnings are growing, investors can expect that the company's high shareholder returns will grow as well, or at least remain at the current level. The company's dividend, which yields 2.2% right now and which was raised by ten percent last fall offers some above market average income, although the dividend alone is not a reason to buy the stock -- the combination of growth potential, dividend (and dividend growth) and potential for share price increases makes the company's shares attractive though. Takeaway Union Pacific has produced record second quarter earnings, and the company's results looked pretty strong overall. With high shareholder returns, a positive outlook and whilst trading at just 20 times trailing earnings shares of Union Pacific look attractive, especially when we add in the above average dividend yield.

					Full Description



Union Pacific Corporation, incorporated on February 3, 1969, is a railroad operating company in the United States. The Company operates through its principal operating company, Union Pacific Railroad Company (UPRR). Its business mix includes Agricultural Products, Automotive, Chemicals, Coal, Industrial Products and Intermodal. As of December 31, 2016, its network included 32,070 route miles, linking Pacific Coast and Gulf Coast ports with the Midwest and Eastern United States gateways. As of December 31, 2016, the Company owned 26,053 miles and operated on the remainder pursuant to trackage rights or leases. It serves the western two-thirds of the country and maintains coordinated schedules with other rail carriers for the handling of freight to and from the Atlantic Coast, the Pacific Coast, the Southeast, the Southwest, Canada and Mexico. Export and import traffic is moved through Gulf Coast and Pacific Coast ports and across the Mexican and Canadian borders.The Company's freight traffic consists of bulk, manifest, and premium business. Bulk traffic primarily consists of coal, grain, soda ash, ethanol, rock and crude oil shipped in unit trains-trains transporting a single commodity from one origin to one destination. Manifest traffic includes individual carload or less than train-load business involving commodities, such as lumber, steel, paper, food and chemicals. The transportation of finished vehicles, auto parts, intermodal containers and truck trailers are included as part of its premium business.Agricultural ProductsThe Company accesses various grain markets, linking the Midwest and Western United States producing areas to export terminals in the Pacific Northwest and Gulf Coast ports, as well as Mexico. The Company also serves domestic markets, including grain processors, animal feeders and ethanol producers in the Midwest, West, South and Rocky Mountain states. As of December 31, 2016, Unit trains, which transported a single commodity between producers and export terminals or domestic markets, represented approximately 41% of its agricultural shipments.AutomotiveThe Company is an automotive carrier west of the Mississippi River. As of December 31, 2016, the Company operated or accessed over 40 vehicle distribution centers. As of December 31, 2016, its franchise served five vehicle assembly plants and connected to West Coast ports, all six Mexico gateways, and the Port of Houston to accommodate both import and export shipments. In addition to transporting finished vehicles, UPRR provides expedited handling of automotive parts in both boxcars and intermodal containers destined for Mexico, the United States and Canada.ChemicalsThe Company's franchise serves the chemical producing areas along the Gulf Coast. Its chemical franchise also accesses chemical producers in the Rocky Mountains and on the West Coast. The Company's chemical shipments include six categories: industrial chemicals, plastics, fertilizer, petroleum and liquid petroleum gases, crude oil and soda ash. These products move primarily to and from the Gulf Coast region. Fertilizer movements originate in the Gulf Coast region, the western United States and Canada (through interline access) for delivery to agricultural users in the Midwest, western United States, as well as abroad. Soda ash originates in southwestern Wyoming and California, destined for chemical and glass producing markets in North America and abroad.CoalThe Company's network supports the transportation of coal, petroleum coke, and biomass to independent and regulated power companies and industrial facilities throughout the United States. Through interchange gateways and ports, UPRR's reach extends to eastern United States utilities, as well as to Mexico and other international destinations. Coal traffic originating in the Powder River Basin (PRB) area of Wyoming is a segment of the UPRR's coal business.Industrial ProductsThe Company's Industrial Products group consists of various categories, including construction products, minerals, consumer goods, metals, lumber, paper and other miscellaneous products. Commercial, residential and governmental infrastructure investments drive shipments of steel, aggregates (cement components), cement and wood products. Industrial and light manufacturing plants receive steel, nonferrous materials, minerals and other raw materials. Paper and packaging commodities, as well as appliances, move to various metropolitan areas for consumers. Lumber shipments originate primarily in the Pacific Northwest and western Canada and move throughout the United States for use in new home construction and repair and remodeling.IntermodalThe Company's Intermodal business includes two segments: international and domestic. International business consists of import and export container traffic that mainly passes through West Coast ports served by UPRR's extensive terminal network. Domestic business includes container and trailer traffic picked up and delivered within North America for intermodal marketing companies (primarily shipper agents and logistics companies), as well as truckload carriers.The Company competes with Burlington Northern Santa Fe LLC.

Railroad stocks and United Airlines trip up Dow transports
The Dow Jones Transportation Average  dropped 83 points, or 0.9%, to buck the rally in the broader stock market, with the selloff in railroad stocks and United Airlines' parent United Continental Holdings Inc. shares  accounting for the bulk of the weakness. United's stock fell $3.29, or 4.2%, in morning trade in the wake of disappointing unit revenue guidance. That was shaving about 20 points off the Dow transports, which is a price-weighted index. Shares of CSX Corp.  slumped $3.43, or 6.3%,  after investors questioned how the railroad operator beat earnings expectations. That selloff knocked the Dow transports down by about 21 points. In sympathy, shares of Norfolk Southern Corp.  shed $3.23, or 2.6%, and Union Pacific Corp.'s stock  gave up $2.13, or 2.0%, to cut a combined 33 points from the Dow transports. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 22 points, or 0.1%, while the S&P 500  tacked on 0.3% and the Nasdaq Composite  gained 0.5%. The Dow transports are headed for a third-straight loss, after reaching a record high on July 14.

S&P 500, Dow industrials press gap support ahead of the Fed
U.S. stocks are slightly lower early Wednesday, pressured ahead of the Federal Reserve’s policy statement, due out this afternoon, and as crude-oil prices challenge major support.  In the process, the S&P 500 and Dow industrials are pressing near-term floors — around S&P 2,380 and Dow 20,910, respectively — against an otherwise bullish bigger-picture backdrop.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

A corporation is a type of entity that is formed and regulated on a state level. The corporation is formed by filing Articles of Incorporation with the Secretary of State within the state of incorporation. Ownership in a corporation is expressed through the issuance of shares while the management of the corporation is governed by a board of directors who are elected by the shareholders.The board of directors select officers who manage the day to day activities of the corporation. The board of directors also will draft bylaws for the corporation Bylaws are basically written protocols that define the way that the corporation will be governed. Corporations are required to hold annual meetings for both the shareholders and the board of directors. The annual meetings are held to discuss and decide on important decisions that are faced by the corporation.

Commonly Asked Questions for starting a C Corporation




 Are Non-U.S. Residents Allowed to Own a Corporation or LLC?

There are no citizenship or residence requirements for ownership of a C Corporation or an LLC. The S-Corporation however does not allow nonresident aliens to be shareholders (owner), but any US citizen or resident alien may be a shareholder (owner). You would, of course, require an in state street address for the state to forward official legal and tax correspondence including service of process, known as the registered agent address, but neither residency nor citizenship is required for ownership of a C Corporation or an LLC.



 In What State Should I Form my LLC or Corporation?

Unless you plan on having a large, multi-state operation, it is generally best to form your company in the state in which it is located.Generally speaking, most states will expect you to be registered with them if there is substantial ongoing business and/or a physical presence in that state. If you do form your company in a state other than the one in which your company is located, you may ultimately need to register your company as a foreign (out of state) company with your home state, which will subject you to all of the fees, taxes, and regulations of that state.



 What are the Differences Between Officers, Directors and Shareholders?

A corporation consists of all three: officers, directors and shareholders. Shareholders are the owners of the corporation and elect the directors. Directors guide and are involved in the fundamental decisions of the corporation on behalf of the shareholders. Officers are selected by the directors and run the day-to-day operations of the corporation. These do not need to be separate people. Any person can fill all three positions. In small businesses, one person can be the only shareholder, the only director, and the only officer.





 What is a C Corporation?


A C Corporation is a completely separate tax and legal entity from its owners, and owners who work in the business are treated and taxed as employees of the corporation (Note: The "C" in C Corporation refers to a sub chapter of the tax code; C Corporations are one of the most common forms of corporations, and they are frequently referred to generically as corporations).
C Corporations are subject to corporate income taxes separate from the owners, where most other forms of business entity allow for the company profits to "pass-through" to the personal income tax statements of the owners. As such, C Corporations are the most formal business entity and they have greater tax reporting responsibilities than other business entities. C Corporations allow for profits to be retained in the business, if desired, and frequently these profits can be taxed at a lower rate than personal income. C Corporations can also pay out after tax profits to its owners in the form of dividends, but this can also lead to double taxation.



 What is Stock Par Value?

Par value is a nominal dollar amount given to corporate shares. It doesn't necessarily reflect their real value, and is typically set at a low value (i.e. one dollar or one cent). The par value of a share is the minimum price at which it may be sold to shareholders, and the par value must be the same for all shares of the same class. The shares can be sold to the initial shareholders, at par value or more, but the price must be the same for each share. Not all states require a par value. Unless you specify otherwise, IncFile will authorize 1500 shares (this is due to the fact that 1500 is easily divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) with a par value of one cent, or at no par value if not required by your state.



 What are Bylaws?

The bylaws of a corporation are an internal document that contains rules for holding corporate meetings and carrying out other formalities according to state corporate laws. Bylaws are not filed with the state.

Prepare & File the Articles of Organization



We will review the information, prepare your incorporation documents, and send them to the
state of formation.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the Colorado Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the Colorado State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























Certified Copy - Articles of Organization




That Certified Copy is an additional document that will be included with the filed Articles
for your company. It is from the California Secretary of State and it is electronically signed and affixed with the California State Seal and the signature of the Secretary. This provides additional supporting documentation as to the official nature of the filing.


























CL-1 Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report.




When filing for a corporation in South Carolina, the SC Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. This initial report is the Form CL-1, and the state charges a fee of $25 for this in addition to the standard state corporate filing fee. We prepare and submit the Form CL-1 along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new corporation.


























Preparation & filing of the Initial Annual Report




When filing for a new business in Washington, the WA Secretary of State requires that an initial annual report be filed along with the necessary corporate charter documents. The state charges a fee of $10 for this in addition to the standard state filing fee. We prepare and submit the initial Annual Report along with the Articles of Incorporation and all fees as required by the state for your new business entity.


























IRS Form 2553 Preparation



The 2553 Form, known as the Subchapter S election (or Election for Small Business), is required to be filed with the IRS to obtain S-Corporation status for purposes of federal taxation. Filing this Form with the IRS is used to convert a C-Corporation into an S-Corporation. IncFile.com will prepare the form and forward it to you (as it requires the signatures of the initial shareholders), along with instructions that include where to sign and submit the form.

IMPORTANT: Please note the Form 2553 is time sensitive and must be filed with the IRS within 75 days of your corporation filing date in order to obtain S-corporation tax status for the current year.



























NYS Form CT-6 Preparation



Unlike most states, New York has a state level of S-Corporation tax status, similar to the Federal S-corporation tax status. A Federal S-corporation may (but is not required to) elect to be taxed as a New York S-corporation by filing Form CT‑6 . When S-corporation is selected as the entity type, IncFile.com will also prepare the form CT-6 for your corporation, along with the Federal S-corporation election, free of charge. NOTE: The form will require the signature(s) of the initial shareholders. IncFile.com will prepare this form and return it to you with your filed corporation, and it will just need to be signed and dated where indicated, and submitted to the state (included with the instructions).

Frequently Asked Questions






Does the price quoted include the state filing fee?

Yes, the price you see at the bottom of the page includes the state prescribed fee that is
required to file the Articles of Incorporation / Organization.



Should I reserve my company name before placing an order?

Absolutely not, in most cases we file the company within one day of receiving an order.
Reserving the name can hinder or delay the filing, if you have already reserved the name
please contact us immediately upon placing an order so that we can submit the filing with
the name reservation attached to the articles of formation.

Yes, although we offer 1 free year of Registered Agent service you will be permitted to
provide your own Registered Agent.



Will I need to sign anything?

sign as the incorporator and as the organizer for an LLC.
