The white goat hair looked more aesthetically pleasing and I knew I was likely to use it for powder, hence wasn't too worried about frequent washing.It's turned out to be a nicely portable tool for re-touching my Bobbi Brown Sheer Finish powder throughout the day. The hair density is good for the purpose, though the hairs are nowhere near as soft as my Hakuhodo sohoko goat brushes. Surprisingly, I've really taken a liking to the elongated flat shape: not only does it make it more handbag-friendly than a round handle, but each stroke is more manoeuvrable into places like the sides of my nose and the inner sockets of my eyes.I wouldn't miss this fan brush as a makeup dresser tool, but would buy again for my handbag if I lost it.
