What People Are Saying







Overview



Issue Mitigation Handbook explains how unfavorable suitability and security issues can be mitigated. Proper issue mitigation is not only critical to ultimately obtaining a federal clearance; in many cases it can result in the granting of an interim clearance and reduce the time it takes to get a final clearance. All three major federal personnel security programs are covered in this book with explanations of the procedures, investigations, and adjudicative standards. Sample SOR, LOD, NOPA, and affidavit forms, as well as reference materials, case citations, and rebuttal, hearing, and appeal instructions are included.

What People are Saying About This


William R. Loveridge

". . . unique in its approach and exceptionally thorough in its content. A great job by an author with extensive practical experience in the personnel security field." -- (William R. Loveridge, Facility Security Officer and retired DOD Personnel Security Adjudicator)



Susan L. Fonfa

". . . valuable for everyone working with the federal security system from the security professional to the novice self-advocate. The book is well-organized and succinct, yet exceedingly comprehensive." -- (Susan L. Fonfa, Ph.D., Security Consultant)



Jess M. Sadick

"Issue Mitigation Handbook . . . a tremendous service for all current and aspiring federal employees and contractors requiring security clearance. . . Henderson [is] the preeminent private-sector expert on security clearance processing; the information he imparts significantly contributes to dispelling much of the myth, mystery, and outright misinformation and fear surrounding federal security clearances." -- (Jess M. Sadick, Founder and Editor, ClearedCommunity.com) 
 


Douglas J. Harpel

". . . a ready-reference of useful information for industrial security officers and would-be holders of all levels of Government-granted security clearances. [This] well-researched book . . . lays out the answers to the tough questions that clearance-aspirants won't find via a Google search." -- (Douglas J. Harpel, Editor, Defense Systems Journal)



Evan Lesser
"In today's tough economy, a security clearance is an immensely valuable career asset. Issue Mitigation Handbook gives cleared professionals the knowledge and guidance they need to help maintain their suitability and keep their clearance." -- (Evan Lesser, Managing Director, ClearanceJobs.com)

Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1965 edition. Volume: no.133 Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper. Original Publisher: [Washington, D.C.] : Trade Statistics and Analysis Branch, Development and Trade Analysis Division, Economic Research Service, U.S. Dept. of Agriculture 14 pages Volume: no.133.

Item Description: ReInk Books, 2017. Softcover. Book Condition: NEW. Reprinted from 1886 edition. Language: eng. NO changes have been made to the original text. This is NOT a retyped or an ocr'd reprint. Illustrations, Index, if any, are included in black and white. Each page is checked manually before printing. As this reprint is from very old book, there could be some missing or flawed pages, but we always try to make the book as complete as possible. Fold-outs, if any, are not part of the book. If the original book was published in multiple volumes then this reprint is of only one volume, not the whole set. This paperback book is SEWN, where the book block is actually sewn (smythe sewn/section sewn) with thread before binding which results in a more durable type of paperback binding. It can also be open wide. The pages will not fall out and will be around for a lot longer than normal paperbacks. This print on demand book is printed on high quality acid-free paper. Original Publisher: Utica, N.Y., Curtiss & Childs' Print. 40 pages.  Bookseller Inventory # 453526565

Fiction Books

Acclaimed authors and enduring characters. Dive into the latest from Toni Morrison to Haruki Murikami to Margaret Atwood. While their works of literary fiction may be very different, these critically lauded authors share an uncanny ability to serve up complex, absorbing novels that are rich and multilayered. Indeed, there's something for every kind of reader to discover in our pages of literary fiction—from the bare, arid prose of McCarthy to the lush magical realism of Marquez, the emotional dynamics of family to the psychological upheaval of war. Fiction Books grab hold of our imaginations and keeps us close. And in the end, we—their fortunate readers—are the ones quite unready and unwilling to let go.

Methods for triazole synthesis



Patent number:  9051282
                                            

Abstract:  Disclosed are methods of synthesizing triazoles that avoids the use of concentrated acids in favor of carbonic acid generated from CO2 that can be practiced at ambient and/or elevated temperature and/or atmospheric and/or elevated pressures. The disclosed methods also provide a way of synthesizing triazole products that are sufficiently pure and/or of sufficient concentration whereby the reaction product(s) may not require purification or other treatment before being used in, for example, formulating water treatment compositions that will tend to suppress corrosion or as an intermediate product in a more complex synthesis.

Transverse device array phase shifter circuit techniques and antennas



Patent number:  6999040
                                            

Abstract:  A transverse device array phase shifter includes an overmoded waveguide structure having a top conductive broad wall surface, a bottom conductive broad wall surface and opposed first and second conductive side wall surfaces. At least one transverse device array circuit is positioned in the waveguide circuit. Each circuit comprises a generally planar dielectric substrate having a microwave circuit defined thereon, and a plurality of spaced discrete phase shifter elements. The substrate is disposed within the waveguide structure generally transverse to the side wall surfaces. A bias circuit applies a voltage to reverse bias the phase shifter elements. The transverse device array phase shifter circuit causes a change in phase of microwave or millimeter-wave energy propagating through the waveguide structure.
