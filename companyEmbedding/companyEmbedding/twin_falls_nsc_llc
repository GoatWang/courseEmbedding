SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE

SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE (this
“Supplemental Indenture” ), dated as of December
1, 2016, among NEW AMETHYST CORP., a Delaware corporation (the
“Successor Issuer” ), the subsidiaries listed on
the signature pages hereto (each a “Subsidiary
Guarantor” ), and U.S. BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, a
national banking association organized under the laws of the United
States of America, as trustee (the “Trustee”
).

W I T N E S S E T H

WHEREAS, AmSurg Corp. (the
“Predecessor Issuer” ), the Subsidiary
Guarantors and the Trustee have heretofore entered into that
certain Indenture dated as of July 16, 2014, as heretofore
amended and supplemented prior to the date hereof (the
“Original Indenture” ), governing the
Predecessor Company’s 5.625% Senior Notes due 2022 (the
“Notes” ); and

WHEREAS, on the date of this
Supplemental Indenture, the Predecessor Issuer has merged with and
into the Successor Issuer, with the Successor Issuer as the
surviving entity (the “Merger” ); and

WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 5.01(a)
of the Original Indenture, the Successor Issuer desires to enter
into this Supplemental Indenture expressly assuming all of the
Predecessor Issuer’s obligations under the Notes, the
Original Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement;
and

WHEREAS, pursuant to Section
5.01(a)(iv) of the Original Indenture, each Subsidiary Guarantor
desires to confirm in writing that its Subsidiary Guarantee shall
apply to the Successor Issuer’s obligations under the Notes,
the Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement; and

WHEREAS, this Supplemental Indenture
is permitted under Section 8.01(a)(ii) of the Original Indenture,
without the consent of the holders of the Notes.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of
the foregoing and for other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the Successor Issuer, the
Subsidiary Guarantors and the Trustee mutually covenant and agree
for the equal and ratable benefit of the Holders of the Notes as
follows:

1. CAPITALIZED TERMS
. Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have
the meanings assigned to them in the Original Indenture.

2. ASSUMPTION OF NOTES AND
ORIGINAL INDENTURE . From and after the effective time of
the Merger, the Successor Issuer hereby expressly assumes all of
the Predecessor Issuer’s obligations under the Notes, the
Original Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement. (The
Original Indenture, as amended and supplemented by this
Supplemental Indenture, is hereinafter referred to as the
“Indenture.” )



3. CONFIRMATION OF NOTE
GUARANTEES . Each Subsidiary Guarantor, by its execution
of this Supplemental Indenture, hereby confirms that its Note
Guarantee shall apply to the obligations of the Successor Issuer in
accordance with the Notes, the Indenture and the Registration

4. NO OTHER CHANGES
. Except as amended and supplemented by this Supplemental
Indenture, the Original Indenture shall continue in full force and
effect.

5. NEW YORK LAW TO GOVERN
. THE INTERNAL LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SHALL GOVERN AND
BE USED TO CONSTRUE THIS SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE BUT WITHOUT GIVING
EFFECT TO APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW TO THE EXTENT
THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANOTHER JURISDICTION WOULD BE
REQUIRED THEREBY.

6. COUNTERPARTS . The
parties may sign any number of copies of this Supplemental
Indenture. Each signed copy shall be an original, but all of
them together represent the same agreement.

7. EFFECT OF HEADINGS
. The Section headings herein are for convenience only and
shall not affect the construction hereof.

8. THE TRUSTEE . The
Trustee shall not be responsible in any manner whatsoever for or in
respect of the validity or sufficiency of this Supplemental
Indenture or for or in respect of the recitals contained herein,
all of which recitals are made solely by the Successor Issuer and
