The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator

The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]
Instructure was founded in 2008 by two BYU graduate students, Brian Whitmer and Devlin Daley,[2] with initial funding from Mozy founder Josh Coates (currently the CEO) and Epic Ventures.[3]
In December 2010, the Utah Education Network (UEN), which represents a number of Utah colleges and universities, announced that Instructure would be replacing Blackboard as their preferred LMS.[4] By January, 2013, Instructure's LMS platform was in use by more than 300 colleges, universities and K-12 districts, and the company's customer base had increased to more than 425 halfway through 2013 and 9 million users by the end of 2013.[5][6]
In February 2011, Instructure announced that they were making their flagship product, Canvas, freely available under an AGPL license as open source software. Instructure's announcement received coverage in the press.[7][8][9][10] In February 2012, the company launched Canvas K-12.[11]
In November 2012, Instructure entered the massive open online course market by launching Canvas Network.[12]
In June 2013, Instructure secured $30 Million in Series D Funding, bringing their lifetime funding total to $50M.[13] In February, 2015, Instructure raised another $40 Million in Series E Funding, raising their lifetime funding total to $90M. CEO Josh Coates described it as "a pre-IPO round."[14] On November 13, 2015, Instructure began trading as a publicly held company on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: INST).[15]
Products[edit]
Canvas[edit]
Instructure Inc. was created in order to support the continued development of a new learning management system (LMS) originally named Instructure. Once incorporated, the founders changed the name of the software to Canvas. The Utah-based company tested the LMS at several local schools including Utah State University and Brigham Young University before officially launching Canvas.
Canvas was built using Ruby on Rails as the web application framework backed by a PostgreSQL database. It incorporates JQuery, HTML5, and CSS3 to provide a modern user interface. OAuth is used to provide limited access to a user's information on certain social media sites like Facebook and Twitter to allow for collaboration between sites. Canvas operates as a software as a service using Amazon Web Services in the "Cloud".
Canvas K-12[edit]
In February 2012, Instructure launched Canvas K-12, an LMS platform designed for the specific needs of elementary and secondary schools.[16] The LMS enrolls parents with their students to provide greater visibility into their children's learning experience and provides actionable analytics to teachers and administrators.
Canvas Network[edit]
In November 2012, Instructure entered the massive open online course MOOC market by launching Canvas Network.[17] Instructure's approach to MOOC has been to facilitate experimentation with pedagogy and new ways to use multimedia environments to change cognition and enhance the learning process. One example is "Gender Through Comic Books," a MOOC taught by Ball State University's Christina Blanch on Canvas Network that used lessons from pop culture to explore evolving social norms and other anthropological ideals.[18]
In July 2013, Instructure partnered with Qualtrics, a Utah-based company, to survey MOOC participants on Instructure's Canvas Network about their motivations for enrolling in and completing these courses.[19] The results suggested that educators rethink ways to fully leverage the online learning environment to make the educational experience more engaging and interesting.
Bridge[edit]
On February 18, 2015, Instructure officially launched Bridge,[20] their new cloud-based corporate LMS. This launch followed $40 million raised in Series E funding, led by Insight Venture Partners. EPIC Ventures and Bessemer Venture Partners also participated in the funding.[21] This round raised their total lifetime funding to close to $90 million. At launch, Bridge served six corporate clients, including Oregon State University, which had also been using Instructure's Canvas LMS for their students.[14]

In February 2011, Instructure announced that they were making their flagship product, Canvas, freely available under an AGPL license as open source software. Instructure's announcement received coverage in the press.[7][8][9][10] In February 2012, the company launched Canvas K-12.[11]
In November 2012, Instructure entered the massive open online course market by launching Canvas Network.[12]
In June 2013, Instructure secured $30 Million in Series D Funding, bringing their lifetime funding total to $50M.[13] In February, 2015, Instructure raised another $40 Million in Series E Funding, raising their lifetime funding total to $90M. CEO Josh Coates described it as "a pre-IPO round."[14] On November 13, 2015, Instructure began trading as a publicly held company on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: INST).[15]
Products[edit]
Canvas[edit]
Instructure Inc. was created in order to support the continued development of a new learning management system (LMS) originally named Instructure. Once incorporated, the founders changed the name of the software to Canvas. The Utah-based company tested the LMS at several local schools including Utah State University and Brigham Young University before officially launching Canvas.
Canvas was built using Ruby on Rails as the web application framework backed by a PostgreSQL database. It incorporates JQuery, HTML5, and CSS3 to provide a modern user interface. OAuth is used to provide limited access to a user's information on certain social media sites like Facebook and Twitter to allow for collaboration between sites. Canvas operates as a software as a service using Amazon Web Services in the "Cloud".
Canvas K-12[edit]
In February 2012, Instructure launched Canvas K-12, an LMS platform designed for the specific needs of elementary and secondary schools.[16] The LMS enrolls parents with their students to provide greater visibility into their children's learning experience and provides actionable analytics to teachers and administrators.
Canvas Network[edit]
In November 2012, Instructure entered the massive open online course MOOC market by launching Canvas Network.[17] Instructure's approach to MOOC has been to facilitate experimentation with pedagogy and new ways to use multimedia environments to change cognition and enhance the learning process. One example is "Gender Through Comic Books," a MOOC taught by Ball State University's Christina Blanch on Canvas Network that used lessons from pop culture to explore evolving social norms and other anthropological ideals.[18]
In July 2013, Instructure partnered with Qualtrics, a Utah-based company, to survey MOOC participants on Instructure's Canvas Network about their motivations for enrolling in and completing these courses.[19] The results suggested that educators rethink ways to fully leverage the online learning environment to make the educational experience more engaging and interesting.
Bridge[edit]
On February 18, 2015, Instructure officially launched Bridge,[20] their new cloud-based corporate LMS. This launch followed $40 million raised in Series E funding, led by Insight Venture Partners. EPIC Ventures and Bessemer Venture Partners also participated in the funding.[21] This round raised their total lifetime funding to close to $90 million. At launch, Bridge served six corporate clients, including Oregon State University, which had also been using Instructure's Canvas LMS for their students.[14]

History[edit]
Instructure was founded in 2008 by two BYU graduate students, Brian Whitmer and Devlin Daley,[2] with initial funding from Mozy founder Josh Coates (currently the CEO) and Epic Ventures.[3]
In December 2010, the Utah Education Network (UEN), which represents a number of Utah colleges and universities, announced that Instructure would be replacing Blackboard as their preferred LMS.[4] By January, 2013, Instructure's LMS platform was in use by more than 300 colleges, universities and K-12 districts, and the company's customer base had increased to more than 425 halfway through 2013 and 9 million users by the end of 2013.[5][6]
In February 2011, Instructure announced that they were making their flagship product, Canvas, freely available under an AGPL license as open source software. Instructure's announcement received coverage in the press.[7][8][9][10] In February 2012, the company launched Canvas K-12.[11]
In November 2012, Instructure entered the massive open online course market by launching Canvas Network.[12]
In June 2013, Instructure secured $30 Million in Series D Funding, bringing their lifetime funding total to $50M.[13] In February, 2015, Instructure raised another $40 Million in Series E Funding, raising their lifetime funding total to $90M. CEO Josh Coates described it as "a pre-IPO round."[14] On November 13, 2015, Instructure began trading as a publicly held company on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE: INST).[15]
Products[edit]
Canvas[edit]
Instructure Inc. was created in order to support the continued development of a new learning management system (LMS) originally named Instructure. Once incorporated, the founders changed the name of the software to Canvas. The Utah-based company tested the LMS at several local schools including Utah State University and Brigham Young University before officially launching Canvas.
Canvas was built using Ruby on Rails as the web application framework backed by a PostgreSQL database. It incorporates JQuery, HTML5, and CSS3 to provide a modern user interface. OAuth is used to provide limited access to a user's information on certain social media sites like Facebook and Twitter to allow for collaboration between sites. Canvas operates as a software as a service using Amazon Web Services in the "Cloud".
Canvas K-12[edit]
In February 2012, Instructure launched Canvas K-12, an LMS platform designed for the specific needs of elementary and secondary schools.[16] The LMS enrolls parents with their students to provide greater visibility into their children's learning experience and provides actionable analytics to teachers and administrators.
Canvas Network[edit]
In November 2012, Instructure entered the massive open online course MOOC market by launching Canvas Network.[17] Instructure's approach to MOOC has been to facilitate experimentation with pedagogy and new ways to use multimedia environments to change cognition and enhance the learning process. One example is "Gender Through Comic Books," a MOOC taught by Ball State University's Christina Blanch on Canvas Network that used lessons from pop culture to explore evolving social norms and other anthropological ideals.[18]
In July 2013, Instructure partnered with Qualtrics, a Utah-based company, to survey MOOC participants on Instructure's Canvas Network about their motivations for enrolling in and completing these courses.[19] The results suggested that educators rethink ways to fully leverage the online learning environment to make the educational experience more engaging and interesting.
Bridge[edit]
On February 18, 2015, Instructure officially launched Bridge,[20] their new cloud-based corporate LMS. This launch followed $40 million raised in Series E funding, led by Insight Venture Partners. EPIC Ventures and Bessemer Venture Partners also participated in the funding.[21] This round raised their total lifetime funding to close to $90 million. At launch, Bridge served six corporate clients, including Oregon State University, which had also been using Instructure's Canvas LMS for their students.[14]

Instructure Icons
The official icon set for Instructure, Inc. products.
Icon formats:

SVG files, icon font and SVG sprite optimized for web
SVG files with configurable bounding boxes/margins for Android
PDF files with configurable bounding boxes/margins for iOS
SVG sprites
Accessible React components for each icon/variant

Usage
npm install instructure-icons

To use the React components:
import { IconAddLine } from 'instructure-icons'

function MyComponent () {
  return <IconAddLine />
}
Contributing
The build scripts generate icon sets from the source Sketch files for multiple platforms (web, iOS, Android) and provide a local web application for testing the output. (see the demo page)
Requirements

Node v5.10.1
Mac OSX
Sketch

Set Up

In the console run ./install.sh to install dependencies.
In the console run npm start to start the local server and watch for changes.

How It Works


In the .sketch files in /src/sketch there are 1920x1920 artboards for each icon set variant. The artboard name is the name of the icon (close, add, etc.) with a prefix of the variant, like solid/close and line/close.


When you save in Sketch with the npm start script running, the artboards will be exported in SVG to the ./__build__ directory automatically via gulp-sketch, creating directories for each variant based on the artboard names.


After exporting, the build will take the SVG files generated for each variant and resize, minify, and package them for various platforms (web, iOS, Android) as individual SVG files, SVG sprites, pdf documents and icon fonts. You can see the result in the /__build__ directory.


Adding and Modifying Icons


Start with the Sketch template provided. Open the template file and then save it as a template (File > Save as Template...). The next time you want to make an icon it will be available in your template list (File > New From Template) in the Sketch app.


Save new icon files in the /src/sketch directory.


Run npm start to start the local server and watch for changes to the sketch files and generate the various formats.


Guidelines for Drawing Icons


Use dashes in the name of the .sketch files (e.g calendar-month). Use the same name for artboards, but prefix with the variant, like solid/calendar-month and line/calendar-month.


Draw your icons on the 1920 x 1920 artboards that are set up for you in the Sketch template.


Before you flatten shapes or vectorize strokes as described below, make a hidden copy of the original paths off to the side so that you can more easily come back and make changes later.


Flatten your shapes (Layer > Paths > Flatten).


Export strokes to vector (Layer > Convert to Outlines).


Don’t use borders on vectors, especially not inside/outside borders which aren’t supported in SVG.


Make sure none of the paths go outside of the artboard. If so, the glyph in the icon font will be misaligned. Draw inside the lines.


Fill the space edge-to-edge as much as possible. The build process will add margins as needed.


Testing Your Changes
There's a small web app for testing all the icons. You can see all the icons at once, in different sizes and formats.
If you ran npm start, you're already running the web app. Just visit localhost:3002.
Release Process

To update the version number, run npm run bump-patch OR npm run bump-minor OR npm run bump-major depending on what type of release you'd like to do.
Merge the version bump commit to master.
Run npm run release to publish the release to npm.
Run npm run deploy to update the docs and examples on gh-pages.

About Us | Instructure

Instructure makes software that makes smarter people. It all started with Canvas in 2011 and the goal to make teaching and learning a lot easier. In 2015, we launched Bridge, which aims to change the way you (and, more importantly, your employees) think about employee engagement and corporate training. Today, more than 2,000 universities, school districts and institutions around the world use (and love) our products. We’re out to make the world smarter with better software because we hate mediocre technology as much as you do. Probably more. OK, yeah, we hate it more. 






Canvas isn’t just a product. It’s a breath of fresh air. It’s an educational revolution. It’s a powerful new way to–pardon our optimism–change the world. And, yes, there’s an industry-pushing learning management system used (and loved) by millions of passionate students and teachers in there too.





Bridge is the rebuttal to lousy, boring corporate training. It’s the new key to employees' ability to learn and contribute more efficiently—simple, mobile, modern, and easy to implement, author, and use. It might even be a little fun (don’t tell HR). Let’s change the way we do corporate learning and training. Down with the yawn-inspiring, groan-inducing era. Up with the easy-to-use, effective era. The Bridge era.





Arc is the end of passive video. The beginning of interactive, smart, easy, collaborative video. We wondered—why is learning technology evolving so quickly, but video still feels one-way, archaic, and just a step beyond slideshows and out-of-focus overhead projectors? So we created Arc to unmute learning and turn content into conversation, connection, and collaboration.

Josh Coates
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
Josh has built a career the way he builds a business—by reimagining the way things can be done (even if it requires doing some major surgery with an acetylene torch). After his start in distributed systems research at the University of California, Berkeley, and Microsoft’s Bay Area Research Center, he founded Scale Eight, which developed a new approach to scalable storage software and attracted customers like Microsoft, Viacom, and Fujitsu. Upon closing operations and selling Scale Eight’s intellectual property to Intel in 2003, Josh went on to found Berkeley Data Systems (Mozy.com) in 2005, which reshaped the world of data storage with a ubiquitous remote backup solution. Two years later, EMC Corp acquired Mozy for $76 million.
Josh now brings this imagination to the LMS world with Instructure. After seeing the opportunity to disrupt the current landscape, and in doing so, facilitate a better educational experience, he became an early investor before joining the board and becoming CEO in 2010.







Steve Kaminsky
CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER
A hardcore Deadhead in CFO’s clothing, Steve came to Instructure in 2012 to manage all of the company’s administrative operations, including accounting, finance, legal, IT, and daily Nerf gun wars. Since he began working with startups in 1995, Steve has been instrumental in raising more than $200 million in funding and building infrastructure for multiple successful acquisitions, which is all the more impressive when you consider he also attended more than 100 Grateful Dead concerts during the same time period.*
Before shifting his expertise toward startups, Steve worked as a CPA for Ernst & Young, the McDonald’s Corporation, and TriZetto. He earned a B.S. in accounting from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and an M.B.A. from UCLA Anderson Graduate School of Management.
* 150, if you count shows post-Jerry (RIP).







David Burggraaf
SVP ENGINEERING
As a father of ten (10!) children and SVP Engineering for Instructure, David Burggraaf is an understandably busy guy. Fascinated by computers since his father gave him his first Timex Sinclair in 1980, David started programming at just 13 years old (there seems to be a theme of “staying busy”). Prior to coming to Instructure in 2014, he was the Sr. VP of Product Engineering at FamilySearch. Before that, he spent 12 years at Microsoft, leading the product development team responsible for the Visual C++ suite of tools (the foundation for much of Microsoft's revenue—as well as that of the software industry in general).
Reflecting on what he loves about working for Instructure, David points to its incredible blend of purpose and technology. “Here’s an incredible group of technologists invested in one of the world's most meaningful endeavors, that of advancing education—you don’t find that anywhere else.” Are you surprised that a father of ten would be emotionally invested in education?







Misty Frost
SVP MARKETING
After spending nearly eight years in the education space with Datamark (and a lifetime immersed in sci-fi books), Misty joined Instructure (and our army of geeks) in 2012. In her role as SVP for Marketing, she guides her team toward bringing things like pretty words and pictures together with pesky things like numbers—and getting them to play nice.
Misty’s 20-year career in advertising and marketing has proven what’s possible when the relationship between a company and its customers is nurtured. Her work has driven results for companies like Hyatt Hotels, Disney, Intel, and more. Misty earned a B.S. in anthropology from the University of Utah and may or may not have a certification from The Jedi Academy.







Matt Kaminer
SVP, GENERAL COUNSEL & SECRETARY
In May 2015, self-professed Disney fanatic Matt Kaminer joined Instructure as SVP, General Counsel & Secretary. Before coming to Instructure, Matt served as General Counsel and Secretary of Collective Inc., a video and mobile advertising company. And before that (take a deep breath), he served as General Counsel and Secretary of Epocrates, Inc., General Counsel for MediMedia USA, Inc., and Assistant General Counsel and Chief Privacy Officer at WebMD Health Corp. That’s a lot of counseling, generally.
Matt holds a B.S. in computer science from Pennsylvania State University and a J.D. from George Washington University. And if you could get a degree in Finding HiddenMickeys, he’d definitely have earned that too.







Mitch Macfarlane
Chief Operating Officer
In 2011, foodie and milkshake aficionado Mitch Macfarlane joined Instructure to help build the Customer Success team from just three employees to nearly 230 by the end of 2015. He also filled the role of VP of Product, driving the implementation of Scrum methodology and a design-first product process. Now, he’s thrilled to serve as Chief Operating Officer. Why is Mitch so excited? Because he gets to build the world’s greatest learning platforms for the world’s greatest customers.
Mitch’s career path includes roles in customer and technical support, engineering, and project management. His love for working with Instructure clients to maximize their happiness is rivaled only by his insatiable appetite for milkshakes and chocolate chip cookies. Prior to joining Instructure, Mitch worked for companies including GE, Nu Skin, and Mozy.com, while also strengthening his lactose tolerance. He earned a B.S. and an M.B.A. from Brigham Young University.







Marc Maloy
EVP WORLDWIDE SALES
How fitting is it that our EVP of Worldwide Sales is a serious fisherman, always looking for the next big catch? Marc joined Instructure in 2013 to lead the company’s fast-growing sales team. He’s super passionate about the intersection of technology and learning—and its awesome potential to make the world a smarter place. (Like all good Instructure employees, Marc understands that there’s no way to overuse the word “awesome” here.)
Marc began his career in operations and spent several years in customer support roles before moving into sales. Most recently, he was head of sales for HireRight and played a big part in growing the business from a startup through a successful IPO. Marc earned a B.S in both HR and operations management from the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University.







Jeff Weber
SVP PEOPLE & PLACES
In the spring of 2013, mountain-biking triathlete Jeff Weber became Instructure’s VP of People & Places, doggedly fixated on bringing even more awesome talent to Instructure. Previously, Jeff worked at Ancestry.com—the leading online network for connecting families and the largest provider of family history information with 2.7 million paying subscriptions—as SVP of People and Places. That meant around 1,300 people (employees) at 10 places (offices). Not bad for a business built around dead people.
Jeff brings years of in-house HR and organizational development experience to Instructure, having worked for companies like Shell Oil Company, Amoco Oil, and Novell. Jeff holds an M.B.A. with an emphasis in organizational behavior from Brigham Young University. Not surprisingly, Jeff digs living in Utah, where outdoor sports enthusiasts go to get serious.







Brian Whitmer
CO-FOUNDER & BOARD MEMBER
Before becoming one of Instructure’s founding fathers in 2008, Brian already knew he wanted to build a better learning management system. His first step was a “product validation tour” of 17 colleges and universities to find out what faculty and students really wanted in an LMS. He went like a modern day Paul Revere in a Geo Metro with no air conditioning, shouting, “An open, elegant, easy-to-use solution is coming!” This legendary tour laid the groundwork for the open, elegant, easy-to-use solution we know today as Canvas.
While earning his B.S. and M.S. degrees in computer science at Brigham Young University, Brian did extensive research in technology usability, which has shaped his approach to building Canvas. Before dedicating his creative genius to opening education with technology, young Brian built and sold floppy disk versions of RPG video games by mail.







Zach Wily
CHIEF ARCHITECT
As Chief Architect, Zach is responsible for the black and white decisions about how to best build Instructure’s powerful, user-centered learning platforms. When Zach joined Instructure in 2010, he was employee number nine. Not only did he bring more than a decade’s experience as a software developer, manager, and consultant, he also brought Instructure’s unofficial black and white mascot (though it’s less unofficial by the minute)—the panda.
Zach has worked as a software developer for a number of companies, including Mozy and, it would seem, had a bit of a penchant for panda bears that’s still going strong today. He studied computer science at Brigham Young University.

Creating Awesome
In October 2014, 20 teams of developers competed in the Utah Tech Week Hackathon for a chance to win $10,000 and the title of best developers in the state. Needless to say, Team Instructure took home the gigantic check (and the bragging rights). So, yes, now we’re bragging.






In the Beginning


Instructure was founded in 2008 by two computer science grad students who got their start with a Geo Metro, a big idea, and an instructor / mentor / techpreneur who thought they might be on to something.
That unassuming Geo Metro would set in motion the company’s legendary product validation tour, which was the catalyst for transforming that big idea into the Canvas learning management system (or LMS, if you speak edtech). And that instructor / mentor / techpreneur? He was (and still is) Josh Coates, Instructure’s first investor, its current CEO, and the founder of Berkeley Data Systems (a.k.a. Mozy).
With only two dozen employees, Instructure formally launched Canvas in February 2011. An open-source software and the only true, cloud-native LMS, it set a new, open standard for education technology. Flash forward to 2015, and Instructure’s headcount had grown to more than 700, and the Canvas community had exploded to colleges, universities, and K-12 schools across the globe.
Because learning doesn’t end after graduation (and because corporate learning was begging for some disruption of its own), Instructure launched Bridge, a cloud-based learning management system for corporate training that allows people to quickly learn the things they need to be more effective in their jobs and drive company results.
To date, Instructure has connected more than 18 million teachers and learners at over 2,000 universities, school districts and institutions around the world.
So here’s your chance to get in on something awesome. Join our team, bring your big ideas, and help write the next chapter of Instructure history.


A human receptionist replaced the panda robot receptionist (or so HR claims)
Employees implemented green shirt Friday (because formal Friday failed)
The first fully stocked kitchen included OJ, popcorn, and intern-baked cookies

2012
					Canvas Network set out to offer open, online courses for everyone, everywhere
				

2013
					Instructure moved its HQ to the Old Mill Corporate Center (and brought its flamethrower)
				

2014
					Instructure went international with offices in London, Sydney, and Hong Kong
				

2015
					Bridge formally launched as a solution to change the way companies train employees
				

2016

Trust
We trust you to do your job and do it well. We hold you accountable and hope you hold us accountable.  We have a clear “tell us if we’re doing something stupid” policy.


Excellence
Achieving excellence isn’t easy. But it is simple. Instructure drives the leading edge of innovation in our technology, support, and business operations. We do this by hiring smart, creative, and passionate people and giving them opportunities to create awesome.


Simplicity
Canvas is designed to make teaching and learning easier. Everything we do—from designing the product to how we communicate—should reflect that. Keep it simple and easy to understand.








Ownership
Let’s treat Instructure like we have a vested interest in it. Because we do. Everyone’s an owner.


Integrity
Simply put, we say what we’re going to do and then we do it.


Customer Experience
We aspire to create an awesome customer experience in every interaction with our products and people.







Openness
Instructure is built on openness—it’s part of who we are. Open doors. Open office. Open source. Open is good, but TMI can be bad. Use discretion.










Invested in Awesome
What’s behind door number one? A veritable showcase of work/life benefits.* They’re so good, Instructure was named one of Utah’s Best Companies to Work For by Utah Business Magazine.


Competitive salary, equity, and 401k
Employee stock purchase plan
Tuition reimbursement
iMacs or Macbooks
Gym memberships and reward-based fitness tracking


HSA program, vision, voluntary life, and AD&D
Fully-stocked kitchens and catered lunches
100% paid medical, dental, disability, and life insurance
Paid time off, 9 paid holidays, and flexible work schedules




*Some Instructure benefits vary by location. Which benefits, you ask? Well, that’s a question for HR. But here’s a list of where they may vary.

Executive Team | Canvas Learning Management System
























Our Team
Our Partners

Executive Team





Josh Coates,Chief Executive Officer
Josh has built a career the way he builds a business—by reimagining the way things can be done (even if it requires doing some major surgery with an acetylene torch). After his start in distributed systems research at the University of California, Berkeley, and Microsoft’s Bay Area Research Center, he founded Scale Eight, which developed a new approach to scalable storage software and attracted customers like Microsoft, Viacom, and Fujitsu. Upon closing operations and selling Scale Eight’s intellectual property to Intel in 2003, Josh went on to found Berkeley Data Systems (Mozy.com) in 2005, which reshaped the world of data storage with a ubiquitous remote backup solution. Two years later, EMC Corp acquired Mozy for $76 million.
Josh now brings this imagination to the LMS world with Instructure. After seeing the opportunity to disrupt the current landscape, and in doing so, facilitate a better educational experience, he became an early investor before joining the board and becoming CEO in 2010.









Steve Kaminsky,Chief Financial Officer
A hardcore Deadhead in CFO’s clothing, Steve came to Instructure in 2012 to manage all of the company’s administrative operations, including accounting, finance, legal, IT, and daily Nerf gun wars. Since he began working with startups in 1995, Steve has been instrumental in raising more than $200 million in funding and building infrastructure for multiple successful acquisitions, which is all the more impressive when you consider he also attended more than 100 Grateful Dead concerts during the same time period.*
Before shifting his expertise toward startups, Steve worked as a CPA for Ernst & Young, the McDonald’s Corporation, and TriZetto. He earned a B.S. in accounting from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and an M.B.A. from UCLA Anderson Graduate School of Management.
* 150, if you count shows post-Jerry (RIP).







David Burggraaf,SVP Engineering
As a father of ten (10!) children and SVP Engineering for Instructure, David Burggraaf is an understandably busy guy. Fascinated by computers since his father gave him his first Timex Sinclair in 1980, David started programming at just 13 years old (there seems to be a theme of “staying busy”). Prior to coming to Instructure in 2014, he was the Sr. VP of Product Engineering at FamilySearch. Before that, he spent 12 years at Microsoft, leading the product development team responsible for the Visual C++ suite of tools (the foundation for much of Microsoft's revenue—as well as that of the software industry in general).
Reflecting on what he loves about working for Instructure, David points to its incredible blend of purpose and technology. “Here’s an incredible group of technologists invested in one of the world’s most meaningful endeavors, that of advancing education—you don’t find that anywhere else.” Are you surprised that a father of ten would be emotionally invested in education?









Misty Frost,SVP Marketing
After spending nearly eight years in the education space with Datamark (and a lifetime immersed in sci-fi books), Misty joined Instructure (and our army of geeks) in 2012. In her role as SVP for Marketing, she guides her team toward bringing things like pretty words and pictures together with pesky things like numbers—and getting them to play nice.
Misty’s 20-year career in advertising and marketing has proven what’s possible when the relationship between a company and its customers is nurtured. Her work has driven results for companies like Hyatt Hotels, Disney, Intel, and more. Misty earned a B.S. in anthropology from the University of Utah and may or may not have a certification from The Jedi Academy.







Matt Kaminer,SVP, General Counsel & Secretary
In May 2015, self-professed Disney fanatic Matt Kaminer joined Instructure as SVP, General Counsel & Secretary. Before coming to Instructure, Matt served as General Counsel and Secretary of Collective Inc., a video and mobile advertising company. And before that (take a deep breath), he served as General Counsel and Secretary of Epocrates, Inc., General Counsel for MediMedia USA, Inc., and Assistant General Counsel and Chief Privacy Officer at WebMD Health Corp. That’s a lot of counseling, generally.
Matt holds a B.S. in computer science from Pennsylvania State University and a J.D. from George Washington University. And if you could get a degree in Finding Hidden Mickeys, he’d definitely have earned that too.









Mitch Macfarlane,Chief Operating Officer
In 2011, foodie and milkshake aficionado Mitch Macfarlane joined Instructure to help build the Customer Success team from just three employees to nearly 230 by the end of 2016. He then filled the role of VP of Product, driving the implementation of Scrum methodology and a design-first product process. Now, he’s thrilled to serve as Chief Operating Officer. Why is Mitch so excited? Because he gets to build the world’s greatest learning platforms for the world’s greatest customers.
Mitch’s career path includes roles in customer and technical support, engineering, and project management. His love for working with Instructure clients to maximize their happiness is rivaled only by his insatiable appetite for milkshakes and chocolate chip cookies. Prior to joining Instructure, Mitch worked for companies including GE, Nu Skin, and Mozy.com, while also strengthening his lactose tolerance. He earned a B.S. and an M.B.A. from Brigham Young University.







Marc Maloy,EVP Worldwide Sales
How fitting is it that our EVP of Worldwide Sales is a serious fisherman, always looking for the next big catch? Marc joined Instructure in 2013 to lead the company’s fast-growing sales team. He’s super passionate about the intersection of technology and learning—and its awesome potential to make the world a smarter place. (Like all good Instructure employees, Marc understands that there’s no way to overuse the word “awesome” here.)
Marc began his career in operations and spent several years in customer support roles before moving into sales. Most recently, he was head of sales for HireRight and played a big part in growing the business from a startup through a successful IPO. Marc earned a B.S in both HR and operations management from the Kelley School of Business at Indiana University.









Jeff Weber,SVP People & Places
In the spring of 2013, mountain-biking triathlete Jeff Weber became Instructure’s VP of People & Places, doggedly fixated on bringing even more awesome talent to Instructure. Previously, Jeff worked at Ancestry.com—the leading online network for connecting families and the largest provider of family history information with 2.7 million paying subscriptions—as SVP of People and Places. That meant around 1,300 people (employees) at 10 places (offices). Not bad for a business built around dead people.
Jeff brings years of in-house HR and organizational development experience to Instructure, having worked for companies like Shell Oil Company, Amoco Oil, and Novell. Jeff holds an M.B.A. with an emphasis in organizational behavior from Brigham Young University. Not surprisingly, Jeff digs living in Utah, where outdoor sports enthusiasts go to get serious.







Zach Wily,Chief Architect
As Chief Architect, Zach is responsible for the black and white decisions about how to best build Instructure’s powerful, user-centered learning platforms. When Zach joined Instructure in 2010, he was employee number nine. Not only did he bring more than a decade’s experience as a software developer, manager, and consultant, he also brought Instructure’s unofficial black and white mascot (though it’s less unofficial by the minute)—the panda.
Zach has worked as a software developer for a number of companies, including Mozy and, it would seem, had a bit of a penchant for panda bears that’s still going strong today. He studied computer science at Brigham Young University.
