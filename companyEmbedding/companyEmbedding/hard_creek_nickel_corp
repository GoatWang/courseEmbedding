Disclaimer - This document includes the use of inferred resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. The noted assessment results are preliminary in nature and there is no assurance the mining scenarios outlined would ever be realized.

This document uses the terms "measured" "indicated" and "inferred" resources. We advise U.S. investors that while those terms are recognized and required by Canadian regulations, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission do not recognize them. U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of mineral deposits in these categories would ever be converted to reserves.

This document contains "forward looking statements" which are subject to risks, both known and unknown, which may affect the outcome of such forward looking statements. Known risks include, but are not limited to, financing risks, commodity price risks, scheduling risks and engineering risks.

Metals & Mining Company Research Reports


Mining companies, as a rule, carry out such activities as the discovery of reserves, their mining and processing.  Various geological materials are mined – be it coal, gold or silver ore, chromite, salt, and a far more. Some companies specialize on certain products (e.g. metals or minerals), but the industry behemoths offer goods belonging to different product categories.  
Companies active in the mining industry vary according to the size and types of their operations.  Nevertheless, the market is dominated by manufacturers receiving over USD 500 million in revenues annually. BHP Billiton, Vale, Rio Tinto, Shenhua and Suncor are amid companies determining the path of the industry. 
The Catalogue is full of innumerable research reports containing profiles of the major and minor companies involved in metals and mining industries. Besides containing all-inclusive profiles of metals and mineral companies, reports offer unique data on companies’ strengths and weaknesses, financial performance, recent developments and future prospects. Detailed discussions of legal and political framework, product offerings and key competitors are also available in the research studies.

Ultra Petroleum has grown from a market capitalization of $10 million to its current capitalization of more than $7 billion.

Disclaimer - This document includes the use of inferred resources that are considered too speculative geologically to have economic considerations applied to them that would enable them to be categorized as mineral reserves. The noted assessment results are preliminary in nature and there is no assurance the mining scenarios outlined would ever be realized.

This document uses the terms "measured" "indicated" and "inferred" resources. We advise U.S. investors that while those terms are recognized and required by Canadian regulations, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission do not recognize them. U.S. investors are cautioned not to assume that any part or all of mineral deposits in these categories would ever be converted to reserves.

This document contains "forward looking statements" which are subject to risks, both known and unknown, which may affect the outcome of such forward looking statements. Known risks include, but are not limited to, financing risks, commodity price risks, scheduling risks and engineering risks.
