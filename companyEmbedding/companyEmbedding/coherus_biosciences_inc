Coherus Biosciences, Inc. Key Developments

Coherus BioSciences Receives Complete Response Letter from FDA
Jun 12 17
Coherus BioSciences, Inc. announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has issued a complete response letter for its biologics license application (BLA) for CHS-1701, a pegfilgrastim (Neulasta) biosimilar candidate, under the 351(k) pathway. The CRL primarily focused on the FDA request for a reanalysis of a subset of subject samples with a revised immunogenicity assay, and requests for certain additional manufacturing related process information. The FDA did not request a clinical study to be performed in oncology patients. Additionally, the CRL does not indicate additional process qualification lots would be required or raise concerns over the GMP status of CHS-1701 bulk manufacturing and fill-finish vendors.
