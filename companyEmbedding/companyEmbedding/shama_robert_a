 Career History



President, Afton Chemical Corporation

                                    Current                


NewMarket Corporation


                  Today’s NewMarket Corporation is a far cry from its beginnings in 1887 as the Albemarle Paper Manufacturing Company. As the world has evolved, so have we. And now we’re recognized worldwide as the well-balanced holding company for some of the most respected and successful companies within the petroleum additives industry.

 

Much of our success and expansion over the last century is owed to adding new industry-leading solutions and growing our base of customers. But another large part has come from strategic acquisitions.

 

Against the background of a changing global economy, this combination has helped us gain a worldwide reputation for delivering value to our customers and equity to our shareholders.

 

Today, NewMarket Corporation provides strategic guidance and insight for our family of companies. By leveraging our centralized resources, our family of companies are able to respond quickly to local market conditions and specific customer needs.


While our business has certainly evolved since we manufactured paper products over a century ago, the way we operate remains unchanged. Everyone we deal with -- employees, customers, suppliers, shareholders, and communities – can feel confident that NewMarket and its people act with honesty, integrity, and fairness.                




President

                                    Current                


Afton Chemical Corp.


                  Afton Chemical Corp. develops and manufactures petroleum additives. It offers gasoline performance additives, diesel fuel additives, and lubricity and cold flow improvers; and driveline products, such as automotive gear oil, automatic transmission fluid, off-road vehicle, and power steering fluid additives, as well as additives for step-type automatic, continuously variable, and dual clutch transmission types. The company also offers passenger car, heavy duty diesel, motorcycle, and railroad and marine diesel engine oil additives, as well as olefin copolymer viscosity index improvers. Afton Chemical was founded in 2004 and is headquartered in Richmond, VA.
