	ITEM 1. BUSINESS.




	Company History



	JPX Global, Inc., (f.k.a.
	Jasper Explorations, Inc.) (the “Company”), was organized under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 18, 2008
	as Jubilee Resources, Inc., to explore mineral properties in North America. The name of the Company was subsequently changed to
	Jasper Explorations, Inc. on December 16, 2010. The name of the Company was again changed on January 3, 2013 from Jasper Explorations,
	Inc. to JPX Global, Inc.


	 


	On February 15, 2013, the
	Company entered into an agreement to acquire all of the assets of Scorpex, Inc. in exchange for 103,250,000 shares of Common Stock
	and 5,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock of the Company. A material condition of the agreement, production of audited financial
	statements, was not provided by Scorpex and therefore the acquisition agreement was terminated on May 16, 2013. We then resumed
	operations that existed prior to February 15, 2013, primarily, the exploration for copper, molybdenum and other minerals.


	 


	On February 5, 2014, the
	Company entered into an agreement to acquire all of the assets of Scorpex, Inc., a Nevada corporation, in exchange for 105,000,000
	shares of Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock (the “Acquisition”). We are now expanding
	our business to further develop our operations as a development stage waste disposal and recycling company, with the goal of storing
	and disposing all types of waste, including those classified as industrial, toxic, and hazardous. With the acquisition of the Scorpex
	assets, the Company has a business model to capitalize on the opportunities available in the integrated waste, and waste management
	services sector primarily in Mexico. Through its exclusive license with Tratamientos Ambientales Scorpion S.A. de C.V., ("TAS")
	a Mexican corporation, we will participate in TAS’s developing approximately 26 acres it owns located at Fraccion A-2 Del
	Rancho El Encinito Km 18.7 Carretera A Ensenada-OJOS Delegacion Real Del Castillo, Ensenada, B.C. CP 22800 for the purpose of storing
	and disposing of residential and commercial, toxic, non-toxic, hazardous and non-hazardous waste. In addition to the Ensenada property
	detailed above, TAS has finalized a lease for a second property of approximately 5 hectacres located at Parcela 45 Y 46 Plan Libertador
	Blvd. 2000, Rosarito, B.C. This Rosarito lease is a 6-month term lease with a lessee option to renew every 6 months indefinitely.
	The cost for the lease is $2500 per month. TAS is a Mexican holding company that owns property, permits, and limited structures
	and has licensed its assets exclusively to JPX Global, Inc. in return for twenty percent (20%) of net revenues from operations
	in Mexico.


	 



	Waste Disposal Plan of Operations



	 


	We are a development stage
	company with no history of operations. As a result of the Acquisition of the Scorpex assets, the Company intends to further capitalize
	on opportunities in its integrated waste, and waste management service operations, including the receiving, storage, transfer and
	disposal in an environmental manner. In providing these services, we intend to actively pursue projects and initiatives that we
	believe make a positive difference for our environment which will be focused on gasification of waste in an environmental manner.
	It is expected that our customer base will include commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers, other waste management
	companies, electric utilities, and governmental entity properties. We are a development stage company and have not realized any
	revenues. We do not have sufficient capital to enable us to commence and complete our exploration program. We will require additional
	financing in order to conduct the exploration programs described herein. Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion, raising
	substantial doubt about the Company’s financial prospects and the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

	Waste management and collection
	involves picking up and transporting waste from where it was generated to our planned gasification facilities. We intend to sub-contract
	our collection services. Waste is defined as nonhazardous waste sent off-site for final disposal through gasification including
	household waste, commercial, business or institutional waste, construction and demolition debris, regulated medical waste, yard
	waste, sludge, scrap tires and hazardous waste.


	 


	The Waste Gasification/Thermal
	Oxidation Plant, where we intend to convert waste to ash, is a two-stage waste combustion process that converts combustible organic
	matter from its existing solid, sludge or liquid state into a gas under an oxygen depleted environment (also known as “oxidation”).
	The resulting gas product is then well mixed with ambient air before being burnt off in a secondary gas-processing unit. The technology
	reverts any man made or organic waste product back to its natural state, which is inert ash or breathable air. The technology is
	capable of handling community solid waste content and biosolids including medical waste, tires, plastics, wood waste, oily waste,
	furniture and other organic or man-made compounds found in municipal or industrial waste.


	 


	The intended plant is comprised
	of three basic components: a Primary Gasification Cell, a Secondary Gas Processor, and a computerized Process Logic Controller.
	Combustible waste material is placed into the primary gasification cell through the load access door. In some facilities this can
	be done via a loading conveyor. The proposed design is to have collection vehicles dump their waste load directly into the primary
	oxidation cell. None of these components have been built on the property.


	 


	The Primary Cell can be
	either a batch or continuous feed processor. Based on our research, batch processing provides the most efficient and cost effective
	strategy for the waste management solution. In the case of batch processing once the cell has received that days collected waste,
	the door is closed and the process is initiated. The cell does not have to be full for the system to be activated.


	 


	An operator is responsible
	for supervising the loading of waste material, and initiating the process startup. A computer keystroke (or optional manual button
	and lever control) which pre-heats the secondary gas-processing unit accomplishes this start-up. Once that unit reaches its pre-set
	temperature, the primary gasification cell heater is activated, and the process begins. Approximately 8 to 12 hours later, the
	organic wastes in the primary cell will have been converted to a gas, and the cycle will generally be complete. The system will
	move to its “cool down” mode. In another 4-6 hours, the system may be re-loaded, and another process started, with
	or without the removal of the preceding load’s ash material.


	 


	Residual materials (bottles,
	cans, ash and misc.) need only to be removed periodically. The composition of MSW consists mainly of organic and combustible waste.
	Glass and metals are easily extracted in our plant design as it includes equipment that will assist in the process and cut down
	on labor man-hours. Ash removal is either an automated or manual process. In automated unloading, the base of the primary gasification
	cell contains a ductile iron furnace floor conveyor that evacuates material remaining in the base of the unit through a side access
	door. This dry waste material empties into a storage bin, which can be removed to another location for recycling.


	 


	Aluminum, metal and glass
	can be completely recovered. Emissions may be captured and used as a nonfossil fuel source for various “on site” processes.


	 


	Our intention is to take
	the ash that is left over from our disposal process and create a brick out of the residue. The machines that will be used, through
	60 thousand pounds of pressure, will create this brick that can then be donated back to any municipality for various uses.


	 


	We intend to provide our
	services under two types of agreements:






	 



	5



	 










	Table of Contents

	 






	 


	 







	•




	For commercial and industrial collection services, we intend to enter
	a multi-year service agreement. The fees under these agreements will be influenced by factors such as collection frequency, type
	and volume or weight of the waste collected, distance to our facility, labor costs, cost of gasification and general market factors.





	 







	•




	For most residential collection services, we will have a contract
	with, or a franchise granted by, a municipality, homeowners’ association or some other regional authority that will give
	us the exclusive right to service all or a portion of the homes in an area. These contracts or franchises are typically for periods
	of one to five years. We expect the fees for residential collection to be either paid by the municipality or authority from their
	tax revenues or service charges, or are paid directly by the residents receiving the service.





	 


	With its current assets,
	and without further financing, our auditor has expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a Going Concern. However,
	the Company plans to raise the capital necessary to fund our business through a private placement and/or a public offering of our
	common stock.


	 


	Because the company has incurred losses, income
	tax expenses are immaterial. No tax benefits have been booked related to operating loss carry-forwards, given the uncertainty of
	the Company being able to utilize such loss carry-forwards in future years. The Company anticipates incurring additional losses
	during the coming year.


	 



	Market



	 


	We believe that the $55
	billion US waste management industry will play a substantial role in the coming economic recovery and the growth of worldwide trade
	as traditional waste conversion, as well as the more technical methods such as gasification, plasma arc gasification, hydrolysis,
	and pyrolysis become cheaper and more efficient. In a world where in 2011 alone, the world’s rapidly increasing urban population
	generated nearly 2 billion tons of municipal solid waste (“MSW”), it is no longer sufficient to discard trash. It is
	estimated that this number will rise to at least 2.9 billion tons by 2022. Today, more than 800 thermal waste-to-energy (“WTE”)
	plants operate in nearly 40 countries around the globe. Led by Asia-Pacific and Europe, this number is expected to grow rapidly
	over the next decade, potentially treating 396 million tons of MSW annually by 2022 with an estimated output of 151 terawatt hours
	(TWh) of electricity. Of the municipal solid waste generated, 33 percent was recycled in 2011, up from 32 percent in 2010.


	 



	Competition




	 



	The solid waste industry
	is very competitive. Competition comes from a number of publicly held solid waste companies, private solid waste companies, large
	commercial and industrial companies handling their own waste collection or disposal operations and public and private waste-to-energy
	companies. We also have competition from municipalities and regional government authorities with respect to residential and commercial
	solid waste collection and solid waste landfills.


	 


	Operating costs, disposal
	costs and collection fees vary widely throughout Mexico. The prices that we intend to charge will be determined locally, and typically
	vary by the volume and weight, type of waste collected, treatment requirements, risk of handling or disposal, frequency of collections,
	distance to final disposal sites, labor costs and amount and type of equipment furnished to the customer. We will face intense
	competition in our core business based on pricing and quality of service. However, we believe that we can distinguish the Company
	from our competition by providing precise accounting, exceptional customer service,

	comprehensive tax management, and competitive
	pricing. While we intend to offer some customers credit terms, in most cases the credit lines will be secured by corporate or personal
	guarantees, deposits, letters of credit or other bank instruments, and liens.



	 




	Compliance with Government Regulation




	 



	We will be required to
	conduct all waste disposal activities in accordance with government regulations. Such operations are subject to various laws governing
	land use, the protection of the environment, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal,
	toxic substances, safety and other matters. Unfavorable amendments to current laws, regulations and permits governing operations
	and activities of resource exploration companies, or more stringent implementation thereof, could have a materially adverse impact
	and cause increases in capital expenditures which could result in a cessation of operations.


	 



	Employees




	 



	We use the services of
	various contract personnel from time to time. Although national unemployment rates remain high relative to historical averages,
	there exists a significant amount of competition for skilled personnel in the waste management and waste conversion industry. Nevertheless,
	we expect to be able to attract and retain such additional employees as are necessary, commensurate with the anticipated future
	expansion of our business resulting from future acquisitions and joint ventures. Further, we expect to continue to use consultants,
	contract labor, attorneys and accountants as necessary.

	carries one hundred thousand (100,000) votes, and holders of our preferred stock are able to vote together with our common stockholders

	On October 18, 2016 the
	Company sold 1,333,333 restricted shares of common stock to an accredited investor at $0.03 per share for total proceeds of $40,000.


	 


	With respect to the transactions
	noted above, no solicitation was made and no underwriting discounts were given or paid in connection with these transactions. The
	Company believes that the issuance of the shares as described above was exempt from registration with the Securities and Exchange
	Commission pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.


	 



	Penny Stock Rules



	 


	The SEC has also adopted
	rules that regulate broker-dealer practices in connection with transactions in “penny stocks” as such term is defined
	by Rule 15g-9. Penny stocks are generally equity securities with a price of less than $5.00 (other than securities registered on
	certain national securities exchanges or quoted on the Nasdaq system provided that current price and volume information with respect
	to transactions in such securities is provided by the exchange or system).


	 


	The shares offered by this
	prospectus constitute penny stocks under the Exchange Act. The shares may remain penny stocks for the foreseeable future. The classification
	of our shares as penny stocks makes it more difficult for a broker-dealer to sell the stock into a secondary market, which makes
	it more difficult for a purchaser to liquidate his or her investment. Any broker-dealer engaged by the purchaser for the purpose
	of selling his or her shares in JPX Global will be subject to the penny stock rules.


	 


	The penny stock rules require
	a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, deliver a standardized risk disclosure
	document approved by the SEC, which: (i) contains a description of the nature and level of risk in the market for penny stocks
	in both public offerings and secondary trading; (ii) contains a description of the broker’s or dealer’s duties to the
	customer and of the rights and remedies available to the customer with respect to a violation to such duties or other requirements
	of the Securities Act; (iii) contains a brief, clear, narrative description of a dealer market, including bid and ask prices for
	penny stocks and significance of the spread between the bid and ask price; (iv) contains a toll-free telephone number for inquiries
	on disciplinary actions; (v) defines significant terms in the disclosure document or in the conduct of trading in penny stocks;
	and (vi) contains such other information and is in such form as the SEC shall require by rule or regulation. The broker-dealer
	also must provide to the customer, prior to effecting any transaction in a penny stock, (i) bid and offer quotations for the penny
	stock; (ii) the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction; (iii) the number of shares to which such
	bid and ask prices apply, or other comparable information relating to the depth and liquidity of the market for such stock; and
	(iv) monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer’s account.


	 


	In addition, the penny
	stock rules require that, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from those rules, the broker-dealer must
	make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser’s
	written acknowledgment of the receipt of a risk disclosure statement, a written agreement to transactions involving penny stocks,
	and a signed and dated copy of a written suitability statement. These disclosure requirements will have the effect of reducing
	the trading activity in the secondary market for our stock because it will be subject to these penny stock rules. Therefore, stockholders
	may have difficulty selling those securities.

	Forward-Looking Statements




	 



	This report contains forward-looking
	statements that involve risks and uncertainties. We use words such as anticipate, believe, plan, expect, future, intend and similar
	expressions to identify such forward-looking statements. You should not place too much reliance on these forward-looking statements.
	Our actual results are likely to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements for many reasons.



	 




	Overview



	 


	On February 5, 2014,
	the Company entered into an agreement to acquire all of the assets of Scorpex, Inc., a Nevada corporation, in exchange for
	105,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 10,000,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock. We are now expanding our business to
	further develop our operations to capitalize on the opportunities available primarily in Mexico, in the integrated waste, and
	waste management service operations, including the receiving, storage, transfer and disposal of waste in an environmental
	manner. In providing these services, we intend to actively pursue projects and initiatives that we believe make a positive
	difference for our environment which will be focused on gasification of waste in an environmental manner. It is expected that
	our customer base will include commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers, other waste management companies,
	electric utilities, and governmental entity properties. We are an exploration stage company and we have not realized any
	revenues to date. We do not have sufficient capital to enable us to commence and complete our exploration program. We will
	require additional financing in order to conduct the exploration program described herein." Our auditors have issued a
	going concern opinion, raising substantial doubt about the Company's financial prospects, and the Company’s ability to
	continue as a going concern. As a waste management company, our principal sources of revenue will result from waste
	management contracts, but will also include revenue from ancillary services related to the handling and conversion of waste.
	Expenses which comprise the costs of goods sold include the operational and staffing costs of the trucks and other vehicles
	used for transporting and special licensing where required. General and administrative expenses have been comprised of
	administrative wages and benefits; occupancy and office expenses; outside legal, accounting and other professional fees;
	travel and other miscellaneous office and administrative expenses. Selling and marketing expenses include
	selling/marketing wages and benefits, advertising and promotional expenses, as well as travel and other miscellaneous related
	expenses.


	 


	Because we have incurred
	losses, income tax expenses are immaterial. No tax benefits have been booked related to operating loss carryforwards, given our
	uncertainty of being able to utilize such loss carryforwards in future years. We anticipate incurring additional losses during
	the coming year.


	 





	Results of Operations




	 



	Following is management’s
	discussion of the relevant items affecting results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.


	 



	Revenues

	. The Company
	generated net revenues of $-0- during both years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.

	Consulting Fees

	.
	Consulting fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $630,000 compared to $2,050,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015.
	During the year ended December 31, 2016 the Company issued 3,000,000 shares of common stock for services rendered to the Company.
	The shares were valued at $600,000 which represented the market price on the dates of issuance. During the year ended December
	31, 2015 the Company issued 2,050,000 shares of common stock for services rendered to the Company. The shares were valued at $2,050,000
	which represented the market price on the dates of issuance.


	 



	Professional Fees.

	Professional fees for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $124,332 compared to $52,557 for the year ended December 31, 2015.
	Professional fees consist mainly of the fees for the audits and reviews of the Company’s financial statements as well as
	the filings with the SEC. We anticipate that professional fees will increase in future periods as we scale up our operations.


	 



	Other General and Administrative
	Expenses.

	Other general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 were $26,189 compared to $1,592 for
	the year ended December 31, 2015. The Company expects other general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as
	we scale up our operations.



	 




	Other Income (Expense).

	The Company had net other expenses of $674,170 for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to $752 during 2015. The net other
	expense in 2016 includes expense from the change in fair value of derivative liability of $558,364. This derivative liability was
	calculated using the Black-Scholes model. Other expenses consist of interest expenses on promissory notes payable.



	 





	Liquidity and Capital Resources




	 



	As of December 31,
	2016, the Company’s primary source of liquidity consisted of $583 in cash and cash equivalents. Since inception, the
	Company has financed its operations through a combination of short -term loans from related parties and others and through
	the private placement of its common stock.


	 


	The Company has
	sustained significant net losses which have resulted in an accumulated deficit at December 31, 2016 of $34,758,025 and is
	currently experiencing a substantial shortfall in operating capital which raises doubt about the Company’s ability to
	continue as a going concern. The Company generated a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 of $1,454,691 compared to
	a net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 of $2,104,901. Without additional revenues, working capital loans, or equity
	investment, there is substantial doubt as to our ability to continue operations.


	 


	We believe these conditions
	have resulted from the inherent risks associated with small public companies. Such risks include, but are not limited to, the ability
	to (i) generate revenues and sales of our products and services at levels sufficient to cover our costs and provide a return for
	investors, (ii) attract additional capital in order to finance growth, and (iii) successfully compete with other comparable companies
	having financial, production and marketing resources significantly greater than those of the Company.


	 


	We believe that our capital
	resources are insufficient for ongoing operations, with minimal current cash reserves, particularly given the resources necessary
	to expand our waste management business. We will likely require considerable amounts of financing to make any significant advancement
	in our business strategy. There is presently no agreement in place that will guarantee financing for our Company, and we cannot
	assure you that we will be able to raise any additional funds, or that such funds will be available on acceptable terms. Funds
	raised through future equity financing will likely be substantially dilutive to current shareholders. Lack of additional funds
	will materially affect our Company and our business, and may cause us to substantially curtail or even cease operations. Consequently,
	you could incur a loss of your entire investment in the Company.

	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



	 


	We do not have any off-balance
	sheet arrangements.


	 



	Critical Accounting Policies




	 



	We believe the following
	critical accounting policies are used in the preparation of our financial statements:


	 



	Use of Estimates.     

	The
	preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
	requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying
	notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates. On a periodic basis, management reviews those estimates, including those
	related to valuation allowances, loss contingencies, income taxes, and projection of future cash flows.



	 




	Research and Development.     

	Research
	and development costs are charged to operations when incurred and are included in operating expenses.



	 



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements


	 


	See Note 3 in the Notes
	to the Financial Statements for recent accounting pronouncements.


	 


	There were various other
	accounting standards and interpretations recently issued, none of which are expected to a have a material impact on the Company's
	financial position, operations or cash flows.


	 



	Forward-Looking Statements



	 


	This report contains or
	incorporates by reference forward-looking statements within the meaning of the United States Private Securities Litigation Reform
	Act of 1995 concerning our future business plans and strategies, the receipt of working capital, future revenues and other statements
	that are not historical in nature. In this report, forward-looking statements are often identified by the words “anticipate,”
	“plan,” “believe,” “expect,” “estimate,” and the like. These forward-looking statements
	reflect our current beliefs, expectations and opinions with respect to future events, and involve future risks and uncertainties

	•


	the worldwide
	economic situation;




	 


	•


	any changes in
	interest rates or inflation;







	•




	the willingness and ability of third parties to honor their contractual
	commitments;








	•




	our ability to raise additional capital, as it may be affected by
	current conditions in the  stock market and competition for risk capital;








	•




	our capital expenditures, as they may be affected by delays or cost
	overruns;








	•




	environmental and other regulations, as the same presently exist

	•




	our ability to identify, finance and integrate any future acquisitions;

	REPORT OF
	INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM





	 




	 




	To the Board
	of Directors and Stockholders of




	JPX Global,
	Inc.




	 




	I have audited
	the accompanying balance sheets of JPX Global, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the related
	statements of operations, stockholders’ deficit, and cash flows for the years then ended. These financial statements are
	the responsibility of the Company’s management. My responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements
	based on my audits.




	 




	I conducted
	my audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require
	that I plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
	audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.  An
	audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating
	the overall financial statement presentation.  I believe that my audits provide a reasonable basis for my opinion.




	 




	In my opinion,
	the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of JPX Global, Inc.
	as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 and the results of its operations and cash flows for the years then ended in conformity with
	accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.




	 




	The accompanying
	financial statements referred to above have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed
	in Note 2 to the financial statements, the Company’s present financial situation raises substantial doubt about its ability
	to continue as a going concern. Management’s plans in regard to this matter are also described in Note 2. The financial
	statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

	On February 5, 2014, the
	Company entered into an agreement to acquire all of the operating assets of Scorpex, Inc. (“Scorpex”) (an entity related
	by common control) in exchange for 105,000,000 shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock of the
	Company. Scorpex is majority owned and controlled by JPX Global, Inc.’s then controlling shareholder, Joseph Caywood. Each
	share of Series B preferred stock is convertible into 10 shares of common stock and is entitled to vote ratably together with our
	common stockholders on all matters upon which common stockholders may vote. With the acquisition of these assets, which consist
	primarily of a license agreement, the Company has modified its business plan to include the development of waste management services
	including the storage, recycling, and disposal of waste. The Company does not presently have any waste management operations.


	 


	The acquired assets consist
	primarily of a license agreement between Scorpex and Tratamientos Ambientales Scorpion, S.A. de C.V. (a corporation formed under
	the laws of Mexico) (“TAS”). This license agreement with TAS has been assigned to JPX. TAS is a wholly owned subsidiary
	of Scorpex, and is, therefore, a common control entity. ASC 805-50-30-5 provides guidance on measuring assets and liabilities transferred
	between entities under common control. As the entities are under common control and the license agreement had no basis on Scorpex’s
	books they are being acquired at their carrying amounts (with no cost basis) on the date of transfer and, therefore, the transaction
	value is $-0-.


	 


	The license agreement was
	dated July 30, 2011 and provided Scorpex with an exclusive worldwide license for the permits, property, and any and all of TAS’s
	other assets necessary for the business of storing, recycling, disposing, and treating waste in Mexico for a term of 10 years.
	The agreement also provided for Scorpex’s annual payment to TAS of 20% of its Net Revenues (gross cash receipts less cost
	of processing and other expenses excluding general, administrative, interest, and taxes) from the license. Pursuant to the Assignment
	Consent dated February 3, 2014, TAS agreed to extend the term of the agreement every 10 years if operations have commenced pursuant
	to the license agreement.


	 


	NOTE 2. GOING CONCERN


	 


	The accompanying financial
	statements have been prepared assuming that the Company will continue as a going concern. The company does not have sufficient
	working capital for its planned activity, and to service its debt, which raises substantial doubt about its ability to continue
	as a going concern. The Company has incurred accumulated losses of $34,758,025 since inception through December 31, 2016.


	 


	Continuation of the company
	as a going concern is dependent upon obtaining additional working capital. The management of the Company has developed a strategy
	which it believes will accomplish this objective through short term loans from related parties, and additional equity investments,
	which will enable the company to continue operations for the coming year. These financial statements do not include any adjustments
	relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts, or amounts and classification of liabilities that
	might result from this uncertainty.

	NOTE 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES


	 



	Accounting Methods



	 


	The Company recognizes
	income and expenses based on the accrual method of accounting. The Company follows accounting principles generally accepted in
	the United States.


	 



	Income Tax



	 


	The Company utilizes the
	liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined
	based on the differences between financial reporting and the tax bases of the assets and liabilities and are measured using the
	enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect, when the differences are expected to be reversed. An allowance against deferred
	tax assets is recorded, when it is more likely than not that such tax benefits will not be realized.


	 



	Basic and Diluted Net Income (loss) Per
	Share



	 


	The Company follows ASC
	Topic 260 to account for the earnings per share. Basic earnings per common share (“EPS”) calculations are determined
	by dividing net income by the weighted average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per
	common share calculations are determined by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive common
	share equivalents outstanding.


	 


	For the years ended December
	31, 2016 and 2015, the common shares underlying the following dilutive securities were excluded from the calculation of diluted
	shares outstanding as the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive:

	101,500,000


	 





	 



	Cash & Cash Equivalents



	 


	For the purposes of the
	statement of cash flows, the Company considers all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less to be cash
	equivalents.


	 



	Revenue Recognition



	 


	Revenue is recognized upon
	completion of services or delivery of goods where the sales price is fixed or determinable and the collectability is reasonably
	assured. The Company has no revenue to date.


	 



	Advertising and Market Development



	 


	The Company expenses advertising
	and market development costs. As of December 31, 2016, the company has not incurred any advertising and market development costs.

	NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS








	December 31, 2016 and 2015








	 



	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets



	 


	The Company reviews and
	evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may
	not be recoverable. The assets are subject to impairment consideration under FASB ASC 360-10-35-17 if events or circumstances indicate
	that their carrying amount might not be recoverable. When the Company determines that an impairment analysis should be done, the
	analysis will be performed using the rules of FASB ASC 930-360-35, Asset Impairment, and 360-10 through 15-5, Impairment or Disposal
	of Long-Lived Assets.


	 



	Environmental Requirements



	 


	At the report date, environmental
	requirements related to a formally held mineral claim are unknown and therefore any estimate of future costs cannot be made.


	 



	Mineral Property Acquisition
	Costs



	 


	Costs of acquisition and
	option costs of mineral rights are capitalized upon acquisition. Mine development costs incurred to develop new ore deposits, to
	expand the capacity of mines, or to develop mine areas substantially in advance of current production are also capitalized once
	proven and probable reserves exist and the property is a commercially mineable property.


	 


	Costs incurred to maintain
	current production or to maintain assets on a standby basis are charged to operations. If the Company does not continue with exploration
	after the completion of the feasibility study, the mineral rights will be expensed at that time. Costs of abandoned projects are
	charged to mining costs including related property and equipment costs. To determine if these costs are in excess of their recoverable
	amount, periodic evaluation of carrying value of capitalized costs and any related property and equipment costs are based upon
	expected future cash flows and/or estimated salvage value in accordance with FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 360-10-35-15,
	Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets.


	 


	Various factors could impact
	our ability to achieve forecasted production schedules. Additionally, commodity prices, capital expenditure requirements and reclamation
	costs could differ from the assumptions the Company may use in cash flow models from exploration stage mineral interests. This,
	however, involves further risks in addition to those factors applicable to mineral interests where proven and probable reserves
	have been identified, due to the lower level of confidence that the identified mineralized material can ultimately be mined economically.


	 



	Estimates and Assumptions



	 


	Management uses estimates
	and assumptions in preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Those estimates
	and assumptions affect the reported amounts of the assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities,
	and the reported revenues and expenses. Actual results could vary from the estimates that were assumed in preparing these financial
	statements.

	Stock-based compensation



	 


	The Company records stock
	based compensation in accordance with the guidance in ASC Topic 505 and 718 which requires the Company to recognize expenses related
	to the fair value of its employee stock option awards. This eliminates accounting for share-based compensation transactions using
	the intrinsic value and requires instead that such transactions be accounted for using a fair-value-based method. The Company recognizes
	the cost of all share-based awards on a graded vesting basis over the vesting period of the award.


	 


	The Company accounts for
	equity instruments issued in exchange for the receipt of goods or services from other than employees in accordance with FASB ASC
	718-10 and the conclusions reached by the FASB ASC 505-50. Costs are measured at the estimated fair market value of the consideration
	received or the estimated fair value of the equity instruments issued, whichever is more reliably measurable. The value of equity
	instruments issued for consideration other than employee services is determined on the earliest of a performance commitment or
	completion of performance by the provider of goods or services as defined by FASB ASC 505-50.


	 



	Fair value of financial instruments



	 


	Fair value estimates discussed
	herein are based upon certain market assumptions and pertinent information available to management as of December 31, 2016. The
	respective carrying value of certain on-balance-sheet financial instruments approximated their fair values. These financial instruments
	include cash and cash equivalents, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, advances from related party, notes payable to related
	parties, notes payable, and convertible loan payable – related party. Fair values were assumed to approximate carrying values
	for cash and payables because they are short term in nature and their carrying amounts approximate fair values or they are payable
	on demand.


	 


	Level 1: The preferred
	inputs to valuation efforts are "quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities," with the caveat
	that the reporting entity must have access to that market. Information at this level is based on direct observations of transactions
	involving the same assets and liabilities, not assumptions, and thus offers superior reliability. However, relatively few items,
	especially physical assets, actually trade in active markets.


	 


	Level 2: FASB
	acknowledged that active markets for identical assets and liabilities are relatively uncommon and, even when they do exist,
	they may be too thin to provide reliable information. To deal with this shortage of direct data, the board provided a second
	level of inputs that can be applied in three situations.


	 


	Level 3: If inputs from
	levels 1 and 2 are not available, FASB acknowledges that fair value measures of many assets and liabilities are less precise. The
	board describes Level 3 inputs as "unobservable," and limits their use by saying they "shall be used to measure
	fair value to the extent that observable inputs are not available." This category allows "for situations in which there
	is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date". Earlier in the standard, FASB explains
	that "observable inputs" are gathered from sources other than the reporting company and that they are expected to reflect
	assumptions made by market participants.


	 



	Recent Accounting Pronouncements



	 


	The Company has evaluated
	recent accounting pronouncements and believes that none of them will have a material effect on the company’s financial statements.

	NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS








	December 31, 2016 and 2015








	 


	NOTE 7. CONVERTIBLE LOAN PAYABLE – RELATED
	PARTY


	 


	On December 18, 2008,
	the Company entered into a Promissory Note agreement with the then CEO of the Company. The note is for a sum of $1,500, is
	non-interest bearing, and was due and payable on December 31, 2010. The note provides that if the note was not paid on
	December 31, 2010, the note can be converted to shares of common stock of the Company for $.001 per share. At the time the
	note was issued, the Company did not have a fair value for the stock: therefore, no beneficial conversion feature was
	recorded. The Company and Joseph Caywood, the current note holder, have verbally agreed that the Company will pay the loan
	off as it is able to without penalty, and the current note holder will not convert the debt into shares of common stock. As
	of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the balance of the loan is $1,500.


	 




	NOTE 8. DERIVATIVE LIABILITY


	 


	The derivative liability at December 31, 2016
	consisted of the following:


	 




	 


	 


	Face Value


	 


	Derivative Liability




	Convertible note payable issued July 22, 2016, due April 22, 2017	


	 


	$


	166,000


	 


	 


	$


	724,364


	 




	Totals


	 


	$


	166,000


	 


	 


	$


	724,364


	 





	 


	The above convertible note contains a variable
	conversion feature based on the future trading price of the Company common stock. Therefore, the number of shares of common stock
	issuable upon conversion of the note is indeterminate. Accordingly, we have recorded the $730,400 fair value of the embedded conversion
	feature as a derivative liability at the July 22, 2016 issuance date and charged $166,000 to debt discounts and the remaining $564,400
	to expense from derivative liability. The $6,036 decrease in the fair value of the derivative liability from $730,400 at July 22,
	2016 to $724,364 at December 31, 2016 was credited to expense from derivative liability. The fair value of the derivative liability
	is measured at the respective issuance date and quarterly thereafter using the Black Scholes option pricing model. Assumptions
	used for the calculation of the derivative liability of the note at December 31, 2016 include (1) stock price of $0.03 per share,
	(2) exercise price of $0.0066 per share, (3) term of 112 days, (4) expected volatility of 609% and (5) risk free interest rate
	of 0.62%.


	 


	NOTE 9. CAPITAL STOCK


	 


	On February 17, 2015, pursuant
	to a Consulting Agreement with Joseph Caywood dated January 1, 2015, (term ended March 31, 2015), the Company issued a total of
	2,050,000 shares of common stock to 18 individuals/entities for services rendered to the Company. The stock was valued at $2,050,000
	and is included in consulting fees on the 2015 statement of operations.


	 


	On July 1, 2016, pursuant
	to a Consulting Services Agreement with an individual consultant dated June 1, 2016 (term ending November 30, 2016), the Company
	issued 2,000,000 shares of common stock to such individual for certain marketing consulting services to be rendered to the Company.
	The stock was valued at $400,000 and was expensed as consulting fees in the three months ended June 30, 2016.

	On June 17, 2016, pursuant
	to a Consulting and Representation Agreement with an entity consultant dated June 14, 2016 (extended term ending June 14, 2017),
	the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of common stock to such entity for certain investor relations services to be rendered to the
	Company. The stock was valued at $200,000 and was expensed as consulting fees in the three months ended June 30, 2016.


	 


	On October 18, 2016 the
	Company sold 1,333,333 restricted shares of common stock to an accredited investor at $0.03 per share for total proceeds of $40,000.


	 


	NOTE 10. INCOME TAXES


	 


	The Financial
	Accounting Standards Board (FASB) has issued FASB ASC 740-10.  FASB ASC 740-10 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in
	income taxes recognized in an enterprise's financial statements.  This standard requires a company to determine whether it
	is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based upon the technical merits of the position.
	 If the more-likely-than-not threshold is met, a company must measure the tax position to determine the amount to recognize
	in the financial statements.  As a result of the implementation of this standard, the Company performed a review of its material
	tax positions in accordance with recognition and measurement standards established by FASB ASC 740-10.  


	 


	Deferred taxes
	are provided on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating
	loss and tax credit carryforwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences.  Temporary
	differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.  Deferred tax
	assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or
	all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.  Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of
	changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.


	 


	At December 31,
	2016 the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $869,000 that may be offset against future taxable income
	through 2036. No tax benefits have been reported in the financial statements, because the potential tax benefits of the net operating
	loss carry forwards are offset by a valuation allowance of the same amount.


	 


	Due to the change in ownership provisions of the Tax Reform Act
	of 1986, net operating loss carryforwards for Federal income tax reporting purposes are subject to annual limitations. Should a
	significant change in ownership occur, net operating loss carryforwards may be limited as to use in the future.


	 


	Net deferred
	tax assets consist of the following components as of December 31, 2016 and 2015:

	At December 31,
	2016, the Company had no unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate.


	 


	The Company did not have any tax positions for
	which it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within
	the next 12 months.


	 


	The Company includes
	interest and penalties arising from the underpayment of income taxes in the consolidated statements of operations in the provision
	for income taxes.  As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company had no accrued interest or penalties related to uncertain
	tax positions.


	 


	The tax years
	that remain subject to examination by major taxing jurisdictions are those for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013
	and 2012.


	 




	NOTE 11. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS


	 


	In February and March 2017,
	the Company issued a total of 33,684,454 shares of common stock to Auctus Fund, LLC in satisfaction of a total of $11,672 principal
	(of the $166,000 note payable) and a total of $2,938 accrued interest.

	ITEM 9. CHANGES IN AND DISAGREEMENTS WITH
	ACCOUNTANTS ON ACCOUNTING AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE.



	 


	On January 28, 2015, JPX
	Global, Inc. (hereafter, “we” “us” “our” or the “Company”) dismissed its independent
	registered accountant, Pritchett, Siler & Hardy, P.C. (hereafter “PSH”). The company engaged PSH as its independent
	registered accountant on April 1, 2014.


	 


	The report of PSH regarding
	the Company’s financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 contained in its annual report on Form 10-K
	for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, did not contain any adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion and was not qualified
	or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting principles, except that such report on our financial statements contained
	an explanatory paragraph in respect to uncertainty as to the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.


	 


	During the period from
	April 1, 2014 through to January 28, 2015, the date of dismissal, there were no disagreements with PSH on any matter of accounting
	principles or practices, financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedures, which disagreements, if not resolved to
	the satisfaction of PSH would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreements in connection with its
	report.


	 


	On January 28, 2015 we engaged Michael T. Studer
	CPA P.C. (“Studer”), registered independent public accounting firm, as our independent accountant. Prior to the engagement
	of Studer, the Company has not consulted with Studer regarding either:


	 




	 



	a)




	the application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed; or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's financial statements, and neither a written report was provided to the Company nor oral advice was provided that Studer concluded was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue; or





	 




	 



	b)




	any matter that was either the subject of a disagreement (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions to Item 304 of Regulation S-K), or a "reportable event" (as that term is defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K).





	 


	We have not had any disagreements with any of
	our existing accountants during the past two fiscal years.



	 







	ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES



	 


	(a)   We
	maintain a system of controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports that
	we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
	time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the
	reports that we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, is accumulated and communicated to our management,
	including our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, as appropriate
	to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. As of December 31, 2016, under the supervision and with the participation
	of our Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer, management has evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation
	of our disclosure controls and procedures. Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Financial Officer
	concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective.

	As permitted by applicable
	SEC rules, this report does not include an attestation report of our independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal
	control over financial reporting. Management’s report, which is included below, was not subject to attestation by our registered
	public accounting firm pursuant to temporary rules of the SEC that permit us to provide only management’s report in this
	annual report.


	 


	(b)   There
	were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2016 that materially affected,
	or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.


	 



	MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROLS
	OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING



	 


	Our management is responsible
	for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(f)
	under the Exchange Act.


	 


	Our internal control over
	financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and
	the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes
	those policies and procedures that:


	 







	-




	Pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately
	and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of assets;





	 







	-




	Provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary
	to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that our receipts
	and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and our directors; and





	 







	-




	Provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention and timely detection
	of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on our financial statements.





	 


	Internal control systems,
	no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems that are determined to be effective provide
	only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation. Also, projections of any evaluation
	of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
	or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.


	 


	Management assessed the
	effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on criteria for effective internal control over financial
	reporting described in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
	Treadway Commission as determined to apply to a company our size.


	 


	Based on its assessment,
	management concluded that we maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016.

	PART III




	 








	ITEM 10. DIRECTORS, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND
	CORPORATE GOVERNANCE.



	 




	Board of Directors


	 


	Our board of directors
	consists of the following two individuals:


	 






	Name and Year First Elected Director(1)




	 




	Age




	 




	Background Information







	James P. Foran


	(2012)



	 



	57



	 



	Mr. Foran, age 57, is a director and the Chief
	Executive Officer for Continental Industrial Services since 1999, a company that specializes in mechanical installation and maintenance
	of water and waste treatment facilities. Mr. Foran is also the Senior Project Manager for the Detroit Incinerator Rehabilitation
	since November 2010, renovation of one of the world’s largest incineration complex’s. Mr. Foran has more than twenty
	years of experience at managing personnel and projects in the Heavy Civil Engineering Construction field. His involvement has included
	a diverse background in multiple management areas: establishing budgets, schedules, project management, mechanical process, monitoring
	and coordination, and extensive personnel management experience. He has experience in the design and construction of industrial
	facilities and processes for chemical and municipal customers. Mr. Foran has a Juris Doctorate degree from the University of Detroit
	School of Law, and a Bachelor's degree in English Literature and Communications. Mr. Foran is currently licensed to practice law
	in Michigan.


	 






	 


	(1) The business address
	of our sole director is 9864 E Grand River, Ste 110-301, Brighton, MI 48116.



	 




	Director Independence



	 


	We do not consider our
	sole member of the board of directors an “independent director” in accordance with the published listing requirements
	of the NYSE Euronext Stock Exchange. The independence definition of the NYSE includes a series of objective tests, such as that
	the director is not, and has not been for at least three years, one of our employees and that neither the director, nor any of
	his family members has engaged in various types of business dealings with us. In addition, we are required to consider “all
	relevant facts and circumstances” in making our determination as to the independence of our directors.


	 



	Compensation of Directors



	 


	Although we anticipate
	compensating the members of our board of directors in the future at industry levels, our current director is not paid cash compensation
	for his service as director. The director may be reimbursed for certain expenses incurred in attending board of directors and committee
	meetings.

	Board of Directors Meetings and Committees



	 


	Although various items
	were reviewed and approved by the Board of Directors via unanimous written consent during 2016 and 2015, the Board held no in-person
	meetings during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.


	 


	We do not have Audit or
	Compensation Committees of our board of directors. Because of the lack of financial resources available to us, we also do not have
	an “audit committee financial expert” as such term is described in Item 401 of Regulation S-K promulgated by the SEC.


	 



	Changes in Procedures by which Security
	Holders May Recommend Nominees to the Board




	 



	Any
	security holder who wishes to recommend a prospective director nominee should do so in writing by sending a letter to the Board
	of Directors. The letter should be signed, dated and include the name and address of the security holder making the recommendation,
	information to enable the Board to verify that the security holder was the holder of record or beneficial owner of the company’s
	securities as of the date of the letter, and the name, address and resumé of the potential nominee. Specific minimum qualifications
	for directors and director nominees which the Board believes must be met in order to be so considered include, but are not limited
	to, management experience, exemplary personal integrity and reputation, sound judgment, and sufficient time to devote to the discharge
	of his or her duties. There have been no changes to the procedures by which a security holder may recommend a nominee to the Board
	during our most recently ended fiscal year.


	 


	Executive Officers


	 


	James P. Foran is our sole
	executive officer, serving as our Chief Executive Officer and Secretary, as well as our principal accounting and financial officer.
	Further information pertaining Mr. Foran’s business background and experience is contained in the section above marked

	DIRECTORS,
	EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CORPORATE GOVERNANCE.



	 



	Section 16(a) Beneficial Ownership Reporting
	Compliance



	 


	We are required to identify
	each person who was an officer, director or beneficial owner of more than 10% of our registered equity securities during our most
	recent fiscal year and who failed to file on a timely basis reports required by Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of
	1934.


	 


	For the 2016 fiscal year
	we are unaware of any officer, director or beneficial owner of more that 10% of our registered equity securities who failed to
	file reports on a timely basis in accordance with Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.


	 



	Code of Ethics



	 


	The Company expects
	that its Officers and Directors will maintain appropriate standards of honesty and ethical conduct in connection with the
	performance of their duties on behalf of the Company. In recognition of this expectation, the Company has adopted a Code of
	Ethics. The purpose of this Code of Ethics is to codify standards the Company believes are reasonably necessary to deter
	wrongdoing and to promote honest and ethical conduct, including the ethical handling of actual or apparent conflicts of
	interest between personal and professional relationships and full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in
	reports and documents that the Company files with, or submits to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
	“SEC”), or other regulatory bodies and in other public communications made by the Company.

	Our Named Executive Officer did not have any
	unexercised options or stock awards that have not vested outstanding at the end of our last fiscal year. Other than as noted above,

	ITEM 12. SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL
	OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS.



	 


	The following table sets
	forth the beneficial ownership of each of our directors and executive officers, and each person known to us to beneficially own
	5% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock, and our executive officers and directors as a group, as of March 31,
	2017. Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC and includes voting or investment power with respect
	to the securities. Unless otherwise indicated, we believe that each beneficial owner set forth in the table has sole voting and
	investment power and has the same address as us. Our address is 9864 E Grand River, Ste 110-301, Brighton, Michigan 48116. As of
	March 31, 2017, we had 205,473,596 shares of common stock issued and outstanding. Each of our shares of common stock holds one
	vote. The following table describes the ownership of our voting securities (i) by each of our officers and directors, (ii) all
	of our officers and directors as a group, and (iii) each person known to us to own beneficially more than 5% of our common stock

	DESCRIPTION
	OF CAPITAL STOCK


	 


	The following description
	of our capital stock is based on relevant portions of our Articles of Incorporation (also sometimes referred to as our “charter”)
	and Bylaws. This summary may not contain all of the information that is important to you, and we refer you to our Articles of Incorporation
	and Bylaws for a more detailed description of the provisions summarized below.


	 


	JPX Global was organized
	as a corporation under the laws of the State of Nevada on December 18, 2008. Our authorized capital stock consists of 500,000,000
	shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share and 40,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. As of
	December 31, 2016, there were approximately 355 record holders of our common stock. There are no outstanding other options or warrants
	to purchase our stock.


	 


	Our charter provides that
	our board of directors may not amend our Articles of Incorporation without approval of our shareholders, including holders of our
	preferred shares. A decrease or increase in the number of shares of capital stock which we may issue would require an amendment
	of our charter.


	 


	At December 31, 2016, we
	had 171,789,142 shares of common stock issued and outstanding, 1,000 shares of Series A preferred stock issued and outstanding,
	and 10,000,000 shares of Series B preferred stock issued and outstanding.


	 


	Common Stock


	 


	Our charter authorizes
	us to issue up to 500,000,000 shares of common stock. All shares of our common stock have equal rights as to earnings, assets,
	dividends and voting privileges. If and when we issue shares of common stock to stockholders, such shares will be duly authorized,
	validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Distributions may be paid to the holders of our common stock if, as and when authorized
	by our board of directors and declared by us out of assets legally available therefore. Shares of our common stock have no preemptive,
	conversion or redemption rights and are freely transferable, except where their transfer is restricted by federal and state securities
	laws or by contract. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, each share of our common stock would be entitled
	to share ratably in all of our assets that are legally available for distribution after we pay all debts and other liabilities
	and subject to any preferential rights of holders of our preferred stock, if any preferred stock is outstanding at such time. Each
	share of our common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, including the election of
	directors.


	 



	Preferred Stock




	 



	Our charter authorizes
	us to issue up to 40,000,000 shares of preferred stock. We have designated 1,000 of the Company’s authorized 40,000,000 shares
	of preferred stock as Series A Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share, and 10,000,000 of the Company’s authorized 40,000,000
	shares of preferred stock as Series B Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share.


	 







	·





	Series A Preferred Stock.

	The Series A Preferred Stock carries
	no dividend, distribution, liquidation or conversion rights, each share of series A preferred stock carries one hundred thousand
	(100,000) votes, and holders of our preferred stock are able to vote together with our common stockholders on all matters upon
	which common stockholders may vote. Consequently, the holders of our preferred stock are able to unilaterally control the election
	of our board of directors and, ultimately, the direction of our Company. On December 31, 2016, 1,000 shares of our Series A Preferred
	Stock were issued and outstanding.

	Table of Contents

	 













	·





	Series B Preferred Stock.

	The Series B Preferred Stock is
	convertible into 10 shares of common stock and is entitled to vote ratably together with holders of the Company’s common
	stock on all matters upon which common stockholders may vote. On December 31, 2016, 10,000,000 shares of our Series B Preferred
	Stock were issued and outstanding.





	 


	Limitation of Liability of Directors and
	Officers; Indemnification and Advance of Expenses


	 


	Pursuant to our charter
	and under the Nevada Revised Statutes (hereafter, the “NRS”), our directors are not liable to us or our stockholders
	for monetary damages for breach of fiduciary duty, except for liability in connection with a breach of duty of loyalty, for acts
	or omissions not in good faith or which involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law, for authorization of illegal
	dividend payments or stock redemptions under Nevada law or any transaction from which a director has derived an improper personal
	benefit. Our charter provides that we are authorized to provide indemnification of (and advancement of expenses) to our directors,
	officers, employees and agents (and any other persons to which applicable law permits us to provide indemnification) through Bylaw
	provisions, agreements with such persons, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise, to the fullest extent
	permitted by applicable law.


	 


	We may enter into indemnification
	agreements with certain of our current directors and officers. The indemnification agreement indemnifies the indemnitee to the
	fullest extent permitted by law, including against third-party claims and claims by or in right of the Company or any subsidiary
	or majority-owned partnership of the Company by reason of that person (including the advancement of expenses subject to certain
	conditions) (a) being a director, officer employee or agent of the Company, or of any subsidiary or majority-owned partnership
	of the Company or (b) serving at our request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another entity. If appropriate, we are
	entitled to assume the defense of the claim with counsel selected by us and approved by the indemnitee (which approval may not
	be unreasonably withheld). Separate counsel employed by the indemnitee will be at his or her own expense unless (1) the employment
	of separate counsel has been previously authorized by us, (2) the indemnitee reasonably concludes there may be a conflict of interest
	or (3) we have not, in fact, employed counsel to assume the defense of such claim.


	 



	Disclosure of Commission Position on Indemnification
	for Securities Act Liabilities



	 


	Insofar as indemnification
	for liabilities arising under the Securities Act may be permitted to our directors, officers and controlling persons pursuant to
	the provisions above, or otherwise, we have been advised that in the opinion of the SEC such indemnification is against public
	policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and is, therefore, unenforceable.


	 


	In the event that a claim
	for indemnification against such liabilities, other than the payment by us of expenses incurred or paid by one of our directors,
	officers, or controlling persons in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding, is asserted by one of our directors,
	officers, or controlling persons in connection with the securities being registered, we will, unless in the opinion of our counsel
	the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification
	is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act, and we will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue


	 


	Provisions of the NRS and Our Charter
	and Bylaws


	 


	Our charter and bylaws
	provide that our board of directors will have the exclusive power to make, alter, amend or repeal any provision of our bylaws.

	Change of Control




	 



	On February 5, 2014, the
	Company entered into an agreement to acquire all of the assets of Scorpex, Inc., a Nevada corporation, in exchange for 105,000,000
	shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stockof the Company. Joseph Caywood was the controlling shareholder
	of both Scorpex, Inc. and the Company on February 5, 2014.




	 








	ITEM 13. CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED
	TRANSACTIONS.



	 


	On February 5, 2014, the
	Company entered into an agreement to acquire all of the assets of Scorpex, Inc., a Nevada corporation, in exchange for 105,000,000
	shares of common stock and 10,000,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock of the Company. Joseph Caywood was the controlling shareholder
	of both Scorpex, Inc. and the Company on February 5, 2014.


	 


	On January 6, 2014, the
	Company issued 1,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock as security for outstanding debts of the Company to Joseph Caywood.Although
	the preferred stock carries no dividend, distribution, liquidation or conversion rights, each share of series A preferred stock
	carries one hundred thousand (100,000) votes, and holders of our Series A preferred stock are able to vote together with our common
	stockholders on all matters upon which common stockholders may vote. Consequently, Mr. Caywood became able to unilaterally control
	the election of our board of directors and, ultimately, the direction of our Company.


	 


	At December 31, 2016 and
	2015, the Company was indebted to Joseph Caywood for advances to and for the Company in the amounts of $14,594 and $243,864, respectively.
	The liability is non-interest bearing and there are no terms of repayment.


	 


	At December 31, 2016 and
	2015, the Company was indebted to Joseph Caywood under a Promissory Note assigned to Mr. Caywood by the Company’s former
	chief executive officer Robert Denman in the amount of $1,500. The Promissory Note is non-interest bearing, was due and payable
	on December 31, 2010, and is convertible into shares of common stock at $.001 per share.

	b.       Any
	fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the Company's internal
	control over financial reporting.

Key Stock Data     ?    P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.
