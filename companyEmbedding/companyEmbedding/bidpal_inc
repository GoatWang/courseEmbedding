A preview of the product is available at https://www.bidpal.com/one-test-drive/. The 2017 Summer product release is immediately available.

The user experience was actually enjoyable! Further, BidPal's support staff was AMAZING. We had a DYI account and so I called the support line A LOT. There was always a friendly and knowledgable person who answered my questions. Lastly, BidPal hosts a number of free online webinars open to anyone that I found extremely insightful. What do you dislike?The Giving Center could not be customized in the software version we used, nor could some of the receipts. Hopefully this changes in future iterations. The user interface was better than other online auction products I've seen, but not as user friendly as sites like Shopify. With that said, I think the version coming out this summer will address some of that. Recommendations to others considering the productI evaluated a number of different products before deciding on BidPal and the cost is comparable. What pushes it over the edge for me is the user friendly interface and back-end, as well as the quality of the customer support it comes with. What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?For an organization with limited staff, BidPal made the back-end really easy for us. Registration and Check Out was a breeze and we were able to generate a lot of sales through our online auction before our event even began.

Since we have a small group who works on our event, this is invaluable.  I like having everything in one place and knowing exactly where we are at in the event planning process.  The pre and post event reports provide information that helps us improve the event from year to year.What do you dislike?There is nothing I dislike about Bidpal.  As a nonprofit, I always am watching our budget, so I wish we could spend a little less on Bidpal.  At the same time, I think the service they provide is worth ever penny.  We could not do it without them!Recommendations to others considering the productI would highly recommend giving Bidpal a try for your next event!What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?We have a very small development office and a small group of volunteers to run our auction event.  Bidpal is an integral part of our team.  It make the planning and execution of our event run smoothly year in and year out.  I love having Bidpal on site to help trouble shoot anything that might arise.  It gives me great peace of mind going into an event knowing I have them to lean on.  Check in and check out the night of our event are a breezy with Bidpal.

I had never used BidPal before and was able to pick it up almost instantly. I was thrown into the mix of planning a huge event and BidPal actually made it easier for me, even though I was new to the system. What do you dislike?All the reports are great, however it seems they mostly are PDF's and Word Docs. I need excels in most of my reporting, so that has been a bit of challenge. But at least they have all the information I need. Its just a matter of formatting it. Recommendations to others considering the productTalk to any institution who has run an auction or event with this software. See if there is one in your area you can attend even! This system is so easy to use for both the institution and the constituents who log in as supporters. What business problems are you solving with the product?

From an admin perspective, we are able to create and manage our events very easily from the back end of the program. From an event/on-site perspective, I have trained dozens of volunteers at many events literally 10 minutes before they had to register guests and assist at auctions. This has always gone seamlessly and volunteers of varying experience and ability are able to understand how to use this system. Also, the support of BidPal staff is unparalleled. I have worked with many BidPal staff and they are always friendly, proactive and responsive. I highly recommend BidPal.What do you dislike?Nothing, this system is easy to use and makes our events look and feel very professional.What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?Easy payment processing, easy guest registration, easy reporting and data export, professional look and feel of our events for our guests.Read MoreShare on0 of 0 found this helpful.Helpful?YesNo0 CommentsAdd a CommentAdd a CommentRespond as BidPalReport a ConcernStephanie Ann K.Review SourceStephanie Ann K.Validated ReviewVerified Current UserReview SourceExcellent ExperienceUpdated On June 13, 2017Validated ReviewVerified Current UserWhat do you like best?My favorite part of BidPal was the auction managing system. It was so much easier to track our auction solicitations and package items! The BidPal support team was very helpful any time we had questions, and the tutorial videos were awesome! Check-in and check-out were also a breeze.What do you dislike?We had to enter in all of our supporters as there is not yet integration with DonorPerfect.What business problems are you solving with the product?  What benefits have you realized?BidPal offered a better alternative to another auction management company we had been using. With BidPal, check-in and check-out were the quickest and easiest we have ever experienced at our event. It was very nice that we could manage table registrations at the event through the online system.Read MoreShare on0 of 0 found this helpful.Helpful?YesNo0 CommentsAdd a CommentAdd a CommentRespond as BidPalReport a ConcernAdministrator in Primary/Secondary EducationReview SourceAdministrator in Primary/Secondary EducationValidated ReviewVerified Current UserReview SourceGreat experience with BidPal!  Incredible costumer support!Updated On May 30, 2017Validated ReviewVerified Current UserWhat do you like best?This was our first year to offer mobile bidding at our annual auction and BidPal was incredibly easy to use.  It made for a very successful event.  Inputting the auction item data was easy and having several reporting options was also very nice to have.  What do you dislike?BidPal was very easy to use and set up.  I don't think there was anything about the system that I didn't like.Recommendations to others considering the productI would highly recommend BidPal to others.  From start to finish, the whole auction process was much easier for us this year.  Entering auction items and creating packages was simple; making table assignments and purchasing tickets was very straightforward; and having the data provided in several different reporting options was really nice to have.What business problems are you solving with the product?

Men's ClothingGuys, it’s time to update your wardrobe. Luckily for you, we’ve got all the staples and on-trend pieces your closet needs. Explore men’s clothing (including big & tall sizes), plus shoes and accessories to create outfits tailored for every occasion. And if you’re interested in a few helpful styling tips, then check out our Men’s Guide to Style. Don’t worry, you can thank us later.
First, let’s keep it casual. The keys to a great laid-back wardrobe are to pick pieces that fit well, are comfortable and are versatile. T-shirts and tees are a great place to start. Plain tees are simple and can be worn with anything. Bonus? They can double as undershirts in a pinch. Graphic tees are an easy way to show off your personality. Go with versions that showcase your interests, rep your favorite sports team or just look cool. Finish your chill shirt collection with a few polos—they’re a more polished option and can easily be dressed down or up.
Now that you’ve got your list of classic casual shirts, it’s time to focus on refreshing your collection of shorts and pants. From cargos and chinos to denim, we’ve got you covered. When it comes to jeans, especially, grab a few pairs in various washes—think light, medium and dark. Feeling adventurous? Colored denim provides a fresh update to your look. From skinny and slim fit to bootcut and relaxed, fit matters and you should always pick pairs that suit your frame and that you feel good in.
Let’s move on to pieces you’ll need to dress to impress. Look pulled together with suits, dress shirts, undershirts and men’s dress shoes. Take the opportunity to mix and match with sport coats and blazers. Pair them with dress pants or jeans for a modern feel (but only if if the dress code is more lenient). Whether you’re headed to the office, a wedding or special event, your stylish clothes will speak for themselves. Don’t forget accessories. Grab a wallet, cuff links, ties, belts and more to round out your look.
Whether you’re dressed up or down, you’ll need to layer up when it’s cold outside. Our collection of jacket, coats and vest will keep you warm. Throw on cozy sweaters and sweatshirts into your look, and for even more warmth, stock up on hats, scarves and gloves. Stick with Timberland boots and thicker fabrics that help trap heat—think wool, leather, cotton and more.
Oh, and we can’t forget workout clothes. Whether you live at the gym or are just getting back into an exercise routine, you’re going to need a solid collection of activewear. And on rest days (and every evening), pajamas and loungewear will come in handy. We’re here to help you look great every hour of the day. Find helpful styling tops and tricks with Macy’s Men’s Guide to Style.
