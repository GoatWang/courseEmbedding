Product Description
Simon Joseph Master Violin
Simon Joseph Master Violin is a special violin indeed! From Transylvania, Romania, this violin sports spruce and maple selected from Carpathian mountains. The accessories are rosewood, which include the pegs, tailpiece, chin rest, and end button. The pegs are Swiss style, with beige pins and three ring collars. End button in an English model with a beige pin. Tailpiece is hill-style with a beige fret, and one golden fine tuner for the E string. Chin rest is Guarnieri style. Fingerboard is made of ebony. The bridge was also made by the luthier; it is a Simon Joseph bridge. The beautiful wood is coated with a handmade oil varnish. The Simon Joseph violin is strung with Spirocores.

STANDING ORDERS

All Bloomberg BNA treatises are available on standing order, which ensures you will always receive the most current edition of the book or supplement of the title you have ordered from Bloomberg BNA’s book division. As soon as a new supplement or edition is published (usually annually) for a title you’ve previously purchased and requested to be placed on standing order, we’ll ship it to you to review for 30 days without any obligation. During this period, you can either (a) honor the invoice and receive a 5% discount (in addition to any other discounts you may qualify for) off the then-current price of the update, plus shipping and handling or (b) return the book(s), in which case, your invoice will be cancelled upon receipt of the book(s). Call us for a prepaid UPS label for your return. It’s as simple and easy as that. Most importantly, standing orders mean you will never have to worry about the timeliness of the information you’re relying on. And, you may discontinue standing orders at any time by contacting us at 1.800.960.1220 or by sending an email to books@bna.com.

 Put me on standing order at a 5% discount off list price of all future updates, in addition to any other discounts I may quality for. (Returnable within 30 days.)
