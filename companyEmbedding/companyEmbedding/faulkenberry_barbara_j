She is a National Association of Corporate Directors ("NACD") Board Leadership Fellow and participated in the NACD Cyber Summit, both of which contribute to best practices in corporate governance and cyber security. General Faulkenberry brings to the Company senior leadership experience in the areas of logistics, operations, strategic planning, risk management, cyber defense, international negotiations, governmental affairs, information technology and leadership development, which we believe qualifies her to serve as a member of our Board of Directors.
