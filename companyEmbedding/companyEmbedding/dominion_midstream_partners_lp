RICHMOND, Va., Dec. 1, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Dominion Midstream Partners, LP (NYSE:   DM), today closed on the transaction to acquire Questar Pipeline, LLC, from Dominion Resources, Inc. (NYSE:   D), for $1.725 billion. As part of the transaction, Dominion Midstream paid $823 million in cash to Dominion, issued $167 million of common units and $300 million of convertible preferred units to Dominion, and has assumed Questar Pipeline's $435 million of outstanding indebtedness.  








Cash sources included a previously announced $360 million underwritten public common unit offering, a $137.5 million private placement of common units, and $500 million of convertible preferred units placed with a group of institutional investors led by Stonepeak Infrastructure Partners.
Thomas F. Farrell II, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Dominion and Dominion Midstream GP, LLC, said:
"Today's announcement once again demonstrates Dominion's and Dominion Midstream's ability to execute complementary acquisitions to achieve best-in-class distribution growth at Dominion Midstream while providing cash to Dominion to pay down debt."  
The addition of Questar Pipeline – which owns and operates Federal Energy Regulatory Commission-regulated natural gas transmission and storage assets in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming – is expected to be immediately accretive to Dominion Midstream's distributable cash flow per unit. This transaction supports the partnership's intention to grow distributions to unitholders at a compounded annual growth rate of 22 percent per year through the end of the decade.
Dominion plans to use the cash generated by the dropdown transaction and other related financing activities to reduce debt at the parent level by $1.2 billion.
Joint bookrunning managers and placement agents on the above-referenced public and private capital markets activities included RBC Capital Markets, Barclays, JP Morgan, Mizuho Securities, BofA Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and UBS Investment Bank.  
About Dominion Midstream Dominion Midstream is a Delaware limited partnership formed by Dominion Resources, Inc., to grow a portfolio of natural gas terminaling, processing, storage, transportation and related assets.  It is headquartered in Richmond, Va. For more information about Dominion Midstream, visit its website at www.dommidstream.com.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Morgan Stanley reviewed four companies in the midstream energy segment and found Kinder Morgan Inc (NYSE: KMI) as worth upgrading from an Equal-Weight to an Overweight rating. The brokerage also boosted its price objective on the company from $23 to $24.
Analysts led by Tom Abrams cited four pieces of support for downgrading the other companies. According to Abrams, "stabilization, scarcity value diminishing, volatility, and time frames lengthening" were the reasons behind the downgrades and subsequent price tag reductions.
"We see the postmerger cancellation return of ETE/ETP and WMB/WPZ as more viable independent midstream choices for investors as cathartic for the sector. All are large components of midstream indices and, after recent financial announcements, have significantly moved the sector perception to a more stable position," said Abrams.

Morgan Stanley expects 2018 to usher in better credit metrics and cash flows. Therefore, the brokerage believes the stock merits re-rating.
Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE: EPD)
The lead analyst downgraded the stock from Overweight to Equal Weight. Similarly, the price objective of the stock has been slashed from $33 to $30, based on cash flow multiples reduction. 
Dominion Midstream Partners LP (NYSE: DM)
This is one of three stocks to get the downgrade rating from Overweight to Equal Weight from Morgan Stanley. The brokerage also reduced the price target from $40 to $30 citing a drop in target multiple.
Magellan Midstream Partners, L.P. (NYSE: MMP)
 One more stock in the downgraded list from Equal Weight to Underweight. The lead analyst cut the price tag from $73 to $69.
