United Refining Company is an independent refiner  and marketer of petroleum products.  We fuel cars, trucks, farm and  construction equipment and heat homes and businesses in Pennsylvania and  portions of New York and Ohio.


    United was founded in 1902 in the cradle of the  world petroleum industry.  From the start we have cherished a role of  independence in an industry that has been dominated by the giants.  For  over 100 years we have remained a free and innovative force in the  marketplace helping to bring the benefits of healthy competition to the  people of our region.

Through the years, United has continued to grow by  expanding and optimizing the refinery and by acquisition and the  building of new locations in our retail gasoline and convenience store  business.  Today we have over 350 retail outlets in Pennsylvania, Ohio,  and New York, which include service station/convenience stores, truck  stops, restaurants and garages.  The locations are branded Kwik Fill /  Red Apple Food Marts and Country Fair.
United Averages approximately 70,000 barrels per  day of oil throughput at is facility.  The refinery operates 24 hours  per day, 7 days a week.
United Refining Company employs over 4000 employees  at our facilities.  In addition to operating the retail system, United  also has a trucking operation in Erie, Pennsylvania, terminal operations  in Rochester, Tonawanda, Oswego, and West Seneca, New York as well as  Dravosburg and Springdale, Pennsylvania.  United owns an asphalt  terminal in Cordova, Alabama and maintains an office in Calgary,  Alberta, Canada.

History[edit]

Kwik Fill sign, January 2013


The United Refining Company was founded in 1902 by Harry Logan, Sr. His son, Harry Logan, Jr., succeeded his father as president and chairman of United Refining in 1957. In 1981, John Catsimatidis acquired United Refining as a subsidiary of his Red Apple Group.
The refinery was expanded from 60,000 barrels per day (9,500 m3/d) to 65,000 barrels per day (10,300 m3/d) in 1982. It was expanded again to have a processing capacity of 70,000 barrels per day (11,000 m3/d) in 2007. The employees of the Warren refinery are represented by the International Union of Operating Engineers.
Citgo[edit]
United Refining acquired the rights to use the name Citgo in 2002 when it bought a local gas station and convenience store chain called Country Fair, Inc. in Erie, Pennsylvania[3] which included a license agreement to use "Citgo's brands, trademarks and other forms of identification."[4]
After Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez's speech to the United Nations, there were calls to boycott the Citgo brand.[4] In response, URC began phasing out that brandname,[4] and has been emphasizing that its crude oil supply comes from North America. URC also continued rebranding its product under the Kwik Fill and other local names.[5]
Alternate energy[edit]
United Refining blends ethanol with its gasoline in accordance with the Energy Policy Act.
Convenience stores[edit]
United Refining Company distributes its oil through its line of owned-and-operated convenience stores, totaling approximately 375 throughout upstate New York, Pennsylvania, and Northeast Ohio. The stores operate under the names Kwik Fill, Red Apple, or Country Fair. Many Kwik Fill locations, like the one in the photo above, are full-service, meaning they pump your gas for you.

History[edit]

Kwik Fill sign, January 2013


The United Refining Company was founded in 1902 by Harry Logan, Sr. His son, Harry Logan, Jr., succeeded his father as president and chairman of United Refining in 1957. In 1981, John Catsimatidis acquired United Refining as a subsidiary of his Red Apple Group.
The refinery was expanded from 60,000 barrels per day (9,500 m3/d) to 65,000 barrels per day (10,300 m3/d) in 1982. It was expanded again to have a processing capacity of 70,000 barrels per day (11,000 m3/d) in 2007. The employees of the Warren refinery are represented by the International Union of Operating Engineers.
Citgo[edit]
United Refining acquired the rights to use the name Citgo in 2002 when it bought a local gas station and convenience store chain called Country Fair, Inc. in Erie, Pennsylvania[3] which included a license agreement to use "Citgo's brands, trademarks and other forms of identification."[4]
After Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez's speech to the United Nations, there were calls to boycott the Citgo brand.[4] In response, URC began phasing out that brandname,[4] and has been emphasizing that its crude oil supply comes from North America. URC also continued rebranding its product under the Kwik Fill and other local names.[5]
Alternate energy[edit]
United Refining blends ethanol with its gasoline in accordance with the Energy Policy Act.
Convenience stores[edit]
United Refining Company distributes its oil through its line of owned-and-operated convenience stores, totaling approximately 375 throughout upstate New York, Pennsylvania, and Northeast Ohio. The stores operate under the names Kwik Fill, Red Apple, or Country Fair. Many Kwik Fill locations, like the one in the photo above, are full-service, meaning they pump your gas for you.

On 04/15/2016, United Refining Company announced that they will be unable to file their next 10-Q by the deadline required by the SEC.


United Refining Company Announces Earnings Results for the Year Ended August 31, 2015
Nov 23 15
United Refining Company announced earnings results for the year ended August 31, 2015. Net income for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 was $82.1 million. This is an increase of $11.0 million from net income of $71.1 million for the year ended August 31, 2014. EBITDA (LIFO) was $197.1 million for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015, an increase of $22.5 million from $174.6 million from the fiscal year ended August 31, 2014. Adjusted EBITDA on a FIFO basis during fiscal years 2015 and 2014 was $93.6 million and $175.4 million, respectively. Net sales for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 were $2,716.7 million, a decrease of $722.5 million from $3,439.2 million for 2014. The decrease in Company sales was primarily attributed to a drop in NYMEX crude oil prices which averaged $101.05/bbl for fiscal 2014 versus $64.93/bbl for fiscal 2015. This 36% decrease per barrel was also reflected in a decrease in wholesale and retail selling prices. Operating income was $158,045,000 compared to $144,177,000 a year ago.


United Refining Company, United Refining Company of Pennsylvania, Kiantone Pipeline Corporation, United Refining Company of New York Inc., United Biofuels, Inc., Country Fair, Inc. and Kwik-Fill Corporation Enters into an Amended, Restated and Consolidated Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement with PNC Bank
Oct 26 15
United Refining Company, United Refining Company of Pennsylvania, Kiantone Pipeline Corporation, United Refining Company of New York Inc., United Biofuels, Inc., Country Fair, Inc. and Kwik-Fill Corporation (Borrowers) entered into an Amended, Restated and Consolidated Revolving Credit, Term Loan and Security Agreement with a group of lenders led by PNC Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, and PNC Capital Markets LLC, as Sole Lead Arranger and Bookrunner, pursuant to which the Company: (i) increased its existing revolving credit facility from $175,000,000 to $225,000,000 (Revolving Credit Facility); (ii) entered into a term loan in the amount of $250,000,000 (Term Loan); (iii) amended certain representations, warranties, covenants and terms and conditions contained in the Credit Agreement, including the provision of additional collateral in the form of a first lien mortgage on the petroleum refining facility located in Warren, Pennsylvania and the Cobham Park tank farm; and (iv) included additional subsidiaries of the Company as borrowers under the Credit Agreement and re-characterized Kwik Fill Corporation as a borrower and not as a guarantor. Both the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan are secured primarily by certain cash accounts, accounts receivable, inventory, the Refinery and the capital stock of Kiantone; provided, that the Refinery and the Kiantone stock will be released as collateral as soon as the Term Loan is paid in full. The Company intends to use the proceeds from the Revolving Credit Facility for working capital needs and general corporate purposes and the proceeds from the Term Loan to finance its cash tender offer (Tender Offer) for any and all of its $237.25 million aggregate principal amount of outstanding 10.500% First Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2018. As amended, interest under the Revolving Credit Facility is calculated as follows: (a) for domestic rate borrowings, at (i) the greater of the Agent's prime rate, federal funds rate plus 0.5% or the daily LIBOR rate plus 1%, plus (ii) an applicable margin of 1.25% to 1.75%, and (b) for euro-rate borrowings, at the LIBOR rate plus an applicable margin of 2.25% to 2.75%. The applicable margin will vary depending on a formula calculating the Company's average unused availability under the facility. Until expiration on October 20, 2020, the Company may borrow on a borrowing base formula.

KWIKPAY POLICY STATEMENTRead the Kwik Pay Policy Statement and click the button below

United Refining Company and its affiliated companies ("United") appreciate your visiting this Web site and other related or linked United sites (the "Site").  We value your privacy and we want you to understand our practices with respect to gathering information from visitors to the Site and with respect to how that information may be used.  Please check each portion or page of the Site that you visit.  Certain portions or pages of the Site may contain changes to the Privacy Statement applicable to your use of that portion or page; for example, certain applications may request additional information.
Information and Uses
When someone visits the Site, our web servers automatically gather information that allows the Site to communicate with the visitor's computer during the visit.  We also track such information as the number of visits to the Site, which parts of the Site visitors select, IP address (the Internet address assigned to your computer from your Internet Service Provider), domain type, browser type (e.g., Netscape or Internet Explorer), date and time of day.  We use those types of information for statistical purposes that help us design and administer the Site. Those types of information do not disclose personal information that would permit us to identify or locate individual visitors.
Privacy concerns focus on Personal Information ("PI"), that is, information that could identify a specific individual such as names, addresses, e-mail addresses, and telephone numbers.  If during your visit you personalize the Site, complete an order form, enter a contest, or submit other information to us, you may provide us with PI.  We may collect and use that PI to provide you with products or services, to bill you for products and services you request, to market products and services which we think may be of interest to you, or to communicate with you for other purposes.  PI may also be used to manage and provide training and to obtain course assessments and self-assessments concerning skill and competencies from participants in order to identify and enhance training activities.
As explained below in the section on Sharing Information with Third Parties, we do not distribute or sell PI to third parties for the purpose of allowing them to market their products and services to you; moreover, as explained in the Opt Out/ Modify Information section, we will make a reasonable effort to remove your PI from our database in such a way that you will not receive future communications from us.  If you notify us that PI previously submitted to our site is no longer accurate, we will make a reasonable effort to make appropriate corrections.  To facilitate our efforts, it would be helpful if you could let us know the context in which you provide PI, e.g. in connection with promotion of a specific product or service.

Information Placed on Your Computer
We may store some information (commonly known as a "cookie") on your computer when you look at or use the Site.  This information facilitates customizing your use of the Site and ensures that you do not need to re-enter your details every time you visit it.  You can erase or block this information from your computer if you want to. (Your ‘help' screen or user manual should tell you how to do this.)
We use third-party advertising technology to provide ads when you visit sites upon which we advertise.  This technology will not process any information that can be used to personally identify you, that is it will not include your name, address, or other PI.  When you access an ad, a "cookie" file will be stored on your computer.  This information is used to help manage our on-line advertising.
Information from Children
The Site may have information that may be of special interest to children but United does not seek through the Site to gather PI from or about persons under the age of 17.
Hyperlinks
This Site may have links to sites that United does not own, control or maintain.  We make no representations or warranties about privacy practices of linked sites and cannot be responsible for their privacy policies and practices and we make no representations or warranties about the privacy practices of those sites.  Similarly, we cannot be responsible for the policies and practices of any site from which you linked to our Web site.  We recommend that you check the privacy policy of other sites and contact the operator if you have concerns or questions.
Sharing Information with Third Parties
Communicating via the Internet and sending information, products, and services to you by other means necessarily involves your PI passing through or being handled by third-parties, but United does not sell or distribute your PI to third parties for purposes of allowing them to market their products and services to you.
We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf.  Examples include fulfilling order, deliveries, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing date, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments and providing customer service.  They have access to PI needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
Personal data collected by United may be transferred among its various divisions and affiliated companies.  By submitting data on the Site, the visitor is providing explicit consent to these transfers.
Sensitive Information
United does not seek any sensitive information from visitors to our Site, unless legally required to do so, for example in connection with processing credit card payments, recruiting and hiring.  Sensitive information includes a number of types of data relating, but not limited to: race or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or other similar beliefs, trade union membership, physical or mental health, or criminal record, We suggest that you do not provide sensitive information of this nature.  However, if you do provide such information, United accepts your explicit consent to use that data in the ways described in this Privacy Statement or in the ways described at the point where such information is disclosed.
Opt Out/Modify Information
You can request the removal or modification of your PI by sending an e-mail to the appropriate area under "Contact Us".  We will then make a reasonable effort to accommodate your request.  As previously noted, it would be helpful to let us know the context in which you provided PI.

History[edit]

The United Refining Company was founded in 1902 by Harry Logan, Sr. His son, Harry Logan, Jr., succeeded his father as president and chairman of United Refining in 1957. In 1981, John Catsimatidis acquired United Refining as a subsidiary of his Red Apple Group.
The refinery was expanded from 60,000 barrels per day (9,500 m3/d) to 65,000 barrels per day (10,300 m3/d) in 1982. It was expanded again to have a processing capacity of 70,000 barrels per day (11,000 m3/d) in 2007. The employees of the Warren refinery are represented by the International Union of Operating Engineers.
Citgo[edit]
United Refining acquired the rights to use the name Citgo in 2002 when it bought a local gas station and convenience store chain called Country Fair, Inc. in Erie, Pennsylvania[3] which included a license agreement to use "Citgo's brands, trademarks and other forms of identification."[4]
After Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez's speech to the United Nations, there were calls to boycott the Citgo brand.[4] In response, URC began phasing out that brandname,[4] and has been emphasizing that its crude oil supply comes from North America. URC also continued rebranding its product under the Kwik Fill and other local names.[5]
Alternate energy[edit]
United Refining blends ethanol with its gasoline in accordance with the Energy Policy Act.
Convenience stores[edit]
United Refining Company distributes its oil through its line of owned-and-operated convenience stores, totaling approximately 375 throughout upstate New York, Pennsylvania, and Northeast Ohio. The stores operate under the names Kwik Fill, Red Apple, or Country Fair. Many Kwik Fill locations, like the one in the photo above, are full-service, meaning they pump your gas for you.

Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
