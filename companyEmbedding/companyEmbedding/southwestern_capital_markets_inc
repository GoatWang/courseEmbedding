Home | History






Founded in 1983 in San Antonio, Texas by Robert G. Rodriguez, Southwestern Capital Markets (SCM) started in the financial services industry as an advisor to municipalities, structuring debt issues and assisting with the financial planning of public entities.

                      After receiving approval for its broker/dealer license by the Securities and Exchange Commission in 1985, SCM began serving on underwriting syndicates in municipal bond transactions and became the first Hispanic-owned investment banking firm in the United States.
Since that time, a client-driven approach to growth has steadily resulted in an expanded range of financial advisory and broker/dealer services. In a complex and fast-paced industry, the firm continues to remain dedicated to building long term client relationships as SCM proudly approaches its 25th Anniversary.
