(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  When used in this discussion and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the words "believes," "anticipates," "projects," "should," "estimates," "expects," and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements within the meaning of that term in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and in Section 21F of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Actual results may differ materially due to uncertainties including:  � our ability to identify and acquire retail real estate investments that meet our investment standards in our target markets;  � the level of rental revenue and net interest income we achieve from our target assets;  � the market value of our assets and the supply of, and demand for, retail real estate investments in which we invest;  � the state of the U.S. economy generally, or in specific geographic regions;  � the impact of economic conditions on our business;  � the conditions in the local markets in which we operate and our concentration in those markets, as well as changes in national economic and market conditions;  � consumer spending and confidence trends;  � our ability to enter into new leases or to renew leases with existing tenants at the properties we own or acquire at favorable rates;  � our ability to anticipate changes in consumer buying practices and the space needs of tenants;  � the competitive landscape impacting the properties we own or acquire and their tenants;  � our relationships with our tenants and their financial condition and liquidity;  � our ability to continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax;  -23-  � our use of debt as part of our financing strategy and our ability to make payments or to comply with any covenants under any borrowings or other debt facilities we currently have or subsequently obtain;  � the level of our operating expenses, including amounts we are required to pay to our management team and to engage third party property managers;  � changes in interest rates that could impact the market price of our common stock and the cost of our borrowings; and  � legislative and regulatory changes (including changes to laws governing the taxation of REITs).  We caution that the foregoing list of factors is not all-inclusive. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements above. We caution not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. We do not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement to reflect any change in our expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. Other sections of this report may include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.  Overview  ROIC commenced operations in October 2009 as a fully integrated and self-managed REIT. ROIC specializes in the acquisition, ownership and management of necessity-based community and neighborhood shopping centers in the western regions of the United States, anchored by national and regional supermarkets and drugstores. ROIC refers to the properties it targets for investment as its target assets.  From the commencement of its operations through June 30, 2013, the Company has completed approximately $1.1 billion of shopping center investments. As of June 30, 2013, the Company's portfolio consisted of 49 wholly-owned retail properties totaling approximately 4.9 million square feet of gross leasable area ("GLA"). The Company also owns one retail property through a joint venture, which is comprised of a 49% ownership interest in the Crossroads Shopping Center, a 463,402 square foot shopping center situated on approximately 40 acres of land, which is currently 98.8% leased.  As of June 30, 2013, the Company's wholly-owned portfolio was approximately 93.0% leased. During the three months ended June 30, 2013, the Company leased or renewed a total of 83,000 square feet in its portfolio. During the six months ended June 30, 2013, the Company leased or renewed a total of 254,000 square feet in its portfolio. The Company has committed approximately $1.1 million and $266,000 in tenant improvements and leasing commissions, respectively, for the new leases and renewals that occurred during the six months ended June 30, 2013.  ROIC is organized in a traditional umbrella partnership real estate investment trust ("UpREIT") format pursuant to which Retail Opportunity Investments GP, LLC, its wholly-owned subsidiary, serves as the general partner of, and ROIC conducts substantially all of its business through, its wholly-owned Operating Partnership, Retail Opportunity Investments Partnership, LP, a Delaware limited partnership, and its subsidiaries. ROIC reincorporated as a Maryland corporation on June 2, 2011. ROIC has elected to be taxed as a REIT, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with the year ended December 31, 2010.  -24-  Subsequent Events  On July 31, 2013, the ROIC's board of directors declared a cash dividend on its common stock of $0.15 per share, payable on September 30, 2013 to holders of record on September 16, 2013.  On July 31, 2013, the Company's board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to a maximum of $50.0 million of the Company's common stock.  Report on Operating Results  Funds from operations ("FFO"), is a widely-recognized non-GAAP financial measure for REITs that the Company believes when considered with financial statements determined in accordance with GAAP, provides additional and useful means to assess its financial performance. FFO is frequently used by securities analysts, investors and other interested parties to evaluate the performance of REITs, most of which present FFO along with net income as calculated in accordance with GAAP.  The Company computes FFO in accordance with the "White Paper" on FFO published by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT"), which defines FFO as net income attributable to common stockholders (determined in accordance with GAAP) excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring, sales of depreciable property, and impairments, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for partnerships and unconsolidated joint ventures.  However, FFO:  � does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with GAAP (which, unlike FFO, generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income); and  � should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance.  FFO as defined by the Company may not be comparable to similarly titled items reported by other REITs due to possible differences in the application of the NAREIT definition used by such REITs.  In accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") guidance relating to business combinations, which, among other things, requires any acquirer of a business (investment property) to expense all acquisition costs related to the acquisition, the amount of which will vary based on each specific acquisition and the volume of acquisitions. Accordingly, the costs of completed acquisitions will reduce our FFO. Acquisition costs for the three months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 were approximately $520,000 and $630,000, respectively. Acquisition costs for the six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 were approximately $928,000 and $753,000, respectively.  The table below provides a reconciliation of net income applicable to stockholders in accordance with GAAP to FFO for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012.  -25-   For the Three Months Ended For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2013 June 30, 2012 June 30, 2013 June 30, 2012 Net income for period $ 2,471,012 $ 4,424,752 $ 4,760,898 $ 5,552,156 Plus: Real property depreciation 4,668,517 3,324,573 8,917,306 6,279,053 Amortization of tenant improvements and allowances 1,207,475 913,792 2,387,851 1,860,134 Amortization of deferred leasing costs 3,300,714 2,779,177 6,752,679 5,528,173 Depreciation and amortization attributable to unconsolidated joint ventures 353,254 605,972 705,330 1,212,237 Loss from discontinued operations 713,529 - 713,529 - Funds from operations $ 12,714,501 $ 12,048,266 $ 24,237,593 $ 20,431,753  Results of Operations  At June 30, 2013, the Company had equity interests in 50 properties, of which 49 are consolidated ("consolidated properties") in the accompanying financial statements and one is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The Company believes, because of the location of the properties in densely populated areas, the nature of its investment provides for relatively stable revenue flows even during difficult economic times. The Company has a strong capital structure with manageable debt. The Company expects to continue to actively explore acquisition opportunities consistent with its business strategy.  Property operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. The Company defines property operating income as operating revenues (base rent and recoveries from tenants), less property and related expenses (property operating expenses and property taxes). Property operating income excludes general and administrative expenses, mortgage interest income, depreciation and amortization, acquisition transaction costs, interest expense, gains and losses from property acquisitions and dispositions, equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures, extraordinary items, tenant improvements and leasing commissions. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating property operating income, and accordingly, the Company's property operating income may not be comparable to other REITs.  Property operating income is used by management to evaluate and compare the operating performance of the Company's properties, to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of the Company's properties as this measure is not affected by the cost of our funding, the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses, gains or losses from the acquisition and sale of operating real estate assets, general and administrative expenses or other gains and losses that relate to our ownership of our properties. The Company believes the exclusion of these items from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating the Company's properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.  Property operating income is a measure of the operating performance of the Company's properties but does not measure the Company's performance as a whole. Property operating income is therefore not a substitute for net income or operating income as computed in accordance with GAAP.  Results of Operations for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2012.  Property Operating Income The table below provides a reconciliation of consolidated operating income, in accordance with GAAP, to consolidated property operating income for the three months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012. -26- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2013 June 30, 2012 Operating income per GAAP $ 6,588,436 $ 2,857,089 Plus: Depreciation and amortization 9,176,706 7,017,542 General and administrative expenses 2,913,101 2,596,688 Acquisition transaction costs 519,532 630,371 Less: Mortgage interest (208,197) (509,428) Property operating income $ 18,989,578 $ 12,592,262  The following comparison for the three months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2012, makes reference to the effect of the same-store properties. Same-store properties represent all operating properties owned by the Company in the same manner during both periods which totaled 31 of the Company's 49 consolidated properties.  The table below provides a reconciliation of operating income in accordance with GAAP to property operating income for the three months ended June 30, 2013 and 2012 related to the 31 same-store properties owned by the Company during the entirety of both periods.   For the Three Months Ended June 30, 2013 June 30, 2012 Same-store operating income per GAAP $ 7,400,975 $ 5,642,619 Plus: Depreciation and amortization 5,711,959 6,548,024 Acquisition transaction costs 9,819 21,812 Same-store property operating income $ 13,122,753 $ 12,212,455  During the three months ended June 30, 2013, the Company generated property operating income of approximately $19.0 million compared to property operating income of $12.6 million generated during the three months ended June 30, 2012. Property operating income increased by $6.4 million during the three months ended June 30, 2013 primarily as a result of an increase in the number of properties owned by the Company in 2013 compared to 2012 and an increase in same-store properties' operating income. As of June 30, 2013, the Company owned 49 consolidated properties as compared to 36 properties at June 30, 2012. The newly acquired properties increased property operating income in 2013 by approximately $5.5 million. The 31 same-store properties increased property operating income by approximately $910,000.  Depreciation and amortization  The Company incurred depreciation and amortization expenses during the three months ended June 30, 2013 of approximately $9.2 million compared to $7.0 million incurred during the comparable period in 2012. Depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in 2013 as a result of an increase in the number of properties owned by the Company in 2013 compared to 2012.  General and administrative Expenses  The Company incurred general and administrative expenses during the three months ended June 30, 2013 of approximately $2.9 million compared to $2.6 million incurred during the comparable period in 2012. General and administrative expenses increased approximately $300,000 primarily as a result of increased administrative expenses incurred to support our increase in the number of properties owned by the Company in 2013 compared to 2012.  Acquisition transaction costs  The Company incurred property acquisition costs during the three months ended June 30, 2013 of approximately $520,000 compared to $630,000 incurred during the comparable period in 2012. Property acquisition costs were higher in 2012 due to additional professional fees incurred related to acquisition activity.  -27-  Interest expense and other finance expenses  During the three months ended June 30, 2013, the Company incurred approximately $3.4 million of interest expense compared to approximately $2.8 million during the three months ended June 30, 2012, due to higher net borrowings on the term loan/credit facility and interest incurred on loans assumed for Santa Teresa Village, Euclid Plaza and Bernardo Heights, slightly offset by lower borrowing costs during the period.  Gain on bargain purchase  During the three months ended June 30, 2012, the Company recorded a gain on bargain purchase of approximately $3.9 million when recording the fair values of two properties that were acquired during the period through Conveyance in Lieu of Foreclosure Agreements. There was no comparable gain recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2013.  Loss from discontinued operations  In June 2013, the Company sold the Nimbus Winery Shopping Center, a non-grocery anchored, non-core shopping center located in Rancho Cordova, California. The sales price of this property of approximately $6.3 million, less costs to sell, resulted in proceeds to the Company of approximately $5.6 million. Accordingly, the Company recorded a loss on sale of property of approximately $714,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2013, which has been included in discontinued operations.  Results of Operations for the six months ended June 30, 2013 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2012.

Critical Accounting Policies  Critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the presentation of the Company's financial condition and results of operations and require management's most difficult, complex or subjective judgments. Set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. This summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of the Company's accounting policies included in Note 1 to ROIC's and the Operating Partnership's consolidated financial statements.  -29-  Revenue Recognition  The Company records base rents on a straight-line basis over the term of each lease. The excess of rents recognized over amounts contractually due pursuant to the underlying leases is included in tenant and other receivables on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Most leases contain provisions that require tenants to reimburse a pro-rata share of real estate taxes and certain common area expenses. Adjustments are also made throughout the year to tenant and other receivables and the related cost recovery income based upon the Company's best estimate of the final amounts to be billed and collected. In addition, the Company also provides an allowance for future credit losses in connection with the deferred straight-line rent receivable.  Allowance for Doubtful Accounts  The allowance for doubtful accounts is established based on a quarterly analysis of the risk of loss on specific accounts. The analysis places particular emphasis on past-due accounts and considers information such as the nature and age of the receivables, the payment history of the tenants or other debtors, the financial condition of the tenants and any guarantors and management's assessment of their ability to meet their lease obligations, the basis for any disputes and the status of related negotiations, among other things. Management's estimates of the required allowance is subject to revision as these factors change and is sensitive to the effects of economic and market conditions on tenants, particularly those at retail properties. Estimates are used to establish reimbursements from tenants for common area maintenance, real estate tax and insurance costs. The Company analyzes the balance of its estimated accounts receivable for real estate taxes, common area maintenance and insurance for each of its properties by comparing actual recoveries versus actual expenses and any actual write-offs. Based on its analysis, the Company may record an additional amount in its allowance for doubtful accounts related to these items. In addition, the Company also provides an allowance for future credit losses in connection with the deferred straight-line rent receivable.  Real Estate  Land, buildings, property improvements, furniture/fixtures and tenant improvements are recorded at cost. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Renovations and/or replacements, which improve or extend the life of the asset, are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.  Upon the acquisition of real estate properties, the fair value of the real estate purchased is allocated to the acquired tangible assets (consisting of land, buildings and improvements), and acquired intangible assets and liabilities (consisting of above-market and below-market leases and acquired in-place leases). The fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant, which value is then allocated to land, buildings and improvements based on management's determination of the relative fair values of these assets. In valuing an acquired property's intangibles, factors considered by management include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease-up periods, and estimates . . .

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  When used in this discussion and elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, the words "believes," "anticipates," "projects," "should," "estimates," "expects," and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements within the meaning of that term in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"), and in Section 21F of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). Actual results may differ materially due to uncertainties including:  · our ability to identify and acquire retail real estate that meet our investment standards in our markets;  · the level of rental revenue and net interest income we achieve from our assets;  · the market value of our assets and the supply of, and demand for, retail real estate in which we invest;  · the state of the U.S. economy generally, or in specific geographic regions;  · the impact of economic conditions on our business;  - 25 -  · the conditions in the local markets in which we operate and our concentration in those markets, as well as changes in national economic and market conditions;  · consumer spending and confidence trends;  · our ability to enter into new leases or to renew leases with existing tenants at the properties we own or acquire at favorable rates;  · our ability to anticipate changes in consumer buying practices and the space needs of tenants;  · the competitive landscape impacting the properties we own or acquire and their tenants;  · our relationships with our tenants and their financial condition and liquidity;  · our ability to continue to qualify as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax;  · our use of debt as part of our financing strategy and our ability to make payments or to comply with any covenants under our senior unsecured notes, our unsecured credit facilities or other debt facilities we currently have or subsequently obtain;  · the level of our operating expenses, including amounts we are required to pay to our management team and to engage third party property managers;  · changes in interest rates that could impact the market price of our common stock and the cost of our borrowings;  · the exercise, or level of exercise, of ROIC's warrants, exercisable for common stock at an exercise price of $12.00 per share (the "warrants"); and  · legislative and regulatory changes (including changes to laws governing the taxation of REITs).  Forward-looking statements are based on estimates as of the date of this report. We disclaim any obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward-looking statements reflecting new estimates, events or circumstances after the date of this report.  We caution that the foregoing list of factors is not all-inclusive. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements above. We caution not to place undue reliance upon any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. We do not undertake or accept any obligation or undertaking to release publicly any updates or revisions to any forward-looking statement to reflect any change in our expectations or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. Other sections of this report may include additional factors that could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Moreover, we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment. New risk factors emerge from time to time and it is not possible for management to predict all such risk factors, nor can it assess the impact of all such risk factors on our business or the extent to which any factor, or combination of factors, may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.  Overview  Retail Opportunity Investments Corp. ("ROIC") is organized in an UpREIT format pursuant to which Retail Opportunity Investments GP, LLC, its wholly-owned subsidiary, serves as the general partner of, and ROIC conducts substantially all of its business through, its operating partnership, Retail Opportunity Investments Partnership, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the "Operating Partnership"), together with its subsidiaries. ROIC reincorporated as a Maryland corporation on June 2, 2011. ROIC has elected to be taxed as a REIT, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with the year ended December 31, 2010.  - 26 -  ROIC commenced operations in October 2009 as a fully integrated and self-managed REIT, and as of June 30, 2014, ROIC owned an approximate 96.6% partnership interest and other limited partners owned the remaining approximate 3.4% partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. ROIC specializes in the acquisition, ownership and management of necessity-based community and neighborhood shopping centers on the west coast of the United States, anchored by supermarkets and drugstores.  From the commencement of its operations through June 30, 2014, the Company has completed approximately $1.6 billion of shopping center investments. As of June 30, 2014, the Company's portfolio consisted of 59 retail properties totaling approximately 6.9 million square feet of gross leasable area ("GLA").  As of June 30, 2014, the Company's portfolio was approximately 96.8% leased. During the six months ended June 30, 2014, the Company leased or renewed a total of 389,000 square feet in its portfolio. The Company has committed approximately $1.9 million, or $7.40 per square foot, in tenant improvements for new leases that occurred during the six months ended June 30, 2014. Additionally, the Company has committed approximately $449,000, or $1.80 per square foot, in leasing commissions, for the new leases that occurred during the six months ended June 30, 2014. Tenant improvement and leasing commission commitments for renewed leases were not material for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014.  Subsequent Events  Subsequent to June 30, 2014, the Company entered into a binding contract to acquire a shopping center located in Wilsonville, Oregon, within the Portland metropolitan area. The Company expects to fund the acquisition in part with the issuance of $15.7 million in ROIC common equity in the form of operating partnership units, based on a value of $16.00 per unit.  Subsequent to June 30, 2014, the Company received notice of warrant exercises of approximately 599,000 warrants, totaling approximately $7.2 million of proceeds.  On July 30, 2014, ROIC's board of directors declared a cash dividend on its common stock of $0.16 per share, payable on September 29, 2014 to holders of record on September 15, 2014.  Results of Operations  At June 30, 2014, the Company had 59 properties, all of which are consolidated ("consolidated properties") in the accompanying financial statements. The Company believes, because of the location of the properties in densely populated areas, the nature of its investments provides for relatively stable revenue flows even during difficult economic times. The Company has a strong capital structure with manageable debt as of June 30, 2014. The Company expects to continue to actively explore acquisition opportunities consistent with its business strategy.  Property operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. The Company defines property operating income as operating revenues (base rent and recoveries from tenants), less property and related expenses (property operating expenses and property taxes). Property operating income excludes general and administrative expenses, mortgage interest income, depreciation and amortization, acquisition transaction costs, other expense, interest expense, gains and losses from property acquisitions and dispositions, equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint ventures, extraordinary items, tenant improvements and leasing commissions. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating property operating income, and accordingly, the Company's property operating income may not be comparable to other REITs.  - 27 -  Property operating income is used by management to evaluate and compare the operating performance of the Company's properties, to determine trends in earnings and to compute the fair value of the Company's properties as this measure is not affected by the cost of our funding, the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses, gains or losses from the acquisition and sale of operating real estate assets, general and administrative expenses or other gains and losses that relate to our ownership of our properties. The Company believes the exclusion of these items from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating the Company's properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs.  Property operating income is a measure of the operating performance of the Company's properties but does not measure the Company's performance as a whole. Property operating income is therefore not a substitute for net income or operating income as computed in accordance with GAAP.  Results of Operations for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2013.  Property Operating Income The table below provides a reconciliation of consolidated operating income, in accordance with GAAP, to consolidated property operating income for the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013. Three Months Ended June 30, 2014 2013 Operating income per GAAP $ 9,688,017 $ 6,589,695 Plus: Depreciation and amortization 14,257,274 9,176,706 General and administrative expenses 2,775,877 2,727,039 Acquisition transaction costs 311,098 519,532 Other expenses 130,080 186,062 Less: Mortgage interest income - (208,197 ) Total portfolio property operating income $ 27,162,346 $ 18,990,837  The following comparison for the three months ended June 30, 2014 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2013, makes reference to the effect of the same-store properties. Same-store properties, which totaled 44 of the Company's 59 properties as of June 30, 2014, represent all operating properties owned by the Company during the entirety of both periods presented and consolidated into the Company's financial statements during such periods.  The table below provides a reconciliation of consolidated operating income, in accordance with GAAP, to property operating income for the three months ended June 30, 2014 related to the 44 same-store properties owned by the Company during the entirety of both the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 and consolidated into the Company's financial statements during such periods.   Three months ended June 30, 2014 Same-Store Non Same-Store Total Operating income per GAAP $ 9,008,368 $ 679,649 $ 9,688,017 Plus: Depreciation and amortization 8,292,002 5,965,272 14,257,274 General and administrative expenses (1) - 2,775,877 2,775,877 Acquisition transaction costs 167 310,931 311,098 Other expenses (1) - 130,080 130,080 Property operating income $ 17,300,537 $ 9,861,809 $ 27,162,346  - 28 -  The table below provides a reconciliation of consolidated operating income, in accordance with GAAP, to property operating income for the three months ended June 30, 2013 related to the 44 same-store properties owned by the Company during the entirety of both the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013 and consolidated into the Company's financial statements during such periods.   Three months ended June 30, 2013 Same-Store Non Same-Store Total Operating income (loss) per GAAP $ 9,225,038 $ (2,635,343 ) $ 6,589,695 Plus: Depreciation and amortization 8,348,846 827,860 9,176,706 General and administrative expenses (1) - 2,727,039 2,727,039 Acquisition transaction costs 225,993 293,539 519,532 Other expenses (1) - 186,062 186,062 Less: Mortgage interest income - (208,197 ) (208,197 ) Property operating income $ 17,799,877 $ 1,190,960 $ 18,990,837 ______________________  During the three months ended June 30, 2014, the Company generated property operating income of approximately $27.2 million compared to property operating income of $19.0 million generated during the three months ended June 30, 2013. Property operating income increased by $8.2 million during the three months ended June 30, 2014 primarily as a result of an increase in the number of properties owned by the Company in 2014 compared to 2013. As of June 30, 2014, the Company owned 59 consolidated properties as compared to 49 properties at June 30, 2013. The newly acquired properties increased property operating income in 2014 by approximately $8.7 million. The 44 same-store properties decreased property operating income by approximately $499,000 primarily due to a decrease in straight line rental income.  Mortgage interest income  The Company generated interest income from mortgage notes receivable during the three months ended June 30, 2013 of approximately $208,000 and no comparable income was recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2014. This decrease was a result of the cancellation of the Company's loan to the Crossroads joint venture in connection with the Company's acquisition of the remaining partnership interests in the Crossroads Shopping Center from its joint venture partner in September 2013. As of June 30, 2014, the Company has no remaining investments in mortgage loans on real estate.  Depreciation and amortization  The Company incurred depreciation and amortization expenses during the three months ended June 30, 2014 of approximately $14.3 million compared to $9.2 million incurred during the three months ended June 30, 2013. Depreciation and amortization expenses were higher in 2014 as a result of an increase in the number of properties owned by the Company in 2014 compared to 2013.  General and administrative expenses  The Company incurred general and administrative expenses during the three months ended June 30, 2014 of approximately $2.8 million, which is consistent with the $2.7 million incurred during the three months ended June 30, 2013.  Acquisition transaction costs  The Company incurred property acquisition costs during the three months ended June 30, 2014 of approximately $311,000 compared to $520,000 incurred during the three months ended June 30, 2013. Property acquisition costs were higher in 2013 primarily due to legal and other professional fees incurred related to acquisition activity.  - 29 -  Interest expense and other finance expenses  The Company incurred interest expense during the three months ended June 30, 2014 of approximately $7.0 million compared to approximately $3.4 million during the three months ended June 30, 2013. The increase of approximately $3.5 million was primarily due to additional interest incurred related to the Senior Notes Due 2023 which were issued in December 2013, which bear a higher interest rate than the credit facility, as well as higher net borrowings on the term loan/credit facility.  Equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint venture  During the three months ended June 30, 2013, the Company recorded equity in earnings from unconsolidated joint venture of approximately $40,000 and no comparable income was recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2014. This decrease was a result of the consolidation of Crossroads Shopping Center in September 2013. As of June 30, 2014, the Company has no remaining unconsolidated joint ventures.  Gain on sale of real estate  On June 5, 2014, the Company sold Phillips Village Shopping Center, a non-core shopping center located in Pomona, California with an occupancy rate of approximately 10.4% as of May 31, 2014. The sales price of this property of approximately $16.0 million, less costs to sell, resulted in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $15.6 million. The Company recorded a gain on sale of approximately $3.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2014. There was no comparable gain recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2013.  Loss from discontinued operations  In June 2013, the Company sold the Nimbus Winery Shopping Center, a non-grocery anchored, non-core shopping center located in Rancho Cordova, California. The sales price of this property of approximately $6.3 million, less costs to sell, resulted in net proceeds to the Company of approximately $5.6 million. The Company recorded a loss on sale of property of approximately $714,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2013, which has been included in discontinued operations. There was no comparable loss recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2014.  Results of Operations for the six months ended June 30, 2014 compared to the six months ended June 30, 2013.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
