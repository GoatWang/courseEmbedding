The address you entered was not found in our service area. Please re-enter your address. Some tips to make your experience easier: 


Enter the first few letters of your street name, abbreviate directions using N, S, E, W, NE, NW, SE, SW and remove all street types (e.g. Court, Ave. etc.).For example the street name North Main Street should be entered as N Main
For numeric streets, try the plain numeric version first (e.g. 1 to indicate 1st Street). For example West 7th Street should be entered as W 7
If your street name includes a hyphen, try it with the hyphen and try it with a space instead of a hyphen.

Cincinnati Bell started out as the City and Suburban Telegraph Association and was providing telegraph lines between homes and businesses in 1873, three years before the invention of the telephone. In 1878, it gained exclusive rights to the Bell franchise within a 25-mile (40-km) radius of Cincinnati—the first telephone exchange in Ohio. It has substantially the same incumbent local exchange carrier territory today, straddling 2,400 square miles in three states. The name changed to Cincinnati and Suburban Bell Telephone Company in 1903. It was shortened to Cincinnati Bell in 1971.
Cincinnati Bell and Southern New England Telephone (SNET) were the only two companies in the old Bell System that operated independently because AT&T Corporation only owned minority stakes in the companies. Therefore, neither is considered a Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC), AT&T was not obligated to dispose of their ownership stakes in the companies, and restrictions placed on the Baby Bells did not apply to these two companies. AT&T owned 32.6% of Cincinnati Bell until 1984, at which point the shares AT&T owned were placed into a trust and then sold.[1] In 1998, SNET was bought by SBC Communications (Now the new AT&T), an RBOC, and in 2014 was sold to Frontier Communications, a company with no relation to the former Bell System; however, Cincinnati Bell has remained independent.
The newsmagazine 60 Minutes reported in 1989 that Cincinnati Bell cooperated with local police to wiretap local residents in search of alleged communist or criminal activity from 1972 to 1984.[2] In a move widely criticized by consumer advocates, Cincinnati Bell was also the first phone company in Ohio to take advantage of a 2005 state law that lets phone companies raise rates without having to gain approval from state regulators.[citation needed]




Cincinnati Bell's residential landline service continues to use the classic Bell logo.[3]


In May 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio awarded Cincinnati Bell Long Distance the right to offer local wireline telephone service in 55 counties outside its incumbent territory and began to resell business local phone service in these counties, in competition with incumbent carrier Ameritech.[4][5]
During the 1990s, Cincinnati Bell acquired a nationwide transmission network formerly known as IXC Communications and changed its corporate name to "Broadwing Communications," although the local telephone operations continued to operate under their traditional name. In 2004, the holding company divested the long-distance operation as Broadwing Corporation and changed its name back to Cincinnati Bell.
In 2002, Cincinnati Bell sold Cincinnati Bell Directory, consisting of its directory operations, to Spectrum Equity. The resulting company is named CBD Media. The sale marked the first time a former Bell System-affiliated company sold off its directory operations.
In 2003, when BellSouth exited the payphone market, some former BellSouth payphones in Kentucky were sold to Cincinnati Bell.
Cincinnati Bell is the only American Bell System company that continues to publicly do business under the "Bell" name.[6] In July 2006, Cincinnati Bell removed the final Bell logo—designed in 1969 by Saul Bass—from most of its corporate branding, leaving only a stylized wordmark. This left BellSouth as the last remaining Baby Bell to still use the Bell logo, but it was acquired by AT&T later that year, with the BellSouth brand being retired in 2007. However, the company continues to use the Bell logo in promotional materials for residential landline and long-distance service.[7]
Cincinnati Bell's original headquarters, the Cincinnati and Suburban Telephone Company Building, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Telecommunications[edit]
Landline service[edit]
Cincinnati Bell provides landline PSTN local and long-distance calling. In recent years, the company has seen subscriptions to these traditional services decline due to competition from cable and wireless providers.[8]
Wireless telephony[edit]




Former Cincinnati Bell Wireless logo used until mid-2006


From 1998 until 2015, Cincinnati Bell Wireless (CBW) offered GSM wireless service in southeastern Indiana, southwestern Ohio, and northwestern Kentucky. It was sold at Best Buy, Circuit City (until 2009), Office Depot, and participating Kroger locations. It offered HSPA+[9] service in most of Hamilton County, Ohio, and parts of surrounding counties; EDGE[10] service in Dayton and Oxford; and GSM service elsewhere. The local coverage area extended north to Celina and Urbana, east to Hillsboro, south to Corinth and Warsaw, and west to Batesville.[11] Cincinnati Bell's prepaid mobile phone products were sold under same i-wireless brand as an unrelated service by locally based Kroger.[12]
Cincinnati Bell made its first foray into wireless telephony around 1986, when it acquired a 45% stake in Ameritech Cellular. On February 2, 1998, Cincinnati Bell acquired 80% of AT&T Wireless Services's new Cincinnati-Dayton PCS network for over $100 million. Cincinnati Bell's subsidiary Cincinnati Bell Wireless was responsible for marketing and sales, while AT&T Wireless handled technical operations for the joint venture. Wireless service began by June in Cincinnati and by September in Dayton, eventually covering a 21-county area.[13][14][15] When AT&T Wireless was purchased by Cingular, now known as AT&T Mobility, control of its 20% stake also passed to Cingular. On February 17, 2006, Cincinnati Bell took full control of CBW by purchasing Cingular's stake for $83 million. As a part of the deal, Cincinnati Bell and Cingular secured lower roaming charges on each other's respective GSM networks.[16]
An independent research provider tested Cincinnati Bell Wireless's service in Cincinnati and Dayton and found the company to have the best wireless network in 2005 and 2006.[17] Cincinnati Bell Wireless had 571,000 wireless subscribers at the end of 2007[18] and 196,000 postpaid wireless subscribers at the end of 2013.[19]
On April 7, 2014, Cincinnati Bell announced plans to sell its wireless spectrum and other assets to Verizon Wireless, as part of a planned emphasis on enterprise and entertainment services such as FiOptics.[6][20] Cincinnati Bell Wireless ended service on February 28, 2015. The company's retail locations began selling Verizon products.[21]
Internet access[edit]




Former Fuse logo


Cincinnati Bell offers Internet access to customers in its service area. Cincinnati Bell's Fuse Internet Service provides dial-up access, while its broadband access is through its ZoomTown ADSL service. ZoomTown customers still connect to the Internet through an Internet service provider. Typically, ZoomTown is used in conjunction with Cincinnati Bell's ISP, Fuse, although other local ISPs are available. ZoomTown's ADSL technology currently offers three speeds of 5 Mbit/s and 768 kbit/s downstream.[22] ZoomTown started service in 1999. Cincinnati Bell also offers a service called ZoomTown Plus that bundles Internet access with news, reference, and entertainment content, provided though Synacor.[23] Cincinnati Bell has started offering Zoomtown Internet at speeds from 5 Mbit/s up to 1 Gbit/s in conjunction with its FiOptics services. The availability is limited to areas currently wired for FiOptics, and other FiOptics services are not required. In areas now covered by FiOptics, Cincinnati Bell no longer offers ADSL-only speeds of greater than 5 Mbit/s.
Its primary competitor for broadband Internet access is Charter Spectrum Internet.
Fiber optics[edit]
In late 2009, Cincinnati Bell started offering a fiber-optic communications (Internet, telephone, and IPTV) service called FiOptics, similar to the U-verse service offered by AT&T and the FiOS service offered by Verizon Communications.[24] Cincinnati Bell is currently in the process of rolling out the new service to select communities in the Cincinnati area.[25] FiOptics runs fiber to the home, augmented by fiber to the node.[8] In August 2014, Cincinnati Bell began offering gigabit Internet speeds with its FiOptics service.[26]
Electricity[edit]
In 2011, Cincinnati Bell became the first telecommunications company to also provide retail energy service.[27] Through a partnership with Viridian Energy, Cincinnati Bell Energy competes with several other alternative electricity retailers for the power generation portion of customers' electricity bills.[8] The subsidiary advertises that its service is entirely sourced from regional wind power certified by Green-e Energy.[28]
Retail stores[edit]
Cincinnati Bell originally operated a chain of Cincinnati Bell Phone Center locations until 1992, when it sold the retail chain to AT&T.[29] It reentered the retail space in 1998 with three Store@Cincinnati Bell retail locations.[14][13] As of 2015[update], the company operates eight Cincinnati Bell Stores.[30]

In areas now covered by FiOptics, Cincinnati Bell no longer offers ADSL-only speeds of greater than 5 Mbit/s.
Its primary competitor for broadband Internet access is Charter Spectrum Internet.
Fiber optics[edit]
In late 2009, Cincinnati Bell started offering a fiber-optic communications (Internet, telephone, and IPTV) service called FiOptics, similar to the U-verse service offered by AT&T and the FiOS service offered by Verizon Communications.[24] Cincinnati Bell is currently in the process of rolling out the new service to select communities in the Cincinnati area.[25] FiOptics runs fiber to the home, augmented by fiber to the node.[8] In August 2014, Cincinnati Bell began offering gigabit Internet speeds with its FiOptics service.[26]
Electricity[edit]
In 2011, Cincinnati Bell became the first telecommunications company to also provide retail energy service.[27] Through a partnership with Viridian Energy, Cincinnati Bell Energy competes with several other alternative electricity retailers for the power generation portion of customers' electricity bills.[8] The subsidiary advertises that its service is entirely sourced from regional wind power certified by Green-e Energy.[28]
Retail stores[edit]
Cincinnati Bell originally operated a chain of Cincinnati Bell Phone Center locations until 1992, when it sold the retail chain to AT&T.[29] It reentered the retail space in 1998 with three Store@Cincinnati Bell retail locations.[14][13] As of 2015[update], the company operates eight Cincinnati Bell Stores.[30]

History[edit]




Warsaw Avenue office building, Price Hill, Cincinnati


Cincinnati Bell started out as the City and Suburban Telegraph Association and was providing telegraph lines between homes and businesses in 1873, three years before the invention of the telephone. In 1878, it gained exclusive rights to the Bell franchise within a 25-mile (40-km) radius of Cincinnati—the first telephone exchange in Ohio. It has substantially the same incumbent local exchange carrier territory today, straddling 2,400 square miles in three states. The name changed to Cincinnati and Suburban Bell Telephone Company in 1903. It was shortened to Cincinnati Bell in 1971.
Cincinnati Bell and Southern New England Telephone (SNET) were the only two companies in the old Bell System that operated independently because AT&T Corporation only owned minority stakes in the companies. Therefore, neither is considered a Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC), AT&T was not obligated to dispose of their ownership stakes in the companies, and restrictions placed on the Baby Bells did not apply to these two companies. AT&T owned 32.6% of Cincinnati Bell until 1984, at which point the shares AT&T owned were placed into a trust and then sold.[1] In 1998, SNET was bought by SBC Communications (Now the new AT&T), an RBOC, and in 2014 was sold to Frontier Communications, a company with no relation to the former Bell System; however, Cincinnati Bell has remained independent.
The newsmagazine 60 Minutes reported in 1989 that Cincinnati Bell cooperated with local police to wiretap local residents in search of alleged communist or criminal activity from 1972 to 1984.[2] In a move widely criticized by consumer advocates, Cincinnati Bell was also the first phone company in Ohio to take advantage of a 2005 state law that lets phone companies raise rates without having to gain approval from state regulators.[citation needed]




Cincinnati Bell's residential landline service continues to use the classic Bell logo.[3]


In May 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio awarded Cincinnati Bell Long Distance the right to offer local wireline telephone service in 55 counties outside its incumbent territory and began to resell business local phone service in these counties, in competition with incumbent carrier Ameritech.[4][5]
During the 1990s, Cincinnati Bell acquired a nationwide transmission network formerly known as IXC Communications and changed its corporate name to "Broadwing Communications," although the local telephone operations continued to operate under their traditional name. In 2004, the holding company divested the long-distance operation as Broadwing Corporation and changed its name back to Cincinnati Bell.
In 2002, Cincinnati Bell sold Cincinnati Bell Directory, consisting of its directory operations, to Spectrum Equity. The resulting company is named CBD Media. The sale marked the first time a former Bell System-affiliated company sold off its directory operations.
In 2003, when BellSouth exited the payphone market, some former BellSouth payphones in Kentucky were sold to Cincinnati Bell.
Cincinnati Bell is the only American Bell System company that continues to publicly do business under the "Bell" name.[6] In July 2006, Cincinnati Bell removed the final Bell logo—designed in 1969 by Saul Bass—from most of its corporate branding, leaving only a stylized wordmark. This left BellSouth as the last remaining Baby Bell to still use the Bell logo, but it was acquired by AT&T later that year, with the BellSouth brand being retired in 2007. However, the company continues to use the Bell logo in promotional materials for residential landline and long-distance service.[7]
Cincinnati Bell's original headquarters, the Cincinnati and Suburban Telephone Company Building, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Telecommunications[edit]
Landline service[edit]
Cincinnati Bell provides landline PSTN local and long-distance calling. In recent years, the company has seen subscriptions to these traditional services decline due to competition from cable and wireless providers.[8]
Wireless telephony[edit]




Former Cincinnati Bell Wireless logo used until mid-2006


From 1998 until 2015, Cincinnati Bell Wireless (CBW) offered GSM wireless service in southeastern Indiana, southwestern Ohio, and northwestern Kentucky. It was sold at Best Buy, Circuit City (until 2009), Office Depot, and participating Kroger locations. It offered HSPA+[9] service in most of Hamilton County, Ohio, and parts of surrounding counties; EDGE[10] service in Dayton and Oxford; and GSM service elsewhere. The local coverage area extended north to Celina and Urbana, east to Hillsboro, south to Corinth and Warsaw, and west to Batesville.[11] Cincinnati Bell's prepaid mobile phone products were sold under same i-wireless brand as an unrelated service by locally based Kroger.[12]
Cincinnati Bell made its first foray into wireless telephony around 1986, when it acquired a 45% stake in Ameritech Cellular. On February 2, 1998, Cincinnati Bell acquired 80% of AT&T Wireless Services's new Cincinnati-Dayton PCS network for over $100 million. Cincinnati Bell's subsidiary Cincinnati Bell Wireless was responsible for marketing and sales, while AT&T Wireless handled technical operations for the joint venture. Wireless service began by June in Cincinnati and by September in Dayton, eventually covering a 21-county area.[13][14][15] When AT&T Wireless was purchased by Cingular, now known as AT&T Mobility, control of its 20% stake also passed to Cingular. On February 17, 2006, Cincinnati Bell took full control of CBW by purchasing Cingular's stake for $83 million. As a part of the deal, Cincinnati Bell and Cingular secured lower roaming charges on each other's respective GSM networks.[16]
An independent research provider tested Cincinnati Bell Wireless's service in Cincinnati and Dayton and found the company to have the best wireless network in 2005 and 2006.[17] Cincinnati Bell Wireless had 571,000 wireless subscribers at the end of 2007[18] and 196,000 postpaid wireless subscribers at the end of 2013.[19]
On April 7, 2014, Cincinnati Bell announced plans to sell its wireless spectrum and other assets to Verizon Wireless, as part of a planned emphasis on enterprise and entertainment services such as FiOptics.[6][20] Cincinnati Bell Wireless ended service on February 28, 2015. The company's retail locations began selling Verizon products.[21]
Internet access[edit]




Former Fuse logo


Cincinnati Bell offers Internet access to customers in its service area. Cincinnati Bell's Fuse Internet Service provides dial-up access, while its broadband access is through its ZoomTown ADSL service. ZoomTown customers still connect to the Internet through an Internet service provider. Typically, ZoomTown is used in conjunction with Cincinnati Bell's ISP, Fuse, although other local ISPs are available. ZoomTown's ADSL technology currently offers three speeds of 5 Mbit/s and 768 kbit/s downstream.[22] ZoomTown started service in 1999. Cincinnati Bell also offers a service called ZoomTown Plus that bundles Internet access with news, reference, and entertainment content, provided though Synacor.[23] Cincinnati Bell has started offering Zoomtown Internet at speeds from 5 Mbit/s up to 1 Gbit/s in conjunction with its FiOptics services. The availability is limited to areas currently wired for FiOptics, and other FiOptics services are not required. In areas now covered by FiOptics, Cincinnati Bell no longer offers ADSL-only speeds of greater than 5 Mbit/s.
Its primary competitor for broadband Internet access is Charter Spectrum Internet.
Fiber optics[edit]
In late 2009, Cincinnati Bell started offering a fiber-optic communications (Internet, telephone, and IPTV) service called FiOptics, similar to the U-verse service offered by AT&T and the FiOS service offered by Verizon Communications.[24] Cincinnati Bell is currently in the process of rolling out the new service to select communities in the Cincinnati area.[25] FiOptics runs fiber to the home, augmented by fiber to the node.[8] In August 2014, Cincinnati Bell began offering gigabit Internet speeds with its FiOptics service.[26]
Electricity[edit]
In 2011, Cincinnati Bell became the first telecommunications company to also provide retail energy service.[27] Through a partnership with Viridian Energy, Cincinnati Bell Energy competes with several other alternative electricity retailers for the power generation portion of customers' electricity bills.[8] The subsidiary advertises that its service is entirely sourced from regional wind power certified by Green-e Energy.[28]
Retail stores[edit]
Cincinnati Bell originally operated a chain of Cincinnati Bell Phone Center locations until 1992, when it sold the retail chain to AT&T.[29] It reentered the retail space in 1998 with three Store@Cincinnati Bell retail locations.[14][13] As of 2015[update], the company operates eight Cincinnati Bell Stores.[30]

History[edit]




Warsaw Avenue office building, Price Hill, Cincinnati


Cincinnati Bell started out as the City and Suburban Telegraph Association and was providing telegraph lines between homes and businesses in 1873, three years before the invention of the telephone. In 1878, it gained exclusive rights to the Bell franchise within a 25-mile (40-km) radius of Cincinnati—the first telephone exchange in Ohio. It has substantially the same incumbent local exchange carrier territory today, straddling 2,400 square miles in three states. The name changed to Cincinnati and Suburban Bell Telephone Company in 1903. It was shortened to Cincinnati Bell in 1971.
Cincinnati Bell and Southern New England Telephone (SNET) were the only two companies in the old Bell System that operated independently because AT&T Corporation only owned minority stakes in the companies. Therefore, neither is considered a Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC), AT&T was not obligated to dispose of their ownership stakes in the companies, and restrictions placed on the Baby Bells did not apply to these two companies. AT&T owned 32.6% of Cincinnati Bell until 1984, at which point the shares AT&T owned were placed into a trust and then sold.[1] In 1998, SNET was bought by SBC Communications (Now the new AT&T), an RBOC, and in 2014 was sold to Frontier Communications, a company with no relation to the former Bell System; however, Cincinnati Bell has remained independent.
The newsmagazine 60 Minutes reported in 1989 that Cincinnati Bell cooperated with local police to wiretap local residents in search of alleged communist or criminal activity from 1972 to 1984.[2] In a move widely criticized by consumer advocates, Cincinnati Bell was also the first phone company in Ohio to take advantage of a 2005 state law that lets phone companies raise rates without having to gain approval from state regulators.[citation needed]




Cincinnati Bell's residential landline service continues to use the classic Bell logo.[3]


In May 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio awarded Cincinnati Bell Long Distance the right to offer local wireline telephone service in 55 counties outside its incumbent territory and began to resell business local phone service in these counties, in competition with incumbent carrier Ameritech.[4][5]
During the 1990s, Cincinnati Bell acquired a nationwide transmission network formerly known as IXC Communications and changed its corporate name to "Broadwing Communications," although the local telephone operations continued to operate under their traditional name. In 2004, the holding company divested the long-distance operation as Broadwing Corporation and changed its name back to Cincinnati Bell.
In 2002, Cincinnati Bell sold Cincinnati Bell Directory, consisting of its directory operations, to Spectrum Equity. The resulting company is named CBD Media. The sale marked the first time a former Bell System-affiliated company sold off its directory operations.
In 2003, when BellSouth exited the payphone market, some former BellSouth payphones in Kentucky were sold to Cincinnati Bell.
Cincinnati Bell is the only American Bell System company that continues to publicly do business under the "Bell" name.[6] In July 2006, Cincinnati Bell removed the final Bell logo—designed in 1969 by Saul Bass—from most of its corporate branding, leaving only a stylized wordmark. This left BellSouth as the last remaining Baby Bell to still use the Bell logo, but it was acquired by AT&T later that year, with the BellSouth brand being retired in 2007. However, the company continues to use the Bell logo in promotional materials for residential landline and long-distance service.[7]
Cincinnati Bell's original headquarters, the Cincinnati and Suburban Telephone Company Building, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Telecommunications[edit]
Landline service[edit]
Cincinnati Bell provides landline PSTN local and long-distance calling. In recent years, the company has seen subscriptions to these traditional services decline due to competition from cable and wireless providers.[8]
Wireless telephony[edit]




Former Cincinnati Bell Wireless logo used until mid-2006


From 1998 until 2015, Cincinnati Bell Wireless (CBW) offered GSM wireless service in southeastern Indiana, southwestern Ohio, and northwestern Kentucky. It was sold at Best Buy, Circuit City (until 2009), Office Depot, and participating Kroger locations. It offered HSPA+[9] service in most of Hamilton County, Ohio, and parts of surrounding counties; EDGE[10] service in Dayton and Oxford; and GSM service elsewhere. The local coverage area extended north to Celina and Urbana, east to Hillsboro, south to Corinth and Warsaw, and west to Batesville.[11] Cincinnati Bell's prepaid mobile phone products were sold under same i-wireless brand as an unrelated service by locally based Kroger.[12]
Cincinnati Bell made its first foray into wireless telephony around 1986, when it acquired a 45% stake in Ameritech Cellular. On February 2, 1998, Cincinnati Bell acquired 80% of AT&T Wireless Services's new Cincinnati-Dayton PCS network for over $100 million. Cincinnati Bell's subsidiary Cincinnati Bell Wireless was responsible for marketing and sales, while AT&T Wireless handled technical operations for the joint venture. Wireless service began by June in Cincinnati and by September in Dayton, eventually covering a 21-county area.[13][14][15] When AT&T Wireless was purchased by Cingular, now known as AT&T Mobility, control of its 20% stake also passed to Cingular. On February 17, 2006, Cincinnati Bell took full control of CBW by purchasing Cingular's stake for $83 million. As a part of the deal, Cincinnati Bell and Cingular secured lower roaming charges on each other's respective GSM networks.[16]
An independent research provider tested Cincinnati Bell Wireless's service in Cincinnati and Dayton and found the company to have the best wireless network in 2005 and 2006.[17] Cincinnati Bell Wireless had 571,000 wireless subscribers at the end of 2007[18] and 196,000 postpaid wireless subscribers at the end of 2013.[19]
On April 7, 2014, Cincinnati Bell announced plans to sell its wireless spectrum and other assets to Verizon Wireless, as part of a planned emphasis on enterprise and entertainment services such as FiOptics.[6][20] Cincinnati Bell Wireless ended service on February 28, 2015. The company's retail locations began selling Verizon products.[21]
Internet access[edit]




Former Fuse logo


Cincinnati Bell offers Internet access to customers in its service area. Cincinnati Bell's Fuse Internet Service provides dial-up access, while its broadband access is through its ZoomTown ADSL service. ZoomTown customers still connect to the Internet through an Internet service provider. Typically, ZoomTown is used in conjunction with Cincinnati Bell's ISP, Fuse, although other local ISPs are available. ZoomTown's ADSL technology currently offers three speeds of 5 Mbit/s and 768 kbit/s downstream.[22] ZoomTown started service in 1999. Cincinnati Bell also offers a service called ZoomTown Plus that bundles Internet access with news, reference, and entertainment content, provided though Synacor.[23] Cincinnati Bell has started offering Zoomtown Internet at speeds from 5 Mbit/s up to 1 Gbit/s in conjunction with its FiOptics services. The availability is limited to areas currently wired for FiOptics, and other FiOptics services are not required. In areas now covered by FiOptics, Cincinnati Bell no longer offers ADSL-only speeds of greater than 5 Mbit/s.
Its primary competitor for broadband Internet access is Charter Spectrum Internet.
Fiber optics[edit]
In late 2009, Cincinnati Bell started offering a fiber-optic communications (Internet, telephone, and IPTV) service called FiOptics, similar to the U-verse service offered by AT&T and the FiOS service offered by Verizon Communications.[24] Cincinnati Bell is currently in the process of rolling out the new service to select communities in the Cincinnati area.[25] FiOptics runs fiber to the home, augmented by fiber to the node.[8] In August 2014, Cincinnati Bell began offering gigabit Internet speeds with its FiOptics service.[26]
Electricity[edit]
In 2011, Cincinnati Bell became the first telecommunications company to also provide retail energy service.[27] Through a partnership with Viridian Energy, Cincinnati Bell Energy competes with several other alternative electricity retailers for the power generation portion of customers' electricity bills.[8] The subsidiary advertises that its service is entirely sourced from regional wind power certified by Green-e Energy.[28]
Retail stores[edit]
Cincinnati Bell originally operated a chain of Cincinnati Bell Phone Center locations until 1992, when it sold the retail chain to AT&T.[29] It reentered the retail space in 1998 with three Store@Cincinnati Bell retail locations.[14][13] As of 2015[update], the company operates eight Cincinnati Bell Stores.[30]

Cincinnati Bell (stylized in branding materials as Cıncınnatı Bell) is the dominant telephone company for Cincinnati, Ohio, its nearby suburbs, and the Dayton metropolitan area in the U.S. states of Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky. The parent company is named Cincinnati Bell Inc. Its incumbent local exchange carrier subsidiary uses the name Cincinnati Bell Telephone Company LLC. Other subsidiaries handle services such as payphones and long distance calling.

History[edit]




Warsaw Avenue office building, Price Hill, Cincinnati


Cincinnati Bell started out as the City and Suburban Telegraph Association and was providing telegraph lines between homes and businesses in 1873, three years before the invention of the telephone. In 1878, it gained exclusive rights to the Bell franchise within a 25-mile (40-km) radius of Cincinnati—the first telephone exchange in Ohio. It has substantially the same incumbent local exchange carrier territory today, straddling 2,400 square miles in three states. The name changed to Cincinnati and Suburban Bell Telephone Company in 1903. It was shortened to Cincinnati Bell in 1971.
Cincinnati Bell and Southern New England Telephone (SNET) were the only two companies in the old Bell System that operated independently because AT&T Corporation only owned minority stakes in the companies. Therefore, neither is considered a Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC), AT&T was not obligated to dispose of their ownership stakes in the companies, and restrictions placed on the Baby Bells did not apply to these two companies. AT&T owned 32.6% of Cincinnati Bell until 1984, at which point the shares AT&T owned were placed into a trust and then sold.[1] In 1998, SNET was bought by SBC Communications (Now the new AT&T), an RBOC, and in 2014 was sold to Frontier Communications, a company with no relation to the former Bell System; however, Cincinnati Bell has remained independent.
The newsmagazine 60 Minutes reported in 1989 that Cincinnati Bell cooperated with local police to wiretap local residents in search of alleged communist or criminal activity from 1972 to 1984.[2] In a move widely criticized by consumer advocates, Cincinnati Bell was also the first phone company in Ohio to take advantage of a 2005 state law that lets phone companies raise rates without having to gain approval from state regulators.[citation needed]




Cincinnati Bell's residential landline service continues to use the classic Bell logo.[3]


In May 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio awarded Cincinnati Bell Long Distance the right to offer local wireline telephone service in 55 counties outside its incumbent territory and began to resell business local phone service in these counties, in competition with incumbent carrier Ameritech.[4][5]
During the 1990s, Cincinnati Bell acquired a nationwide transmission network formerly known as IXC Communications and changed its corporate name to "Broadwing Communications," although the local telephone operations continued to operate under their traditional name. In 2004, the holding company divested the long-distance operation as Broadwing Corporation and changed its name back to Cincinnati Bell.
In 2002, Cincinnati Bell sold Cincinnati Bell Directory, consisting of its directory operations, to Spectrum Equity. The resulting company is named CBD Media. The sale marked the first time a former Bell System-affiliated company sold off its directory operations.
In 2003, when BellSouth exited the payphone market, some former BellSouth payphones in Kentucky were sold to Cincinnati Bell.
Cincinnati Bell is the only American Bell System company that continues to publicly do business under the "Bell" name.[6] In July 2006, Cincinnati Bell removed the final Bell logo—designed in 1969 by Saul Bass—from most of its corporate branding, leaving only a stylized wordmark. This left BellSouth as the last remaining Baby Bell to still use the Bell logo, but it was acquired by AT&T later that year, with the BellSouth brand being retired in 2007. However, the company continues to use the Bell logo in promotional materials for residential landline and long-distance service.[7]
Cincinnati Bell's original headquarters, the Cincinnati and Suburban Telephone Company Building, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Telecommunications[edit]
Landline service[edit]
Cincinnati Bell provides landline PSTN local and long-distance calling. In recent years, the company has seen subscriptions to these traditional services decline due to competition from cable and wireless providers.[8]
Wireless telephony[edit]




Former Cincinnati Bell Wireless logo used until mid-2006


From 1998 until 2015, Cincinnati Bell Wireless (CBW) offered GSM wireless service in southeastern Indiana, southwestern Ohio, and northwestern Kentucky. It was sold at Best Buy, Circuit City (until 2009), Office Depot, and participating Kroger locations. It offered HSPA+[9] service in most of Hamilton County, Ohio, and parts of surrounding counties; EDGE[10] service in Dayton and Oxford; and GSM service elsewhere. The local coverage area extended north to Celina and Urbana, east to Hillsboro, south to Corinth and Warsaw, and west to Batesville.[11] Cincinnati Bell's prepaid mobile phone products were sold under same i-wireless brand as an unrelated service by locally based Kroger.[12]
Cincinnati Bell made its first foray into wireless telephony around 1986, when it acquired a 45% stake in Ameritech Cellular. On February 2, 1998, Cincinnati Bell acquired 80% of AT&T Wireless Services's new Cincinnati-Dayton PCS network for over $100 million. Cincinnati Bell's subsidiary Cincinnati Bell Wireless was responsible for marketing and sales, while AT&T Wireless handled technical operations for the joint venture. Wireless service began by June in Cincinnati and by September in Dayton, eventually covering a 21-county area.[13][14][15] When AT&T Wireless was purchased by Cingular, now known as AT&T Mobility, control of its 20% stake also passed to Cingular. On February 17, 2006, Cincinnati Bell took full control of CBW by purchasing Cingular's stake for $83 million. As a part of the deal, Cincinnati Bell and Cingular secured lower roaming charges on each other's respective GSM networks.[16]
An independent research provider tested Cincinnati Bell Wireless's service in Cincinnati and Dayton and found the company to have the best wireless network in 2005 and 2006.[17] Cincinnati Bell Wireless had 571,000 wireless subscribers at the end of 2007[18] and 196,000 postpaid wireless subscribers at the end of 2013.[19]
On April 7, 2014, Cincinnati Bell announced plans to sell its wireless spectrum and other assets to Verizon Wireless, as part of a planned emphasis on enterprise and entertainment services such as FiOptics.[6][20] Cincinnati Bell Wireless ended service on February 28, 2015. The company's retail locations began selling Verizon products.[21]
Internet access[edit]




Former Fuse logo


Cincinnati Bell offers Internet access to customers in its service area. Cincinnati Bell's Fuse Internet Service provides dial-up access, while its broadband access is through its ZoomTown ADSL service. ZoomTown customers still connect to the Internet through an Internet service provider. Typically, ZoomTown is used in conjunction with Cincinnati Bell's ISP, Fuse, although other local ISPs are available. ZoomTown's ADSL technology currently offers three speeds of 5 Mbit/s and 768 kbit/s downstream.[22] ZoomTown started service in 1999. Cincinnati Bell also offers a service called ZoomTown Plus that bundles Internet access with news, reference, and entertainment content, provided though Synacor.[23] Cincinnati Bell has started offering Zoomtown Internet at speeds from 5 Mbit/s up to 1 Gbit/s in conjunction with its FiOptics services. The availability is limited to areas currently wired for FiOptics, and other FiOptics services are not required. In areas now covered by FiOptics, Cincinnati Bell no longer offers ADSL-only speeds of greater than 5 Mbit/s.
Its primary competitor for broadband Internet access is Charter Spectrum Internet.
Fiber optics[edit]
In late 2009, Cincinnati Bell started offering a fiber-optic communications (Internet, telephone, and IPTV) service called FiOptics, similar to the U-verse service offered by AT&T and the FiOS service offered by Verizon Communications.[24] Cincinnati Bell is currently in the process of rolling out the new service to select communities in the Cincinnati area.[25] FiOptics runs fiber to the home, augmented by fiber to the node.[8] In August 2014, Cincinnati Bell began offering gigabit Internet speeds with its FiOptics service.[26]
Electricity[edit]
In 2011, Cincinnati Bell became the first telecommunications company to also provide retail energy service.[27] Through a partnership with Viridian Energy, Cincinnati Bell Energy competes with several other alternative electricity retailers for the power generation portion of customers' electricity bills.[8] The subsidiary advertises that its service is entirely sourced from regional wind power certified by Green-e Energy.[28]
Retail stores[edit]
Cincinnati Bell originally operated a chain of Cincinnati Bell Phone Center locations until 1992, when it sold the retail chain to AT&T.[29] It reentered the retail space in 1998 with three Store@Cincinnati Bell retail locations.[14][13] As of 2015[update], the company operates eight Cincinnati Bell Stores.[30]

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Equity Research reports, or ZER for short, are our in-house, independently produced research reports.
The ever popular one-page Snapshot reports are generated for virtually every single Zacks Ranked stock. It's packed with all of the company's key stats and salient decision making information. Including the Zacks Rank, Zacks Industry Rank, Style Scores, the Price, Consensus & Surprise chart, graphical estimate analysis and how a stocks stacks up to its peers.
The detailed multi-page Analyst report does an even deeper dive on the company's vital statistics. In addition to all of the proprietary analysis in the Snapshot, the report also visually displays the four components of the Zacks Rank (Agreement, Magnitude, Upside and Surprise); provides a comprehensive overview of the company business drivers, complete with earnings and sales charts; a recap of their last earnings report; and a bulleted list of reasons to buy or sell the stock. It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

Headquartered in Cincinnati, OH, U.S. telecom service provider Cincinnati Bell Inc. (CBB  -  Free Report)	 recently announced an alliance with eero inc., maker of the world’s first whole-home WiFi system. As per the deal, Cincinnati Bell will be offering eero’s whole-home Wi-Fi system at eight of its retail stores across Greater Cincinnati. Thus, this deal will make Cincinnati Bell the first Internet Service Provider (ISP) in the country to offer eero products at its stores.eero inc., founded in Jun 2014, is a San Francisco-based company which specializes in the production of a wireless router using a mesh WiFi system. Normally, a set of three eeros is enough to support the network coverage of an average home (3,000–4,000 square feet).Cincinnati Bell’s ProspectsCincinnati Bell is focused on transforming itself from a legacy copper-based telecommunications company into a technology business with contemporary fiber assets serving both consumer and business customers with flexible data, video, voice and IP solutions. The company continues to build an advanced fiber network across Greater Cincinnati to support its high-speed Fioptics Internet and Entertainment services. Presently, the company's Fioptics services cover almost 60% of the region.By offering eero’s line of products in its retail stores, Cincinnati Bell will be able to grow its FTTH (Fiber to the home) customer base. FTTH is presently the fastest growing method of providing higher bandwidth to consumers and businesses, and thereby enabling more robust video, Internet and voice services.Further, the eero home-WiFi system is easy to install and use. Customers will also be able to use WiFi connections through multiple access points throughout their homes to create a wireless mesh network (WMN). This will also help consumers fully maximize the Internet of Things movement that is increasingly connecting smart devices. Users that have Ethernet wiring at homes also have the option to hard wire each device.Moreover, eero allows customers to expand the system as per their requirement through the eero app (iOS and Android Support). The over-the-air software updates offer customers new features, improved performance and enhanced security.Latest DealCincinnati Bell recently declared a deal with The E.W. Scripps Company, an American broadcasting company in Cincinnati. Per the deal, Scripps’ wholly owned subsidiary – Newsy, a digital video news channel – will now be offered through its Fioptics cable television services.Newsy is accessible on devices such as Apple Inc.’s (AAPL  -  Free Report)	 Apple TV, Dish Network Corp.’s (DISH  -  Free Report)	 Sling TV, Roku, Amazon.com Inc.’s (AMZN  -  Free Report)	 Fire TV and Google Chromecast.

History[edit]




Warsaw Avenue office building, Price Hill, Cincinnati


Cincinnati Bell started out as the City and Suburban Telegraph Association and was providing telegraph lines between homes and businesses in 1873, three years before the invention of the telephone. In 1878, it gained exclusive rights to the Bell franchise within a 25-mile (40-km) radius of Cincinnati—the first telephone exchange in Ohio. It has substantially the same incumbent local exchange carrier territory today, straddling 2,400 square miles in three states. The name changed to Cincinnati and Suburban Bell Telephone Company in 1903. It was shortened to Cincinnati Bell in 1971.
Cincinnati Bell and Southern New England Telephone (SNET) were the only two companies in the old Bell System that operated independently because AT&T Corporation only owned minority stakes in the companies. Therefore, neither is considered a Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC), AT&T was not obligated to dispose of their ownership stakes in the companies, and restrictions placed on the Baby Bells did not apply to these two companies. AT&T owned 32.6% of Cincinnati Bell until 1984, at which point the shares AT&T owned were placed into a trust and then sold.[1] In 1998, SNET was bought by SBC Communications (Now the new AT&T), an RBOC, and in 2014 was sold to Frontier Communications, a company with no relation to the former Bell System; however, Cincinnati Bell has remained independent.
The newsmagazine 60 Minutes reported in 1989 that Cincinnati Bell cooperated with local police to wiretap local residents in search of alleged communist or criminal activity from 1972 to 1984.[2] In a move widely criticized by consumer advocates, Cincinnati Bell was also the first phone company in Ohio to take advantage of a 2005 state law that lets phone companies raise rates without having to gain approval from state regulators.[citation needed]




Cincinnati Bell's residential landline service continues to use the classic Bell logo.[3]


In May 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio awarded Cincinnati Bell Long Distance the right to offer local wireline telephone service in 55 counties outside its incumbent territory and began to resell business local phone service in these counties, in competition with incumbent carrier Ameritech.[4][5]
During the 1990s, Cincinnati Bell acquired a nationwide transmission network formerly known as IXC Communications and changed its corporate name to "Broadwing Communications," although the local telephone operations continued to operate under their traditional name. In 2004, the holding company divested the long-distance operation as Broadwing Corporation and changed its name back to Cincinnati Bell.
In 2002, Cincinnati Bell sold Cincinnati Bell Directory, consisting of its directory operations, to Spectrum Equity. The resulting company is named CBD Media. The sale marked the first time a former Bell System-affiliated company sold off its directory operations.
In 2003, when BellSouth exited the payphone market, some former BellSouth payphones in Kentucky were sold to Cincinnati Bell.
Cincinnati Bell is the only American Bell System company that continues to publicly do business under the "Bell" name.[6] In July 2006, Cincinnati Bell removed the final Bell logo—designed in 1969 by Saul Bass—from most of its corporate branding, leaving only a stylized wordmark. This left BellSouth as the last remaining Baby Bell to still use the Bell logo, but it was acquired by AT&T later that year, with the BellSouth brand being retired in 2007. However, the company continues to use the Bell logo in promotional materials for residential landline and long-distance service.[7]
Cincinnati Bell's original headquarters, the Cincinnati and Suburban Telephone Company Building, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Telecommunications[edit]
Landline service[edit]
Cincinnati Bell provides landline PSTN local and long-distance calling. In recent years, the company has seen subscriptions to these traditional services decline due to competition from cable and wireless providers.[8]
Wireless telephony[edit]




Former Cincinnati Bell Wireless logo used until mid-2006


From 1998 until 2015, Cincinnati Bell Wireless (CBW) offered GSM wireless service in southeastern Indiana, southwestern Ohio, and northwestern Kentucky. It was sold at Best Buy, Circuit City (until 2009), Office Depot, and participating Kroger locations. It offered HSPA+[9] service in most of Hamilton County, Ohio, and parts of surrounding counties; EDGE[10] service in Dayton and Oxford; and GSM service elsewhere. The local coverage area extended north to Celina and Urbana, east to Hillsboro, south to Corinth and Warsaw, and west to Batesville.[11] Cincinnati Bell's prepaid mobile phone products were sold under same i-wireless brand as an unrelated service by locally based Kroger.[12]
Cincinnati Bell made its first foray into wireless telephony around 1986, when it acquired a 45% stake in Ameritech Cellular. On February 2, 1998, Cincinnati Bell acquired 80% of AT&T Wireless Services's new Cincinnati-Dayton PCS network for over $100 million. Cincinnati Bell's subsidiary Cincinnati Bell Wireless was responsible for marketing and sales, while AT&T Wireless handled technical operations for the joint venture. Wireless service began by June in Cincinnati and by September in Dayton, eventually covering a 21-county area.[13][14][15] When AT&T Wireless was purchased by Cingular, now known as AT&T Mobility, control of its 20% stake also passed to Cingular. On February 17, 2006, Cincinnati Bell took full control of CBW by purchasing Cingular's stake for $83 million. As a part of the deal, Cincinnati Bell and Cingular secured lower roaming charges on each other's respective GSM networks.[16]
An independent research provider tested Cincinnati Bell Wireless's service in Cincinnati and Dayton and found the company to have the best wireless network in 2005 and 2006.[17] Cincinnati Bell Wireless had 571,000 wireless subscribers at the end of 2007[18] and 196,000 postpaid wireless subscribers at the end of 2013.[19]
On April 7, 2014, Cincinnati Bell announced plans to sell its wireless spectrum and other assets to Verizon Wireless, as part of a planned emphasis on enterprise and entertainment services such as FiOptics.[6][20] Cincinnati Bell Wireless ended service on February 28, 2015. The company's retail locations began selling Verizon products.[21]
Internet access[edit]




Former Fuse logo


Cincinnati Bell offers Internet access to customers in its service area. Cincinnati Bell's Fuse Internet Service provides dial-up access, while its broadband access is through its ZoomTown ADSL service. ZoomTown customers still connect to the Internet through an Internet service provider. Typically, ZoomTown is used in conjunction with Cincinnati Bell's ISP, Fuse, although other local ISPs are available. ZoomTown's ADSL technology currently offers three speeds of 5 Mbit/s and 768 kbit/s downstream.[22] ZoomTown started service in 1999. Cincinnati Bell also offers a service called ZoomTown Plus that bundles Internet access with news, reference, and entertainment content, provided though Synacor.[23] Cincinnati Bell has started offering Zoomtown Internet at speeds from 5 Mbit/s up to 1 Gbit/s in conjunction with its FiOptics services. The availability is limited to areas currently wired for FiOptics, and other FiOptics services are not required. In areas now covered by FiOptics, Cincinnati Bell no longer offers ADSL-only speeds of greater than 5 Mbit/s.
Its primary competitor for broadband Internet access is Charter Spectrum Internet.
Fiber optics[edit]
In late 2009, Cincinnati Bell started offering a fiber-optic communications (Internet, telephone, and IPTV) service called FiOptics, similar to the U-verse service offered by AT&T and the FiOS service offered by Verizon Communications.[24] Cincinnati Bell is currently in the process of rolling out the new service to select communities in the Cincinnati area.[25] FiOptics runs fiber to the home, augmented by fiber to the node.[8] In August 2014, Cincinnati Bell began offering gigabit Internet speeds with its FiOptics service.[26]
Electricity[edit]
In 2011, Cincinnati Bell became the first telecommunications company to also provide retail energy service.[27] Through a partnership with Viridian Energy, Cincinnati Bell Energy competes with several other alternative electricity retailers for the power generation portion of customers' electricity bills.[8] The subsidiary advertises that its service is entirely sourced from regional wind power certified by Green-e Energy.[28]
Retail stores[edit]
Cincinnati Bell originally operated a chain of Cincinnati Bell Phone Center locations until 1992, when it sold the retail chain to AT&T.[29] It reentered the retail space in 1998 with three Store@Cincinnati Bell retail locations.[14][13] As of 2015[update], the company operates eight Cincinnati Bell Stores.[30]

History[edit]




Warsaw Avenue office building, Price Hill, Cincinnati


Cincinnati Bell started out as the City and Suburban Telegraph Association and was providing telegraph lines between homes and businesses in 1873, three years before the invention of the telephone. In 1878, it gained exclusive rights to the Bell franchise within a 25-mile (40-km) radius of Cincinnati—the first telephone exchange in Ohio. It has substantially the same incumbent local exchange carrier territory today, straddling 2,400 square miles in three states. The name changed to Cincinnati and Suburban Bell Telephone Company in 1903. It was shortened to Cincinnati Bell in 1971.
Cincinnati Bell and Southern New England Telephone (SNET) were the only two companies in the old Bell System that operated independently because AT&T Corporation only owned minority stakes in the companies. Therefore, neither is considered a Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC), AT&T was not obligated to dispose of their ownership stakes in the companies, and restrictions placed on the Baby Bells did not apply to these two companies. AT&T owned 32.6% of Cincinnati Bell until 1984, at which point the shares AT&T owned were placed into a trust and then sold.[1] In 1998, SNET was bought by SBC Communications (Now the new AT&T), an RBOC, and in 2014 was sold to Frontier Communications, a company with no relation to the former Bell System; however, Cincinnati Bell has remained independent.
The newsmagazine 60 Minutes reported in 1989 that Cincinnati Bell cooperated with local police to wiretap local residents in search of alleged communist or criminal activity from 1972 to 1984.[2] In a move widely criticized by consumer advocates, Cincinnati Bell was also the first phone company in Ohio to take advantage of a 2005 state law that lets phone companies raise rates without having to gain approval from state regulators.[citation needed]




Cincinnati Bell's residential landline service continues to use the classic Bell logo.[3]


In May 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio awarded Cincinnati Bell Long Distance the right to offer local wireline telephone service in 55 counties outside its incumbent territory and began to resell business local phone service in these counties, in competition with incumbent carrier Ameritech.[4][5]
During the 1990s, Cincinnati Bell acquired a nationwide transmission network formerly known as IXC Communications and changed its corporate name to "Broadwing Communications," although the local telephone operations continued to operate under their traditional name. In 2004, the holding company divested the long-distance operation as Broadwing Corporation and changed its name back to Cincinnati Bell.
In 2002, Cincinnati Bell sold Cincinnati Bell Directory, consisting of its directory operations, to Spectrum Equity. The resulting company is named CBD Media. The sale marked the first time a former Bell System-affiliated company sold off its directory operations.
In 2003, when BellSouth exited the payphone market, some former BellSouth payphones in Kentucky were sold to Cincinnati Bell.
Cincinnati Bell is the only American Bell System company that continues to publicly do business under the "Bell" name.[6] In July 2006, Cincinnati Bell removed the final Bell logo—designed in 1969 by Saul Bass—from most of its corporate branding, leaving only a stylized wordmark. This left BellSouth as the last remaining Baby Bell to still use the Bell logo, but it was acquired by AT&T later that year, with the BellSouth brand being retired in 2007. However, the company continues to use the Bell logo in promotional materials for residential landline and long-distance service.[7]
Cincinnati Bell's original headquarters, the Cincinnati and Suburban Telephone Company Building, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Cincinnati Bell provides landline PSTN local and long-distance calling. In recent years, the company has seen subscriptions to these traditional services decline due to competition from cable and wireless providers.[8]
Wireless telephony[edit]




Former Cincinnati Bell Wireless logo used until mid-2006


From 1998 until 2015, Cincinnati Bell Wireless (CBW) offered GSM wireless service in southeastern Indiana, southwestern Ohio, and northwestern Kentucky. It was sold at Best Buy, Circuit City (until 2009), Office Depot, and participating Kroger locations. It offered HSPA+[9] service in most of Hamilton County, Ohio, and parts of surrounding counties; EDGE[10] service in Dayton and Oxford; and GSM service elsewhere. The local coverage area extended north to Celina and Urbana, east to Hillsboro, south to Corinth and Warsaw, and west to Batesville.[11] Cincinnati Bell's prepaid mobile phone products were sold under same i-wireless brand as an unrelated service by locally based Kroger.[12]
Cincinnati Bell made its first foray into wireless telephony around 1986, when it acquired a 45% stake in Ameritech Cellular. On February 2, 1998, Cincinnati Bell acquired 80% of AT&T Wireless Services's new Cincinnati-Dayton PCS network for over $100 million. Cincinnati Bell's subsidiary Cincinnati Bell Wireless was responsible for marketing and sales, while AT&T Wireless handled technical operations for the joint venture. Wireless service began by June in Cincinnati and by September in Dayton, eventually covering a 21-county area.[13][14][15] When AT&T Wireless was purchased by Cingular, now known as AT&T Mobility, control of its 20% stake also passed to Cingular. On February 17, 2006, Cincinnati Bell took full control of CBW by purchasing Cingular's stake for $83 million. As a part of the deal, Cincinnati Bell and Cingular secured lower roaming charges on each other's respective GSM networks.[16]
An independent research provider tested Cincinnati Bell Wireless's service in Cincinnati and Dayton and found the company to have the best wireless network in 2005 and 2006.[17] Cincinnati Bell Wireless had 571,000 wireless subscribers at the end of 2007[18] and 196,000 postpaid wireless subscribers at the end of 2013.[19]
On April 7, 2014, Cincinnati Bell announced plans to sell its wireless spectrum and other assets to Verizon Wireless, as part of a planned emphasis on enterprise and entertainment services such as FiOptics.[6][20] Cincinnati Bell Wireless ended service on February 28, 2015. The company's retail locations began selling Verizon products.[21]
Internet access[edit]




Former Fuse logo


Cincinnati Bell offers Internet access to customers in its service area. Cincinnati Bell's Fuse Internet Service provides dial-up access, while its broadband access is through its ZoomTown ADSL service. ZoomTown customers still connect to the Internet through an Internet service provider. Typically, ZoomTown is used in conjunction with Cincinnati Bell's ISP, Fuse, although other local ISPs are available. ZoomTown's ADSL technology currently offers three speeds of 5 Mbit/s and 768 kbit/s downstream.[22] ZoomTown started service in 1999. Cincinnati Bell also offers a service called ZoomTown Plus that bundles Internet access with news, reference, and entertainment content, provided though Synacor.[23] Cincinnati Bell has started offering Zoomtown Internet at speeds from 5 Mbit/s up to 1 Gbit/s in conjunction with its FiOptics services. The availability is limited to areas currently wired for FiOptics, and other FiOptics services are not required. In areas now covered by FiOptics, Cincinnati Bell no longer offers ADSL-only speeds of greater than 5 Mbit/s.
Its primary competitor for broadband Internet access is Charter Spectrum Internet.
Fiber optics[edit]
In late 2009, Cincinnati Bell started offering a fiber-optic communications (Internet, telephone, and IPTV) service called FiOptics, similar to the U-verse service offered by AT&T and the FiOS service offered by Verizon Communications.[24] Cincinnati Bell is currently in the process of rolling out the new service to select communities in the Cincinnati area.[25] FiOptics runs fiber to the home, augmented by fiber to the node.[8] In August 2014, Cincinnati Bell began offering gigabit Internet speeds with its FiOptics service.[26]
Electricity[edit]
In 2011, Cincinnati Bell became the first telecommunications company to also provide retail energy service.[27] Through a partnership with Viridian Energy, Cincinnati Bell Energy competes with several other alternative electricity retailers for the power generation portion of customers' electricity bills.[8] The subsidiary advertises that its service is entirely sourced from regional wind power certified by Green-e Energy.[28]
Retail stores[edit]
Cincinnati Bell originally operated a chain of Cincinnati Bell Phone Center locations until 1992, when it sold the retail chain to AT&T.[29] It reentered the retail space in 1998 with three Store@Cincinnati Bell retail locations.[14][13] As of 2015[update], the company operates eight Cincinnati Bell Stores.[30]

History[edit]




Warsaw Avenue office building, Price Hill, Cincinnati


Cincinnati Bell started out as the City and Suburban Telegraph Association and was providing telegraph lines between homes and businesses in 1873, three years before the invention of the telephone. In 1878, it gained exclusive rights to the Bell franchise within a 25-mile (40-km) radius of Cincinnati—the first telephone exchange in Ohio. It has substantially the same incumbent local exchange carrier territory today, straddling 2,400 square miles in three states. The name changed to Cincinnati and Suburban Bell Telephone Company in 1903. It was shortened to Cincinnati Bell in 1971.
Cincinnati Bell and Southern New England Telephone (SNET) were the only two companies in the old Bell System that operated independently because AT&T Corporation only owned minority stakes in the companies. Therefore, neither is considered a Regional Bell Operating Company (RBOC), AT&T was not obligated to dispose of their ownership stakes in the companies, and restrictions placed on the Baby Bells did not apply to these two companies. AT&T owned 32.6% of Cincinnati Bell until 1984, at which point the shares AT&T owned were placed into a trust and then sold.[1] In 1998, SNET was bought by SBC Communications (Now the new AT&T), an RBOC, and in 2014 was sold to Frontier Communications, a company with no relation to the former Bell System; however, Cincinnati Bell has remained independent.
The newsmagazine 60 Minutes reported in 1989 that Cincinnati Bell cooperated with local police to wiretap local residents in search of alleged communist or criminal activity from 1972 to 1984.[2] In a move widely criticized by consumer advocates, Cincinnati Bell was also the first phone company in Ohio to take advantage of a 2005 state law that lets phone companies raise rates without having to gain approval from state regulators.[citation needed]




Cincinnati Bell's residential landline service continues to use the classic Bell logo.[3]


In May 1999, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio awarded Cincinnati Bell Long Distance the right to offer local wireline telephone service in 55 counties outside its incumbent territory and began to resell business local phone service in these counties, in competition with incumbent carrier Ameritech.[4][5]
During the 1990s, Cincinnati Bell acquired a nationwide transmission network formerly known as IXC Communications and changed its corporate name to "Broadwing Communications," although the local telephone operations continued to operate under their traditional name. In 2004, the holding company divested the long-distance operation as Broadwing Corporation and changed its name back to Cincinnati Bell.
In 2002, Cincinnati Bell sold Cincinnati Bell Directory, consisting of its directory operations, to Spectrum Equity. The resulting company is named CBD Media. The sale marked the first time a former Bell System-affiliated company sold off its directory operations.
In 2003, when BellSouth exited the payphone market, some former BellSouth payphones in Kentucky were sold to Cincinnati Bell.
Cincinnati Bell is the only American Bell System company that continues to publicly do business under the "Bell" name.[6] In July 2006, Cincinnati Bell removed the final Bell logo—designed in 1969 by Saul Bass—from most of its corporate branding, leaving only a stylized wordmark. This left BellSouth as the last remaining Baby Bell to still use the Bell logo, but it was acquired by AT&T later that year, with the BellSouth brand being retired in 2007. However, the company continues to use the Bell logo in promotional materials for residential landline and long-distance service.[7]
Cincinnati Bell's original headquarters, the Cincinnati and Suburban Telephone Company Building, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
Telecommunications[edit]
Landline service[edit]
Cincinnati Bell provides landline PSTN local and long-distance calling. In recent years, the company has seen subscriptions to these traditional services decline due to competition from cable and wireless providers.[8]
Wireless telephony[edit]




Former Cincinnati Bell Wireless logo used until mid-2006


From 1998 until 2015, Cincinnati Bell Wireless (CBW) offered GSM wireless service in southeastern Indiana, southwestern Ohio, and northwestern Kentucky. It was sold at Best Buy, Circuit City (until 2009), Office Depot, and participating Kroger locations. It offered HSPA+[9] service in most of Hamilton County, Ohio, and parts of surrounding counties; EDGE[10] service in Dayton and Oxford; and GSM service elsewhere. The local coverage area extended north to Celina and Urbana, east to Hillsboro, south to Corinth and Warsaw, and west to Batesville.[11] Cincinnati Bell's prepaid mobile phone products were sold under same i-wireless brand as an unrelated service by locally based Kroger.[12]
Cincinnati Bell made its first foray into wireless telephony around 1986, when it acquired a 45% stake in Ameritech Cellular. On February 2, 1998, Cincinnati Bell acquired 80% of AT&T Wireless Services's new Cincinnati-Dayton PCS network for over $100 million. Cincinnati Bell's subsidiary Cincinnati Bell Wireless was responsible for marketing and sales, while AT&T Wireless handled technical operations for the joint venture. Wireless service began by June in Cincinnati and by September in Dayton, eventually covering a 21-county area.[13][14][15] When AT&T Wireless was purchased by Cingular, now known as AT&T Mobility, control of its 20% stake also passed to Cingular. On February 17, 2006, Cincinnati Bell took full control of CBW by purchasing Cingular's stake for $83 million. As a part of the deal, Cincinnati Bell and Cingular secured lower roaming charges on each other's respective GSM networks.[16]
An independent research provider tested Cincinnati Bell Wireless's service in Cincinnati and Dayton and found the company to have the best wireless network in 2005 and 2006.[17] Cincinnati Bell Wireless had 571,000 wireless subscribers at the end of 2007[18] and 196,000 postpaid wireless subscribers at the end of 2013.[19]
On April 7, 2014, Cincinnati Bell announced plans to sell its wireless spectrum and other assets to Verizon Wireless, as part of a planned emphasis on enterprise and entertainment services such as FiOptics.[6][20] Cincinnati Bell Wireless ended service on February 28, 2015. The company's retail locations began selling Verizon products.[21]
Internet access[edit]




Former Fuse logo


Cincinnati Bell offers Internet access to customers in its service area. Cincinnati Bell's Fuse Internet Service provides dial-up access, while its broadband access is through its ZoomTown ADSL service. ZoomTown customers still connect to the Internet through an Internet service provider. Typically, ZoomTown is used in conjunction with Cincinnati Bell's ISP, Fuse, although other local ISPs are available. ZoomTown's ADSL technology currently offers three speeds of 5 Mbit/s and 768 kbit/s downstream.[22] ZoomTown started service in 1999. Cincinnati Bell also offers a service called ZoomTown Plus that bundles Internet access with news, reference, and entertainment content, provided though Synacor.[23] Cincinnati Bell has started offering Zoomtown Internet at speeds from 5 Mbit/s up to 1 Gbit/s in conjunction with its FiOptics services. The availability is limited to areas currently wired for FiOptics, and other FiOptics services are not required. In areas now covered by FiOptics, Cincinnati Bell no longer offers ADSL-only speeds of greater than 5 Mbit/s.
Its primary competitor for broadband Internet access is Charter Spectrum Internet.
Fiber optics[edit]
In late 2009, Cincinnati Bell started offering a fiber-optic communications (Internet, telephone, and IPTV) service called FiOptics, similar to the U-verse service offered by AT&T and the FiOS service offered by Verizon Communications.[24] Cincinnati Bell is currently in the process of rolling out the new service to select communities in the Cincinnati area.[25] FiOptics runs fiber to the home, augmented by fiber to the node.[8] In August 2014, Cincinnati Bell began offering gigabit Internet speeds with its FiOptics service.[26]
Electricity[edit]
In 2011, Cincinnati Bell became the first telecommunications company to also provide retail energy service.[27] Through a partnership with Viridian Energy, Cincinnati Bell Energy competes with several other alternative electricity retailers for the power generation portion of customers' electricity bills.[8] The subsidiary advertises that its service is entirely sourced from regional wind power certified by Green-e Energy.[28]
Retail stores[edit]
Cincinnati Bell originally operated a chain of Cincinnati Bell Phone Center locations until 1992, when it sold the retail chain to AT&T.[29] It reentered the retail space in 1998 with three Store@Cincinnati Bell retail locations.[14][13] As of 2015[update], the company operates eight Cincinnati Bell Stores.[30]
