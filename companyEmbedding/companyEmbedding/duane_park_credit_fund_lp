Duane Park in Tribeca.


Duane Park is a small, triangular public urban park located in the Tribeca neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City.[1] The park is bordered by Hudson Street to the east and branches of Duane Street on north and south sides.
The park is supported by a non-profit group, The Friends of Duane Park, whose website contains a brief history of the park and its neighborhood.[2]
The city of New York purchased Duane Park in 1795 from Trinity Church for five dollars.[1] The park is surrounded by commercial buildings which were constructed during the 19th century.[1] Duane Street, which borders the park, is named for James Duane, an important parishioner at Trinity Church.[3]

Duane Park

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search





Duane Park in Tribeca.


Duane Park is a small, triangular public urban park located in the Tribeca neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City.[1] The park is bordered by Hudson Street to the east and branches of Duane Street on north and south sides.
The park is supported by a non-profit group, The Friends of Duane Park, whose website contains a brief history of the park and its neighborhood.[2]
The city of New York purchased Duane Park in 1795 from Trinity Church for five dollars.[1] The park is surrounded by commercial buildings which were constructed during the 19th century.[1] Duane Street, which borders the park, is named for James Duane, an important parishioner at Trinity Church.[3]

Duane Park

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Duane Park in Tribeca.


Duane Park is a small, triangular public urban park located in the Tribeca neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City.[1] The park is bordered by Hudson Street to the east and branches of Duane Street on north and south sides.
The park is supported by a non-profit group, The Friends of Duane Park, whose website contains a brief history of the park and its neighborhood.[2]
The city of New York purchased Duane Park in 1795 from Trinity Church for five dollars.[1] The park is surrounded by commercial buildings which were constructed during the 19th century.[1] Duane Street, which borders the park, is named for James Duane, an important parishioner at Trinity Church.[3]

The 2015 Hedge Fund Rising Stars: T. Troy Dixon

							The Hollis Park Partners founder recently secured $50 million in start-up capital from GCM Grosvenor.
						










In December 2014, T. Troy Dixon landed a major deal. Less
    than two years old, his hedge fund firm Hollis Park Partners
    entered a strategic partnership and seed deal with GCM
    Grosvenor, the Chicago-based, $50.2 billion fund-of-hedge-funds
    giant. Grosvenor provided $50 million in seed capital for
    Hollis Park, which now has close to $225 million in assets
    under management. The New Yorkbased multistrategy firm is
    named after the Queens, New York, neighborhood where Dixon grew
    up and Duane Park in Tribeca, where he now lives; it invests
    across structured rates, structured derivatives and structured
    credit. Dixon, 43, has already won recognition for his
    investing prowess. Black Enterprise magazine placed
    him on its 75 Most Powerful Blacks on Wall Street list in 2011
    and its Americas Most Powerful Players Under 40 list in
    2007, and Investment Dealers Digest deemed him
    one of its 40 Under 40 in 2006. Prior to Hollis Park, he spent
    most of his career at investment banks, most recently
    co-heading the structured products trading group at Deutsche
    Bank in New York from 2006 to late 2013. He sits on the boards
    of Harlems Apollo Theater  along with fellow hedge
    fund manager and noted philanthropist 
    Paul Tudor Jones II  and Boys Hope Girls Hope, a
    Brooklyn nonprofit that helps children excel through
    scholarships and charities. Dixon earned a BA in economics from
    College of the Holy Cross in Massachusetts in 1993, where he
    was recruited to play football and also joined the baseball
    team. Two decades later hes still involved with the
    school. In 2008 he donated $250,000 to fund an artificial turf
    field to improve playing conditions.
