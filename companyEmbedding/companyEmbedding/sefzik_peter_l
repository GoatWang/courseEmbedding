Peter L. Sefzik Named Comerica's Texas Market President

16-Year Comerica Veteran Succeeds J. Patrick Faubion in Role




Sep 2, 2015, 10:03am EDT














DALLAS, Sept. 2, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Comerica Bank today announced that Peter L. Sefzik has been named its Texas market president, effective immediately. Sefzik succeeds and will now report directly to J. Patrick Faubion, who in July was named executive vice president of Comerica's Business Bank. With this appointment, Sefzik will also join Comerica's Management Policy Committee. 

As Texas market president, Sefzik will lead Comerica's Texas Management Council and oversee all business and community development efforts in the bank's headquarters market, including direct management responsibility for Middle Market and Energy Lending in Texas. Additionally, he will manage six regional presidents and have overall market responsibilities for the commercial, wealth and retail lines of business in Texas, Arizona and Florida. 
"Peter's strong track record of leadership, collaboration, broad experience across key businesses and his ability to build deep client relationships position him very well for this new assignment, and I am confident in his ability to continue to build upon the strong foundation of our Texas division," said Faubion. "He will bring fresh insights and energy to this role, and will help us to continue to raise the expectations of what a bank can be for our colleagues, our clients and the communities we serve."
Sefzik, who began his banking career with Comerica as a credit analyst in 1999, most recently served as senior vice president and national private banking group business manager since 2014. Prior to that, Sefzik was regional managing director of Wealth Management for the bank's Texas, Arizona and Florida markets, and held various roles of increasing scope and responsibility within Comerica's wealth and commercial banking lines of business, including nine years in Comerica's Energy Lending group. 
He received his bachelor's degree in International Relations and MBA in International Management from Baylor University, and earned his juris doctorate from Southern Methodist University's Dedman School of Law. An active community volunteer, fundraiser and philanthropist, he currently serves on the board of the Dallas Arboretum. 
He previously chaired Comerica's United Way campaign in Texas, Arizona and Florida, served as a trustee of the Dallas Opera, on the executive leadership team for Cotes du Coeur for the American Heart Association and on the board of the Dallas Children's Theatre. He is also a graduate of the 2013 class of Leadership Dallas. 
About ComericaComerica Incorporated (NYSE: CMA) is a financial services company headquartered in Dallas, Texas, and strategically aligned by three business segments: The Business Bank, The Retail Bank, and Wealth Management. Comerica focuses on relationships, and helping people and businesses be successful.
