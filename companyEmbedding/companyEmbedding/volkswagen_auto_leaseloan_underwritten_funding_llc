The Bay Area’s Go-To Source for Volkswagen Parts
At Capitol Volkswagen, we love working on Volkswagen cars. And, while we’re happy to serve people who either do not want to perform their own auto repairs and car service, don’t know how, or don’t have the time; we completely understand how many drivers want to do it themselves. For some, there’s nothing so rewarding as getting some grease on their hands. To help, Capitol Volkswagen, located at 911 Capitol Expressway Auto Mall, San Jose, CA, carries all of the Volkswagen car parts you might need – from the oil filters to the windshield wiper blades to the batteries to the tires to the brake pads and more. If you need help determining exactly what you need to do the job right, just ask. And if, for some strange reason, we don’t have exactly what you’re looking for, we’re happy to special order it right away.

Please use the buttons below to order parts or contact our parts department. We can be reached by phone at 888-407-2472.

VOLKSWAGEN AUTO LEASE/LOAN UNDERWRITTEN FUNDING, LLC - S-1/A - 20040915 - UNDERWRITING






	Lease Underwriting Procedures



	     

	Both auto loan and auto lease applications are
	generally subject to the same credit policies and procedures at
	VW Credit. Contracts that are purchased must comply with VW
	Credits underwriting standards and other requirements, as
	described below, under existing agreements between VW Credit and
	dealers. VW Credits underwriting standards emphasize the
	prospective lessees ability to pay and creditworthiness,
	as well as the asset value of the motor vehicle to be leased. VW
	Credits underwriting, servicing and collection activities
	are conducted principally at processing centers located in
	Libertyville, Illinois and Portland, Oregon.


	     

	Lease applications submitted to VW Credit for a
	new motor vehicle must list sufficient information to process
	the application, including the applicants:













	 



	 




	residential information;





	 




	 



	 




	source and amount of monthly income;





	 




	 



	 




	monthly mortgage or rent payment;






	21








	Table of Contents















	 



	 




	social security number; and





	 




	 



	 




	other personal information.





	     

	VW Credits credit decision is influenced
	by, among other things, the applicants custom credit score
	as obtained from a statistically derived empirical credit
	scoring process and a credit bureau score. VW Credit uses a
	two-dimensional credit score matrix based on the custom score
	and the credit bureau score for loan and lease originations. The
	custom scorecards were developed for VW Credit by Fair, Isaac
	and Company, Inc. based on VW Credits specific
	application, origination and loan and lease performance
	information. The credit scoring process takes into account
	information about the applicant, including various debt ratios
	and other personal information. VW Credit makes its final credit
	decision based upon the degree of credit risk perceived and the
	amount of credit requested. To improve overall underwriting
	efficiency, a portion of VW Credits applications are
	automatically approved or rejected based on an algorithm which
	takes into consideration the applicants credit scores,
	time in credit bureau, loan to value, prior bankruptcies and
	other related information.


	     

	VW Credits underwriting standards are
	reviewed by its Retail Credit Committee. Any change in VW
	Credits underwriting standards requires prior approval
	from the Retail Credit Committee.









	Determination of Residual Values







	     

	The value of the notes being offered under this
	prospectus is based on the aggregate Securitization Value of the
	Included Units. As used in this prospectus,

	Securitization Value

	means, for each Included
	Unit, (a) as of the cutoff date or any date other than the
	maturity date of the related lease, the sum of (1) the
	present value (discounted at the Securitization Rate) of the
	aggregate monthly payments remaining on the lease (including
	monthly payments due and not yet paid for which the servicer has
	never made an advance) and (2) the present value
	(discounted at the Securitization Rate) of the Base Residual
	Value of the related vehicle and (b) as of the maturity
	date of the related lease, the Base Residual Value of the
	related vehicle; however, the Securitization Value of a
	Terminated Unit (as described below under The
	Leases  Characteristics of the Units 
	Calculation of Targeted Principal Distributable Amount) is
	equal to zero.

	Base Residual Value

	means, for
	each leased vehicle, the lowest of (i) the stated residual
	value, (ii) the MSRP ALG Residual and (iii) the
	Maximum Residualized MSRP ALG Residual (which we also refer to
	as the

	MRM ALG Residual

	).










	     

	The MSRP ALG Residual and the MRM ALG Residual
	are residual value calculations produced by a third-party
	source,

	Automotive Lease Guide

	(also referred to as

	ALG

	), an independent publisher of residual
	value percentages recognized throughout the automotive finance
	industry for projecting vehicle market values at lease
	termination. The MRM ALG Residual calculates a residual value
	estimate that is a percentage of the

	Maximum
	Residualized MSRP,

	which consists of the
	manufacturers suggested retail price (commonly referred to
	as

	MSRP

	) of the typically equipped vehicle
	and value adding options, giving only partial credit or no
	credit for those options that add little or no value to the
	resale price of the vehicle.










	     


	MSRP ALG
	Residual



	means, with respect to
	any lease, a residual value estimate produced by ALG based on
	the total MSRP of the base vehicle and all VW Credit authorized
	options, without making a distinction between the value adding
	options and non-value adding options. The calculation of Base
	Residual Value has the effect of placing a cap on the total
	capitalized cost of a vehicle for purposes of calculating the
	residual value of such vehicle.










	     

	Each lease sets forth a residual value, which we
	refer to in this prospectus as the

	stated residual
	value

	established at the time of lease origination (as
	it may be subsequently revised in connection with an extension
	of a lease in accordance with customary servicing practices).
	The stated residual value as provided in the lease agreement is
	the value of the vehicle at the end of the lease and is the
	amount used to calculate the base monthly lease payments under
	the lease, assuming that the lease amortizes like a loan. If we
	assume that the original capitalized cost of the lease is the
	initial principal amount of the loan, that the lease rate is the
	interest rate, that the lease term is the term of the loan and
	that all monthly payments are timely made, the stated residual
	value is the amount to which the outstanding balance would
	decline at the scheduled expiration of the







	22








	Table of Contents





	lease term. When a vehicle is sold after being
	returned by the lessee at the end of the related lease, there
	will be a residual loss if the net sales proceeds of the vehicle
	are less than the stated residual value.







	     

	In establishing the stated residual value of
	Volkswagen leased vehicles, VW Credit uses an internally
	developed proprietary model. The model uses, among other things,
	key factors such as MSRP, wholesale price, brand image, model
	image, month of lease origination, lease term, product life
	cycle, and any current or planned sales incentives in its
	calculation of residual values. The model is reviewed regularly
	by VW Credits Residual Value Committee. The stated
	residual values set by the model are compared to VW
	Credits historical off-lease vehicle sales performance,
	various independent industry guides, such as ALG and the

	National Auto Research Official Used Car Market Guide Monthly


	(Black Book)

	, for reasonableness. ALG and
	Black Book are independent publications of residual value
	percentages which are widely used throughout the automotive
	finance industry for estimating vehicle market values at lease
	termination. These values serve as a projection of a
	vehicles future resale value by expressing the future
	value as a percentage of a vehicles original
	manufacturers suggested retail price. Stated residual
	values for Audi vehicles are established to project the value of
	the vehicle at maturity.










	     

	The estimated future value of a leased vehicle is
	a major component of the leasing business. Specifically, any
	excess of the stated residual value of a vehicle over its actual
	future market value represents a residual loss at lease
	termination. VW Credit believes that the difference between the
	stated residual values and the actual value at maturity may
	affect consumer behavior concerning purchasing or returning a
	vehicle to the lessor at lease termination. Furthermore, VW
	Credit believes that return rates may decline as the difference
	between stated residual value and actual value declines. As it
	specifically pertains to this transaction, the residual loss at
	lease termination in respect of a leased vehicle will be
	determined by the excess, if any, of the Base Residual Value of
	the leased vehicle (which is the lowest of the related stated
	residual value, the MSRP ALG Residual and the MRM ALG Residual
	of such vehicle) over its actual sales proceeds.






	     

	All of the leases and leased vehicles that have
	been allocated to the Transaction SUBI have been originated
	under the residual value policies described above.
	Notwithstanding the foregoing, no assurance can be given as to
	VW Credits future experience with respect to the return
	rates of Volkswagen and Audi vehicles relating to leases
	originated under these policies. In addition, no assurance can
	be given that VW Credits experience with respect to the
	return of off-lease Volkswagen and Audi vehicles or related
	residual value losses, or the experience of the issuer with
	respect to the leased vehicles, will be similar to that set
	forth in the residual value loss experience table set forth
	under VW Credit, Inc.  Residual Value Loss
	Experience.


	     

	VW Credit believes that the historical residual
	value loss experience is partially attributable to new car
	pricing policies of all manufacturers. Many manufacturers have
	recently endeavored to keep new car pricing flat and, in some
	cases, less than the prices for models from prior years. New car
	models frequently have more standard equipment that were
	included as optional equipment in models from prior years.
	Additionally, VW Credit believes that the increased popularity
	of leasing and increased levels of new car sales over the last
	five years has resulted in a higher supply of late model used
	vehicles. These factors have exerted additional downward
	pressure on the value of used vehicles when compared to the
	price for new vehicles.









	Remarketing Program







	     

	VW Credit directs all inbound customer calls to
	the remarketing department 90 days prior to lease maturity.
	Within 120 days of maturity, the remarketing consultants
	may proactively call lessees to determine their intent to
	purchase or return the related leased vehicles. At 75 days
	and 35 days prior to maturity, VW Credit contacts each
	lease customer through direct mail providing each customer with
	information regarding the lessees lease obligations,
	including vehicle inspection, turn-in requirements, option to
	purchase, financing availability and the required documentation.
	If the lessee indicates an intention to purchase the leased
	vehicle, the lessee is provided with all necessary documents to
	complete the purchase. Lessees that do not respond to any
	mailings are contacted using phone calls by VW Credit to
	determine their intentions and to apprise them of their lease
	end obligations.










	     

	A vehicle inspection, including digital pictures
	of the vehicle, normally occurs approximately 25 days prior
	to lease maturity and may occur at the lessees residence,
	place of business or a dealership. The lessee is







	23








	Table of Contents









	provided an estimate for excess wear and use and
	excess mileage charges and is encouraged to file insurance
	claims and make repairs prior to returning the vehicle.
	Inspection reports and digital pictures are processed
	electronically and transmitted for viewing by dealers online to
	facilitate VW Credits online dealer purchase channel.











	     

	From time to time, VW Credit has offered existing
	lessees special lease programs on selected models to help
	mitigate residual value losses. These programs may offer the
	lessee waiver of lease payments upon early termination, an
	extended service contract at a reduced cost or reduced annual
	percentage rate financing. There can be no assurance that VW
	Credit will offer any programs in the future.













	Lease Vehicle Maintenance



	     

	Each VW Credit lease contract provides that the
	lessee is responsible for all maintenance, repair, service and
	operating expenses of the leased vehicle. In addition, the
	lessee is responsible for all damage to the leased vehicle and
	for its loss, seizure or theft. At the scheduled maturity date
	of a VW Credit lease contract, if the lessee does not purchase
	the leased vehicle, the VW Credit lease contract requires the
	lessee to pay VW Credit the estimated cost to repair any damages
	to the vehicle resulting from unreasonable or
	excessive wear and use. Unreasonable or excess wear
	and use generally includes, but is not limited to, the
	following: (1) inoperative mechanical and electrical parts
	including power accessories, (2) any and all dents, dings,
	scratches, chips or rusted areas on any body or trim part,
	(3) gouges or tears through bumper covers, broken or dented
	grilles, (4) mismatched paint or any mark left by special
	identification, (5) seats, seat belts, headlining, door
	panels or carpeting which is torn, worn, stained, burned or
	damaged, (6) cracks, scratches, pits or chips to
	windshields, windows, head light lenses, sealed beams or
	taillight assemblies, (7) any tire not part of a matching
	set of five tires of the same brand, size and quality (or four
	with an emergency doughnut), any tire with less than
	1/8 inch of tread or any tire with gouged, cut, torn or
	plugged sidewalls or (8) any missing parts, accessories and
	adornments, including bumpers, ornamentation, aerials, hubcaps,
	rear view mirrors, radio and stereo components or spare tire. VW
	Credit may waive all or part of the excessive wear and mileage
	billed to the lessee.









	Methods of Vehicle Disposal







	     

	VW Credits vehicle remarketing department
	handles the disposition of all motor vehicles for VW Credit
	including repossessions, early terminations and end of term
	leases. Each lease currently provides that upon maturity, the
	lessee has the option to purchase the related motor vehicle for
	an amount equal to the stated purchase option price. If the
	lessee does not exercise this option, the vehicle is returned to
	a franchised dealer and the vehicle is offered for sale to the
	returning dealer through two branded internet sites,
	http://www.AudiDirect.com and http://www.VolkswagenDirect.com,
	at a price based on the Manheim Market Report Price (for Audi
	vehicles) and the VW Credit wholesale auction results (for
	Volkswagen vehicles), adjusted for mileage and excessive damage.
	If the dealer to which the vehicle is returned does not exercise
	its option to purchase the vehicle, then the vehicle is offered
	for sale on the two internet sites in an auction bidding
	environment. The

	Manheim Market Report Price

	of a vehicle is a price quoted in the Manheim Market Report, a
	publication that monitors and reports the pricing of all cars
	sold at Manheim Auctions, a large wholesale automobile auction
	company. Vehicles that are not purchased by the lessee or a
	dealer are returned to VW Credit for sale through auction. VW
	Credit uses a system of auto auctions throughout the United
	States. VW Credit has an internal target of 45 days from
	the time a vehicle is turned in until it is sold. Repossessions
	and early terminations are handled in accordance with various
	state requirements.






	     

	Remarketing decisions related to auction
	assignment and logistics are primarily electronic. This allows
	VW Credit to control inventory management, flow of vehicles to
	the auction and placement of the vehicles to auction locations
	that it believes will yield the highest net recovery value.






	     

	VW Credit has regular sales at 15 major auction
	locations throughout the United States. VW Credits highest
	lease volume is in the northeastern region. From time to time,
	auction capacity and demand for pre-owned vehicles in the
	northern markets may be insufficient to absorb the volume.
	Therefore, VW Credit may







	24








	Table of Contents





	transport vehicles to different regions where it
	perceives a greater demand in order to maximize the
	vehicles recovery values.







	     

	The Certified Pre-Owned Vehicle Program was
	established by Volkswagen of America to create customer and
	dealer demand for off-lease used Volkswagen and Audi vehicles
	and to enhance the value of off-lease vehicles. To qualify for
	the Certified Pre-Owned Vehicle Program, a vehicle must pass an
	inspection conducted by the related dealer based on standards
	set by Volkswagen of America. For Certified Pre-Owned vehicles,
	Volkswagen of America provides a limited warranty which covers
	the vehicle for a selected period of time and mileage. Each
	Certified Pre-Owned vehicle is covered by a roadside assistance
	program which is similar to that offered on new vehicles. The
	Certified Pre-Owned Vehicle Program is actively marketed by
	Volkswagen of America using, from time to time, both broadcast
	and print media.






	     

	Occasionally, VW Credit offers incentives to
	lease new vehicles to lessees whose lease contracts are nearing
	expiration. These incentives may include waiver of one or more
	monthly payments otherwise payable under the related lease for
	leases allocated to the Transaction SUBI. VW Credit will pay to
	the issuer the amount of any monthly payments so waived. These
	incentives may increase the turn-in rates for the related
	vehicles and increase the exposure of noteholders to residual
	risks.









	Insurance



	     

	Each lease contract requires the lessee to obtain
	and maintain vehicle liability and physical damage insurance on
	the leased vehicle. VW Credits dealer agreements include a
	requirement that the dealer provide VW Credit with written
	evidence that the lessee has physical damage and liability
	insurance which meets the requirements of the lease contract at
	the inception of the lease. The amount of insurance required by
	the lease contracts is at least equal to the amount required by
	applicable state law, subject to customary deductibles. VW
	Credit requires the policy to name the origination trust as
	additional insured with respect to liability and insured and
	loss payee with respect to physical damage. VW Credit currently
	monitors the ongoing status of insurance and attempts to cause
	the lessee to reinstate insurance in the event the lessee has
	allowed the policy to lapse; nevertheless, there can be no
	assurance that each leased vehicle will continue to be covered
	by liability and physical damage insurance for the entire term
	of the lease or that VW Credit will continue to monitor
	insurance while the notes remain outstanding. VW Credit does not
	force place insurance.


	     

	VW Credit does not require lessees to carry
	credit disability, credit life, credit health or other similar
	insurance coverage which provides for payments to be made on the
	leases on behalf of lessees in the event of disability or death.
	To the extent that the lessee obtains any of these insurance
	coverages, payments received on that coverage may, if permitted
	by applicable law, be applied to payments on the related lease
	to the extent that the lessees beneficiary chooses to do
	so.









	Collection and Repossession
	Procedures







	     

	There are three methods for lessees to make
	monthly lease payments. Most lessees mail payments, along with a
	statement, to one of three lockboxes. A small percentage of
	lessees use VW Credits automated payment option or make
	payments by telephone.






	     

	VW Credit measures delinquency by the number of
	days elapsed from the date a payment is due under the lease
	contract. VW Credit considers a payment to be past due or
	delinquent when a lessee fails to make at least 75% of a
	scheduled payment by the related due date. If a lease is between
	5 and 15 days delinquent, VW Credit mails a notice to the
	lessee and initiates telephone contact requesting payment. VW
	Credit gains collection efficiency through the use of technology
	such as automated dialing, predictive dialing and behavioral
	scoring of all lease accounts. If the delinquent lease cannot be
	brought current or completely collected within 60 to
	90 days, VW Credit generally assigns the vehicle to a
	repossession agent and attempts to repossess the related leased
	vehicle. VW Credit holds repossessed vehicles in inventory to
	comply with any applicable statutory requirements for
	reinstatement or redemption and then sells or otherwise disposes
	of the vehicles. VW Credits current policy is to generally
	charge off a lease contract on the earlier of (1) the date
	on which the proceeds of sale of the leased vehicle are applied
	to the lease contract and (2) the month in which the lease
	contract reaches its 120th day of delinquency if assigned to a
	repossession agent for 60 days. Any



	25








	Table of Contents









	deficiencies remaining after repossession and
	sale of the vehicle or after the full charge-off of the lease
	generally are pursued by or on behalf of VW Credit to the extent
	practicable and legally permitted. See Additional Legal
	Aspects of the Leases and the Leased Vehicles 
	Deficiency Judgments.


















	Extensions and Pull-Aheads











	     

	On occasion, VW Credit may extend the term of a
	lease if (1) the lessee requests an extension (2) the
	lessee is not in default of any of its obligations under the
	lease and (3) the lessee agrees to continue to make monthly
	payments. Lessees at the end of a lease who intend to lease
	another Volkswagen or Audi automobile but cannot do so at lease
	maturity, for reasons such as awaiting delivery of a new
	vehicle, preference for the next model year or other timing
	circumstances, may qualify for a lease term extension of up to a
	maximum of six months. In addition, in the future VW Credit may
	adopt incentive programs that encourage term extensions in
	connection with the lease of another Volkswagen or Audi
	automobile. If a term extension is granted for any Included Unit
	beyond the collection period preceding the final scheduled
	payment date for the Class A-4 notes (a

	Postmaturity Term Extension

	), VW Credit, as
	servicer, will be required to deposit into the collection
	account an amount equal to the Securitization Value of the
	Included Unit, at which time that Included Unit will be
	repurchased and will no longer constitutes a Transaction SUBI
	asset.










	     

	VW Credit, as servicer, may also permit a lessee
	to terminate a lease prior to its maturity in order to allow
	that lessee to enter into a new lease contract for a different
	Volkswagen or Audi vehicle as part of a pull-ahead
	or other marketing program. However, an early termination with
	respect to any lease allocated to the Transaction SUBI will not
	be permitted unless all Pull-Ahead Amounts due and payable by
	the lessee under that lease on or before the date of the
	lessees election to terminate the lease have been paid by
	or on behalf of the lessee and are deposited in the collection
	account within the time period required for the servicer to
	deposit collections into the collection account. Following this
	early termination, the servicer will charge the lessee any
	applicable excess wear and use charges and excess mileage
	charges in accordance with its customary servicing practices
	with respect to leases that are terminated early by the related
	lessee in the absence of a pull-ahead or other
	marketing program.










	     

	As used in this prospectus,

	Pull-Ahead
	Amount

	means, with respect to any vehicle allocated to
	the Transaction SUBI and the related lease, an amount equal to
	(a) the

	sum of

	(i) any due and unpaid payments
	under that lease

	plus

	(ii) the monthly payment
	amount times the number of monthly payments not yet due with
	respect to that lease

	minus

	(b) any unearned rent
	charges calculated under the scheduled actuarial method under
	that lease.













	Delinquency, Repossession and Loss
	Data







	     

	Set forth below is information concerning VW
	Credits experience with respect to its entire portfolio of
	new and used Volkswagen and Audi motor vehicle leases, which
	includes leases owned by VW Credit or the origination trust and
	leases that have been sold but are still being serviced by VW
	Credit. The dollar amounts of the leases outstanding is VW
	Credits book value. Credit losses are an expected cost in
	the business of extending credit and are considered in VW
	Credits rate-setting process. VW Credits strategy is
	to minimize credit losses while providing financing support for
	the sale of the motor vehicles.






	     

	For credit loss terminations, VW Credit charges
	off the account balance of a lease upon the related
	vehicles sale date.






	     

	Gains or losses associated with the sale of
	off-lease inventory also are recorded upon the vehicle sale
	date. Collections of end-of-term charges such as excess wear and
	use and excess mileage charges are credited when proceeds are
	received.






	     

	Delinquency, repossession and loss experience may
	be influenced by a variety of economic, social and geographic
	conditions and other factors beyond VW Credits control.
	There is no assurance that VW Credits delinquency,
	repossession and loss experience with respect to its leases and
	the related leased vehicles in the future, or the experience of
	the issuer with respect to the leases and the leased vehicles,
	will be similar to that set forth below.

	THE LEASES









	General







	     

	The leases allocated to the Transaction SUBI
	consist of motor vehicle retail closed-end leases for new
	Volkswagen and Audi motor vehicles. Each of the leases was
	originated by a dealer in the ordinary course of that
	dealers business and assigned to the origination trust.










	     

	Each lease in this transaction is a closed-end
	lease. Over the term of the lease, the lessee is required to
	make substantially equal monthly payments intended to cover the
	cost of financing the related leased vehicle, scheduled
	depreciation of the leased vehicle and certain sales, use or
	lease taxes. From each payment billed with respect to a leased
	vehicle, the monthly payment amount that represents the
	financing cost and depreciation of the leased vehicle (including
	any capitalized amounts, such as service contract premiums) will
	be available to the issuer to make payments in respect of the
	notes. At the scheduled end of the lease term, under the lease
	the lessee has two options:





















	 


	     

	(1) the lessee can purchase the leased
	vehicle for an amount (the

	maturity date purchase
	option amount

	) equal to the sum of (a) the
	purchase option amount specified in the lease, (b) the
	purchase option fee specified in the lease, if any, (c) any
	other fees and taxes related to the purchase of the leased
	vehicle and (d) any due and unpaid payments and other
	charges under the lease; or











	 










	 


	     

	(2) the lessee can return the leased vehicle
	to, or upon the order of, the lessor and pay an amount equal to
	(a) the turn-in fee, if any, specified in the lease,
	(b) any amounts assessed by the servicer as a result of
	excessive wear and use, excess mileage, taxes, parking tickets
	or fines and (c) any due and unpaid payments under the
	lease.















	     

	An amount equal to the sales proceeds from sales
	of leased vehicles to the lessees, dealers or at auction and all
	amounts assessed and collected by the servicer in connection
	with excessive wear and use and excess mileage charges upon
	return of the leased vehicles will be available to the issuer to
	make payments in respect of the notes. Because the leases are
	closed-end leases, the lessees will not be responsible for any
	amount by which the stated residual value of the leased vehicle
	exceeds the sales proceeds received for the leased vehicle at
	expiration of the lease.













	Early Termination







	     

	Each lease provides that the lessee or the lessor
	may terminate the lease before the scheduled end of the lease
	term (an

	early termination

	) in the
	circumstances discussed below. A lessee has the right to request
	an early termination provided that the lessee is not in default
	under the lease. In addition, in the future VW Credit may adopt
	incentive plans that encourage lessees to terminate leases
	before the related scheduled end of term. See
	VW Credit, Inc.  Extensions and
	Pull-Aheads. The lessee may purchase the leased vehicle
	for an amount equal to (x) the maturity date purchase
	option amount, plus (y) the monthly payment amount times
	the number of monthly payments not yet due with respect to
	related lease, minus (z) unearned rent charges calculated
	under the scheduled actuarial method under the lease.










	     

	In addition to purchasing the leased vehicle, a
	lessee has the right to cause an early termination by returning
	the leased vehicle to the lessor and pay an amount (an

	early termination amount

	) equal to
	(i) the turn-in fee, if any, specified in the lease, plus
	(ii) any due and unpaid payments under the lease, plus
	(iii) the costs of retaking, storing and selling the leased
	vehicle, plus (iv) any fees and taxes related to the early
	termination, plus (v) the monthly payment amount times the
	number of monthly payments not yet due with respect to related
	lease, minus (vi) unearned rent charges calculated under
	the scheduled actuarial method under the lease, minus
	(vii) the amount the leased vehicle sale price exceeds the
	purchase option amount, plus (viii) to the extent the purchase
	option amount exceeds the leased vehicle sale price, the lesser
	of (1) any amounts assessed by the servicer as a result of
	excessive wear and use or excess mileage, prorated annually, and
	(2) the amount by which the maturity date purchase option
	amount exceeds the leased vehicle sale price.







	30








	Table of Contents








	     

	The

	leased vehicle sale price

	of a leased vehicle is determined under the related lease
	pursuant to one or more of the following methods, as specified
	in the lease:















	 


	     

	(1) by agreement between the lessee and the
	lessor;





	 




	 


	     

	(2) by the disposition of the leased vehicle
	in a commercially reasonable manner;





	 




	 


	     

	(3) within ten days of the early
	termination, by an independent third-party appraiser acceptable
	to the lessee and the lessor and paid for by the lessee of the
	wholesale value of the leased vehicle that could be received at
	sale;





	 




	 


	     

	(4) if the leased vehicle is damaged,
	destroyed, stolen, abandoned or confiscated by any governmental
	authority, the leased vehicle is declared a total loss by the
	lessees insurance carriers, and the lessee has complied
	with the insurance requirements set forth in the lease at the
	time of the loss, the amount of the applicable insurance
	deductible owed by the lessee and the proceeds of the settlement
	of the insurance claim, unless the lessor agrees to a higher
	amount; or





	 




	 


	     

	(5) in some states, if the lessor elects to
	retain ownership of the leased vehicle for re-lease or other
	use, the wholesale value of the leased vehicle as specified in
	the current edition of the NADA Official Used Car Guide.





	     

	Each lease also allows the lessor to cause an
	early termination of the lease and repossess the related leased
	vehicle upon a lessee default. Events of default under a lease
	include, but are not limited to (1) the failure by a lessee
	to make a payment when due, (2) the failure of the lessee
	to provide truthful information on the credit application,
	(3) the failure of the lessee to timely or properly perform
	any obligation under the lease, or (4) the bankruptcy or
	other insolvency of the lessee.


	     

	If the lessor terminates a lease early due to a
	lessee default, the lessee will owe the early termination
	amount, including any reasonable attorneys fees and court
	costs, to the extent permitted by law.


	     

	The lessor may also cause an early termination of
	a lease if the related leased vehicle is damaged, destroyed,
	stolen, abandoned or confiscated by any governmental authority.
	If the lessor causes an early termination of the lease and the
	lessee has complied with the insurance requirements, paid the
	deductible and has satisfied all of the obligations under the
	lease, the lessor will accept the insurance loss proceeds as
	satisfaction in full of the lessees early termination
	amount. If the lessor causes an early termination and the lessee
	has not complied with the lease insurance requirements, has not
	paid the deductible or has not satisfied all of its obligations
	under the lease, the lessee will owe the lessor an amount equal
	to the difference between the early termination amount and any
	loss insurance proceeds received by the lessor with respect to
	the related leased vehicle.

	date, the Units in the statistical pool described in this
	prospectus had an aggregate Securitization Value of
	approximately $1,837,965,489.08. As of the cutoff date, the
	Units allocated to the Transaction SUBI are expected to have an
	aggregate initial Securitization Value of approximately
	$1,709,401,709.41.

	Calculation of the Securitization
	Value







	     

	Under the Servicing Agreement, the servicer will
	calculate a

	Securitization Value

	for each
	Included Unit equal to the following:






	 




	 




	 







	Calculation Date








	Securitization Value Formula

















	as of any date other than its maturity date:




	 




	the sum of the present values, calculated using a
	discount rate equal to the Securitization Rate, of (a) the
	aggregate monthly payments remaining on the lease (including
	monthly payments due but not yet paid) and (b) the Base
	Residual Value of the related leased vehicle and







	as of its maturity date:





	 




	the Base Residual Value of the related leased
	vehicle.







	     

	The Securitization Value of a Terminated Unit is
	equal to zero.


	     

	The Securitization Value represents the amount of
	financing that will be raised against each lease and the related
	leased vehicle. The Securitization Value will, at any given time
	during the term of the lease represent the principal amount of
	notes that can be amortized by the sum of the monthly payments
	due in respect of the leased vehicle over the remaining lease
	term, plus the Base Residual Value of the leased vehicle, in
	each case discounted at an annualized rate equal to the
	Securitization Rate.


	     


	Securitization
	Rate



	means, for any Included
	Unit, the greater of (a) the Minimum Discount Rate and
	(b) the implicit lease rate of such Unit.






	     

	The

	Minimum Discount Rate

	for
	purposes of presenting the pool information in this prospectus
	is deemed to be equal to 7.20%. The actual Minimum Discount Rate
	will equal the discount rate (rounded up to the nearest basis
	point) that, if used to calculate the Securitization Value of
	the Included Units as of the cutoff date, results in a weighted
	average yield (i.e., the weighted average internal rate of
	return) of the Included Units equal to the Required
	Securitization Yield.










	     


	Required Securitization
	Yield



	will equal the sum of
	(a) the Weighted Average Note Interest Rate,
	(b) the servicing fee rate, which is 1.00% and
	(c) 3.50%. The Weighted Average Note Interest Rate
	equals the sum of the Weighted Class Note Interest
	Rates for all classes of notes.










	     

	The

	Weighted
	Class Note Interest Rate

	means, for any
	class of notes, the rate per annum (rounded up to the nearest
	basis point) equal to the product of (a) (i) with respect
	to the Class A-1 notes, the Class A-2 notes, the
	Class A-3 notes and the Class A-4-A notes, the coupon
	interest rate per annum for such class of notes or
	(ii) with respect to the Class A-4-B notes, the fixed
	rate per annum payable to the swap counterparty for such class
	of notes, multiplied by (b) a fraction, the numerator of
	which is the Time Principal Product of such class of notes and
	the denominator of which is the sum of the Time Principal
	Products of all classes of







	33








	Table of Contents





	notes. The

	Time Principal
	Product

	of any class of notes is the product of
	(i) the weighted average life of such class of notes
	(assuming the exercise of any optional redemption and the 100%
	Prepayment Assumption described under

	Weighted Average
	Life of the Notes

	) multiplied by (ii) the initial
	aggregate principal amount of such class of notes.



	 



















	Calculation of Targeted Principal
	Distributable Amount















	     

	In connection with payments of principal to the
	noteholders, the servicer will calculate the Targeted Principal
	Distributable Amount for each payment date based on the
	reduction in the Securitization Value of the Included Units.










	     

	The

	Targeted Principal Distributable
	Amount

	for any payment date and the related collection
	period will equal the sum of the following amounts:















	 


	     

	(a) for each Included Unit that did not
	become a Terminated Unit during that collection period, the
	excess of the Securitization Value of the Included Unit at the
	beginning of that collection period over the Securitization
	Value at the end of that collection period,





	 




	 


	     

	(b) for each Included Unit that became a
	Terminated Unit during that collection period, the
	Securitization Value of the Included Unit as of the beginning of
	that collection period, and





	 




	 


	     

	(c) for each Included Unit the beneficial
	interest in which is repurchased by VW Credit on that payment
	date, the Securitization Value of the Included Unit at the
	beginning of that collection period.





	     

	A

	Terminated Unit

	is an
	Included Unit for which any of the following has occurred during
	a collection period:



















	 



	 




	the related leased vehicle was sold or otherwise
	disposed of by the servicer following (i) the related lease
	becoming a defaulted lease or (ii) the scheduled or early
	termination (including any early termination by the related
	lessee) of the related lease;











	 




	 



	 




	the related lease became a defaulted lease or the
	related lease terminated or expired more than 90 days prior
	to the end of that collection period and the related leased
	vehicle was not sold; or





	 




	 



	 




	the servicers records, in accordance with
	its customary servicing practices, disclose that all insurance
	proceeds expected to be received have been received by the
	servicer following a casualty or other loss with respect to the
	related leased vehicle.





	     

	A

	defaulted lease

	means a
	lease for which any of the following has occurred during a
	collection period:













	 



	 




	on which any payment is past due 90 or more days;





	 




	 



	 




	for which the related vehicle has been
	repossessed but which has not been charged off; or





	 




	 



	 




	which has been charged off in accordance with the
	servicers customary servicing practices.

	The Included Units will be identified in a
	schedule appearing as a schedule to the Transaction SUBI
	Supplement. In the SUBI Sale Agreement, VW Credit will make
	representations and warranties with respect to each lease and
	related leased vehicle, including, among other things, that each
	lease met the eligibility criteria described above under
	 Characteristics of the Units 
	Eligibility Criteria and Portfolio Characteristics as of
	the cutoff date. On the closing date, the transferor will assign
	all of its rights under the SUBI Sale Agreement to the issuer.










	     

	The SUBI Sale Agreement will also provide that if
	the Transaction SUBI trustee, VW Credit, the issuer,
	the indenture trustee or the transferor discovers a breach of
	any representation or warranty referred to in the preceding
	paragraph that materially and adversely affects the
	issuers interest in the related lease or leased vehicle,
	which breach is not cured in all material respects on or before
	the payment date related to the collection period in which the
	servicer discovers such incorrectness (either pursuant to notice
	or otherwise), the then applicable Unit will be reallocated to
	the UTI on the payment date related to that collection period.
	In connection with this reallocation, VW Credit will be required
	to deposit into the collection account a repurchase payment
	equal to the Securitization Value of the applicable Unit (the

	repurchase payment

	).










	     

	The repurchase payment must be made by
	VW Credit as of the payment date immediately following the
	day on which the related cure period ended. Upon making that
	payment, the related Unit will no longer constitute an Included
	Unit.













	MATURITY, PREPAYMENT AND YIELD
	CONSIDERATIONS










	General



	     

	The rate of payment of principal of the notes
	will depend on the rate of payments on the Included Units
	(including scheduled monthly payments on and prepayments and
	liquidations of the leases) and losses on the Included Units,
	which cannot be predicted with certainty.


	     

	A prepayment of a lease in full (including
	payment in respect of the stated residual value of the related
	leased vehicle) may be in the form of:













	 



	 




	net proceeds resulting from early lease
	terminations;





	 




	 



	 




	sales proceeds following a default under the
	lease; or





	 










	 



	 




	repurchase payments made by VW Credit.















	     

	The rate of prepayment on the leases may be
	influenced by a variety of economic, social and other factors,
	including the availability of competing lease programs and the
	conditions in the used motor vehicle market. In general,
	prepayments of leases will shorten the weighted average life of
	the notes, which is the average amount of time during which each
	dollar of the principal amount of a note is outstanding. As the
	rate of payment of principal on the notes will depend primarily
	on the rate of payment  including
	prepayments  of the leases, the final payment of
	principal of a class of notes could occur significantly earlier
	than the applicable final scheduled payment date. If lease
	prepayments cause the principal of a class of notes to be paid
	earlier than anticipated, the related noteholders will bear the
	risk of being able to reinvest principal payments at interest
	rates at least equal to the applicable interest rate.






	     

	Historical levels of lease delinquencies and
	defaults, leased vehicle repossessions and losses and residual
	value losses are discussed under VW Credit,
	Inc.  Delinquency, Repossession and Loss Data.
	VW Credit can give no assurances that the leases will
	experience the same rate of prepayment or default or any greater
	or lesser rate than VW Credits historical rate, or that
	the residual value experience of leased vehicles related to
	leases that are scheduled to reach their maturity dates will be
	the same as VW Credits historical residual value loss
	experience for all of the retail leases in its portfolio
	(including leases that VW Credit has sold to third parties but
	continues to service).

	Table of Contents




	     

	The effective yield on, and average life of, the
	notes will depend upon, among other things, the amount of
	scheduled and unscheduled payments on or in respect of the
	leases and related leased vehicles and the rate at which those
	payments are paid to the holders of notes. In the event of
	prepayments of the leases, noteholders who receive those amounts
	may be unable to reinvest the related payments received on their
	notes at yields as high as the related interest rate. The timing
	of changes in the rate of prepayments on the leases and payments
	in respect of the related leased vehicles may also significantly
	affect an investors actual yield to maturity and the
	average life of the notes. A substantial increase in the rate of
	payments on or in respect of the leases and related leased
	vehicles (including prepayments and liquidations of the leases)
	may shorten the final maturity of, and may significantly affect
	the yield on, the notes. See Risk Factors  The
	timing of principal payments is uncertain.


	     

	The yield to an investor who purchases notes in
	the secondary market at a price other than par will vary from
	the anticipated yield if the rate of prepayment on the leases is
	actually different than the rate the investor anticipates at the
	time it purchases the notes.


	     

	In sum, the following factors will affect an
	investors expected yield:











	 


	     

	(1) the price the investor paid for the
	related notes;





	 




	 


	     

	(2) the rate of prepayments, including
	losses, in respect of the leases and the related leased
	vehicles; and





	 




	 


	     

	(3) the investors assumed reinvestment
	rate.





	     

	These factors do not operate independently, but
	are interrelated. For example, if the rate of prepayments on the
	leases and the related leased vehicles is slower than
	anticipated, the investors yield will be lower if interest
	rates exceed the investors expectations and higher if
	interest rates fall below the investors expectations.
	Conversely, if the rate of prepayments on or in respect of the
	leases and the related leased vehicles is faster than
	anticipated, the investors yield will be higher if
	interest rates surpass the investors expectations and
	lower if interest rates fall below the investors
	expectations.






	     

	In addition, any notes outstanding will be paid
	in full if and when the transferor elects to purchase the
	Transaction SUBI from the issuer on any payment date when the
	aggregate unpaid principal amount of the notes is less than or
	equal to 10% of the initial principal amount of the notes. Any
	notes then outstanding at that time will be prepaid in whole at
	a redemption price equal to their unpaid principal amount plus
	accrued and unpaid interest.













	Weighted Average Life of the Notes



	     

	The following information is provided solely to
	illustrate the effect of prepayments of the leases and the
	related leased vehicles on the unpaid principal amounts of the
	notes and the weighted average life of the notes under the
	assumptions stated below, and is not a prediction of the
	prepayment rates that might actually be experienced with respect
	to the leases.


	     

	Prepayments on motor vehicle leases may be
	measured by a prepayment standard or model. The prepayment model
	used in this prospectus is expressed in terms of percentages of

	ABS,

	which means a prepayment model that
	assumes a constant percentage of the original number of leases
	in the pool prepay each month. The base prepayment assumption,
	which we refer to in this prospectus as the 

	100%
	Prepayment Assumption,

	assumes that the original
	principal balance of the leases will prepay as follows:

















	 


	     

	(1) In month one, prepayments will occur at
	0.033% ABS and increase by 0.033% ABS each month until reaching
	1.10% ABS in the 33rd month of the life of the lease.











	 










	 


	     

	(2) In month 34 through 36, prepayments
	remain at 1.10%.











	 










	 


	     

	(3) In month 37, prepayments decrease to
	0.75% ABS and remain at that level until the original
	outstanding principal balance of the contract has been paid in
	full.












	39








	Table of Contents




	     

	Neither any ABS rate nor the 100% Prepayment
	Assumption purports to be a historical description of the
	prepayment experience or a prediction of the anticipated rate of
	prepayment of the leases. We cannot assure you that the leases
	will prepay at the levels of the Prepayment Assumption or at any
	other rate.


	     

	The tables below were prepared on the basis of
	certain assumptions, including that:













	 



	 




	all monthly payments are timely received and no
	lease is ever delinquent;





	 




	 



	 




	each fiscal month of VW Credit is equivalent to a
	calendar month;





	 




	 



	 




	no repurchase payment is required to be made by
	VW Credit in respect of any Included Unit;





	 




	 



	 




	there are no losses in respect of the leases;





	 










	 



	 




	there are no termination payments due to the
	issuer or to the swap counterparty as a result of the
	termination of the interest rate swap transaction;











	 










	 



	 




	payments on the notes are made on the 20th day of
	each month, whether or not that day is a business day;











	 










	 



	 




	the servicing fee is 1.00% per annum and the
	administration fee (the

	administration fee

	)
	is $5,000 per collection period;











	 




	 



	 




	all prepayments on the leases are prepayments in
	full (and the residual values of the related leased vehicles are
	paid in full);





	 










	 



	 




	the reserve account is funded with an amount
	equal to $17,094,017.09;











	 










	 



	 




	the aggregate Securitization Value of the
	Included Units as of the cutoff date is $1,709,401,709.41, based
	on the Securitization Rate; and











	 










	 



	 




	the closing date (the

	closing
	date

	) is assumed to be September 29, 2004.











	     

	No representation is made as to what the actual
	levels of losses and delinquencies on the leases will be.
	Because payments on the leases and the leased vehicles will
	differ from those used in preparing the following tables,

	(1) 




	The weighted average life of the Class A-3
	notes is determined by (a) multiplying the amount of each
	distribution in reduction of principal amount by the number of
	years from the closing date to the date indicated,
	(b) adding the results and (c) dividing the sum by the
	aggregate distributions in reduction of principal amount
	referred to in clause (a).

	The weighted average life of the Class A-4-A

	(a) multiplying the amount of each distribution in
	reduction of principal amount by the number of years from the
	closing date to the date indicated, (b) adding the results
	and (c) dividing the sum by the aggregate distributions in
	reduction of principal amount referred to in clause (a).

	NOTE FACTORS AND TRADING INFORMATION



	     

	The

	note factor

	for a class of
	notes will be a seven-digit decimal that the servicer will
	compute for each payment date, which will represent the
	remaining outstanding principal amount of each class of notes as
	of that payment date (after giving effect to payments made on
	that payment date), expressed as a fraction of the initial
	outstanding principal amount of that class of notes. Each note
	factor will initially be 1.0000000, and will thereafter decline
	to reflect reductions in the principal amount of the related
	class of notes. A noteholders portion of the principal
	amount of the notes will be the product of (i) the original
	denomination of the note and (ii) the applicable note
	factor.

The Bay Area’s Go-To Source for Volkswagen Parts
At Capitol Volkswagen, we love working on Volkswagen cars. And, while we’re happy to serve people who either do not want to perform their own auto repairs and car service, don’t know how, or don’t have the time; we completely understand how many drivers want to do it themselves. For some, there’s nothing so rewarding as getting some grease on their hands. To help, Capitol Volkswagen, located at 911 Capitol Expressway Auto Mall, San Jose, CA, carries all of the Volkswagen car parts you might need – from the oil filters to the windshield wiper blades to the batteries to the tires to the brake pads and more. If you need help determining exactly what you need to do the job right, just ask. And if, for some strange reason, we don’t have exactly what you’re looking for, we’re happy to special order it right away.

Please use the buttons below to order parts or contact our parts department. We can be reached by phone at 888-407-2472.

Read more Volkswagen history



Volkswagen is an automaker based in Germany. Its products typically command a higher price than those of competing models, but the return is a more upscale driving and ownership experience.
In 1934, Ferdinand Porsche was commissioned to build a small, inexpensive car at the request of Adolph Hitler. His answer -- a beetle-shaped sedan that was called a Volkswagen (German for "people's car") -- debuted two years later. Hitler had a town built near the plant for factory workers; he named it Kraft durch Freude Stadt (derived from the Nazi party's motto, "Joy through Strength"), and soon decided that Porsche's creation should be named the KdF-wagen (short for the "Joy through Strength" car). This upset Porsche, who was not political.
World War II delayed production of the vehicle; the factory suffered extensive damage during combat, and was ultimately taken over by the British Army. The company was renamed Volkswagen, and the town at the factory was renamed Wolfsburg (after Werner von Schulenberg of Wolfsburg, who had been forced to surrender his land for the construction of the town and factory). By the end of the 1940s, mass production of the Volkswagen Beetle had begun. The model made its first appearance on U.S. shores in 1949.
The 1950s saw Volkswagen broadening its product range, adding the Bus (Type 2) to its lineup. The Bus, especially, proved quite popular due to its versatility. And the Beetle, which went on to become the best-selling car of all time, quickly showed signs of being an enduring favorite, with more than 1 million models produced at the Wolfsburg factory by 1955. This decade also saw the debut of the Karmann Ghia sports car, which featured a sleek, Italian-designed two-seater body atop a Beetle platform.
Volkswagen's star rose during the 1960s, its success fueled largely by the breakout success of the Beetle. The car benefited from an effective advertising campaign and from an appearance in a popular Disney movie. By the close of the decade, Volkswagen's yearly output of Beetles topped the 1 million mark.
In 1972, with more than 15 million units assembled, the Beetle topped the world production record set by Ford's Model T. Mid-decade saw the launch of a new era of Volkswagens that had front-mounted, water-cooled engines driving the front wheels. The Passat (Dasher in the U.S.) was the first of the new breed and was built using standardized components that could be used interchangeably among other models in the manufacturer's lineup. The Passat was soon joined by the Golf (Rabbit in the U.S.), which met with immediate success. By the end of the decade, the manufacturer's lineup had grown to include the Scirocco sport coupe and the performance-oriented Golf/Rabbit GTI. The Beetle, however, was discontinued for the U.S. market.
The Golf grew in popularity during the '80s, becoming Volkswagen's most popular model. When a second generation of the car was built in 1983, it was crafted in a mostly automated process using robots -- marking the first time robots had been used in vehicle manufacture. By the mid-'80s, the U.S. version traded the Rabbit name for "Golf." The higher-performance Golf GTI helped the manufacturer make waves on the rally circuit. In 1986, Volkswagen Motorsport nabbed the title of Group A World Rally Champions.
Volkswagen saw its sales in the North American market tumble during the early '90s, but by the end of the decade, refocused marketing efforts and an increased emphasis on new products had brought about a turnaround in the company's fortunes. The popular New Beetle helped put the company back on the radar in the United States (though it fared less successfully in European markets). The body style was based on the classic Beetle, and it struck a chord with consumers who still had a place in their hearts for the iconic, cheerful-looking "love bug."
The new millennium saw Volkswagen moving into the luxury segment with the launch of the pricey Phaeton sedan and Touareg SUV. Though well-designed and executed, the Phaeton was a disappointment sales-wise, perhaps signaling unwillingness on the part of consumers to shell out premium dollars for a brand that lacks the cachet of established upscale names like BMW and Mercedes-Benz.
Luckily, Volkswagen has seen success with other vehicles in its lineup, which currently includes everything from family-oriented sedans to roomy SUVs. Today, the automaker enjoys a reputation for crafting vehicles that offer refined handling and upscale accommodations.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
