Don C Stark's Experience
Title: Director
               Company: Immunomedics , Inc.
Job Details
               Immunomedics is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing monoclonal antibody-based products for the targeted treatment of cancer, autoimmune disorders and other serious diseases. Immunomedics advanced proprietary technologies allow the Company to create humanized antibodies that can be used either alone in unlabeled or naked form, or conjugated with radioactive isotopes, chemotherapeutics, cytokines or toxins. Using these technologies, Immunomedics has built a pipeline of eight clinical-stage product candidates. Immunomedics portfolio of investigational products includes antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) that are designed to deliver a specific payload of a chemotherapeutic directly to the tumor while reducing overall toxic effects that are usually found with conventional administration of these chemotherapeutic agents. Immunomedics most advanced ADCs are sacituzumab govitecan (IMMU-132) and labetuzumab govitecan (IMMU-130), which are in Phase 2 trials for a number of solid tumors and metastatic colorectal cancer, respectively. IMMU-132 has received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from FDA for the treatment of patients with triple-negative breast cancer who have failed at least 2 prior therapies for metastatic disease. Immunomedics has a research collaboration with Bayer to study epratuzumab as a thorium-227-labeled antibody. Immunomedics has other ongoing collaborations in oncology with independent cancer study groups. The IntreALL Inter-European study group is conducting a large, randomized Phase 3 trial combining epratuzumab with chemotherapy in children with relapsed acute lymphoblastic leukemia at clinical sites in Australia, Europe, and Israel. Immunomedics also has a number of other product candidates that target solid tumors and hematologic malignancies, as well as other diseases, in various stages of clinical and preclinical development. These include combination therapies involving its antibody-drug conjugates, bispecific antibodies targeting cancers and infectious diseases as T-cell redirecting immunotherapies, as well as bispecific antibodies for next-generation cancer and autoimmune disease therapies, created using its patented DOCK-AND-LOCK protein conjugation technology. The Company believes that its portfolio of intellectual property, which includes approximately 286 active patents in the United States and more than 400 foreign patents, protects its product candidates and technologies.
Title: Chairman
               Company: Turks and Caicos Reef Fund
Job Details
               Since 2012, the Turks & Caicos Reef Fund has been the lead non-governmental organization for the installation and maintenance of dive boat, snorkel boat and yacht moorings throughout the Turks & Caicos Islands under the terms of a Memorandum of Understanding with the Department of Environment and Maritime Affairs (DEMA). DEMA is the local governmental agency responsible for maintaining the marine protected areas in the TCI as well as all other environmental issues. As of September 2015, we have installed 67 proper sea floor anchors (no more chains wrapped around coral heads!) and mooring lines for dive boat moorings, 16 snorkel boat moorings and 5 yacht moorings - 21 of the dive moorings and all snorkel and yacht moorings are brand new sites. The donations from divers, snorkelers and other visitors to these islands are needed to continue this project, so please help!
