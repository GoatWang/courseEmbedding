Strategic Alpha Fund



Select a Fund  


  Overview PerformanceY shares are only available to certain institutional investors. Please click here for other share classes.Overview



The Strategic Alpha Fund seeks to provide an attractive absolute total return, complemented by prudent investment management designed to manage risks and protect investor capital. The secondary goal of the Fund is to achieve these returns with relatively low volatility

Frequent portfolio turnover may result in increased tax liabilities, which will reduce your overall return from the Fund.
 

 Primary Benchmark: BoA Merrill Lynch US Dollar 3-month LIBOR Constant Maturity�Portfolio ManagementMatt Eagan, CFAKevin KearnsTodd Vandam, CFATotal Fund Assets (as of 6/30/2017): $1.2 billionLipper Category: Absolute Return categoryMorningstar Category: Nontraditional BondStrategy Highlights

The strategy combines the features of a traditional bond fund and an alternative investment to create an all-weather solution.
Unconstrained by market benchmarks, this absolute return oriented strategy has the flexibility to invest in opportunities across the global fixed income landscape, as well as use derivative instruments. This mobility enables the team to respond tactically to shifting economic environments and market events.
The strategy targets risk levels between 4% and 6%* to help dampen volatility and to help hedge against global events that influence fixed-income markets.
Portfolio average duration may range between -2 to 5 years 
 *Although the fund actively manages risk for a 4% to 6% standard deviation level, there is no guarantee that the fund will always maintain its targeted risk level.
Investment Strategy
Total long or short exposure will not exceed 100% short & 100% long on a notional basis* 
May invest up to 50% of net exposure in non-dollar currency
May invest up to 20% of net exposure in emerging markets currency 
May invest up to 50% of net exposure in below investment grade, fixed income securities 
*Limits shown are net long or short as a % of total long exposure and exclude the use of futures and related options. 
About Risk
Fixed income securities may carry one or more of the following risks: credit, interest rate (as interest rates rise bond prices usually fall), inflation and liquidity. 
Below investment grade fixed income securities may be subject to greater risks (including the risk of default) than other fixed income securities. 
Currency exchange rates between the US dollar and foreign currencies may cause the value of the fund’s investments to decline. 
Derivatives involve risk of loss and may entail additional risks. Because derivatives depend on the performance of an underlying asset, they can be highly volatile and are subject to market and credit risks. 
Foreign and emerging market securities may be subject to greater political, economic, environmental, credit, currency and information risks. Foreign securities may be subject to higher volatility than US securities due to varying degrees of regulation and limited liquidity. These risks are magnified in emerging markets. 
Mortgage-related and asset-backed securities are subject to the risks of the mortgages and assets underlying the securities. Other related risks include prepayment risk, which is the risk that the securities may be prepaid, potentially resulting in the reinvestment of the prepaid amounts into securities with lower yields. 
Commodity-related investments, including derivatives, may be affected by a number of factors including commodity prices, world events, import controls and economic conditions, and therefore may involve substantial risk of loss. 
Non-diversified funds invest a greater portion of assets in fewer securities and therefore may be more vulnerable to adverse changes in the market.
   
1As of the most recent prospectus, the investment advisor has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses once the expense cap of the fund has been exceeded. This arrangement is set to expire on 4/30/19. When an expense cap has not been exceeded, the fund may have similar expense ratios and/or yields.LIBOR stands for London Interbank Offered Rate, the rate of interest at which banks offer to lend money to one another. It is a standard financial index used in US capital markets. Indexes are unmanaged and do not incur fees.  It is not possible to invest directly in an index.
