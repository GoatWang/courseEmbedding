Abba David Poliakoff
Abba David Poliakoff
Member
Gordon Feinblatt LLC
Abba David Poliakoff’s career as an attorney has taken him from Washington, D.C., to Wall Street, but Baltimore is where his heart is and where the fruits of his business law practice and community service continue to grow.
“My greatest accomplishment is helping to plant the seeds of an idea, grow it into a viable company, produce a product or technology, develop into a business, and burst into a wild and phenomenal success for the entrepreneurs and for the investors,” said Poliakoff, who is chairman of the Securities Practice Group and Israel Practice Group for Gordon Feinblatt, LLC.
When he’s not advising clients at his Baltimore office, Poliakoff serves in a governor-appointed role as co-chair of the Regulatory Reform Commission of Maryland, and sits on the boards of more than 10 organizations, including the University of Maryland School of Medicine, Levindale Hebrew Geriatric Center and Hospital Inc., Champions Oncology Inc., and the Baltimore Jewish Council, where he is first vice president.
During his tenure as board chairman of The Maryland/Israel Development Center, Poliakoff proudly worked to establish Maryland as a principal destination for Israeli companies, and to provide Maryland businesses with opportunities in Israel, he said. He received the Hanan Sibel Maryland/Israel Business Leadership Award in 2014.
Poliakoff’s family has lived in Baltimore for six generations—“four generations before, and two forward,” he said.
“I feel like I have an obligation to my community and my city,” Poliakoff said. “I need to pay back the benefits I receive and make sure this is a place where my children and grandchildren want to continue to live in.”

How do I choose a lawyer?Consider the following: 
Comfort Level - Are you comfortable telling the lawyer personal
information? Does the lawyer seem interested in solving your problem? 
Credentials - How long has the lawyer been in practice? Has
the lawyer worked on other cases similar to yours? 
Cost - How are the lawyer's fees structured - hourly or flat
fee? Can the lawyer estimate the cost of your case? 
City - Is the lawyer's office conveniently located?
Not sure what questions to ask a lawyer?Here are a few to get you started:

How long have you been in practice?
How many cases like mine have you handled?
How often do you settle cases out of court?
What are your fees and costs?
What are the next steps?

Want to check lawyer discipline?Research
