                        Jerre and Mary Joy Stead Center for Ethics and Values                    






An endowed center, the Jerre L. and Mary Joy Stead Center for Ethics and Values (Stead Center) draws together seminary resources, graduate professional schools, area pastors, and laity to address the compelling ethical issues facing contemporary society; e.g., technological interventions at the beginning and ending of life; war and religion; the plight of children in the cities; the environment; and human experimentation. It seeks to bring a theological perspective to these issues of ecumenical and international scope. Special lecture series and seminars are among the settings which will bring religious communities, seminary scholars, and university colleagues together with the Garrett-Evangelical community.
The mission of the Stead Center is to promote teaching and research along a range of theological topics and moral issues. It is committed to drawing upon and promoting thoughtful conversation among the church, academy, and society in a manner in which no sharp distinction is drawn between “theory” and “practice.” Or stated more prosaically, the Stead Center is dedicated to the proposition that there is nothing more practical than a good idea, and nothing more ideal than good practice.
The purpose of the Stead Center is to promote the teaching and research of ethics and values, utilizing the following methods:
Offering curricular courses at Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary
Offering or assisting non-curricular instruction and continuing education courses at Garrett-Evangelical Theological Seminary and other locales
Sponsoring or promoting public lectures, conferences, symposia, forums, and other educational events
Initiating, conducting, and supporting research that promotes the mission of the Stead Center
Convening invitational consultations
Developing and distributing educational resources that are pertinent to the Stead Center’s mission and audiences

About Jerre L. and Mary Joy Stead 
“We try to give where we can make the most difference and we believe that Garrett-Evangelical is making a big difference in preparing the kind of leadership our churches need."
- Jerre Stead

 
Jerre and Mary Joy Stead were raised in Maquoketa, Iowa, where they met in 1957. They were married in 1961 and have raised two children. Their life together has been one of remarkable achievement and commitment to church, family, and effective philanthropy. Garrett-Evangelical has been fortunate to have the benefit of the Steads’ vision and generosity.
Jerre Stead earned his bachelor’s degree in business administration from the University of Iowa in 1965. In 1987, after 21 years of management experience at Honeywell, Inc., he joined Square D Company of Palatine, Illinois, as president and chief operating officer and chairman of the board. In 1991, Jerre became president and chief executive officer of AT&T’s business products division, where he engineered a dramatic turnaround of the division. He was named chairman and chief executive officer of AT&T/NCR in 1993. In 1995, Jerre became chairman and chief executive officer of Legent Corporation in Herndon, Virginia, where he was instrumental in completing a successful merger with Computer Associates. In 1996, he joined Ingram Micro, the world’s largest distributor of technology products, as the chief executive officer with a proven track record, great vision, and global expertise. In 2000, after retiring from Ingram Micro, he became executive chairman of IHS Inc., a global information company offering expertise in the areas of energy, economics, geopolitical risk, sustainability and supply-chain management. Jerre assumed the additional role of CEO for IHS Inc. on September 20, 2006, which he maintained until June of 2013. He now serves as Executive Chairman of the company.
Throughout his business life, Jerre Stead has been admired and respected for his transformational leadership style and a deep commitment to a strong code of values. He is co-author with James A. Belasco of Soaring with the Phoenix: Renewing the Vision, Reviving the Spirit, and Re-creating the Success of Your Company. He has served as a trustee at Garrett-Evangelical since 1991 and currently serves as chair of the board of trustees and co-chair of the seminary’s Forging Our Future: Phase Three capital campaign.
Mary Joy has been up to the challenges dictated by Jerre’s high profile and demanding career. Although she has not sought the limelight, she has been a full and indispensable partner in the couple’s life decisions and philanthropic endeavors. She is active in church affairs, an avid golfer (along with Jerre), and a licensed airplane pilot. Family has always been at the center of the Stead’s life and a primary goal for both Steads is to fulfill their roles as parents and grandparents. Jerre and Mary Joy have lived their lives as a shared commitment to helping others.
In 1996, Jerre and Mary Joy set the pace for the Bold Leaders for a New World campaign through a major lead gift. Then in 1997, they doubled that commitment. Their gifts have endowed the Jerre L. and Mary Joy Stead Center for Ethics and Values and the Jerre L. and Mary Joy Stead Chair of Christian Social Ethics, a position which ensures that Garrett-Evangelical will always have a faculty person who teaches Christian Social Ethics and directs the work of the Stead Center. In addition, it was announced at the seminary’s board of trustees meeting on May 12, 2011, that Jerre and Mary Joy had made a commitment of $5 million to Garrett-Evangelical’s unrestricted endowment. In announcing this most recent commitment, Mr. Stead challenged the other trustees to match his gift and help lead the way in reaching the $100 million Forging our Future Phase Three campaign goal by addressing the largest component of the campaign—building the seminary’s unrestricted endowment. In response to this generous gift from the Steads, the board of trustees voted unanimously to rename Lesemann Hall as the Jerre and Mary Joy Stead Hall. The Steads also had made an earlier campaign commitment to endow three full-tuition plus stipend scholarships for students at the seminary.

Jerre Stead**Board of Visitors Lifetime MemberBoard of VisitorsBiographyJerre L. Stead became Executive Chairman of IHS Inc. December 1, 2000. He led IHS to a very successful IPO in November 2005. IHS is the global leader in its industry. He served as chairman and CEO from September 2006 to June 2013, when he returned to executive chairman. IHS has provided its shareowners a 31 percent CAGR since its IPO. The company has grown from $470 million to $2.2 billion since going public.
He joined Ingram Micro in 1996 as Chairman and CEO with a proven track record and is characterized as having great vision and global expertise. Mr. Stead took Ingram Micro public on November 1, 1996, which, at that time, was the largest IPO in history for a technology company. Under his leadership Ingram Micro grew from an $8 billion dollar company to a $30 billion dollar company doing business in over 120 countries. The company was number 41 in the Fortune 500 for the year 2000.
Mr. Stead began his career in 1965 at Honeywell, Inc., where he spent 21 years and held a number of executive management positions in the United States and Europe.

One evening last September, when the devastating scope of destruction from Colorado’s floods became apparent, business executive Jerre Stead got a call from the governor’s office. Would Mr. Stead, asked a staffer, be willing to talk to the governor about becoming  chief recovery officer to manage post-flood rebuilding?
Stead pondered the offer — and made his decision after a startling wildlife encounter that he took as a sign. More on that later.
But the decision was never really in doubt. Stead — rhymes with “bread” — has never backed away from a challenge, business or civic.
The executive chairman of Douglas County-based information purveyor IHS Inc. is a renowned corporate turnaround artist whose résumé is a list of one business success after another.
For recognition of his achievements at IHS and for directing flood recovery, Stead has been named 2013 Business Person of the Year by The Denver Post.
During his 13-year tenure at IHS, Stead launched one of Colorado’s most successful initial public stock offerings and routinely posts impressive results in revenue, net income and shareholder return.
If a savvy investor had purchased $10,000 of IHS stock on the first day of the 2005 offering, it would be worth about $73,000 today.
IHS provides data and strategic information to clients in energy, product life cycle, security and environment. Sales have jumped from $476 million in 2005 to what analysts project will be $2.2 billion this fiscal year.
But in addition to running one of Colorado’s largest and fastest-growing public companies, Stead has earned acclaim for getting Colorado back on its feet much sooner than was believed possible after flooding damaged or destroyed more than 20,000 homes and 200 miles of roads.


“One of the things that make thriving communities are people who step up like this,” said Gov. John Hickenlooper. “Jerre is a perfect example.”
Stead personifies energy on a corporate and personal level. On the eve of his 71st birthday, he works a schedule that would wear out many executives half his age.
Here’s a typical day: Up at 3:30 a.m. Floor exercises for 20 minutes. Another 20 minutes of meditation and reading. Check e-mail. Go out for a pre-dawn run of 4 or 5 miles around the Inverness Business Park.
“I know all the security guards around here pretty well,” Stead says.
Then he’s into the Inverness headquarters of IHS before almost anyone else arrives. Works a long day, followed as likely as not by an evening event for one of the many charities he supports.
Stead’s selection as Business Person of the Year is “an excellent choice,” said Denver venture capitalist Steve Halstedt of Centennial Ventures. Halstedt is chairman of OpenWorld Learning, a Denver-based nonprofit that promotes child education. Stead and his wife, Mary Joy, are major supporters.
“I cannot say enough good things about their active involvement and their commitment to kids, to technology education and to providing opportunities for those less blessed than themselves,” Halstedt said.
Stead in 2013  stepped down as chief executive of IHS in a planned succession but remains the firm’s executive chairman. In 2012, the last year in which he worked as a full-time CEO, his total compensation was $5.1 million — a handsome paycheck but still ranking only 37th among the highest-paid executives of Colorado-based companies.
Yet Stead disdains an extravagant lifestyle, choosing instead to use years of CEO salaries and stock awards to maximize his philanthropic gifts. Among them: $25 million to the University of Iowa college of business, $20 million to the university’s department of pediatrics, $10 million to a Methodist seminary in Illinois and $9 million to Alzheimer’s research.
Among Stead’s fans is business legend Michael Armstrong, the former CEO and chairman of AT&T, who now serves as the lead independent director on the IHS board.
Armstrong recalls that years ago, IHS compiled business data and sent it to clients on microfiche — a now-archaic technology that compiled pages of text on photographic film.
“Here was a private company that was very low-tech, didn’t innovate, didn’t create,” he said. “Now, Jerre has turned that into what is today high-tech, high-growth, one of the most successful companies on the New York Stock Exchange.”
Under Stead’s watch, IHS has grown internally and by acquiring nearly 60 companies.  Some of the most notable acquisitions are R.L. Polk & Co., Cambridge Energy Research Associates, Global Insights and Jane’s Information Group.
Corporate acquisitions don’t always work out. Armstrong notes that spectacular implosions such as Enron and WorldCom were caused in part by unsuccessful acquisitions.
“But Jerre has done successful acquisitions,” Armstrong said. “Every single one we did, we integrated into one brand, one management system, one market strategy.”
Armstrong said IHS’s directors were unanimous in their support of Stead accepting Hickenlooper’s request to become chief recovery officer even as Stead was spending plenty of time helping Scott Key ease into his new position as CEO of IHS.
Stead himself knew it was the right step to take, but the decision was affirmed in an unusual way.
On the morning after Hickenlooper’s office made the phone call, Stead decided to think it over during a characteristic early-morning run, this time from his vacation home in Scottsdale, Ariz.
Stead walked out the back door and suddenly saw a bobcat holding in its jaws a dead rabbit on top of the adobe wall bordering the home.
Momentarily startled, Stead took a step back and fell into his swimming pool.
“It’s what I call a ‘God wink.’ The floods, the swimming pool, getting wet — it all kind of came together,” Stead said. “That sealed my decision.”
Hickenlooper’s chief of staff, Roxane White, has known Stead for years.
Flood-recovery efforts, she noted, have resulted from the efforts of thousands of people and dozens of agencies.
“Not to take away from anybody’s individual role, but coordinating all those functions and bringing everyone together, you really need someone like Jerre Stead,” she said. “The thing with Jerre is that when he commits, he commits 110 percent.
“He’s one of the most powerful executives I know, yet he’s one of the nicest and most compatible people I’ve ever met.”

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
