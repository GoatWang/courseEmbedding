Inside Vanguard Moto Inc., a Motorcycle Building Startup at The Brooklyn Navy Yards

Inside the factory of Vanguard Moto, in the Brooklyn Navy Yard
While the heydays of traditional manufacturing in Brooklyn are long gone and many of the old warehouses and factories have now been converted into lofts and artist space, a more urban, high tech version of manufacturing still exists in the city. Once one of the nation’s most prolific ship manufacturing facilities, today the Brooklyn Navy Yards is a nationally acclaimed industrial park that serves as a model for modern, industrial development. The Yard is home to over 330 diverse businesses, employing over 7,000 people and generating over $2 billion in annual economic revenue.




The Brooklyn Navy Yards, also known as the The United States Navy Yard, and the New York Naval Shipyard, first started off as a facility for manufacturing merchant vessels after the Revolutionary War. Then, in 1801 it was purchased by the U.S Navy, and became an active Navy shipyard in 1806. Throughout the years the Yard produced some of the countries preeminent battle ships, including USS Maine and USS Arizona. The Navy Yard was decommissioned in 1966 as part of a project that sought to reduce costs through the closure of unneeded military facilities. While the government initially refused to sell the Yard to the city, the facility was ultimately sold 18 months later during the Nixon administration. The Yard was leased by Seatrain Shipbuilding for a brief period, before the era of ship building in Brooklyn came to an end in 1979.
Atop Rooftop Reds in the Brooklyn Navy Yard
Today the Brooklyn Navy Yard has become a bustling mecca of innovative manufacturing and tech startups in New York City. The businesses that are based in the Yard include Brooklyn Grange, a sprawling 65,000 sq. ft rooftop urban farm that employs sustainable agriculture methods; Rooftop Reds, the world’s first commercially viable rooftop vineyard; Crye Precision, which makes an assortment of gear to protect soldiers in combat – including boxers with Kevlar panels to protect the genitals and inner thighs; Duggal, a printing company which has recently expanded into tech manufacturing with street lights powered by solar panels and wind turbines. Another fascinating and exciting startup that we recently visited is the innovative motorcycle startup Vanguard Moto Inc. We sat down with David Wax from Vanguard to discuss the incentives behind the start up and the company’s prospect.




Vanguard Moto Inc. is a premium motorcycle design and manufacturing company looking to “disrupt the premium motorcycle market with their contemporary design and modular assembly process.” The company was founded by entrepreneur and former consultant and supply chain expert Francois-Xavier Terny, and motorcycle designer and engineer Edward Jacobs. Both men were involved in the motorcycle market, where they saw “a gap in the motorcycle market in the premium segment,” according to David Wax. Jacobs and Terny believed that there are no real options in the premium range (between $30,000 and $50,000). “The only motorcycles you could buy are $15k-$20k motorcycles with $15k-$20k of accessories strapped to them.” Vanguard’s motorcycle is estimated to cost $30,000 of purely design and bike components, rather than accessories.

Jacobs, who also had some new contemporary ideas for motorcycles, formed Vanguard Moto Inc. in 2013 with Terny. Today Vanguard has a working prototype that they have tested. The prototype is a testament to the contemporary design that Vanguard strives for. As Wax says, “rather than put plastic around the motorcycle to make it look nice, we’re actually designing the motorcycle to look nice in its purest form.”

The bike has a fully digital dash port, and LED lights that are integrated into the bike and articulate out of the bike. Unlike most bikes which utilize a chain to power the back wheel, Vanguard’s design employs a shaft. The designers also opted to forgo the traditional exhaust design in favor of one that is integrated into the crank case. Wax says, “the idea was to not have the exhaust as a design element.” Another feature of the bike is its modular assembly. The bike consists of three parts that can be assembled with five bolts and three electrical connectors. The result of this contemporary design is an innovative bike that has $30,000 worth of pure, essential design components.

Vanguard is currently in the process of making some modifications and refinements to their prototype, which they were able to test-ride around the streets of the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The estimated start of production for the bikes is mid-2018. Manufacturing work will take place in the Navy Yard, and Wax says, “Right now we have space reserved at facilities just over there [in another building in the Yard] for full production manufacturing.”

Finally when asked why they chose the Navy Yards as their startup’s venue, Wax says, “You have some of the best design and business minds in the world. You also have a facility that is set up specifically for this [manufacturing and startups].”
Wax further praises the Navy Yard, saying “The Navy Yards really makes this possible. If it wasn’t for the Navy Yards we’d have to be located somewhere else. The Navy Yard is very friendly for what we’re doing.”

Vanguard Moto Inc.
New Motorcycle Brand


Company Information

Website:
http://www.vanguard.nyc 
Sector:
Other Transportation
Location:
Brooklyn, NY



Designed, engineered and built in New York City, Vanguard Moto is a premium motorcycle company.
It's looking to disrupt the premium motorcycle market with a contemporary design and a modular assembly process.
The key to the Vanguard motorcycle is its modular design. Its patent-pending modular assembly process has redefined motorcycle manufacturing. The modular design allows Vanguard to create three different motorcycles from one common platform.
Vanguard was born from the meeting of Edward Jacobs, a recognized motorcycle designer and engineer, and Francois-Xavier Terny, an entrepreneur and former consultant, expert in supply chain and cost optimization.  
The premium motorcycle segment is a $3 billion market worldwide characterized by growth, high margin and resilience. The market is not properly addressed by incumbents who essentially soup-up their mass models and sell them at premium prices (between $25 and $40k). 
Starting at $30,000, Vanguard offers the rider a strong alternative to current premium motorcycles from established manufacturers. 
As Steve Radt, Owner, Ducati Triumph Dealership in New York, said: "I am the General Manager and Owner of Ducati Triumph New York. Our dealership has had a relationship with Vanguard since the Company’s founding. We have seen the motorcycle designs and are confident that the new brand has great potential for success in the market. Mototainment looks forward to becoming one of the first dealers to carry the brand. Not only is the brand positioning itself in the growing market for premium motorcycles, but Vanguard offers an attractive unique design and a “Made in New York” message. We have a strong inclination that Vanguard’s offering will resonate well with our customers."
Francois-Xavier and Edward began incubating the Vanguard journey in 2013.  The concept and the prototype were financed through founders' equity and seed capital.  Vanguard needs your help to get to the next step.


Team Background
Edward Jacobs - CTO
Edward Jacobs studied architecture and industrial design at Pratt Institute in New York City before interning at design studios in Austria. 
Upon completion of his post graduate studies, he spent two years with Oasis designing for architectural firms. 
He joined Confederate Motorcycles in 2005, designing and engineering some of the most acclaimed motorcycles. 
He quit in 2011 to open up his own design studio in NYC, before co-founding Vanguard.
Francois-Xavier Terny - CEO
Francois-Xavier began his professional career in 1991 with Bain & Company.
He then created his own consulting firm, Masaï, in 1996 as a firm specializing in industrial cost optimization. 
In 2006, having reached $25 million with 100 professionals in 12 offices in Europe, US, Japan, China and India, he accepted a competitor’s offer to be acquired. 
Since then, he has been a Board advisor, General Manager and Investor to various companies, including a motorcycle company. 
He worked in Private Equity, at an established family office in NYC before co-founding Vanguard.
He earned his degree from HEC Paris.

Layer opened.Read the transcript







Liz Tammaro: So we received quite a few questions in advance when you all registered for this webcast. We're going to get started with our first question and, Jim, I'm going to give this one to you. So it makes a lot of sense before we get started, let's define what is an ETF. Jim Rowley: Simply put, an ETF is an exchange-traded fund, right− It's a pooled investment vehicle that acquires or disposes of securities. Investors own a pro rata share of the assets in that fund. The fund issues new shares or redeems existing shares to meet investor demand. Furthermore, and I should say providing some type of an investment exposure to those advisors, whether it's an index in particular or a market strategy. And when you think about even more so what makes them similar to mutual funds is that the majority of ETFs are organized and regulated as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940. And that's the same regulatory regime under which mutual funds operate. So for all the discussions sometimes we hear about differences between mutual funds and ETFs, they're overwhelmingly similar actually. Liz Tammaro: And even thinking about that, we can talk about maybe what are some of the benefits of the mutual fund versus an ETF or, sorry, even vice versa, ETF versus mutual fund. And even maybe what are some of the disadvantages. Jim Rowley: I'll take that because I think I don't necessarily like the word disadvantage. I think differences is maybe the more appropriate term. And we just addressed some of the similarities between ETFs and mutual funds, so it's maybe more important to know what are the actual differences. And really the differences come down to two major items and they both relate to how investors transact in shares of those funds, right− We're talking about exchange-traded funds. ETF investors they trade with each other on exchange in terms of buying or selling their securities, and the price that they get is a tradeable market price. Mutual fund investors, on the other hand, they are buying and selling their shares directly with the fund and they might do that through some type of intermediary but it's back and forth with the fund itself and they get an end-of-day NAV. So we think about all the similarities and, again, sometimes there's a discussion about how different they are; but, really, the differences come down to those two items. It's trading on exchange versus direct with the fund and it's trading at a market price rather than getting the end-of-day NAV. Jim Rowley: I think we actually have a great way to illustrate that. I think we have a chart that addresses that point that Doug was talking about that ETFs are overwhelming. They just happen to be index funds. And when the chart comes up, a simple way to illustrate this is we look at expense ratios. But instead of breaking them down by ETF versus mutual fund, we break them down by index fund versus nonindex fund separated into ETF and mutual fund. And when you see the expense ratios, you see that given an indexing strategy, whether it's a mutual fund or an ETF, the expense ratios tend to be lower than they are for the nonindex strategies, whether it's an ETF or a mutual fund. So it has a lot more to do with whether or not it's an indexing strategy than whether or not it's an ETF or a mutual fund. Liz Tammaro: And similar to that question, we have another one that's come in from Bruce asking about how easy is it to buy and/or sell an ETF versus a mutual fund− Jim Rowley: A lot of moving parts in that question because I think the default has always been mutual funds because they've been around longer. So it becomes a lot of a comfort decision in many ways where purchasing a mutual fund is usually done in dollars. You put your orders in in dollar terms. You're happy to hit the enter button on your keyboard because you know at the end of the day your order is going to execute at the end of the day with a 4 PM NAV. You might be able to get fractional shares because your order gets rounded up into dollars and the mutual fund takes care of the automatic reinvestment for you. With an ETF, investors need to be aware of transacting through their brokerage account. And now the dynamic might be a little bit different because you have to put your order in in shares, mutually speaking. There's no fractionals there. When you put your order in shares, you get a corresponding dollar amount rather than put the order in dollars and you get a corresponding share amount. So, you know, the ease comes with a comfort level that a particular individual might choose or have a preference for doing.

Instead, investors must buy and sell Vanguard ETF Shares in the secondary market and hold those shares in a brokerage account. In doing so, the investor may incur brokerage commissions and may pay more than net asset value when buying and receive less than net asset value when selling.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
