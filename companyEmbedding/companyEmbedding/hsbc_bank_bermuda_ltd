History[edit]
Foundation[edit]
In 1889, Bermudian merchants founded a second bank to compete with N. T. Butterfield & Son. The Bank of Bermuda took over the branch that the Merchants' Bank of Halifax, Nova Scotia had established in 1886 to take over the agency it had awarded to N. T. Butterfield & Son Ltd. The merchants formally incorporated the Bank of Bermuda in 1890.
Bank of Bermuda joins the HSBC Group[edit]
Bank of Bermuda grew to span 17 of the world's key financial and offshore centers including Bahrain, Cayman Islands, Cook Islands, Dublin, Guernsey, Hong Kong, Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, London, Luxembourg, New York, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa and Switzerland prior to joining the HSBC Group's network in February 2004. Shareholders accepted an offer valuing the Bank at US$1.3 billion, the initial offer having been made on 28 October 2003. Most of Bank of Bermuda's operations in these overseas locations were amalgamated with HSBC offices in 2004.
The main business lines of the Bank of Bermuda were the traditional banking division (Retail, Commercial and Corporate), Private Client Division (Private Banking and Trust services) and finally the Global Fund Services division (Traditional and Alternative Fund administration). These divisional structures were broadly replicated to in the overseas offices.
Activities[edit]
The Bank of Bermuda has a 41% market share in terms of deposits in Bermuda, trailing Butterfield Bank at 51%.[2]
In the local market Bank of Bermuda offers a broad range of products and services to the local community, including checking and savings accounts, transactional / payment services, debit / ATM cards, credit cards, personal and consumer loans, mortgages and home equity loans, investment and financial planning services. For the international market Bank of Bermuda offers a mix of Private Client Services, Commercial Banking, Asset Management, Global Fund Services, and Corporate, Investment Banking and Markets activities.

History[edit]
Foundation[edit]
In 1889, Bermudian merchants founded a second bank to compete with N. T. Butterfield & Son. The Bank of Bermuda took over the branch that the Merchants' Bank of Halifax, Nova Scotia had established in 1886 to take over the agency it had awarded to N. T. Butterfield & Son Ltd. The merchants formally incorporated the Bank of Bermuda in 1890.
Bank of Bermuda joins the HSBC Group[edit]
Bank of Bermuda grew to span 17 of the world's key financial and offshore centers including Bahrain, Cayman Islands, Cook Islands, Dublin, Guernsey, Hong Kong, Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, London, Luxembourg, New York, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa and Switzerland prior to joining the HSBC Group's network in February 2004.

 Educational Background



BA in Psychology 


Trinity College

                  Trinity College looks like a traditional New England liberal arts school.

But we act in some untraditional ways.

Our commitment to urban-global education, for example, is groundbreaking, as is our interdisciplinary Neuroscience Program and our First-Year Program, one of the earliest in the nation. We have also just added more than 20 young teacher/scholars to our faculty, and our faculty across the board is committed to collaboration with students on real-world research projects.

We continue to re-examine and transform the concept of liberal arts education because our graduates expect to thrive and to have a serious effect on the world.

Trinity’s 10:1 student/faculty ratio means access to teachers who have time to discuss your term paper in person, encourage your research project, and celebrate your success on Commencement Day. Choose from 38 academic majors in the liberal arts and sciences, including one in engineering, another program that is not traditional for a college like Trinity. Twenty-six interdisciplinary minors like human rights, Jewish studies, and African American studies give you even more choices.

World-wide study abroad, courses that include interaction with the city around us, and for-credit academic internships give you experience beyond the classroom.

And yes, our campus is beautiful in a traditional New England-college way—100 green acres dotted with historic buildings—and it’s located in an interesting place, Connecticut’s state capital, the city of Hartford. It’s home to 2,300 students from 45 states and 47 countries who connect to the College and each other through 100 student organizations, 29 NCAA Division III athletic teams, internships, and volunteer projects.

You can learn about all of this here on our Web site—academics, athletics, student activities, and more—but the best thing is to visit Trinity and see for yourself. Campus visits are conducted year-round, and you are always welcome                





 Career History

It offers fund administration, trust, custody, asset management, and banking services to institutions and individuals. The Bank of Bermuda operates offshore centers in Bahrain, Cayman Islands, Cook Islands, Dublin, Guernsey, Hong Kong, Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, London, Luxembourg, New York, New Zealand, Singapore, South Africa, and Switzerland. The company was founded in 1889 and is headquartered in Hamilton, Bermuda.                




President & Chief Executive Officer

                                    2005 - 2006

It also provides research-intensive equity management services to individuals and institutions located throughout the world. The company was founded by Stewart P. William on January 1, 1975 and is headquartered in New York, NY.                




President & Chief Executive Officer

                                    2005 - 2006                


W.P. Stewart & Co (Europe) Ltd.


                  WPSE is a long-term, research-based manager which seeks to provide above-average long-term investment returns, while accepting what they believe to be below-average risk. The firm seeks to invest in large, growing enterprises that are leaders in their respective fields and that operate businesses with relatively predictable growth. WPSE focuses on a five-year investment horizon and does not engage in market timing. Because the firm invests long-term in a very limited number of high quality, generally non-cyclical businesses, they will typically not have holdings in many of the S&P industry groups.                




President & Chief Executive Officer

                                    1998 - 2006                


WPS Advisors, Inc.


                  WPS Advisors seeks to double the value of their clients' investments every 5 years, for an average return of about 15% a year. The firm conducts in-house research on every company they select, developing their investment research information from a variety of sources, both external and internal. They visit companies regularly, contact managements frequently and talk to competitors, customers and suppliers. WPS Advisors prepares detailed 5-year projections for all investment prospects. These forecasts, and the related appraisals of fair current value for companies under review, are continuously updated. Central to the firm's analytic process is a valuation method that is used to determine the intrinsic value of the shares of each of the companies they follow. This appraisal technique systematically examines all relevant factors such as quality of assets, ability to finance growth, strength of product line, capability of management and inflation adaptability.WPS Advisors seeks to invest in companies with solid and consistent earnings growth, which is associated with significant revenue growth. They also look for companies with above-average profitability with low sensitivity to economic cycles, strong financial positions with below average debt-to-total capital ratios, controllable operational leverage, high free cash flow and exceptional management teams.Though not limited by sector, the firm tends to invest in the stocks of US mid-cap and large-cap companies in the finance, consumer non-durables, electronic technology, technology services and retail sectors. WPS Advisors maintains a low turnover rate.
