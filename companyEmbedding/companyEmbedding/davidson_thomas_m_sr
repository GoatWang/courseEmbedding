The Bismarck Tribune

Nov 11, 2000


















































































Thomas M. "Tom" Davidson, Sr., 79, Chairman of the Board of
Directors of the American State Bank and Trust Company, died Nov.
11, 2000 at his home in Williston. Services will be held at 2 p.m.
Tuesday, at First Lutheran Church, Williston, with the Revs. Dean
Larson and Joel Westby officiating, with burial in Riverview
Cemetery.
Visitation will be from 9 a.m.-7 p.m. today and 9 a.m.-noon
Tuesday, both at Everson Funeral Home, Williston, and for one hour
prior to the service at the church.
Thomas McClellan Davidson was born Oct. 17, 1921 in Williston to
W.S. Sr. and Olive (Evans)Davidson. He was to spend his entire life
in Williston, graduating from Williston High School in the Class of
1939 before attending the University of Montana and the University
of North Dakota.

He was united in marriage to Shirley Strand in Las Vegas, Nev.
on June 2, 1961. They established their home in Williston and have
lived here through these many succeeding years. Tom loved ranching.
From 1929 to 1965, the Davidson ranch was operated under the name
"Long S Cattle Company," located on the Ft. Berthold Indian
Reservation. He took over the operation for his father in the late
1950's. In 1965, the Cattle Company was moved after purchasing a
ranch near Big Horn, Mont., which Tom operated through the date of
his passing.
Tom also assumed the Presidency of the American State Bank &
Trust Company in 1969. From that point forward, Tom was the heart
and soul of the family bank that his father first became associated
with in 1906. Tom began working at the family bank in his teenage
years.
He was a member of the First Lutheran Church, and Moose Lodges.
He was also a Board member of the UND Alumni Association, a
Director of the North Dakota Stockmen's Association and was active
in the American National Cattleman's Association.
Tom was dedicated to his community and went to extraordinary
lengths to support it and also was widely known in the ranching
circles of eastern Montana.
Tom's proudest moments were his marriage to Shirley, the birth
of his two children and later the birth of his four grandchildren.
His family was always first and foremost in his life.

Tom is survived by his wife, Shirley; one daughter and
son-in-law, Tamara and Patrick Sogard, and their children, Oliver,
Barrett, Isabella and Thomas; one son, Thomas Davidson Jr.,
Minneapolis; and one brother, John R. Davidson, Billings, Mont.
He was preceded in death by his parents and one brother, W.S.
Davidson Jr.
For those interested, the family suggests memorials to the T.M.
Davidson Scholarship Fund or the Mercy Medical Center's Cancer
Treatment Center. (Everson Funeral Home, Williston)
