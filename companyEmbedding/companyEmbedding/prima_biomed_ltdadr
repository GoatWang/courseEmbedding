TENS Units from LGMedSupply
LGMedSupply has a large selection of portable TENS units for pain relief. Whether youre looking for pain relief from back pain or in other areas of your body, you will find that we offer the best TENS machines and warranties. TENS units are often used as a non-invasive way of electric stimulation for pain relief. A substantial amount of pain relief can be achieved by using a TENS unit properly as the electrode pads cause electric stimulation that travels along nerve fibers, thus creating a pain relieving sensation.
EMS Units from LGMedSupply
We also carry many EMS units. An EMS unit, also known as an electrical muscle stimulator, electronic muscle stimulator, electric muscle stimulator or electro muscle stimulator, can be used as a therapy tool for patients, a strength training tool for athletes and healthy individuals, and even as a testing tool for the evaluation of neural and muscular function.
Electrical muscle stimulation is the use of electric impulses to cause muscle contraction. EMS units provide electrical current that passes through the muscle and causes the muscle to contract. Electrical impulses generated by the EMS machine are delivered through electrodes placed on the skin next to the muscles that need electronic muscle stimulation.  Electrical muscle stimulation can also accelerate the muscle learning process by providing its users with repeated contractions.
A Large Selection of TENS EMS Combo Units
TENS units and EMS units work the same way. An EMS unit will stimulate muscles, whereas a TENS unit will stimulate nerve endings. Many pain sufferers use a combination of both TENS and EMS to provide a maximum amount of relief and muscle stimulation. We carry a large selection of portable Combo TENS / EMS units to combine the benefits of nerve ending stimulation and electronic muscle stimulation.
Portable Ultrasound Machines for the Home from LGMedSupply
We also carry a large selection of portable ultrasonic machines for use at home. These home ultrasound machines stimulate tissue beneath the skin surface by using very high frequency sound waves. Home ultrasound machines can make the healing process much faster by increasing blood flow. They can also diminish the amount of pain due to a decrease in swelling and edema. Portable ultrasound machines provides the user a gentle massage of tendons and/or ligaments without adding any stress, all while softening scar tissue.
Having a portable ultrasound machine at home offers long-term pain relief, cost savings, portable therapy, and can reduce healing time and chronic inflammation.


Google Trusted Store Customer RatingsHave brought many items for LG Medical since 2012 and never had an issue. Service is always great and the products are excellent quality for a great price. If you have a question and call they are knowledgeable about their products plus the LG web site has many videos and tip. I will continue to buy from LG Medical as I feel the are one of the best in their field. DMD- Written on June 17, 2016 READ MORE REVIEWSA family member ordered from LGMedSupply in the past and had great service, and that is why I felt safe ordering from them. And they didn't let me down. I got exactly what I ordered and it got to me when it was supposed to so that is why I gave them the top rating.- Written on July 19, 2016 READ MORE REVIEWSGreat product, Great Shipping, Great Customer service. AAA+++- Written on July 17, 2016 READ MORE REVIEWS I was very happy with the service that I got from the staff at LG Med Supply. I looked all over the net for over a year to see who was the main Co. that had not only what I needed but who was the Co. that seemed to be the main Manufacturer of the Tens Unit. Then I started checking who had all of the Conductive Designed Pads That my Dr. wanted me to have and here again LG Med Supply had all of the items and were offering the best prices on all of the items that I needed. LG Med Supply was hands down the best in all of the categories as far as who had all of the items that I needed from the Back Belt Strap/Neck electrode/Shoulder and Knee Conductive Designed Pads that my Dr. wanted me to start therapy with. LG Med Supply is the only web site that had a vast selection of different shaped Electrodes which deliver a totally different stimulation that really gives you a completely different feeling then a straight square pad electrode. Thank You LG Med Supply for being there in my time of need.

Prima BioMed Ltd is a biotechnology company working primarily in the field of cancer immunotherapy. The company was originally built on CVac, a therapeutic cancer vaccine. In late 2014 Prima acquired the privately held French immunotherapy company Immutep SA and as a result is now focused on products that work through the LAG3 immune control mechanism.
Prima currently has three main products in its pipeline, all acquired with Immutep:
IMP321, which is recombinant soluble LAG3, used as an activator of antigen presenting cells. This product has completed a Phase IIa clinical study, where it doubled the expected response rate in HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer.
IMP731, a depleting monoclonal antibody for autoimmune diseases, targeting LAG3+ activated T cells. This antibody has been licensed to GlaxoSmithKline.
IMP701, an antagonist monoclonal antibody to LAG3 for use in cancer. This product has been licensed to Novartis

History[edit]
Prima BioMed originated from four early-stage biomedical research projects which scientists at the Austin Research Institute, a medical research facility then associated with Melbourne's Austin Hospital (and that merged with the Burnet Institute in 2006) were working on in the late 1990s. These projects were packaged together and taken public in July 2001 on the ASX in a reverse takeover of a defunct mineral explorer called Prima Resources.[1] The most advanced of these projects is what became CVac.
Main article: CVac
CVac was taken into the Phase II 'CAN-003' study in epithelial ovarian cancer in July 2010.[2] In September 2013 Prima reported top-line interim data from this trial which showed no observed difference between treatment and control group in terms of Progression-free survival (PFS),[3] however in May 2014, when Prima reported final data from CAN-003, it was able to show median PFS for CVac patients in second remission of 12.91 months versus 4.94 months for the control group. This result had statistical significance (p=0.04).[4] After this data was received Prima sought to alter its clinical trial protocols in order to recruit second remission patients, however in February 2015 the company announced that it was no longer recruiting into its CVac studies.[5] Prima reported final Overall Survival numbers for CVac in May 2015 showing that median survival number for second remission CVac patients had still not been reached at 42 months, versus the median for the treatment group of 25.5 months. The p value for this comparison was 0.07.[6]
Immutep acquisition[edit]
Since February 2015 Prima's main focus has been on the programs that it acquired with Immutep. Prima had announced the acquisition of Immutep in October 2014 and completed the transaction in December 2014. The final purchase price was US$25m.[7] Immutep, which had been founded in 2001 by Professor Frédéric Triebel, had been built on LAG3, an immune checkpoint molecule known to play a role in switching off an immune response. Triebel had discovered LAG-3 in 1990[8] and over the course of the next decade, as part of a collaboration between Institut Gustave Roussy and Merck Serono, Triebel et al., established LAG-3’s mechanism of action in T cells and dendritic cells. Immutep had called its soluble LAG-3 immune system activation technology 'ImmuFact' (short for 'Immunostimulatory Factors') and its LAG-3 antagonist antibody technology 'ImmuTune'. It also developed a technology platform called ImmuCcine which involved covalently linking an antigen to IMP321 in a fusion protein in order vectorise the antigen to dendritic cells. Currently Prima BioMed are only focus on the ImmuFact and ImmuTune platforms.[9]
IMP321[edit]
IMP321 (LAG-3Ig) is a soluble dimeric recombinant form of LAG-3, being a fusion protein with immunoglobulin, designed to activate antigen presenting cells. Immutep established in 2008 that the product could induce activation of dendritic cell and monocytes, resulting in T cell expansion.[10] Phase IIa data in metastatic breast cancer, generated in 2010, has suggested that IMP321 works as a chemo-immunotherapeutic, where chemotherapy creates tumour debris, and IMP321 increases activation of APCs as they take up that debris. In that study, IMP321 increased the response rate according to the RECIST criteria from the 25% rate expected for paclitaxel to over 50% at the six-month mark.[11] There is also evidence (in-vivo) that IMP321 at low doses can be used as a T cell adjuvant for cancer vaccines.[12]
Prima has initiated a Phase IIb study (2015-2019) of IMP321 in hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.[13] As of February 2016[update] Prima has registered a Phase I study in conjunction with an existing approved checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab.[14]
IMP731[edit]
IMP731 is a depleting antibody for autoimmune disease that targets LAG3+ activated T cells. GSK licensed the rights to develop such antibodies from Immutep in December 2010 in a total deal package worth ₤64m. GSK subsequently developed GSK2831781, its own depleting anti-LAG-3 antibody based on Immutep's original IMP731 antibody.[15] Prima announced a 'single digit' million dollar milestone related to GSK2831781’s commencement of a Phase I study in psoriasis in January 2015.[16] There is evidence, in the tuberculin-induced DTH model in primates, that a single injection of a depleting LAG-3 monoclonal antibody can prevent Th1-driven skin inflammation.[17]
IMP701[edit]
IMP701 is an anti-LAG-3 antibody which blocks LAG-3-mediated immune down-regulation. The product was originally licensed in 2012 to the American biotech company CoStim. That company was acquired by Novartis in 2014. Novartis remains a licensee of IMP701 but the program is pre-clinical.
Prima stock[edit]
Prima has been publicly traded on the ASX since July 2001. The company did its IPO on Nasdaq in April 2012 and trades on that exchange in the form of ADRs. The current conversion rate between Prima ordinary shares and ADRs is 30:1.[18] On 14 May 2015 Prima BioMed announced a A$15 million investment from Ridgeback Capital Investments, a US-based specialist healthcare investor.[19] On 19 and 20 May 2015, just after Prima announced final Overall Survival data for its CAN-003 study of CVac, the company's ADRs experienced a significant two-day increase on Nasdaq. On 19 May the stock increased from US$0.52 per share from the previous session's close to US$1.60. On 20 May the stock opened at US$2.13 and rising as high as US$6.48 per share before closing at US$5.91. On that day 91.46 million ADRs were traded.
Main people[edit]
Prima's CEO since July 2014 has been Marc Voigt,[20] a German national who runs the company from its Berlin office. Frédéric Triebel serves as Chief Scientific and Medical Officer, working from the Paris office and laboratory. The Prima board is chaired by the Australian businesswoman Lucy Turnbull and includes Russell Howard.
Locations[edit]
Prima BioMed has office space in Berlin on Brandenburgische Straße in the Wilmersdorf district near the Konstanzer Straße U-Bahn station. Immutep had laboratories and office space at Orsay, a southwestern suburb of Paris, and this has been maintained by Prima BioMed. There is also an office on Macquarie Street, Sydney.
Leadership history[edit]
Prima BioMed's first two CEOs were Marcus Clark (2001–2006)[21] and Eugene Kopp (2006–2008). In October 2007 the Sydney-based bioentrepreneur Martin Rogers became an Executive Director and he led the company as managing director or CEO through to 2012. An American named Matt Lehman was CEO to 2014 before he was replaced by the current incumbent, Marc Voigt.

Prima BioMed Ltd is a biotechnology company working primarily in the field of cancer immunotherapy. The company was originally built on CVac, a therapeutic cancer vaccine. In late 2014 Prima acquired the privately held French immunotherapy company Immutep SA and as a result is now focused on products that work through the LAG3 immune control mechanism.
Prima currently has three main products in its pipeline, all acquired with Immutep:
IMP321, which is recombinant soluble LAG3, used as an activator of antigen presenting cells. This product has completed a Phase IIa clinical study, where it doubled the expected response rate in HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer.
IMP731, a depleting monoclonal antibody for autoimmune diseases, targeting LAG3+ activated T cells. This antibody has been licensed to GlaxoSmithKline.
IMP701, an antagonist monoclonal antibody to LAG3 for use in cancer. This product has been licensed to Novartis

History[edit]
Prima BioMed originated from four early-stage biomedical research projects which scientists at the Austin Research Institute, a medical research facility then associated with Melbourne's Austin Hospital (and that merged with the Burnet Institute in 2006) were working on in the late 1990s. These projects were packaged together and taken public in July 2001 on the ASX in a reverse takeover of a defunct mineral explorer called Prima Resources.[1] The most advanced of these projects is what became CVac.
Main article: CVac
CVac was taken into the Phase II 'CAN-003' study in epithelial ovarian cancer in July 2010.[2] In September 2013 Prima reported top-line interim data from this trial which showed no observed difference between treatment and control group in terms of Progression-free survival (PFS),[3] however in May 2014, when Prima reported final data from CAN-003, it was able to show median PFS for CVac patients in second remission of 12.91 months versus 4.94 months for the control group. This result had statistical significance (p=0.04).[4] After this data was received Prima sought to alter its clinical trial protocols in order to recruit second remission patients, however in February 2015 the company announced that it was no longer recruiting into its CVac studies.[5] Prima reported final Overall Survival numbers for CVac in May 2015 showing that median survival number for second remission CVac patients had still not been reached at 42 months, versus the median for the treatment group of 25.5 months. The p value for this comparison was 0.07.[6]
Immutep acquisition[edit]
Since February 2015 Prima's main focus has been on the programs that it acquired with Immutep. Prima had announced the acquisition of Immutep in October 2014 and completed the transaction in December 2014. The final purchase price was US$25m.[7] Immutep, which had been founded in 2001 by Professor Frédéric Triebel, had been built on LAG3, an immune checkpoint molecule known to play a role in switching off an immune response. Triebel had discovered LAG-3 in 1990[8] and over the course of the next decade, as part of a collaboration between Institut Gustave Roussy and Merck Serono, Triebel et al., established LAG-3’s mechanism of action in T cells and dendritic cells. Immutep had called its soluble LAG-3 immune system activation technology 'ImmuFact' (short for 'Immunostimulatory Factors') and its LAG-3 antagonist antibody technology 'ImmuTune'. It also developed a technology platform called ImmuCcine which involved covalently linking an antigen to IMP321 in a fusion protein in order vectorise the antigen to dendritic cells. Currently Prima BioMed are only focus on the ImmuFact and ImmuTune platforms.[9]
IMP321[edit]
IMP321 (LAG-3Ig) is a soluble dimeric recombinant form of LAG-3, being a fusion protein with immunoglobulin, designed to activate antigen presenting cells. Immutep established in 2008 that the product could induce activation of dendritic cell and monocytes, resulting in T cell expansion.[10] Phase IIa data in metastatic breast cancer, generated in 2010, has suggested that IMP321 works as a chemo-immunotherapeutic, where chemotherapy creates tumour debris, and IMP321 increases activation of APCs as they take up that debris. In that study, IMP321 increased the response rate according to the RECIST criteria from the 25% rate expected for paclitaxel to over 50% at the six-month mark.[11] There is also evidence (in-vivo) that IMP321 at low doses can be used as a T cell adjuvant for cancer vaccines.[12]
Prima has initiated a Phase IIb study (2015-2019) of IMP321 in hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.[13] As of February 2016[update] Prima has registered a Phase I study in conjunction with an existing approved checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab.[14]
IMP731[edit]
IMP731 is a depleting antibody for autoimmune disease that targets LAG3+ activated T cells. GSK licensed the rights to develop such antibodies from Immutep in December 2010 in a total deal package worth ₤64m. GSK subsequently developed GSK2831781, its own depleting anti-LAG-3 antibody based on Immutep's original IMP731 antibody.[15] Prima announced a 'single digit' million dollar milestone related to GSK2831781’s commencement of a Phase I study in psoriasis in January 2015.[16] There is evidence, in the tuberculin-induced DTH model in primates, that a single injection of a depleting LAG-3 monoclonal antibody can prevent Th1-driven skin inflammation.[17]
IMP701[edit]
IMP701 is an anti-LAG-3 antibody which blocks LAG-3-mediated immune down-regulation. The product was originally licensed in 2012 to the American biotech company CoStim. That company was acquired by Novartis in 2014. Novartis remains a licensee of IMP701 but the program is pre-clinical.
Prima stock[edit]
Prima has been publicly traded on the ASX since July 2001. The company did its IPO on Nasdaq in April 2012 and trades on that exchange in the form of ADRs. The current conversion rate between Prima ordinary shares and ADRs is 30:1.[18] On 14 May 2015 Prima BioMed announced a A$15 million investment from Ridgeback Capital Investments, a US-based specialist healthcare investor.[19] On 19 and 20 May 2015, just after Prima announced final Overall Survival data for its CAN-003 study of CVac, the company's ADRs experienced a significant two-day increase on Nasdaq. On 19 May the stock increased from US$0.52 per share from the previous session's close to US$1.60. On 20 May the stock opened at US$2.13 and rising as high as US$6.48 per share before closing at US$5.91. On that day 91.46 million ADRs were traded.
Main people[edit]
Prima's CEO since July 2014 has been Marc Voigt,[20] a German national who runs the company from its Berlin office. Frédéric Triebel serves as Chief Scientific and Medical Officer, working from the Paris office and laboratory. The Prima board is chaired by the Australian businesswoman Lucy Turnbull and includes Russell Howard.
Locations[edit]
Prima BioMed has office space in Berlin on Brandenburgische Straße in the Wilmersdorf district near the Konstanzer Straße U-Bahn station. Immutep had laboratories and office space at Orsay, a southwestern suburb of Paris, and this has been maintained by Prima BioMed. There is also an office on Macquarie Street, Sydney.
Leadership history[edit]
Prima BioMed's first two CEOs were Marcus Clark (2001–2006)[21] and Eugene Kopp (2006–2008). In October 2007 the Sydney-based bioentrepreneur Martin Rogers became an Executive Director and he led the company as managing director or CEO through to 2012. An American named Matt Lehman was CEO to 2014 before he was replaced by the current incumbent, Marc Voigt.

Prima BioMed Ltd is a biotechnology company working primarily in the field of cancer immunotherapy. The company was originally built on CVac, a therapeutic cancer vaccine. In late 2014 Prima acquired the privately held French immunotherapy company Immutep SA and as a result is now focused on products that work through the LAG3 immune control mechanism.
Prima currently has three main products in its pipeline, all acquired with Immutep:
IMP321, which is recombinant soluble LAG3, used as an activator of antigen presenting cells. This product has completed a Phase IIa clinical study, where it doubled the expected response rate in HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer.
IMP731, a depleting monoclonal antibody for autoimmune diseases, targeting LAG3+ activated T cells. This antibody has been licensed to GlaxoSmithKline.
IMP701, an antagonist monoclonal antibody to LAG3 for use in cancer. This product has been licensed to Novartis

History[edit]
Prima BioMed originated from four early-stage biomedical research projects which scientists at the Austin Research Institute, a medical research facility then associated with Melbourne's Austin Hospital (and that merged with the Burnet Institute in 2006) were working on in the late 1990s. These projects were packaged together and taken public in July 2001 on the ASX in a reverse takeover of a defunct mineral explorer called Prima Resources.[1] The most advanced of these projects is what became CVac.
Main article: CVac
CVac was taken into the Phase II 'CAN-003' study in epithelial ovarian cancer in July 2010.[2] In September 2013 Prima reported top-line interim data from this trial which showed no observed difference between treatment and control group in terms of Progression-free survival (PFS),[3] however in May 2014, when Prima reported final data from CAN-003, it was able to show median PFS for CVac patients in second remission of 12.91 months versus 4.94 months for the control group. This result had statistical significance (p=0.04).[4] After this data was received Prima sought to alter its clinical trial protocols in order to recruit second remission patients, however in February 2015 the company announced that it was no longer recruiting into its CVac studies.[5] Prima reported final Overall Survival numbers for CVac in May 2015 showing that median survival number for second remission CVac patients had still not been reached at 42 months, versus the median for the treatment group of 25.5 months. The p value for this comparison was 0.07.[6]
Immutep acquisition[edit]
Since February 2015 Prima's main focus has been on the programs that it acquired with Immutep. Prima had announced the acquisition of Immutep in October 2014 and completed the transaction in December 2014. The final purchase price was US$25m.[7] Immutep, which had been founded in 2001 by Professor Frédéric Triebel, had been built on LAG3, an immune checkpoint molecule known to play a role in switching off an immune response. Triebel had discovered LAG-3 in 1990[8] and over the course of the next decade, as part of a collaboration between Institut Gustave Roussy and Merck Serono, Triebel et al., established LAG-3’s mechanism of action in T cells and dendritic cells. Immutep had called its soluble LAG-3 immune system activation technology 'ImmuFact' (short for 'Immunostimulatory Factors') and its LAG-3 antagonist antibody technology 'ImmuTune'. It also developed a technology platform called ImmuCcine which involved covalently linking an antigen to IMP321 in a fusion protein in order vectorise the antigen to dendritic cells. Currently Prima BioMed are only focus on the ImmuFact and ImmuTune platforms.[9]
IMP321[edit]
IMP321 (LAG-3Ig) is a soluble dimeric recombinant form of LAG-3, being a fusion protein with immunoglobulin, designed to activate antigen presenting cells. Immutep established in 2008 that the product could induce activation of dendritic cell and monocytes, resulting in T cell expansion.[10] Phase IIa data in metastatic breast cancer, generated in 2010, has suggested that IMP321 works as a chemo-immunotherapeutic, where chemotherapy creates tumour debris, and IMP321 increases activation of APCs as they take up that debris. In that study, IMP321 increased the response rate according to the RECIST criteria from the 25% rate expected for paclitaxel to over 50% at the six-month mark.[11] There is also evidence (in-vivo) that IMP321 at low doses can be used as a T cell adjuvant for cancer vaccines.[12]
Prima has initiated a Phase IIb study (2015-2019) of IMP321 in hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.[13] As of February 2016[update] Prima has registered a Phase I study in conjunction with an existing approved checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab.[14]
IMP731[edit]
IMP731 is a depleting antibody for autoimmune disease that targets LAG3+ activated T cells. GSK licensed the rights to develop such antibodies from Immutep in December 2010 in a total deal package worth ₤64m. GSK subsequently developed GSK2831781, its own depleting anti-LAG-3 antibody based on Immutep's original IMP731 antibody.[15] Prima announced a 'single digit' million dollar milestone related to GSK2831781’s commencement of a Phase I study in psoriasis in January 2015.[16] There is evidence, in the tuberculin-induced DTH model in primates, that a single injection of a depleting LAG-3 monoclonal antibody can prevent Th1-driven skin inflammation.[17]
IMP701[edit]
IMP701 is an anti-LAG-3 antibody which blocks LAG-3-mediated immune down-regulation. The product was originally licensed in 2012 to the American biotech company CoStim. That company was acquired by Novartis in 2014. Novartis remains a licensee of IMP701 but the program is pre-clinical.
Prima stock[edit]
Prima has been publicly traded on the ASX since July 2001. The company did its IPO on Nasdaq in April 2012 and trades on that exchange in the form of ADRs. The current conversion rate between Prima ordinary shares and ADRs is 30:1.[18] On 14 May 2015 Prima BioMed announced a A$15 million investment from Ridgeback Capital Investments, a US-based specialist healthcare investor.[19] On 19 and 20 May 2015, just after Prima announced final Overall Survival data for its CAN-003 study of CVac, the company's ADRs experienced a significant two-day increase on Nasdaq. On 19 May the stock increased from US$0.52 per share from the previous session's close to US$1.60. On 20 May the stock opened at US$2.13 and rising as high as US$6.48 per share before closing at US$5.91. On that day 91.46 million ADRs were traded.
Main people[edit]
Prima's CEO since July 2014 has been Marc Voigt,[20] a German national who runs the company from its Berlin office. Frédéric Triebel serves as Chief Scientific and Medical Officer, working from the Paris office and laboratory. The Prima board is chaired by the Australian businesswoman Lucy Turnbull and includes Russell Howard.
Locations[edit]
Prima BioMed has office space in Berlin on Brandenburgische Straße in the Wilmersdorf district near the Konstanzer Straße U-Bahn station. Immutep had laboratories and office space at Orsay, a southwestern suburb of Paris, and this has been maintained by Prima BioMed. There is also an office on Macquarie Street, Sydney.
Leadership history[edit]
Prima BioMed's first two CEOs were Marcus Clark (2001–2006)[21] and Eugene Kopp (2006–2008). In October 2007 the Sydney-based bioentrepreneur Martin Rogers became an Executive Director and he led the company as managing director or CEO through to 2012. An American named Matt Lehman was CEO to 2014 before he was replaced by the current incumbent, Marc Voigt.

Prima BioMed Ltd is a biotechnology company working primarily in the field of cancer immunotherapy. The company was originally built on CVac, a therapeutic cancer vaccine. In late 2014 Prima acquired the privately held French immunotherapy company Immutep SA and as a result is now focused on products that work through the LAG3 immune control mechanism.
Prima currently has three main products in its pipeline, all acquired with Immutep:
IMP321, which is recombinant soluble LAG3, used as an activator of antigen presenting cells. This product has completed a Phase IIa clinical study, where it doubled the expected response rate in HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer.
IMP731, a depleting monoclonal antibody for autoimmune diseases, targeting LAG3+ activated T cells. This antibody has been licensed to GlaxoSmithKline.
IMP701, an antagonist monoclonal antibody to LAG3 for use in cancer. This product has been licensed to Novartis

History[edit]
Prima BioMed originated from four early-stage biomedical research projects which scientists at the Austin Research Institute, a medical research facility then associated with Melbourne's Austin Hospital (and that merged with the Burnet Institute in 2006) were working on in the late 1990s. These projects were packaged together and taken public in July 2001 on the ASX in a reverse takeover of a defunct mineral explorer called Prima Resources.[1] The most advanced of these projects is what became CVac.
Main article: CVac
CVac was taken into the Phase II 'CAN-003' study in epithelial ovarian cancer in July 2010.[2] In September 2013 Prima reported top-line interim data from this trial which showed no observed difference between treatment and control group in terms of Progression-free survival (PFS),[3] however in May 2014, when Prima reported final data from CAN-003, it was able to show median PFS for CVac patients in second remission of 12.91 months versus 4.94 months for the control group. This result had statistical significance (p=0.04).[4] After this data was received Prima sought to alter its clinical trial protocols in order to recruit second remission patients, however in February 2015 the company announced that it was no longer recruiting into its CVac studies.[5] Prima reported final Overall Survival numbers for CVac in May 2015 showing that median survival number for second remission CVac patients had still not been reached at 42 months, versus the median for the treatment group of 25.5 months. The p value for this comparison was 0.07.[6]
Immutep acquisition[edit]
Since February 2015 Prima's main focus has been on the programs that it acquired with Immutep. Prima had announced the acquisition of Immutep in October 2014 and completed the transaction in December 2014. The final purchase price was US$25m.[7] Immutep, which had been founded in 2001 by Professor Frédéric Triebel, had been built on LAG3, an immune checkpoint molecule known to play a role in switching off an immune response. Triebel had discovered LAG-3 in 1990[8] and over the course of the next decade, as part of a collaboration between Institut Gustave Roussy and Merck Serono, Triebel et al., established LAG-3’s mechanism of action in T cells and dendritic cells. Immutep had called its soluble LAG-3 immune system activation technology 'ImmuFact' (short for 'Immunostimulatory Factors') and its LAG-3 antagonist antibody technology 'ImmuTune'. It also developed a technology platform called ImmuCcine which involved covalently linking an antigen to IMP321 in a fusion protein in order vectorise the antigen to dendritic cells. Currently Prima BioMed are only focus on the ImmuFact and ImmuTune platforms.[9]
IMP321[edit]
IMP321 (LAG-3Ig) is a soluble dimeric recombinant form of LAG-3, being a fusion protein with immunoglobulin, designed to activate antigen presenting cells. Immutep established in 2008 that the product could induce activation of dendritic cell and monocytes, resulting in T cell expansion.[10] Phase IIa data in metastatic breast cancer, generated in 2010, has suggested that IMP321 works as a chemo-immunotherapeutic, where chemotherapy creates tumour debris, and IMP321 increases activation of APCs as they take up that debris. In that study, IMP321 increased the response rate according to the RECIST criteria from the 25% rate expected for paclitaxel to over 50% at the six-month mark.[11] There is also evidence (in-vivo) that IMP321 at low doses can be used as a T cell adjuvant for cancer vaccines.[12]
Prima has initiated a Phase IIb study (2015-2019) of IMP321 in hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.[13] As of February 2016[update] Prima has registered a Phase I study in conjunction with an existing approved checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab.[14]
IMP731[edit]
IMP731 is a depleting antibody for autoimmune disease that targets LAG3+ activated T cells. GSK licensed the rights to develop such antibodies from Immutep in December 2010 in a total deal package worth ₤64m. GSK subsequently developed GSK2831781, its own depleting anti-LAG-3 antibody based on Immutep's original IMP731 antibody.[15] Prima announced a 'single digit' million dollar milestone related to GSK2831781’s commencement of a Phase I study in psoriasis in January 2015.[16] There is evidence, in the tuberculin-induced DTH model in primates, that a single injection of a depleting LAG-3 monoclonal antibody can prevent Th1-driven skin inflammation.[17]
IMP701[edit]
IMP701 is an anti-LAG-3 antibody which blocks LAG-3-mediated immune down-regulation. The product was originally licensed in 2012 to the American biotech company CoStim. That company was acquired by Novartis in 2014. Novartis remains a licensee of IMP701 but the program is pre-clinical.
Prima stock[edit]
Prima has been publicly traded on the ASX since July 2001. The company did its IPO on Nasdaq in April 2012 and trades on that exchange in the form of ADRs. The current conversion rate between Prima ordinary shares and ADRs is 30:1.[18] On 14 May 2015 Prima BioMed announced a A$15 million investment from Ridgeback Capital Investments, a US-based specialist healthcare investor.[19] On 19 and 20 May 2015, just after Prima announced final Overall Survival data for its CAN-003 study of CVac, the company's ADRs experienced a significant two-day increase on Nasdaq. On 19 May the stock increased from US$0.52 per share from the previous session's close to US$1.60. On 20 May the stock opened at US$2.13 and rising as high as US$6.48 per share before closing at US$5.91. On that day 91.46 million ADRs were traded.
Main people[edit]
Prima's CEO since July 2014 has been Marc Voigt,[20] a German national who runs the company from its Berlin office. Frédéric Triebel serves as Chief Scientific and Medical Officer, working from the Paris office and laboratory. The Prima board is chaired by the Australian businesswoman Lucy Turnbull and includes Russell Howard.
Locations[edit]
Prima BioMed has office space in Berlin on Brandenburgische Straße in the Wilmersdorf district near the Konstanzer Straße U-Bahn station. Immutep had laboratories and office space at Orsay, a southwestern suburb of Paris, and this has been maintained by Prima BioMed. There is also an office on Macquarie Street, Sydney.
Leadership history[edit]
Prima BioMed's first two CEOs were Marcus Clark (2001–2006)[21] and Eugene Kopp (2006–2008). In October 2007 the Sydney-based bioentrepreneur Martin Rogers became an Executive Director and he led the company as managing director or CEO through to 2012. An American named Matt Lehman was CEO to 2014 before he was replaced by the current incumbent, Marc Voigt.

What a constant stream of oil company spending cuts means for crude prices
              
              Oil companies are sounding a recurring theme: lower exploration and production spending estimates. Will that lead to a rally in oil prices?

How Venezuela chaos could spark oil rally OPEC has failed to achieve 
              
              Political and economic turmoil in Venezuela could fuel a rise in oil prices—something the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, despite it’s efforts to cut back production, hasn’t been able to do.

A quarter of S&P 500’s 2017 climb due to five stocks (yes, those five)
              
              Throughout 2017, there’s one acronym that investors have in particular been sinking their teeth into: FAANG.

Amazon earnings fall 77%, shares drop
              
              Amazon.com Inc.  reported much lower earnings than expected Thursday, and shares declined more than 2% in late trading. The e-commerce giant reported net income of $197 million, or 40 cents a share, on sales of $38 billion, a profit decline of 77% from the same quarter a year ago. Analysts on average expected Amazon to report earnings of $1.41 a share on sales of $37.2 billion. The company's spending cut into profit, as fulfillment costs -- the amount Amazon spends to fulfill customers' orders on its e-commerce platform -- rose about 33% from a year ago and spending on technology and content increased by about 43%. Amazon stock traded at all-time highs this week, making Amazon the fourth U.S. company with a market capitalization of $500 billion and briefly giving Chief Executive Jeff Bezos the title of richest man in the world, but shares declined about 2% in immediate after-hours action.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.      Key Stock Data    P/E Ratio (TTM) N/A     EPS (TTM)  $-0.36      Market Cap $44.56 M     Shares Outstanding 20.80 M     Public Float N/A     Yield PBMD has not issued dividends in more than 1 year.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

Website

Prima BioMed Ltd is a biotechnology company working primarily in the field of cancer immunotherapy. The company was originally built on CVac, a therapeutic cancer vaccine. In late 2014 Prima acquired the privately held French immunotherapy company Immutep SA and as a result is now focused on products that work through the LAG3 immune control mechanism.
Prima currently has three main products in its pipeline, all acquired with Immutep:
IMP321, which is recombinant soluble LAG3, used as an activator of antigen presenting cells. This product has completed a Phase IIa clinical study, where it doubled the expected response rate in HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer.
IMP731, a depleting monoclonal antibody for autoimmune diseases, targeting LAG3+ activated T cells. This antibody has been licensed to GlaxoSmithKline.
IMP701, an antagonist monoclonal antibody to LAG3 for use in cancer. This product has been licensed to Novartis

History[edit]
Prima BioMed originated from four early-stage biomedical research projects which scientists at the Austin Research Institute, a medical research facility then associated with Melbourne's Austin Hospital (and that merged with the Burnet Institute in 2006) were working on in the late 1990s. These projects were packaged together and taken public in July 2001 on the ASX in a reverse takeover of a defunct mineral explorer called Prima Resources.[1] The most advanced of these projects is what became CVac.
Main article: CVac
CVac was taken into the Phase II 'CAN-003' study in epithelial ovarian cancer in July 2010.[2] In September 2013 Prima reported top-line interim data from this trial which showed no observed difference between treatment and control group in terms of Progression-free survival (PFS),[3] however in May 2014, when Prima reported final data from CAN-003, it was able to show median PFS for CVac patients in second remission of 12.91 months versus 4.94 months for the control group. This result had statistical significance (p=0.04).[4] After this data was received Prima sought to alter its clinical trial protocols in order to recruit second remission patients, however in February 2015 the company announced that it was no longer recruiting into its CVac studies.[5] Prima reported final Overall Survival numbers for CVac in May 2015 showing that median survival number for second remission CVac patients had still not been reached at 42 months, versus the median for the treatment group of 25.5 months. The p value for this comparison was 0.07.[6]
Immutep acquisition[edit]
Since February 2015 Prima's main focus has been on the programs that it acquired with Immutep. Prima had announced the acquisition of Immutep in October 2014 and completed the transaction in December 2014. The final purchase price was US$25m.[7] Immutep, which had been founded in 2001 by Professor Frédéric Triebel, had been built on LAG3, an immune checkpoint molecule known to play a role in switching off an immune response. Triebel had discovered LAG-3 in 1990[8] and over the course of the next decade, as part of a collaboration between Institut Gustave Roussy and Merck Serono, Triebel et al., established LAG-3’s mechanism of action in T cells and dendritic cells. Immutep had called its soluble LAG-3 immune system activation technology 'ImmuFact' (short for 'Immunostimulatory Factors') and its LAG-3 antagonist antibody technology 'ImmuTune'. It also developed a technology platform called ImmuCcine which involved covalently linking an antigen to IMP321 in a fusion protein in order vectorise the antigen to dendritic cells. Currently Prima BioMed are only focus on the ImmuFact and ImmuTune platforms.[9]
IMP321[edit]
IMP321 (LAG-3Ig) is a soluble dimeric recombinant form of LAG-3, being a fusion protein with immunoglobulin, designed to activate antigen presenting cells. Immutep established in 2008 that the product could induce activation of dendritic cell and monocytes, resulting in T cell expansion.[10] Phase IIa data in metastatic breast cancer, generated in 2010, has suggested that IMP321 works as a chemo-immunotherapeutic, where chemotherapy creates tumour debris, and IMP321 increases activation of APCs as they take up that debris. In that study, IMP321 increased the response rate according to the RECIST criteria from the 25% rate expected for paclitaxel to over 50% at the six-month mark.[11] There is also evidence (in-vivo) that IMP321 at low doses can be used as a T cell adjuvant for cancer vaccines.[12]
Prima has initiated a Phase IIb study (2015-2019) of IMP321 in hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.[13] As of February 2016[update] Prima has registered a Phase I study in conjunction with an existing approved checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab.[14]
IMP731[edit]
IMP731 is a depleting antibody for autoimmune disease that targets LAG3+ activated T cells. GSK licensed the rights to develop such antibodies from Immutep in December 2010 in a total deal package worth ₤64m. GSK subsequently developed GSK2831781, its own depleting anti-LAG-3 antibody based on Immutep's original IMP731 antibody.[15] Prima announced a 'single digit' million dollar milestone related to GSK2831781’s commencement of a Phase I study in psoriasis in January 2015.[16] There is evidence, in the tuberculin-induced DTH model in primates, that a single injection of a depleting LAG-3 monoclonal antibody can prevent Th1-driven skin inflammation.[17]
IMP701[edit]
IMP701 is an anti-LAG-3 antibody which blocks LAG-3-mediated immune down-regulation. The product was originally licensed in 2012 to the American biotech company CoStim. That company was acquired by Novartis in 2014. Novartis remains a licensee of IMP701 but the program is pre-clinical.
Prima stock[edit]
Prima has been publicly traded on the ASX since July 2001. The company did its IPO on Nasdaq in April 2012 and trades on that exchange in the form of ADRs. The current conversion rate between Prima ordinary shares and ADRs is 30:1.[18] On 14 May 2015 Prima BioMed announced a A$15 million investment from Ridgeback Capital Investments, a US-based specialist healthcare investor.[19] On 19 and 20 May 2015, just after Prima announced final Overall Survival data for its CAN-003 study of CVac, the company's ADRs experienced a significant two-day increase on Nasdaq. On 19 May the stock increased from US$0.52 per share from the previous session's close to US$1.60. On 20 May the stock opened at US$2.13 and rising as high as US$6.48 per share before closing at US$5.91. On that day 91.46 million ADRs were traded.
Main people[edit]
Prima's CEO since July 2014 has been Marc Voigt,[20] a German national who runs the company from its Berlin office. Frédéric Triebel serves as Chief Scientific and Medical Officer, working from the Paris office and laboratory. The Prima board is chaired by the Australian businesswoman Lucy Turnbull and includes Russell Howard.
Locations[edit]
Prima BioMed has office space in Berlin on Brandenburgische Straße in the Wilmersdorf district near the Konstanzer Straße U-Bahn station. Immutep had laboratories and office space at Orsay, a southwestern suburb of Paris, and this has been maintained by Prima BioMed. There is also an office on Macquarie Street, Sydney.
Leadership history[edit]
Prima BioMed's first two CEOs were Marcus Clark (2001–2006)[21] and Eugene Kopp (2006–2008). In October 2007 the Sydney-based bioentrepreneur Martin Rogers became an Executive Director and he led the company as managing director or CEO through to 2012. An American named Matt Lehman was CEO to 2014 before he was replaced by the current incumbent, Marc Voigt.

The final purchase price was US$25m.[7] Immutep, which had been founded in 2001 by Professor Frédéric Triebel, had been built on LAG3, an immune checkpoint molecule known to play a role in switching off an immune response. Triebel had discovered LAG-3 in 1990[8] and over the course of the next decade, as part of a collaboration between Institut Gustave Roussy and Merck Serono, Triebel et al., established LAG-3’s mechanism of action in T cells and dendritic cells. Immutep had called its soluble LAG-3 immune system activation technology 'ImmuFact' (short for 'Immunostimulatory Factors') and its LAG-3 antagonist antibody technology 'ImmuTune'. It also developed a technology platform called ImmuCcine which involved covalently linking an antigen to IMP321 in a fusion protein in order vectorise the antigen to dendritic cells. Currently Prima BioMed are only focus on the ImmuFact and ImmuTune platforms.[9]
IMP321[edit]
IMP321 (LAG-3Ig) is a soluble dimeric recombinant form of LAG-3, being a fusion protein with immunoglobulin, designed to activate antigen presenting cells. Immutep established in 2008 that the product could induce activation of dendritic cell and monocytes, resulting in T cell expansion.[10] Phase IIa data in metastatic breast cancer, generated in 2010, has suggested that IMP321 works as a chemo-immunotherapeutic, where chemotherapy creates tumour debris, and IMP321 increases activation of APCs as they take up that debris. In that study, IMP321 increased the response rate according to the RECIST criteria from the 25% rate expected for paclitaxel to over 50% at the six-month mark.[11] There is also evidence (in-vivo) that IMP321 at low doses can be used as a T cell adjuvant for cancer vaccines.[12]
Prima has initiated a Phase IIb study (2015-2019) of IMP321 in hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer.[13] As of February 2016[update] Prima has registered a Phase I study in conjunction with an existing approved checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab.[14]
IMP731[edit]
IMP731 is a depleting antibody for autoimmune disease that targets LAG3+ activated T cells. GSK licensed the rights to develop such antibodies from Immutep in December 2010 in a total deal package worth ₤64m. GSK subsequently developed GSK2831781, its own depleting anti-LAG-3 antibody based on Immutep's original IMP731 antibody.[15] Prima announced a 'single digit' million dollar milestone related to GSK2831781’s commencement of a Phase I study in psoriasis in January 2015.[16] There is evidence, in the tuberculin-induced DTH model in primates, that a single injection of a depleting LAG-3 monoclonal antibody can prevent Th1-driven skin inflammation.[17]
IMP701[edit]
IMP701 is an anti-LAG-3 antibody which blocks LAG-3-mediated immune down-regulation. The product was originally licensed in 2012 to the American biotech company CoStim. That company was acquired by Novartis in 2014. Novartis remains a licensee of IMP701 but the program is pre-clinical.
Prima stock[edit]
Prima has been publicly traded on the ASX since July 2001. The company did its IPO on Nasdaq in April 2012 and trades on that exchange in the form of ADRs. The current conversion rate between Prima ordinary shares and ADRs is 30:1.[18] On 14 May 2015 Prima BioMed announced a A$15 million investment from Ridgeback Capital Investments, a US-based specialist healthcare investor.[19] On 19 and 20 May 2015, just after Prima announced final Overall Survival data for its CAN-003 study of CVac, the company's ADRs experienced a significant two-day increase on Nasdaq. On 19 May the stock increased from US$0.52 per share from the previous session's close to US$1.60. On 20 May the stock opened at US$2.13 and rising as high as US$6.48 per share before closing at US$5.91. On that day 91.46 million ADRs were traded.
Main people[edit]
Prima's CEO since July 2014 has been Marc Voigt,[20] a German national who runs the company from its Berlin office. Frédéric Triebel serves as Chief Scientific and Medical Officer, working from the Paris office and laboratory. The Prima board is chaired by the Australian businesswoman Lucy Turnbull and includes Russell Howard.
Locations[edit]
Prima BioMed has office space in Berlin on Brandenburgische Straße in the Wilmersdorf district near the Konstanzer Straße U-Bahn station. Immutep had laboratories and office space at Orsay, a southwestern suburb of Paris, and this has been maintained by Prima BioMed. There is also an office on Macquarie Street, Sydney.
Leadership history[edit]
Prima BioMed's first two CEOs were Marcus Clark (2001–2006)[21] and Eugene Kopp (2006–2008). In October 2007 the Sydney-based bioentrepreneur Martin Rogers became an Executive Director and he led the company as managing director or CEO through to 2012. An American named Matt Lehman was CEO to 2014 before he was replaced by the current incumbent, Marc Voigt.
