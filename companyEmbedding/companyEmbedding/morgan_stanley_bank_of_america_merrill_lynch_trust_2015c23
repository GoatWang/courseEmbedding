                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
�
The MSBAM 2015-C23 mortgage pool includes the following mortgage loans, each of which is serviced pursuant to a separate pooling and servicing agreement (each, an �Outside Pooling and Servicing Agreement�):
�
��������� the TKG 3 Retail Portfolio mortgage loan, which as of July 8, 2015 is serviced pursuant to the MSC 2015-MS1 pooling and servicing agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 4.4;
�
��������� the Hilton Garden Inn W 54th Street mortgage loan, which is serviced pursuant to the MSBAM 2015-C22 pooling and servicing agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 4.2; and
�
��������� the US StorageMart Portfolio mortgage loan, which is serviced pursuant to the CGBAM 2015-SMRT trust and servicing agreement attached hereto as Exhibit 4.3.
�
Except as set forth below, each of the parties to each pooling and servicing agreement listed in the Exhibit Index both (1) participates in the servicing function for purposes of Item 1122 of Regulation AB and (2) constitutes a servicer that meets the criteria in Item 1108(a)(2)(i) through (iii) of Regulation AB for purposes of Item 1123 of Regulation AB:
�
�����The trustee under a pooling and servicing agreement has a nominal role with respect to the mortgage pool securitized pursuant to such pooling and servicing agreement.� The trustee�s only servicing function is the contingent obligation to make certain advances if the master servicer under such pooling and servicing agreement fails to do so, while all other servicing functions are performed by other parties.� The trustee under each of the pooling and servicing agreements listed in the Exhibit Index has confirmed to the registrant that it has not made any such contingent advances during the reporting period, and consequently, each such trustee does not participate in the servicing function for purposes of Item 1122 of Regulation AB, nor does it
perform the functions of a servicer for purposes of the definition of �servicer� under Item 1101 of Regulation AB or for purposes of Item 1123 of Regulation AB.
�
�����The certificate administrator under a pooling and servicing agreement performs various payment administration functions solely for the securitization governed by such pooling and servicing agreement and the mortgage pool securitized pursuant to such pooling and servicing agreement and does not have any obligations with respect to any other transaction.� Consequently, the certificate administrator under an Outside Pooling and Servicing Agreement does not participate in the servicing function for purposes of Item 1122 of Regulation AB, nor does it perform the functions of a servicer for purposes of the definition of �servicer� under Item 1101 of Regulation AB or for purposes of Item 1123 of Regulation AB.
�
�����The trust advisor under a pooling and servicing agreement represents the interests of senior certificateholders in the transaction governed by such pooling and servicing agreement and is responsible for monitoring the performance of the special servicer under such pooling and servicing agreement and producing certain reports to certificateholders relating to the resolution of the mortgage pool securitized pursuant to such pooling and servicing agreement.� The trust advisor under a pooling and servicing agreement does not have any obligations with respect to any other transaction and is solely obligated to perform loan reporting functions with respect to the securitization governed by such pooling and servicing agreement.� Consequently, the trust advisor under an Outside Pooling and Servicing Agreement neither participates in the servicing function for purposes of Item 1122 of
Regulation AB nor performs the functions of a servicer for purposes of the definition of �servicer� under Item 1101 of Regulation AB or for purposes of Item 1123 of Regulation AB.� In addition, while the trust advisor under a pooling and servicing agreement has certain reporting obligations in respect of the related mortgage pool, it has no obligation to collect or disburse funds in respect of the mortgage pool or to administer any of the underlying mortgage loans.� Consequently, the trust advisor under a pooling and servicing agreement participates in the servicing function for purposes of Item 1122 of Regulation AB, but is not responsible for the �management or collection of the pool assets or making allocations or distributions to holders of the asset-backed securities� within the meaning of �servicer� under Item 1101 of Regulation AB and does not perform the functions of a servicer for purposes of Item 1123 of Regulation AB.� 
�
�����Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas is the custodian under the CGBAM 2015-SMRT trust and servicing agreement, pursuant to which the US StorageMart Portfolio mortgage loan is serviced.� Because Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas is not the MSBAM 2015-C23 custodian, is not affiliated with any sponsor and services only the US StorageMart Portfolio mortgage loan, which constitutes less than 5% of the mortgage pool, Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, as CGBAM 2015-SMRT custodian does not constitute a reporting �servicing function participant� for purposes of Item 1122 of Regulation AB, as specified in the Instruction 3 to Item 1122, and does not constitute a reporting �servicer� for purposes of Item 1123 of Regulation AB, as specified in the Instruction to Item 1123.� 
�
In addition, each of the following parties engaged the services of certain servicing function participants and sub-servicers for the reporting period, as set forth below:
�
�����Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as master servicer, engaged the services of (i) CoreLogic Commercial Real Estate Services, Inc. and National Tax Search, LLC, in each case as a servicing function participant in respect of the entire mortgage pool for the reporting period, and (ii) Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC, as servicing function participant in respect of 5.56% of the mortgage pool for the reporting period.
�
Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as master servicer under the MSBAM 2015-C22 pooling and servicing agreement, pursuant to which the Hilton Garden Inn W 54th Street mortgage loan is serviced, engaged the services of CoreLogic Commercial Real Estate Services, Inc. and National Tax Search, LLC, in each case as a servicing function participant in respect of the Hilton Garden Inn W 54th Street mortgage loan for the reporting period.

�
On June 18, 2014, a group of institutional investors filed a civil complaint in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, New York County, against Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., in its capacity as trustee under 276 residential mortgage backed securities (�RMBS�) trusts, which was later amended on July 18, 2014, to increase the number of trusts to 284 RMBS trusts. On November 24, 2014, the plaintiffs filed a motion to voluntarily dismiss the state court action without prejudice. That same day, a group of institutional investors filed a civil complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (the �District Court�) against Wells Fargo Bank, alleging claims against the bank in its capacity as trustee for 274 RMBS trusts (the �Complaint�).
In December 2014, the plaintiffs� motion to voluntarily dismiss their original state court action was granted. As with the prior state court action, the Complaint is one of six similar complaints filed contemporaneously against RMBS trustees (Deutsche Bank, Citibank, HSBC, Bank of New York Mellon and US Bank) by a group of institutional investor plaintiffs. The Complaint against Wells Fargo Bank alleges that the trustee caused losses to investors and asserts causes of action based upon, among other things, the trustee's alleged failure to (i) enforce repurchase obligations of mortgage loan sellers for purported breaches of representations and warranties, (ii) notify investors of alleged events of default purportedly caused by breaches by mortgage loan servicers, and (iii) abide by appropriate standards of care following alleged events of default. Relief sought includes money damages in an unspecified amount, reimbursement of expenses, and equitable relief. Other cases
(collectively, the �Additional Complaints�) alleging similar causes of action have been filed against Wells Fargo Bank and other trustees in the same court by RMBS investors in these and other transactions, and these cases have been consolidated before the same judge. On January 19, 2016, an order was entered in connection with the Complaint in which the District Court declined to exercise jurisdiction over 261 trusts at issue in the Complaint; the District Court also allowed Plaintiffs to file amended complaints if they so chose, and three amended complaints have been filed. There can be no assurances as to the outcome of the litigation, or the possible impact of the litigation on the trustee or the RMBS trusts. However, Wells Fargo Bank denies liability and believes that it has performed its obligations under the RMBS trusts in good faith, that its actions were not the cause of any losses to investors, and that
it has meritorious defenses, and it intends to contest the plaintiffs� claims vigorously.
�
On February 23, 2016, a certificateholder of the J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust, Series 2007-CIBC18 (the �CIBC18 Trust�), filed suit in the Supreme Court of New York, County of New York, against KeyBank National Association and Berkadia Commercial Mortgage LLC (collectively, the �CIBC18 Servicers�). The suit was filed derivatively on behalf of the CIBC18 Trust. The action was brought in connection with the CIBC18 Servicers� determination of the fair value of a loan, secured by the Bryant Park Hotel in New York City, held by the CIBC18 Trust and sold to an assignee of the CIBC18 Trust�s directing certificateholder, pursuant to an exercise of the fair value option. There can be no assurances as to the outcome of the action or the possible impact of the litigation on the CIBC18 Servicers. Both CIBC18 Servicers deny liability, believe that they
performed their obligations in accordance with the terms of the pooling and servicing agreement applicable to the CIBC18 Trust, and intend to contest the claims asserted against them.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
