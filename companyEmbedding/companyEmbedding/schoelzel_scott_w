INVESTING WITH
INVESTING WITH;Scott W. Schoelzel: Idex II Growth Fund


By CAROLE GOULD


Published: December 31, 1995









                    TO Scott W. Schoelzel of Janus Capital, the choppy stock market in mid-December was a great gift, a chance to scoop up his favorite growth stocks at bargain prices.        

                    That's because the stocks he owned had become expensive by the end of November, and so he sold some shares to lighten his load. As a result, his cash position swelled to 22 percent of assets from his usual target of 15 percent. "As a general rule, I like to keep a fair amount of cash available because there is so much volatility in these markets," he explained in a recent  interview.        

                    So when the Dow industrials dropped 150 points in a couple of days, it was not a painful event but a welcome one. Mr. Schoelzel (pronounced shol-ZEL) picked up shares in Johnson & Johnson, Hospitality Franchise Systems, U.S. Robotics and Shiva, a technology company, at prices he found much more reasonable.        

                    That strategy -- adding to long-term positions during market dips -- is one of the hallmarks of Mr. Schoelzel's investing style, which emphasizes companies  with rapid growth in earnings. It has served him well at the three Idex funds that he manages for Janus from Denver. The funds, which he took over from Tom Marsico nearly two years ago, have gained 16.4 percent a year, on average, during his tenure, compared with 13.4 percent for all growth funds. Mr. Schoelzel also runs more than $73 million in pension and private accounts. Of his funds, Idex II Growth is the largest, at $512 million. The original fund, Idex, and Idex 3, which is now closed, carry huge sales charges of 8.5 percent each. The sales charge for Idex II Growth is a substantial 5.5 percent.        

                    Investors who prefer the no-load route will soon have their own opportunities. Mr. Schoelzel has added a fund, called Olympus, that is set to begin trading on Tuesday without a sales charge. Olympus will let him choose among small, midsize and large companies, both here and abroad. It will also be  more aggressive than the Idex funds, which avoid small stocks. No matter what the group of stocks, Mr. Schoelzel is a traditional growth manager. "When someone asks me what I look for in a company, the answer is almost always, 'earnings, earnings, earnings,' " he said.        

                    Even fast-growing companies with high price-earnings ratios don't scare him away as long as the growth appears sustainable. In particular, he looks at whether earnings growth stems from rising revenues or corporate cost-cutting. "I'm biased toward growing the top line, which really indicates the health of the business," he said.        

                    Though he buys stocks that are rapidly gaining in price, Mr. Schoelzel does not consider himself a momentum investor because he tends to own positions for a long time. As an example, he points to the three years he ran Founders Growth, which outperformed its peers in that time, before he joined Janus. "If you look  at my Founders portfolio and what I own now, you'd think I'd been on vacation for five years," he said.        

                    At the Idex funds, the turnover rate -- or percentage of stocks that are replaced each year -- averages 70 percent, but most of that can be attributed to trimming core positions when the price seems right. "I'm a big believer that you get big returns not in three or four weeks but in three or four years," he said.        

                    As such, he buys new stocks slowly, perhaps in a chunk equal to half of 1 percent of the fund. Then "as the story unfolds, I'll continue to add to it," completing the initial purchase over six months, he said. After that, it is a question of watching the market, selling shares when prices get too high and adding more when prices dip.        

                    He generally plies his trade in sectors he knows well: pharmaceuticals, health care, telecommunications, technology and financial services.        

                    Excited About Java        

                    One of his favorite stocks is Sun Microsystems, which he called a "pure play on the proliferation of the Internet and distributed computing architectures."        

                    The most excitement is about Sun's computer language called Java, which has been licensed by Microsoft, I.B.M. and others and can be used to write applications that run across the Internet or on any type of computer. In hardware, an upgrade of Sun's Sunspark work station, called Ultraspark, is a powerful new product as well.        

                    What about those ever important revenues? Mr. Schoelzel expects 17 percent growth at Sun next year. The company's stock, at its recent price of $47.50, may seem expensive to some. But using Mr. Schoelzel's earnings estimate of $2.50 a share next year, the stock is trading at less than 20 times earnings. While shares of Sun are selling at a multiple just over the market, the company can expect earnings growth of 35 to 40 percent a year, he said.        

                    "Most important, the mix of their business is starting to richen as they move from hardware to a larger and larger software component, which has much bigger margins," Mr. Schoelzel said.        

                    Focus on Health Care        

                    Among the high fliers in his portfolios are companies that design and sell computerized information systems for the health care industry, which Mr. Schoelzel says is woefully behind on the technology curve. HBO & Company, of Atlanta, not only creates systems, but also sets up and manages data processing offices for hospitals. The company's stock, which opened the year just over $34 a share, sells for about $74. Given the tremendous amount of business that the company is bidding on now, Mr. Schoelzel said, he expects earnings to reach $1.95 a share next year. Using that earnings estimate, the company is selling at more than 35 times earnings.        

                    Buying Hospitality Franchise        

                    Mr. Schoelzel has been buying more shares recently in Hospitality Franchise  Systems, which provides advertising, reservations systems and other types of support to franchisees of six motel chains, including Howard Johnson and Days Inn. Through a series of preferred providers, the company markets a variety of products, like a rental car to someone who calls to make a hotel reservation, Mr. Schoelzel said.        

                    The company also provides support services to 6,000 Century 21 real estate franchises, and it recently announced an agreement to develop Days Inn properties in China and Hong Kong.        

                    Again, some aggressive growth projections come rushing out. Mr. Schoelzel expects the company to earn $1.43 a share for 1995, $2.21 next year and $3.16 in 1997. The stock, now trading at $79, "can trade at 30 times our '97 figure, which would be $95 to $100 a share," he said. Hospitality Franchise does not show up in the Idex funds because the company's market capitalization was less than $1 billion when he started buying it, Mr. Schoelzel said. But the company, now valued at $4 billion, shows up in his private accounts. And small stocks of all sorts will be fodder for the new Olympus fund.        

                    At the end of the year, his portfolio remains a bit heavy in cash. "I'm not uncomfortable going into the new year light," he said, because a cut in capital  gains taxes could lead to a selloff and push down prices, creating more of his favorite buying opportunities. Longer term, though, he is positive on the market, in part because of the decline in bond yields, which he expects to make  stocks more attractive.        

                    Photo: Scott W. Schoelzel, 37, invests in companies with rapid earningsgrowth. Now he's buying Sun Microsystems, HBO & Company and Hospitality Franchise.
