The fund has adopted a managed distribution plan. The fund's managed distribution rate is 8.00%.
		





The fund has adopted a managed distribution plan. Under a managed distribution plan, to the extent that sufficient investment income is not available on a monthly basis, the fund will distribute long-term capital gains and/or return of capital in order to maintain its managed distribution level. You should not draw any conclusions about the fund's investment performance from the amount of the fund's distributions or from the terms of the fund's managed distribution plan. The Board of the fund may amend the terms of the plan or terminate the plan at any time without prior notice to the fund's shareholders. The amendment or termination of a plan could have an adverse effect on the market price of the fund's common shares. The plan will be subject to periodic review by the Board. With each distribution that does not consist solely of net investment income, the fund will issue a notice to shareholders and an accompanying press release which will provide detailed information regarding the amount and composition of the distribution and other related information. The amounts and sources of distributions reported in the notice to shareholders are only estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes will depend upon the fund's investment experience during its full fiscal year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The fund will send shareholders a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell them how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. The fund may at times distribute more than its net investment income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of the distribution may result in a return of capital. A return of capital may occur, for example, when some or all of the money that shareholders invested in the fund is paid back to them. A return of capital does not necessarily reflect a fund's investment performance and should not be confused with 'yield' or 'income'. Any such returns of capital will decrease the fund's total assets and, therefore, could have the effect of increasing the fund's expense ratio. In addition, in order to make the level of distributions called for under its plan, the fund may have to sell portfolio securities at a less than opportune time. For estimated source information for distributions paid in prior periods, please see
		

	Dividend Source Information
	






			1
		 
Other may contain sources of income other than ordinary income, such as short term capital gains, long term capital gains, or return of capital. Distributions that are treated for federal income tax purposes as a return of capital will reduce a shareholder's tax basis in his or her shares and, to the extent the distribution exceeds a shareholder's adjusted tax basis, will be treated as a gain to the shareholder from a sale of shares. Please see the funds' dividend source card for the breakdown of the estimated sources of distributions in prior periods by clicking on the link above labeled Dividend Source Information.
		





The amount of distributions may vary depending on a number of factors. As portfolio and market conditions change, the rate of distributions could change.
		

















The Funds are closed-end Funds.  Common shares of the Funds are only available for purchase/sale on the NYSE at the current market price(NYSE-MKT for MFS California Municipal Fund). Shares of the Funds are not FDIC-insured and are not deposits or other obligations of, or guaranteed by, any bank.  Shares of the Funds involve investment risk, including possible loss of principal.  For more complete information about each Fund, including risks, charges, and expenses, please see the Fund's annual and semi annual shareholder report or contact your financial adviser.

      The above funds have adopted a managed distribution plan. Under a 
      managed distribution plan, to the extent that sufficient investment 
      income is not available on a monthly basis, the fund will distribute 
      long-term capital gains and/or return of capital in order to maintain 
      its managed distribution level. Investors should not draw any 
      conclusions about the fund’s investment performance from the amount of 
      the fund’s distributions or from the terms of the fund’s managed 
      distribution plan.
    

      The Board of the fund may amend the terms of the plan or terminate the 
      plan at any time without prior notice to the fund's shareholders. The 
      amendment or termination of a plan could have an adverse effect on the 
      market price of the fund’s common shares. The plan will be subject to 
      periodic review by the Board. With each distribution that does not 
      consist solely of net investment income, the fund will issue a notice to 
      shareholders and an accompanying press release which will provide 
      detailed information regarding the amount and estimated composition of 
      the distribution and other related information.
    

      The amounts and sources of distributions reported above are only 
      estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The 
      actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes 
      will depend upon the fund’s investment experience during its full fiscal 
      year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The fund 
      will send shareholders a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will 
      tell them how to report these distributions for federal income tax 
      purposes. The fund may at times distribute more than its net investment 
      income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of the 
      distribution may result in a return of capital. A return of capital may 
      occur, for example, when some or all of the money that shareholders 
      invested in the fund is paid back to them. A return of capital does not 
      necessarily reflect a fund’s investment performance and should not be 
      confused with ‘yield’ or ‘income’. Any such returns of capital will 
      decrease the fund's total assets and, therefore, could have the effect 
      of increasing the fund's expense ratio. In addition, in order to make 
      the level of distributions called for under its plan, the fund may have 
      to sell portfolio securities at a less than opportune time.

      The above funds have adopted a managed distribution plan. Under a 
      managed distribution plan, to the extent that sufficient investment 
      income is not available on a monthly basis, the fund will distribute 
      long-term capital gains and/or return of capital in order to maintain 
      its managed distribution level. Investors should not draw any 
      conclusions about the fund’s investment performance from the amount of 
      the fund’s distributions or from the terms of the fund’s managed 
      distribution plan.
    

      The Board of the fund may amend the terms of the plan or terminate the 
      plan at any time without prior notice to the fund's shareholders. The 
      amendment or termination of a plan could have an adverse effect on the 
      market price of the fund’s common shares. The plan will be subject to 
      periodic review by the Board. With each distribution that does not 
      consist solely of net investment income, the fund will issue a notice to 
      shareholders and an accompanying press release which will provide 
      detailed information regarding the amount and estimated composition of 
      the distribution and other related information.
    

      The amounts and sources of distributions reported above are only 
      estimates and are not being provided for tax reporting purposes. The 
      actual amounts and sources of the amounts for tax reporting purposes 
      will depend upon the fund’s investment experience during its full fiscal 
      year and may be subject to changes based on tax regulations. The fund 
      will send shareholders a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will 
      tell them how to report these distributions for federal income tax 
      purposes. The fund may at times distribute more than its net investment 
      income and net realized capital gains; therefore, a portion of the 
      distribution may result in a return of capital. A return of capital may 
      occur, for example, when some or all of the money that shareholders 
      invested in the fund is paid back to them. A return of capital does not 
      necessarily reflect a fund’s investment performance and should not be 
      confused with ‘yield’ or ‘income’. Any such returns of capital will 
      decrease the fund's total assets and, therefore, could have the effect 
      of increasing the fund's expense ratio. In addition, in order to make 
      the level of distributions called for under its plan, the fund may have 
      to sell portfolio securities at a less than opportune time.

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for MFS Multimarket Income Trust (NYSE:MMT) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: No ratings tracked in the last 12 months.Consensus Rating:N/A (Score: NaN)Consensus Price Target: N/A

The Exchange Traded Funds prospectus contains its investment objectives, risks, charges, expenses and other important information you should read and consider carefully prior to making an investment decision.
        Please review the current prospectus, available from the Prospectus link on www.motifinvesting.com, by phone at 1-855-586-6843, or in writing at Motif Investing, Inc., P.O. Box 3548, Rancho Cordova, CA  95741.
ETFs have unique features that you should be aware of, which can include distribution of any gains, risks related to securities within the portfolio, and tax consequences. The data quoted herein represents past performance and is not indicative of future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that your investment, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original value. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data provided.  Please review the prospectus or other research tools provided on this site for more recent information. Contact Motif Investing at 1-855-586-6843 to obtain the most recent month-end performance data.
The 30-Day SEC Yield reflects the dividends and interest earned during the past 30 days after the deduction of the ETF’s expenses.  The 30-day SEC Yield is an annual percentage rate based on the ETF's share price and is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share for the 30 days ended on the date of calculation by that day’s maximum share price.  The Distribution Yield is the trailing 12-Month End Yield derived by adding the trailing 12-month's income distributions and dividing the total by the last month's ending share price. Income refers to interest payments from fixed-income ETFs and dividend payments from stock-based ETFs.
The ETF prospectus is provided by DFS (http://www.rrdonnelley.com/financial-services/). The use of this prospectus is restricted solely to the website of Motif Investing and may not be redistributed, copied or otherwise made available without the express written consent of DFS.

Fixed income investments are subject to various unique risks, including changes in credit quality, market valuations, liquidity, prepayments, early redemption,
    corporate events, tax ramifications, and other factors. Fixed income securities are subject to increased loss of principal during periods of rising interest rates.


The 1-Year Return/Return Since Inception indicates the performance of this particular motif over the last 12 months or, if the motif was created within the past 12 months, since the date the motif was created. See how we calculate returns.


The Motif Index level represents the performance of a benchmark motif (a motif in our catalog) over time. It is set at 
1000 on the date of inception of the motif. For example, a Motif Index of 1100 represents a 10% return since inception. Similarly, the change in the Index over a 
specified period represents the period return on the portfolio holding the same share weights as the benchmark motif.
The Motif Index is a measure created and maintained by the firm, which has the discretion to change the holdings that comprise the index and to make alterations to a particular Motif Index.


Popularity shows you how much interest a motif is attracting, compared to other motifs. We base this score on a proprietary formula that uses factors like how many people are viewing the motif, and how much conversation about it is happening in the community, in a range from Low-to-High.
The Volatility measurement for a Motif represents the annualized standard deviation of daily returns on a portfolio holding the same share weights as the Motif, and is measured in a range from Low to High. Since the standard deviation of returns are commonly used as a measure of portfolio risk, a Volatility measurement that is High is indicative of the fact that holding the motif in the past subjected the holder to larger fluctuations or higher risk.
The Valuation metric represents the present valuation of the stocks in the motif relative to the broader equity market. The Valuation metric is calculated as the composite Price-to-Earnings ratio for the stocks in the motif weighted by their respective share weights in a range from Low to High.


Standard pricing: $9.95 total commission per motif transaction. Other fees may apply. For details on fees and commissions, please

        Performance returns indicate the performance of a particular security over that stated period of time as of the date provided. Performance is quoted for informational purposes only, however, there is no guarantee those returns will continue. See how we calculate returns.
    

        Performance returns, including 1-month Return/Return Since Inception/1-year returns indicates the performance of this particular motif over that stated period of time as of the date provided. Performance is quoted for informational purposes only, however, there is no guarantee those returns will continue. See how we calculate returns.
    
System response time and account access times may vary due to a variety of factors, including trading volumes, market conditions, system performance, and other factors.

Investing in securities involves risks, you should be aware of prior to making an investment decision, including the possible loss of principal. An investment in individual stocks, or a collection of stocks
    focused on a particular theme or idea, such as a motif, may be subject to increased risk of price fluctuation over more diversified holdings due to adverse developments which can affect a particular industry or sector.
    Investments in ETFs can include those with a narrow or targeted investment strategy and can be subject to similar sector risks than more broadly diversified investments.
    Motif makes no representation regarding the suitability of a particular investment or investment strategy.  You are responsible for all investment decisions you make including understanding the risks involved with your
    investment strategy.
