        Improvement Act of 1996 ("NSMIA") [Pub. L. No. 104-290, 110 Stat. 3416 (Oct. 11, 1996)] imposes on the ability of States to

invalidate or reduce (or support directly or indirectly any other person or
entity in any such objection, challenge or contest) the existence, validity or
amount of the Total Debt, the obligations under the Transactions Documents or
the Collateral Documents or any lien granted to secure such obligations to the

      shall be deemed to be Notes and Warrants of such Lender governed by the
      terms and conditions of this Agreement and the Collateral Documents, (and
      the benefits thereunder) as if such Excluded Securities were held by such
      Lender as of the date of this Agreement (but only for so long as such
      Excluded Securities are held by such Lender). The Pro Rata share of any
      Lender that acquires Notes from an .Excluded Noteholder (or that transfers

  accordingly.

before a Dismissal Order (if any) is entered as provided above, in each case, to
the fullest extent possible each of the Parties shall be restored to the
position it held immediately before the Agreement Date, the Escrow Documents
shall be of no further force or effect, and SRZ shall return the Escrow

by all Lenders.

Sheet") on or before thirty (30) days after the Dismissal

Section
1.3                                Elimination of

punctually paid when due, the Guarantor shall, immediately upon demand by the
Lenders pay in lawful money of the United States of America, the amounts due to

shall be deemed made, given and received in accordance with the notice
provisions hereof.

Section
1.7                                No Duty To Pursue
Others. It.shall not be necessary for the Lenders (and the Guarantor
hereby waives any rights that the Guarantor may have to require the Lenders), in

institute suit or exhaust its remedies against EBOF or any Subsidiary or others

receivership or other debtor relief law, or any judgment, order or decision
thereunder, the Lenders must rescind or restore any payment, or any part
thereof, received by the Lenders in satisfaction of the obligations hereunder,
any prior release or discharge from the terms of this Guaranty given to the
Guarantor by the Lenders shall be without effect, and this Guaranty shall remain
in full force and effect. It is the intention of the Guarantor that the
Guarantor's obligations hereunder shall not be discharged except by the
Guarantor's indefeasible payment of such obligations and then only to the extent
of such performance.

Section
1.10                                Waiver of Subrogation.
Reimbursement and Contribution. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Guaranty, Guarantor hereby unconditionally and irrevocably
waives, releases and abrogates any and all rights it may now or hereafter have
under any agreement, at law or in equity (including, without limitation, any law
subrogating the Guarantor to the rights of the Lenders), to assert any claim
against or seek contribution, indemnification or any other form of reimbursement
from EBOF, its Subsidiaries, or any other party liable for payment of any or all

Mr.
Dennis McLaughlin, being duly sworn, deposes and says:

1.           I
am the Chief Executive Officer of Earth Biofuels, Inc. ("EBOF") the Defendant in
the above-entitled action, whose corporate address is 3001 Knox Street, Suite
403, Dallas, TX 75205.

2.           I
am authorized by EBOF to confess judgment on EBOF's behalf, in favor of
plaintiff, Portside Growth and Opportunity Fund ("Portside") for the sum of
$1,916,246 (as of September 28, 2007);

3.           Pursuant
to Section 3218 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules, I hereby confess
judgment on EBOF's behalf, in favor of Portside for $1,916,246 (as of September
28, 2007), and authorize it and its parents, subsidiaries, affiliates, agents,
representatives, attorneys, executors, administrators, directors, officers,
shareholders, employees, successors, assigns, predecessors, transferees, and
insurers to enter judgment in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County
of New York, against EBOF in the amount of $1,916,246 (as of September 28,
2007).

4.           This
confession of judgment is for a debt due and owing to Portside, and arises under
certain a promissory note dated July 24, 2006 issued pursuant to a Securities
Purchase Agreement dated July 24, 2006 (the "Transaction
Documents").

5.           The
debt is unconditionally due and owing to Portside by virtue of numerous events
of default arising under the Transaction Documents which have been acknowledged
by EBOF in an interim restructuring agreement dated November 13, 2007 (the
"Interim Restructuring Agreement") and as such are undisputed.




 



55





 



6.           Pursuant
to the Interim Restructuring Agreement, EBOF also agreed and acknowledged that
it is indebted to Portside in the amount of $1,916,246 (as of September 28,
2007), and confesses judgment herein on that debt.

7.           Further,
as set forth in Section 3 of the Interim Restructuring Agreement if EBOF failed
to meet the conditions set forth in Section 3 of the Interim Restructuring
Agreement by the dates specified therein, then EBOF authorized Portside to file
this Affidavit of Confession of Judgment in which EBOF confesses judgment in
favor of Portside and against EBOF in the amount of $1,916,246 (as of September
28, 2007).

8.           This
confession of judgment does not violate section 3201 of the New York Civil
Practice Law and Rules because it was "not executed prior to the time a default
in the payment of an installment occurs in connection with the purchase of
fifteen hundred dollars or less of any commodities for any use other than a
commercial or business use upon any plan of deferred payments whereby the price
or cost is payable in two or more installments."

9.           This
confession of judgment is not for the purpose of securing plaintiff against a
contingent liability.

ARTICLE
I

NATURE
AND SCOPE OF GUARANTY

Section
1.1                                Guaranty of
Debt.              Each
Guarantor hereby irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees for the ratable
benefit5 of each Lender the prompt payment of each such
Lender's Pro Rata Share of the Total Debt, which shall be immediately due and
payable upon any of the following events:.

(a)           prior
to the Restructuring Consummation Deadline. (as defined in section 1.2(e)
below), either (x) an order for relief is entered in a case under the Bankruptcy
Code with respect to McLaughlin, EBOF, or any Subsidiary, or (y) an involuntary
bankruptcy petition is filed against EBOF or any Subsidiary and such petition is
not dismissed on or. before sixty (60) days after the date such petition is
filed;

(b)           failure
of EBOF to execute security documents (in form and substance acceptable to the
Lenders holding 662/3 of the
aggregate face amount of the Notes then outstanding (the “Required Lenders”) as
determined by the Required Lenders in their sole discretion) sufficient to
provide the Lenders with liens, subject only to any then-valid existing liens,
on all of EBOF's assets to secure EBOF's obligations under the Confessions of
Judgment and/or the Transaction Documents on or. before ten (10) days after the
date that, the order dismissing the Bankruptcy Case is entered on the
docket6;

(c)           failure
of all of the Subsidiaries to execute security documents (in form and substance
acceptable to the Required Lenders as determined by the Required Lenders in
their sole discretion), in favor of the Lenders, subject only to any then-valid
existing liens,

securing
their respective obligations under the guaranty by the Subsidiaries on or before
ten (10) days after the Dismissal Date;



  
5 The
ratable benefit will be determined by calculating the Lender's pro rata share
("Pro Rata
Share"), which means the ratio determined by dividing (x) the face amount
of the Notes then held by such Lender by (y) the face amount of Notes then held
by all Lenders.

  
6 The date
that the order dismissing the Bankruptcy Case is entered on the docket and such
order is not subject to any stay shall be referred to herein as the "Dismissal
Date."



 



63





 



(d)           failure

submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts sitting in
The City of New York, Borough of Manhattan, for the adjudication of any dispute
hereunder or in connection herewith or with any transaction contemplated hereby
or discussed herein, and hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert in
any suit, action or proceeding, any claim that it is not personally subject to
the jurisdiction of any such court, that such suit, action or proceeding is
brought in an inconvenient forum or that the venue of such suit, action or
proceeding is improper. Each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives personal
service of process and consents to process being served in any such suit, action
or proceeding by mailing a copy thereof to such party at the address for such
notices to it under this Guaranty and agrees that such service shall constitute
good and sufficient service of process and notice thereof. Nothing contained

Claims. In the event that a Lender acquires (and continues to hold) the
Notes and Warrants (the "Excluded Securities")
under the Transaction Document of a Noteholder that is not a signatory hereto
(an "Excluded
Noteholder"), such Excluded Securities acquired (and held) by such Lender
shall be deemed to be Notes and Warrants of such Lender governed by the terms
and conditions of this Guaranty and the Collateral Documents (and the benefits
hereunder) as if such Excluded Securities were held by such Lender as of the
date of this Guaranty (but only for so long as such Excluded Securities are held
by such Lender). The Pro Rata Share of any lender that acquires Notes from an
Excluded Noteholder (or that transfers any portion of its Notes) shall be
adjusted accordingly.

Section
