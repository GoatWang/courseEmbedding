“Aspen Meadow Lodge, Sisters B&B”


Reviewed June 16, 2005




Sisters, Oregon, is a beautiful little town to visit, especially when traveling to or from the Oregon Coast. And the Aspen Meadow Lodge is our main reason for staying there. Don and Kathy Zygutis used to manage the Sisters Motor Lodge but now own Aspen Meadow Lodge. The rooms are delightful (we like Snowy River because of its fireplace and patio, with view of the aspen grove), with large deck and extensive grounds, including a new patio area along the creek. But the highlight of your Aspen Meadow stay will be Don's great breakfasts. Not only does he effortlessly prepare a delicious meal, served at a lovely table, he has the knack of making all guests comfortable. You will leave having made new friends. Also, one of the best take-out places we've ever discovered is the Orient Express, located behind the Sisters Market on the main street (W. Cascade). Taking the food back to the Lodge to eat on the deck or in your room is a real summertime treat. The little bakery on Cascade is also a must and The Gallimaufry has got to be one of the most attractive "liquor stores" in the continental United States. The town is chockfull of little shops, including several good antique stores, and a great Mexican food restaurant. The surrounding mountain peaks are magnificent. You won't want to leave..... Enjoy!

“Treehouse living at it's finest!”


Reviewed 4 days ago
NEW 



We stayed at MML in the treehouse on the 2nd leg of our NE trip. We were looking forward to it, but it truly surpassed our expectations in every way. The treehouse itself is absolutely lovely with attention paid to every detail of it's design, including the stunning outdoor shower & sink. While the treehouse is not huge, it was very comfortable for a family of four....so much so, that we all decided that treehouse living was for us! Willie provided us with an absolutely delicious breakfast in the morning, and then we followed Greg's advice and took an "eating tour" of Waterbury. This included an apple cider mill (and doughnuts), Cabot cheese, and Ben & Jerry's Factory tour....there were more possibilities, including Green Mountain Tea and a distillery, but we ran out of steam before we managed to get through them all. We spent some time exploring the charming town of Waterbury including it's shops and restaurants, hiked up to the SkyLoft at the top of Greg & Willie's property to enjoy the stunning views, and spent a fair amount of time just relaxing at the treehouse, with the kids exploring the pond and surrounding property. We even were able to have pizza delivered to the treehouse one night when we were too tired to go out! A wonderful experience - the treehouse is a truly magical oasis, only exceeded by Greg and Willie's charming hospitality. We would absolutely return again and highly recommend the accommodations and the experience!

“Can't wait to go back”


Reviewed 1 week ago




What a unique, tranquil, and picturesque venue! The entire lodge is decorated with Nature's beauty. Our Sled Roomhad a comfy king-size bed, cozy robes, great shower/steam room, and outdoor balcony. The location is perfect for exploring beautiful vista's, along with Ben & Jerry's, Cabot Cheese, CiderMill, Chocolate Factory - all within a couple of miles. Breakfasts were delicious! BEST are the owners, who are SO welcoming, and helpful with any needs. We will definitely visit again, and Iwill keep this in mind as a "special gift" for the person who has everything.

“Lovely stay”


Reviewed 2 weeks ago




Very welcoming, warm hosts, and nothing grandma about this inn. Rustic and luxurious at the same time. Spacious common rooms, and plenty of privacy if you want it. We only stayed one night, but I would be tempted to go back for two, so we could enjoy the grounds more. BYO wine and relax outside on the porch. Very nice breakfast.

“Bucket list achieved at MML!!”


Reviewed 3 weeks ago




We stayed in the Treehouse with our two kids in June 2017. Each of us was enchanted by absolutely everything at Moose Meadow Lodge, and we highly recommend it. Willie & Greg welcomed us warmly as they gave us a full tour of the Lodge, the Treehouse, and their breathtaking property. The hike up to the SkyLoft was awesome on a sunny evening. Our kids loved swinging in the hammock by the pond, and Greg very kindly let them feed the fish numerous times, which was a big hit with them. Breakfast was delicious and memorable on the front porch of the Lodge. We slept like babies in the Treehouse, with the fresh air, stars, and birdsong out the window. It really was a very special visit. It is hard to believe we could ever stay anywhere quite as magical as the Treehouse at MML, and we would like to thank Greg & Willie very much for welcoming us.

“Special getaway weekend”


Reviewed June 7, 2017




Stowe/Waterbury is such a special corner of the world and the Moose Meadow Lodge offers an incredible, restful opportunity to kick back and enjoy all that the area has to offer. The property is stunning and you could not ask for better hosts. Willie and Greg are warm, friendly, and fun but, at the same time, offer plenty of space for privacy as well. We were fortunate enough to stay in the Treehouse, a unique and incredible space that makes you feel a part of your gorgeous surroundings while also offering a host of comforts. Willie is a wonderful chef and serves a beautiful breakfast each day...to boot, he is also a trained masseuse who offers an excellent massage! Thank you so much for sharing your gorgeous lodge with us, Willie and Greg. We are already counting down the days until next time!

“Peaceful place, warm hosts”


Reviewed May 29, 2017



via mobile




We called last minute, and they had a room ready for us within 30 minutes. Host Willie treated us with a delicious iced tea, and gave us a tour of the lodge with a brief history. Greg later joined us with a big bear hug, and a few stories and a great sense of humor. The lodge was fully booked, so we could not stay in the treehouse, but we're in the sled room with a good-size bath with hot steam shower and large closet. I am not a fan of objects hanging over the bed, but the sled were clearly secured to the ceiling.The room was clean and the room carpet soft and cushioned. There was minimal noise from other guests, and the room felt very private. The common areas was well thought out allowing for both quiet individual space, couples and group socialization.While on our rainy stay we were unable to enjoy the view from the Sky Loft, an enclosed gazebo at the top of their mountain, however it was clearly well taken care of and a great vantage point.The lodge decor, especially the kitchen and large covered front porch, is beautifully integrated with the outdoors. Breakfast was delicious and Willie tailored my breakfast to my allergies.As owners, it is clear they are on top of any maintenance needed in the rooms or on the grounds as they had workmen coming to repair a small gap in the seal on the shower door which we did not even notice until Greg mentioned it.My only hesitation is the number of hunting trophies, as I think people and children sensitive to animals would not care to come here. That said, much of the taxidermy display the animals in nature and gave mere chance to see them up close and in detail giving me a better understanding of these beautiful creatures.We hope to stay here again, next time with our kids in the treehouse.

More Hi Carol, Thank you for your inquiry about the Moose Meadow Lodge. The main lodge has 4 guest rooms and can comfortably accomodate 8 adults. If there is a 9th or 10th person we can move a futon into one of the rooms to accommodate two more if four of the people don't mind sharing a room. In the summer time we open our Treehouse which has a queen bed on the upper level. If there are children we have two 3" foam mats we put on the floor on the lower level. Let us know if you have any other questions or if we can help in any other way.

You can think of these as two different company structures with very different tax requirements. Whichever way you choose to go, you're going to look more legit than the other guys. So just take a minute to consider your short-and long-term business goals to figure out which structure is best for you.
Advantages and Disadvantages
A limited liability company is a type of business structure that offers personal liability protections and a few tax advantages to boot. The "LL" in LLC is what protects your personal assets in the event of a judgment against your company. Corporations offer limited liability as well, so we're going to focus on the structural and taxation differences in the chart below.



Advantages of an LLC
Advantages of a Corporation




 No limit on the number of owners
 May issue shares of stock to attract investors


 Profit and loss are passed through to the owners' individual tax returns
 Corporate income splitting may help lower overall tax liability


 No annual meeting or minute book requirements
 






Disadvantages of an LLC
Disadvantages of a Corporation




 Cannot engage in corporate income splitting to lower tax liability
 C corp tax structure requires double taxation of corporate profits (s corp's does not)


 Cannot issue stock
 Must hold annual meetings and record minutes


 
 S corporations have restrictions on the number of owners



LLC or Corporation: Which One Is Right for Me?
Business goals aren't one size fits all, and neither is incorporating. When deciding which kind of corporation fits your business strategy, consider some of the differences that each kind offers. And take a deeper dive with our comprehensive comparison chart.
Find out which corporation is right for your business with our business wizard!

Along with picking the right entity type for your business, it's important to consider which state to incorporate in.
For most small business owners, the choice is simple: they incorporate in the state where their company is physically located, known as 'home state incorporation.' However, there are good reasons to consider forming your corporation or LLC in certain other states, including tax advantages, streamlined judicial processes, and easier business filing requirements.
For example, many business owners choose to incorporate in Delaware, which is a favored business jurisdiction for the previously mentioned and other reasons.

Delaware is widely considered to be one of the nation's most business-friendly jurisdictions. There are a number of reasons to incorporate your small business in Delaware, including:

Well-established and flexible business laws
Low franchise tax on small businesses
No tax on capital stock or assets
No state sales tax
A special business court (Court of Chancery) that minimizes the time and cost of commercial litigation
No residency requirement for shareholders, directors, and officers of a corporation or members or managers of an LLC

Hotel Deals: Up To 60% Off Hotels!
Our advertising partners offer great deals at savings of up to 60%. 


Priceline.com offers savings of up to 60% using their 'Name Your Own Price' program. Priceline's 'Name Your Own Price' reservation system is different from other online travel sites. With Priceline's 'Name Your Own Price' reservation system, the exact hotel is shown only after purchase. Over the last 12 months, a substantial percentage of accepted offers have resulted in savings of up to 60% in comparison to the lowest published rates on other leading online travel sites for the same itinerary. There is no guarantee that hotels, dates or prices will be available and savings are not guaranteed. Actual prices and availability are always subject to change.
You can also save up to 60% at Hotwire with 'Hotwire Hot Rates'. 
These are just two examples of amazing offers our partners are offering. Visit Booking.com, Hotels.com, and many more sites for other super deals.

OneTime allows you to search various partner sites at once so you can compare the prices and options offered. Offers and savings are based on information available on these sites. There is no guarantee that these prices, savings, hotels, or dates will be available at the time of booking. Please check the site for the most recent details. When you book travel, your booking is handled by one of those sites directly, not by OneTime. Transactions, and all subsequent customer care, are directly handled by the site where you booked your travel. OneTime does not control the price, rules, regulations, or restrictions surrounding the price. Please read all rules and regulations before booking.

How does it work?




1



It starts with a booking
The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.







2



Followed by a trip
When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.







3



And finally, a review
After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.

Booking.com is part of The Priceline Group, the world leader in online travel & related services.




























Verified reviews from real guests.We have more than 70 million property reviews, and they're all from real, verified guests.


How does it work?




1



It starts with a booking
The only way to leave a review is to first make a booking. That's how we know our reviews come from real guests who have stayed at the property.







2



Followed by a trip
When guests stay at the property, they check out how quiet the room is, how friendly the staff is, and more.







3



And finally, a review
After their trip, guests tell us about their stay. We check for naughty words and verify the authenticity of all guest reviews before adding them to our site.




If you booked through us and want to leave a review, please sign in first.
