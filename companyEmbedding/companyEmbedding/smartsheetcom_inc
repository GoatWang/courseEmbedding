Smartsheet service[edit]
Smartsheet is used to collaborate on project timelines, documents, calendars, tasks and other work.[2][3] According to IDG, it is "[p]art office productivity, part project management, part document sharing . . . [it] is trying to be the central hub for how people work."[4] Smartsheet combines some of the functionality of Microsoft Excel, Project, Access and Sharepoint.[2][5] It competes with Microsoft Project.[6] As of 2016[update], there were 10 million users in 85,000 organizations.[7]
Features[edit]
According to Forbes, Smartsheet has "a relatively simple" user interface.[2] The interface centers on "smartsheets," which are similar to spreadsheets typically found in Microsoft Excel.[8][9] Each smartsheet can have its rows expanded or collapsed to see individual tasks or large-scale project progress respectively. Tasks can be sorted by deadline, priority or the person assigned to them.[10] If a spreadsheet contains dates, Smartsheet will create a calendar view.[10]
Each row in a smartsheet may have files attached to it, emails stored within it, and a discussion board associated with it.[6][10] When a new smartsheet is created, notifications are pushed out to staff to populate its rows and columns.[11] As information is updated, other smartsheets tracking the same task, project or data-point are updated automatically.[8][9] The service also has alerts for when a task deadline is coming up,[10][12] and keeps track of document versions.[6]
Smartsheet can import data from Microsoft Office or Google applications.[2][6] The software integrates with services like Salesforce.com, Dropbox and Amazon Web Services.[3][12] There is also a Smartsheet mobile app for Android and iPhone operating systems.[9] Smartsheet is sold on a subscription basis with no free version.[9]
History[edit]




Smartsheet's original user interface in 2006


Smartsheet was first introduced in 2006. According to the company's co-founder, Brent Frei, initial adoption was slow because the software was too difficult to use.[13][14] At the end of its first year, it had only 10,000 users.[15] The company began making changes to the software in 2008, eventually cutting 60 percent of its features for the purpose of making it more user-friendly.[2][13] Following the 2010 launch of the redesign, adoption grew to 1 million users at 20,000 organizations by 2012.[13]
Integration with Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft Azure were added in 2014.[16] That October the Account Map tool was introduced, which uses an algorithm to visualize the flow of work across groups of employees.[17][18] In August 2014, version 2.0 of the Smartsheet iOS app was introduced. It made a spreadsheet-like user interface the focus of the app's user interface, whereas previously the mobile interface was different than the spreadsheet-oriented desktop version.[19]
In 2015, Smartsheet started introducing closer integrations with Microsoft Office products, in part thanks to changes Microsoft was making in their products to work better with third-party software.[20][21] In January 2015, Smartsheet added support for Microsoft's identity management software Azure Active Directory, which allowed users to log into products like Excel and Smartsheet with the same login.[21][22] Users can also now make changes to smartsheets directly from Microsoft Outlook.[20] In 2016 Smartsheet introduced Sights, a configurable dashboard that shows metrics such as how a team is performing against key performance indicators.[4]
Smartsheet.com, Inc.[edit]
Smartsheet.com, Inc. is a private company that develops and markets the Smartsheet application. As of 2017, it has about 550 employees[23] and is headquartered in Bellevue, Washington[24] The company was founded in the summer of 2006, shortly after co-founder Brent Frei sold his prior company, Onyx Software.[2][15][25] Initially it was funded mostly by Frei.[2] About a year after its founding, Smartsheet had raised $4 million in funding and had just nine employees.[15] By early 2012 it had raised $8.2 million in funding over three rounds and hired its first salesperson.[12][13]
After the Smartsheet software was redesigned in 2010, the company's revenues grew by more than 100 percent each year, for four consecutive years.[26] It raised $26 million in funding in December 2012[3][13] and another $35 million in May 2014.[12] In 2017, the company raised an additional $52.1 million in funding.[23]

After the Smartsheet software was redesigned in 2010, the company's revenues grew by more than 100 percent each year, for four consecutive years.[26] It raised $26 million in funding in December 2012[3][13] and another $35 million in May 2014.[12] In 2017, the company raised an additional $52.1 million in funding.[23]

Smartsheet service[edit]
Smartsheet is used to collaborate on project timelines, documents, calendars, tasks and other work.[2][3] According to IDG, it is "[p]art office productivity, part project management, part document sharing . . . [it] is trying to be the central hub for how people work."[4] Smartsheet combines some of the functionality of Microsoft Excel, Project, Access and Sharepoint.[2][5] It competes with Microsoft Project.[6] As of 2016[update], there were 10 million users in 85,000 organizations.[7]
Features[edit]
According to Forbes, Smartsheet has "a relatively simple" user interface.[2] The interface centers on "smartsheets," which are similar to spreadsheets typically found in Microsoft Excel.[8][9] Each smartsheet can have its rows expanded or collapsed to see individual tasks or large-scale project progress respectively. Tasks can be sorted by deadline, priority or the person assigned to them.[10] If a spreadsheet contains dates, Smartsheet will create a calendar view.[10]
Each row in a smartsheet may have files attached to it, emails stored within it, and a discussion board associated with it.[6][10] When a new smartsheet is created, notifications are pushed out to staff to populate its rows and columns.[11] As information is updated, other smartsheets tracking the same task, project or data-point are updated automatically.[8][9] The service also has alerts for when a task deadline is coming up,[10][12] and keeps track of document versions.[6]
Smartsheet can import data from Microsoft Office or Google applications.[2][6] The software integrates with services like Salesforce.com, Dropbox and Amazon Web Services.[3][12] There is also a Smartsheet mobile app for Android and iPhone operating systems.[9] Smartsheet is sold on a subscription basis with no free version.[9]
History[edit]




Smartsheet's original user interface in 2006


Smartsheet was first introduced in 2006. According to the company's co-founder, Brent Frei, initial adoption was slow because the software was too difficult to use.[13][14] At the end of its first year, it had only 10,000 users.[15] The company began making changes to the software in 2008, eventually cutting 60 percent of its features for the purpose of making it more user-friendly.[2][13] Following the 2010 launch of the redesign, adoption grew to 1 million users at 20,000 organizations by 2012.[13]
Integration with Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft Azure were added in 2014.[16] That October the Account Map tool was introduced, which uses an algorithm to visualize the flow of work across groups of employees.[17][18] In August 2014, version 2.0 of the Smartsheet iOS app was introduced. It made a spreadsheet-like user interface the focus of the app's user interface, whereas previously the mobile interface was different than the spreadsheet-oriented desktop version.[19]
In 2015, Smartsheet started introducing closer integrations with Microsoft Office products, in part thanks to changes Microsoft was making in their products to work better with third-party software.[20][21] In January 2015, Smartsheet added support for Microsoft's identity management software Azure Active Directory, which allowed users to log into products like Excel and Smartsheet with the same login.[21][22] Users can also now make changes to smartsheets directly from Microsoft Outlook.[20] In 2016 Smartsheet introduced Sights, a configurable dashboard that shows metrics such as how a team is performing against key performance indicators.[4]
Smartsheet.com, Inc.[edit]
Smartsheet.com, Inc. is a private company that develops and markets the Smartsheet application. As of 2017, it has about 550 employees[23] and is headquartered in Bellevue, Washington[24] The company was founded in the summer of 2006, shortly after co-founder Brent Frei sold his prior company, Onyx Software.[2][15][25] Initially it was funded mostly by Frei.[2] About a year after its founding, Smartsheet had raised $4 million in funding and had just nine employees.[15] By early 2012 it had raised $8.2 million in funding over three rounds and hired its first salesperson.[12][13]
After the Smartsheet software was redesigned in 2010, the company's revenues grew by more than 100 percent each year, for four consecutive years.[26] It raised $26 million in funding in December 2012[3][13] and another $35 million in May 2014.[12] In 2017, the company raised an additional $52.1 million in funding.[23]

According to Forbes, Smartsheet has "a relatively simple" user interface.[2] The interface centers on "smartsheets," which are similar to spreadsheets typically found in Microsoft Excel.[8][9] Each smartsheet can have its rows expanded or collapsed to see individual tasks or large-scale project progress respectively. Tasks can be sorted by deadline, priority or the person assigned to them.[10] If a spreadsheet contains dates, Smartsheet will create a calendar view.[10]
Each row in a smartsheet may have files attached to it, emails stored within it, and a discussion board associated with it.[6][10] When a new smartsheet is created, notifications are pushed out to staff to populate its rows and columns.[11] As information is updated, other smartsheets tracking the same task, project or data-point are updated automatically.[8][9] The service also has alerts for when a task deadline is coming up,[10][12] and keeps track of document versions.[6]
Smartsheet can import data from Microsoft Office or Google applications.[2][6] The software integrates with services like Salesforce.com, Dropbox and Amazon Web Services.[3][12] There is also a Smartsheet mobile app for Android and iPhone operating systems.[9] Smartsheet is sold on a subscription basis with no free version.[9]
History[edit]




Smartsheet's original user interface in 2006


Smartsheet was first introduced in 2006. According to the company's co-founder, Brent Frei, initial adoption was slow because the software was too difficult to use.[13][14] At the end of its first year, it had only 10,000 users.[15] The company began making changes to the software in 2008, eventually cutting 60 percent of its features for the purpose of making it more user-friendly.[2][13] Following the 2010 launch of the redesign, adoption grew to 1 million users at 20,000 organizations by 2012.[13]
Integration with Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft Azure were added in 2014.[16] That October the Account Map tool was introduced, which uses an algorithm to visualize the flow of work across groups of employees.[17][18] In August 2014, version 2.0 of the Smartsheet iOS app was introduced. It made a spreadsheet-like user interface the focus of the app's user interface, whereas previously the mobile interface was different than the spreadsheet-oriented desktop version.[19]
In 2015, Smartsheet started introducing closer integrations with Microsoft Office products, in part thanks to changes Microsoft was making in their products to work better with third-party software.[20][21] In January 2015, Smartsheet added support for Microsoft's identity management software Azure Active Directory, which allowed users to log into products like Excel and Smartsheet with the same login.[21][22] Users can also now make changes to smartsheets directly from Microsoft Outlook.[20] In 2016 Smartsheet introduced Sights, a configurable dashboard that shows metrics such as how a team is performing against key performance indicators.[4]
Smartsheet.com, Inc.[edit]
Smartsheet.com, Inc. is a private company that develops and markets the Smartsheet application. As of 2017, it has about 550 employees[23] and is headquartered in Bellevue, Washington[24] The company was founded in the summer of 2006, shortly after co-founder Brent Frei sold his prior company, Onyx Software.[2][15][25] Initially it was funded mostly by Frei.[2] About a year after its founding, Smartsheet had raised $4 million in funding and had just nine employees.[15] By early 2012 it had raised $8.2 million in funding over three rounds and hired its first salesperson.[12][13]
After the Smartsheet software was redesigned in 2010, the company's revenues grew by more than 100 percent each year, for four consecutive years.[26] It raised $26 million in funding in December 2012[3][13] and another $35 million in May 2014.[12] In 2017, the company raised an additional $52.1 million in funding.[23]
