NEW YORK, NY – (December 2nd, 2014) – Glorywin Entertainment Group, Inc. (OTC: GWIN), a Nevada corporation, is pleased to announce the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has approved the Company’s application for a name change from Zippy Bags, Inc. to Glorywin Entertainment Group Inc. and assigned a new trading symbol, GWIN.
Glorywin Entertainment Group is a leading-edge online casino expert focused on providing junket services, IT infrastructure and software programming for the online operations of 3 land based casinos in Cambodia and believes the new name more accurately reflects the Company’s current business as it aligns itself as a key-player behind the exponential growth of the Asian gaming industry. 
The company continues to position themselves for long-term profitability along with increased brand awareness in the market.  The Glorywin team brings close to a decade of experience in the gaming industry, operating through 25 sub-junkets and continues to develop proprietary IT support to enhance their online casino platforms and gamers’ experience.
“We have spent the past three months in Macau developing our strategy for 2015, aligning our legal, accounting and compliance personnel along with our entire executive team to move forward under the Glorywin Entertainment Group brand.  The gaming industry in Macau brought in $45 billion last year which was 20% higher than the year before and 85% higher than the totals for Las Vegas.  The trend continues to move upward and our company is better suited than ever to capitalize on this trend and grab an increasing share of the market” says Eng Wah Kung, the Company’s Chief Executive Officer.

Glorywin Entertainment Group Inc. Announces Corporate Name Change and New Symbol




















December 02, 2014 13:19 ET

 | Source: Glorywin Entertainment Group, Inc.





New York, New York, Dec. 2, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Glorywin Entertainment Group, Inc. (OTC: GWIN), a Nevada
corporation, is pleased to announce the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has approved the Company's application
for a name change from Zippy Bags, Inc. to Glorywin Entertainment
Group Inc. and assigned a new trading symbol, GWIN.
Glorywin Entertainment Group is a leading-edge online casino
expert focused on providing junket services, IT infrastructure and
software programming for the online operations of 3 land based
casinos in Cambodia and believes the new name more accurately
reflects the Company's current business as it aligns itself as a
key-player behind the exponential growth of the Asian gaming
industry. 
The company continues to position themselves for long-term
profitability along with increased brand awareness in the
market.  The Glorywin team brings close to a decade of
experience in the gaming industry, operating through 25 sub-junkets
and continues to develop proprietary IT support to enhance their
online casino platforms and gamers' experience.
"We have spent the past three months in Macau developing our
strategy for 2015, aligning our legal, accounting and compliance
personnel along with our entire executive team to move forward
under the Glorywin Entertainment Group brand.  The gaming
industry in Macau brought in $45 billion last year
which was 20% higher than the year before and 85% higher than the
totals for Las Vegas.  The trend continues to
move upward and our company is better suited than ever to
capitalize on this trend and grab an increasing share of the
market" says Eng Wah Kung, the Company's Chief Executive
Officer.
