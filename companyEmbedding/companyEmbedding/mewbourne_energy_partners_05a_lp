Description of
Business




Mewbourne
Energy Partners 05-A, L.P. (the “Registrant” or the
“Partnership”), a Delaware limited partnership, is
engaged primarily in oil and gas development and production in
Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, and was organized on
February 14, 2005. The offering of limited and general
partnership interests began June 1, 2005 as a part of an
offering registered under the name Mewbourne Energy Partners 04-05
Drilling Program, (the “Program”), and concluded
July 29, 2005, with total investor contributions of
$30,000,000 originally being sold to 1,128 subscribers of which
$26,844,000 were sold to 998 subscribers as general partner
interests and $3,156,000 were sold to 130 subscribers as limited
partner interests. During 2007, all general partner equity
interests were converted to limited partner equity interests. In
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, Mewbourne
Development Corporation (“MD”), a Delaware Corporation,
has been appointed as the Partnership’s managing general
partner. MD has no significant equity interest in the
Partnership.

 




2.



Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies




Reference is
hereby made to the Registrant’s Annual Report on Form 10-K
for 2009, which contains a summary of significant accounting
policies followed by the Partnership in the preparation of its
financial statements. These policies are also followed in preparing
the quarterly report included herein.

In
the opinion of management, the accompanying unaudited financial
statements contain all adjustments of a normal recurring nature
necessary to present fairly our financial position, results of
operations, cash flows and partners’ capital for the periods
presented. The results of operations for the interim periods are
not necessarily indicative of the final results expected for the
full year.

New Accounting
Pronouncements

In
February 2010, FASB issued authoritative guidance which requires
additional information to be disclosed principally in respect of
Level 3 fair value measurements and transfers to and from Level 1
and Level 2 measurements. In addition, enhanced disclosure is
required concerning inputs and valuation techniques used to
determine Level 2 and Level 3 fair value measurements. The guidance
is generally effective for interim and annual reporting periods
beginning after December 15, 2009; however, the requirements
to disclose separately purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements
in the Level 3 reconciliation are effective for fiscal years
beginning after December 15, 2010 (and for interim periods
within such years). Early adoption is allowed. The Partnership does
not anticipate any effect from this on its financial position or
results of operations.

In
January 2010, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU)
2010-03, “Oil and Gas Reserve Estimation and
Disclosures” to provide consistency with the new SEC rules.
The ASU amends existing standards to align the reserves calculation
and disclosure requirements under US GAAP with the
requirements in the SEC rules. The Partnership adopted the new
standards effective December 31, 2009. The new standards are
applied prospectively as a change in estimate.

Accounting for
Oil and Gas Producing Activities




The
Partnership follows the full-cost method of accounting for its oil
and gas activities. Under the full-cost method, all productive and
non-productive costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and
development of oil and gas properties are capitalized.
Depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties
subject to amortization is computed on the units-of-production
method based on the proved reserves underlying the oil and gas
properties. At March 31, 2010 and 2009, all capitalized costs
were subject to amortization. Proceeds from the sale or other
disposition of properties are credited to the full cost pool. Gains
and losses on the sale or other disposition of properties are not
recognized unless such adjustments would significantly alter the
relationship between capitalized costs and the proved oil and gas
reserves. Capitalized costs are subject to a quarterly ceiling test
that limits such costs to the aggregate of the present value of
future net cash flows of proved reserves and the lower of cost or
fair value of unproved properties. There was no cost ceiling
write-down at March 31, 2009, whereas at March 31, 2010
there was a $4,960,963 cost ceiling write-down.

In
January 2009, the SEC issued revisions to the natural gas and oil
reporting disclosures, “Modernization of Oil and Gas
Reporting, Final Rule” (the “Final Rule”). In
January 2010, the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“FASB”) updated its oil and gas estimation and
disclosure requirements to align its requirements with the
SEC’s modernized oil and gas reporting rules. The update
amends the definition of proved reserves to use the average of
first-day-of-the-month prices during the twelve months preceding
the end of the reporting period, adds definitions used in
estimating and disclosing proved oil and natural gas quantities and
expands the disclosures required for equity-method investments. The
update must be applied prospectively as a change in accounting
principle that is inseparable from a change in accounting estimate
and is effective for entities with annual reporting periods ending
on or after December 31, 2009. The Partnership adopted the new
standards effective December 31, 2009.

Asset
Retirement Obligations




The
Partnership has recognized an estimated liability for future
plugging and abandonment costs. The estimated liability is based on
historical experience and estimated well life. The liability is
discounted using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Revisions to
the liability could occur due to changes in well ownership
interests or well plugging and abandonment costs, or if federal or
state regulators enact new well restoration requirements. The
Partnership recognizes accretion expense in connection with the
discounted liability over the remaining life of the
well.

A
reconciliation of the Partnership’s liability for well
plugging and abandonment costs for the three months ended
March 31, 2010 and the year ended December 31, 2009 is as
follows:

Related Party
Transactions




In
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, Mewbourne
Development Corporation (“MD”), a Delaware Corporation,
has been appointed as the Partnership’s managing general
partner. MD has no significant equity interest in the Partnership.
Mewbourne Oil Company (“MOC”) is operator of oil and
gas properties owned by the Partnership. Mewbourne Holdings, Inc.
is the parent of both MD and MOC. Substantially all transactions
are with MD and MOC.

In
the ordinary course of business, MOC will incur certain costs that
will be passed on to owners of the well for which the costs were
incurred. The Partnership will receive their portion of these costs
based upon their ownership in each well incurring the costs. These
costs are referred to as operator charges and are standard and
customary in the oil and gas industry. Operator charges include
recovery of gas marketing costs, fixed rate overhead, supervision,
pumping, and equipment furnished by the operator, some of which
will be included in the full cost pool pursuant to Rule 4-10(c)(2)
of Regulation S-X. Services and operator charges are billed in
accordance with the program and partnership agreements.

Table of
Contents

In
general, during any particular calendar year the total amount of
administrative expenses allocated to the Partnership by MOC shall
not exceed the greater of (a) 3.5% of the Partnership’s
gross revenue from the sale of oil and natural gas production
during each year (calculated without any deduction for operating
costs or other costs and expenses) or (b) the sum of $50,000
plus .25% of the capital contributions of limited and general
partners.

The
Partnership participates in oil and gas activities through a
Drilling Program Agreement (the “Program”). The
Partnership and MD are parties to the Program. The costs and
revenues of the Program are allocated to MD and the Partnership as
follows:

PART I  �



ITEM�1.
Business  Mewbourne Energy Partners 05-A, L.P. (the
�Registrant� or the �Partnership�) is a limited partnership organized under the laws of the State of Delaware on February�14, 2005 (date of inception). Its managing general partner is Mewbourne Development Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (�MD�).  A Registration Statement was filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, registering limited and
general partnership interests in a series of two Delaware limited partnerships formed under Mewbourne Energy 04-05 Drilling Programs. General and limited partnership interests were offered at $1,000 each. The maximum offering amount was $30,000,000
(30,000 interests) per partnership. The Registrant was declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on June�1, 2005. On July�29, 2005, the offering of limited and general partnership interests in the Registrant was closed,
with interests aggregating $30,000,000 originally being sold to 1,128 subscribers of which $26,844,000 were sold to 998 subscribers as general partner interests and $3,156,000 were sold to 130 subscribers as limited partner interests.  The Registrant engages primarily in oil and gas development and production and is not involved in any other industry segment. See the selected financial data in
Item�6 and the financial statements in Item�8 of this report for a summary of the Registrant�s revenue, income and identifiable assets.  The
sale of crude oil and natural gas produced by the Registrant will be affected by a number of factors that are beyond the Registrant�s control. These factors include the price of crude oil and natural gas, the fluctuating supply of and demand
for these products, competitive fuels, refining, transportation, extensive federal and state regulations governing the production and sale of crude oil and natural gas, and other competitive conditions. It is impossible to predict with any certainty
the future effect of these factors on the Registrant.  The Registrant does not have long-term contracts with purchasers of its crude oil or natural gas.
The market for crude oil is such that the Registrant anticipates it will be able to sell all the crude oil it can produce. Natural gas will be sold to local distribution companies, gas marketers and end users on the spot market. The spot market
reflects immediate sales of natural gas without long-term contractual commitments. The future market condition for natural gas cannot be predicted with any certainty, and the Registrant may experience delays in marketing natural gas production and
fluctuations in natural gas prices.  Many aspects of the Registrant�s activities are highly competitive including, but not limited to, the acquisition
of suitable drilling prospects and the procurement of drilling and related oil field equipment, and are subject to governmental regulation, both at Federal and state levels. The Registrant�s ability to compete depends on its financial resources
and on the managing general partner�s staff and facilities, none of which are significant in comparison with those of the oil and gas exploration, development and production industry as a whole. Federal and state regulation of oil and gas
operations generally includes drilling and spacing of wells on producing acreage, the imposition of maximum allowable production rates, the taxation of income and other items, and the protection of the environment.  �

Table of Contents
The Registrant does not have any employees of its own. MD is responsible for all management functions. Mewbourne Oil
Company (�MOC�), a wholly owned subsidiary of Mewbourne Holdings, Inc., which is also the parent of the Registrant�s managing general partner, has been appointed Program Manager and is responsible for activities in accordance with a
Drilling Program Agreement entered into by the Registrant, MD and MOC. At March�30, 2006, MOC employed 157 persons, many of whom dedicated a part of their time to the conduct of the Registrant�s business during the period for which this
report is filed.  The production of oil and gas is not considered subject to seasonal factors although the price received by the Registrant for natural gas
sales will generally tend to increase during the winter months. Order backlog is not pertinent to the Registrant�s business.  
ITEM�2.���� Properties  The Registrant�s properties consist primarily of leasehold interests in
properties on which oil and gas wells-in-progress are located. Such property interests are often subject to landowner royalties, overriding royalties and other oil and gas leasehold interests.  Fractional working interests in developmental oil and gas prospects located primarily in the Anadarko Basin of Western Oklahoma, the Texas Panhandle, and the Permian
Basin of New Mexico and West Texas, were acquired by the Registrant, resulting in the Registrant�s participation in the drilling of oil and gas wells. At December�31, 2005, 22 wells had been drilled and were productive and 1 well had been
drilled and abandoned. The following table summarizes the Registrant�s drilling activity for the period from February�14, 2005 (date of inception) through December�31, 2005:  �

ITEM�5.����Market for Registrant�s Common Equity and Related Stockholder Matters  At
March�30, 2006, the Registrant had 30,000 outstanding limited and general partnerships interests held of record by 1,128 subscribers. There is no established public or organized trading market for the limited and general partner interests.
 Revenues which, in the sole judgment of the managing general partner, are not required to meet the Registrant�s obligations will be distributed to
the partners at least quarterly in accordance with the Registrant�s Partnership Agreement. No distributions have been made to limited and general partners for the period from February�14, 2005 (date of inception) through December�31,
2005.

ITEM�7.����Management�s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  General  The Registrant was organized as a Delaware limited partnership on February�14, 2005. The offering of limited
and general partnership interests began June�1, 2005 as a part of an offering registered under the name Mewbourne Energy Partners 04-05 Drilling Programs. The offering of limited and general partner interests in the Registrant concluded
July�29, 2005, with total investor partner contributions of $30,000,000.  The Registrant was formed to engage primarily in the business of drilling
development wells, to produce and market crude oil and natural gas produced from such properties, to distribute any net proceeds from operations to the general and limited partners and to the extent necessary, acquire leases which contain drilling
prospects. The economic life of the Registrant depends on the period over which the Registrant�s oil and gas reserves are economically recoverable.  �

Results of Operations  Because the Registrant was formed during the period covered by this report, no trend analysis based on yearly changes in liquidity, capital resources or results of operations is available.  Revenues and other income for the period from February�14, 2005 (date of inception) through December�31, 2005 totaled $1,121,445, and consisted of oil and gas
sales in the amount of $752,052, and interest income in the amount of $369,393. Gas production volumes during the period ended December�31, 2005 amounted to approximately 80,706 Mcf of gas at a corresponding average realized price of $9.25 per
Mcf of gas. Oil production volumes during the period ended December�31, 2005 amounted to approximately 97 Bbls of oil at a corresponding average realized price of $55.33 per Bbl of oil. Expenses totaling $320,515, consisted primarily of
depreciation, depletion and amortization in the amount of $235,148. Lease operating expenses totaled $18,726. Production taxes were $58,674. Administrative and general expenses were $7,637. Asset retirement obligation accretion expenses were $330.
At December�31, 2005, 22 wells had been drilled and were productive and 1 well had been drilled and was abandoned. The Registrant�s oil and gas revenues should increase during 2006 as additional wells are completed and oil and gas
production is sold. Interest income should decrease in 2006 as the remaining wells are drilled and the available cash is utilized for equipping of such wells. The Registrant expects that drilling and completion costs will decrease during 2006 and
that lease operating cost and depletion provisions will increase.  Liquidity and capital resources  Cash and cash equivalents were $12,773,922 at December�31, 2005. Approximately $15,039,711 of the net initial partners� capital of $27,450,000 was used for
drilling and completion and prepaid well costs. Capital requirements in the future are expected to be paid with remaining cash on hand. Management believes that funds are sufficient to complete the wells for which funds have been committed.
Management expects these wells to be drilled in 2006. Under certain circumstances, as provided in the Registrant�s Partnership Agreement, the Registrant may use revenues and/or borrow monies, either through a financial institution or through an
affiliate of MD, to fund additional capital requirements. Revenues which, in the sole judgment of the managing general partner, are not required to meet the Registrant�s obligations will be distributed to the partners at least quarterly in
accordance with the Registrant�s Partnership Agreement.  Critical Accounting Policies  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from
those estimates.  Significant estimates inherent in the Registrant�s financial statements include the estimate of oil and gas reserves and future
abandonment costs as reported in the footnotes to the financial statements. Changes in oil and gas prices, changes in production estimates and the success or failure of future development activities could have a significant effect on reserve
estimates. The reserve estimates directly impact the computation of depreciation, depletion, and amortization, asset retirement obligation, and the ceiling test for the Registrant�s oil and gas properties.  �

Table of Contents
The Registrant follows the full-cost method of accounting for its oil and gas activities. Under the full-cost method, all
productive and non-productive costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties subject to amortization is computed on the
units-of-production method based on the proved reserves underlying the oil and gas properties. Oil and gas properties are subject to a quarterly ceiling test that limits such costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net cash flows of
proved reserves and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties. The present value of future net cash flows has been prepared assuming year-end selling prices, year-end development and production costs and a 10 percent annual discount
rate.  All financing activities of the Registrant are reported in the financial statements. The Registrant does not engage in any off-balance sheet
financing arrangements.  Asset Retirement Obligations  In accordance with FAS 143, the Partnership has recognized an estimated liability for future plugging and abandonment costs. The estimated liability is based on historical experience and estimated well life. The
liability is discounted using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in well plugging and abandonment costs or well useful lives, or if federal or state regulators enact new well restoration
requirements. The Partnership recognizes accretion expense in connection with the discounted liability over the remaining life of the well.  A
reconciliation of the Partnership�s liability for well plugging and abandonment costs for the period from February�14, 2005 (date of inception) through December�31, 2005, is as follows:  �

 Organization and Related Party Transactions  The Partnership was organized on February�14, 2005. Mewbourne Development Corporation (MD) is managing general partner and Mewbourne Oil Company (MOC) is operator of
oil and gas properties owned by the Partnership. Mewbourne Holdings, Inc. is the parent of both MD and MOC. Substantially all transactions are with MD and MOC.  In the ordinary course of business, MOC will incur certain costs that will be passed on to well owners of the well for which the costs were incurred. The partnership will receive their portion of these costs based upon their ownership in
each well incurring the costs. These costs are referred to as operator charges and are standard and customary in the oil and gas industry. Operator charges include recovery of gas marketing costs, fixed rate overhead, supervision, pumping, and
equipment furnished by the operator. Reimbursement to MOC for operator charges totaled $219,467 for the period from February�14, 2005 (date of inception) through December�31, 2005. Operator charges are billed in accordance with the program
and partnership agreements.  In consideration for services rendered by MD in managing the business of the partnership, the partnership during each of the
initial three years of the partnership will pay to MD a management fee in the amount equal to 1% of the subscriptions by the investor partners to the partnership. Management fees were not allocated to the Partnership for the period from
February�14, 2005 (date of inception) through December�31, 2005.  �

Table of Contents
In general, during any particular calendar year, the total amount of administrative expenses allocated to the Partnership
by MOC shall not exceed the greater of (a)�3.5% of the Partnership�s gross revenue from the sale of oil and natural gas production during each year (calculated without any deduction for operating costs or other costs and expenses) or
(b)�the sum of $50,000 plus .25% of the capital contributions of limited and general partners.  The Partnership participates in oil and gas activities
through a Drilling Program Agreement (the �Program�). The Partnership and MD are parties to the Program. The costs and revenues of the Program are allocated to MD and the Partnership as follows:  �

The Partnership will pay sales commissions and due diligence fees of 8% and 0.5%, respectively, of the capital contributions initially made by investor partners in exchange for
their respective interests. 


(2)
As noted above, pursuant to the Program, MD must contribute 100% of organization and offering costs and lease acquisition costs which approximate 20% of total capital costs. To the
extent that organization and offering costs and lease acquisition costs are less than 20% of total capital costs, MD is responsible for tangible drilling costs until its share of the Program�s total capital costs reaches approximately 20%.
 The Partnership�s financial statements reflect its respective proportionate interest in the Program.

Mewbourne Energy Partners 05-A, L.P.  
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  �


1.
Significant Accounting Policies:  Accounting for Oil and
Gas Producing Activities  Mewbourne Energy Partners 05-A, L.P., (the �Partnership�), a Delaware limited partnership engaged primarily in oil and
gas development and production in Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico, was organized on February�14, 2005. The offering of limited and general partnership interests began June�1, 2005 as a part of an offering registered under the name
Mewbourne Energy Partners 04-05 Drilling Programs, (the �Program�), and concluded July�29, 2005, with total investor contributions of $30,000,000 originally being sold to 1,128 subscribers of which $26,844,000 were sold to 998
subscribers as general partner interests and $3,156,000 were sold to 130 subscribers as limited partner interests.  The Program�s sole business is the
development and production of oil and gas with a concentration on gas. Substantially all of the Program�s gas reserves are being sold regionally in the spot market. Due to the highly competitive nature of the spot market, prices are subject to
seasonal and regional pricing fluctuations. In addition, such spot market sales are generally short-term in nature and are dependent upon obtaining transportation services provided by pipelines. The prices received for the Program�s oil and gas
are subject to influences such as global consumption and supply trends.  The Partnership follows the full-cost method of accounting for its oil and gas
activities. Under the full-cost method, all productive and non-productive costs incurred in the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized. Depreciation, depletion and amortization of oil and gas properties
subject to amortization is computed on the units-of-production method based on the proved reserves underlying the oil and gas properties. At December�31, 2005, approximately $1.61 million of capitalized costs were excluded from amortization.
Proceeds from the sale or other disposition of properties are credited to the full cost pool. Gains and losses are not recognized unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and the proved oil and gas
reserves. Capitalized costs are subject to a quarterly ceiling test that limits such costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net cash flows of proved reserves and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties. There was no
cost ceiling write-down for the year ended December�31, 2005. Prepaid well costs represent payments to Mewbourne Oil Company, a related party, for the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and gas properties for which the Partnership
is contractually obligated but activities have not yet commenced.  Significant estimates inherent in the Registrant�s financial statements include the
estimate of oil and gas reserves and future abandonment costs as reported in the footnotes to the financial statements. Changes in oil and gas prices, changes in production estimates and the success or failure of future development activities could
have a significant effect on reserve estimates. The reserve estimates directly impact the computation of depreciation, depletion, and amortization, asset retirement obligation, and the ceiling test for the Registrant�s oil and gas properties.
 The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.  �

Table of Contents
Cash and cash equivalents  The Partnership considers all highly liquid investments, those with original maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition, to be cash equivalents. The Partnership maintains all its cash in one
financial institution. At various times throughout the year, the cash amount may be in excess of the amount insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  Asset Retirement Obligations  In accordance with FAS 143, the Partnership has recognized an estimated liability for future
plugging and abandonment costs. The estimated liability is based on historical experience and estimated well life. The liability is discounted using the credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Revisions to the liability could occur due to changes in well
plugging and abandonment costs or well useful lives, or if federal or state regulators enact new well restoration requirements. The Partnership recognizes accretion expense in connection with the discounted liability over the remaining life of the
well.  A reconciliation of the Partnership�s liability for well plugging and abandonment costs for the period from February�14, 2005 (date of
inception) through December�31, 2005, is as follows:  �

 Oil and Gas Sales  The Program�s oil and condensate production is sold, title passed, and revenue recognized at or near the Program�s wells under short-term purchase contracts at prevailing prices in accordance with
arrangements which are customary in the oil industry. Sales of gas applicable to the Program�s interest are recorded as revenue when the gas is metered and title transferred pursuant to the gas sales contracts covering the Program�s
interest in gas reserves. The Partnership uses the sales method to recognize oil and gas revenue whereby revenue is recognized for the amount of production taken regardless of the amount for which the Partnership is entitled based on its working
interest ownership. As of December�31, 2005, no material gas imbalances between the Partnership and other working interest owners existed.  Income Taxes  The Partnership is treated as a partnership for income tax purposes, and as a result, income of the Partnership is reported on the
tax returns of the partners and no recognition is given to income taxes in the financial statements.  �


2.
Organization and Related Party Transactions:  The Partnership was
organized on February�14, 2005. Mewbourne Development Corporation (MD) is managing general partner and Mewbourne Oil Company (MOC) is operator of oil and gas properties owned by the Partnership. Mewbourne Holdings, Inc. is the parent of both MD
and MOC. Substantially all transactions are with MD and MOC.  �
22 


Table of Contents
In the ordinary course of business, MOC will incur certain costs that will be passed on to well owners of the well on
which the costs were incurred. The partnership will receive their portion of these costs based upon their ownership in each well incurring the costs. These costs are referred to as Operator charges and are standard and customary in the oil and gas
industry. Operator charges include recovery of gas marketing costs, fixed rate overhead, supervision, pumping, and equipment furnished by the Operator. Reimbursement to MOC for operator charges totaled $219,467 for the period from February�14,
2005 (date of inception) through December�31, 2005. Operator charges are billed in accordance with the program and partnership agreements.  In
consideration for services rendered by MD in managing the business of the partnership, the partnership during each of the initial three years of the partnership will pay to MD a management fee in the amount equal to 1% of the subscriptions by the
investor partners to the partnership. Management fees were not allocated to the Partnership for the period from February�14, 2005 (date of inception) through December�31, 2005.  In general, during any particular calendar year, the total amount of administrative expenses allocated to the Partnership by MOC shall not exceed the greater of (a)�3.5% of the Partnership�s gross revenue
from the sale of oil and natural gas production during each year (calculated without any deduction for operating costs or other costs and expenses) or (b)�the sum of $50,000 plus .25% of the capital contributions of limited and general
partners.  The Partnership participates in oil and gas activities through a Drilling Program Agreement, the Program. The Partnership and MD are parties to
the Program agreement. The costs and revenues of the Program are allocated to MD and the Partnership as follows:  �

 (1) The Partnership will pay sales commissions and due

(2) As noted above, pursuant to the Program, MD must contribute 100% of organization and offering costs and lease acquisition costs which will approximate 20% of total capital costs. To the extent that organization and offering costs and
lease acquisition costs are less than 20% of total capital costs, MD is responsible for tangible drilling costs until its share of the Program�s total capital costs reaches approximately 20%.  The Partnership�s financial statements reflect its respective proportionate interest in the Program.  �

Table of Contents
Estimated Net Quantities of Proved Oil and Gas Reserves:  Reserve estimates as well as certain information regarding future production and discounted cash flows were determined by MOC�s petroleum reservoir engineers. The
Partnership considers reserve estimates to be reasonable, however, due to inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of oil and gas reserves are imprecise and subject to change over time as additional information
becomes available.  There have been no favorable or adverse events that have caused a significant change in estimated proved reserves since
December�31, 2005. The Partnership has no long-term supply agreements or contracts with governments or authorities in which it acts as producer nor does it have any interest in oil and gas operations accounted for by the equity method. All
reserves are located onshore within the United States.  Proved Reserves:

Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows:  For the period from February�14, 2005 (date of inception) through December�31, 2005  The Standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows from estimated production of proved oil and gas reserves is presented in accordance with the provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.�69, �Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities� (SFAS No.�69). In computing this data, assumptions other than those mandated by SFAS No.�69 could produce substantially
different results. The Partnership cautions against viewing this information as a forecast of future economic conditions, revenues, or fair value.  The
standardized measure has been prepared assuming year-end selling prices, year-end development and production costs and a 10 percent annual discount rate. No future income tax expense has been provided for the Partnership since it incurs no income
tax liability. (See Significant Accounting Policies � Income Taxes in Note 1 to the Financial Statements.) The year-end prices were $58.61 per barrel of oil and $7.53 for MCF of gas as of December�31, 2005.  �

	personnel, which is funded by overriding royalty interests burdening prospects
	developed by the drilling program manager. Payments to employees are
	discretionary and are made net of expenses. Gross payments from the plan to
	employees were approximately $1,045,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30,
	2003. The interests in the oil and gas leases to be acquired by the drilling
	program will not be burdened by plan royalties and the partnerships will not
	bear any costs or expenses attributable to the plan.








	     

	Non-Cash Compensation of Executive Officer

	. Mr. Mewbourne, as the sole
	executive officer of the managing partner and the drilling program manager, was
	provided club memberships for use in performing his assigned duties and from
	time to time used such memberships for personal purposes. To the extent any
	club membership was used for non-reimbursed, non-job related purposes, a
	proportionate part of the cost of providing such use would have constituted
	remuneration to the user. The managing partner and the drilling program
	manager are unable without unreasonable effort to determine the extent of such
	non-reimbursed, non-job related use, but believe that during the year ended
	December 31, 2003 the amounts of such benefits received by such officer did not
	exceed 10% of such officers cash compensation for the year.
