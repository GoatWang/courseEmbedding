Retirement Income
A New Way to Fund Life in Retirement Retirement is a time of change, as individuals prepare to rely on their accumulated savings – rather than a paycheck – for income. Investment portfolios need to be reconfigured to play a new role: generating cash flow to support both current expenses and a long-term retirement. Generating income and protecting against loss take on greater importance for investors transitioning to retirement.  The Natixis ASG Retirement Spending Account is a separately managed account designed as an all-in-one solution to address key retirement funding needs:  

Consistent monthly income
Customized by withdrawal rate and starting year
Actively managed to control risk
Dynamic asset allocation
Easy to implement

It offers a choice of eight specialized portfolios. Each one uses the Adaptive Retirement Income Glidepath®, designed to protect against excessive losses early in retirement and increase opportunities for growth later on. The account seeks to provide a monthly source of income throughout retirement, with the flexibility to adjust each year, or as investors’ circumstances change.

Although the report reflects an improvement as the unemployment rate has dropped since 2015, the country still scores second-lowest on this indicator.Government indebtedness is seen as a key factor behind Spain’s bottom 10 position regarding the state of finance.One finding of the study overall is that investors across the markets should look for alternative ways of saving money in order to bolster their retirement pensions, and this is particularly poignant when it comes to Spain, according to Sophie del Campo, head of NGAM for Iberia, LatAm and US Offshore.“We need to encourage Spanish investors to save as much as they can to secure a better retirement. But we also need financial companies to offer Spanish individuals enhanced savings products,” she said.“It is among our responsibilities, as asset management experts, to provide the best options to Spanish investors.”ESG investment products seem to be crucial in order to rise savings all over the world.

H2O Asset Management Acquires Majority Stake In Arctic Blue Capital
Jul 10 2017  |  10:56pm ET

London-based global macro manager H2O Asset Management has acquired a majority stake in systematic commodities specialist Arctic Blue Capital from Stable Asset Management.
Terms of the transaction, which is pending FCA approval, have not been disclosed. It brings two complementary investment managers together and is a response to increasing client demand for investment strategies suited to a changing inflationary environment, H2O said in a statement. 
H2O is acquiring 51% of Arctic Blue, according to CEO Bruno Crastes, as part of the company’s strategy of revenue diversification. Upon closing, Arctic Blue will remain a separate management entity from the core H2O team, will not rebrand its investment products and will continue to be led by CIO and founder Jean-Jacques Duhot. The company’s flagship fund, the Arctic Blue Original Strategy, and its equity-focused Atlanterra Strategy, will be added to the H2O distribution platform, the company said in the statement. Both trade a diversified portfolio of breakout, trend and reversal models across three time horizons - short, medium and long-term. 
The Arctic Blue strategy was launched in 2008 at the Canadian sovereign pension Caisse des Dépôts et Placements du Québec (CDPQ). After deployment at CIBC and Millennium Capital Partners, it was seeded as a stand-alone firm by Stable Asset Management in 2014. In total, Arctic Blue manages approximately $200 million. 
Founded in 2010 by Crastes and his former Crédit Agricole Asset Management (now Amundi) colleague Vincent Chailley to focus on liquid absolute return strategies, H20 is part of the multi-affiliate model of Natixis Global Asset Management. The company offers a comprehensive range of UCITS funds in global bonds, currencies and equities, serving institutional and corporate clients as well as individual investors, and manages approximately $14.6 billion.

 Beyond the tear sheet: War stories from the front lines of hedge fund due diligence 
 Investing in private partnership structures such as hedge funds, private equity and private real estate can be a fruitful and exciting endeavor, especially when venturing into asset classes that lack competition and efficiency. An important qualification to remember when beginning due diligence on a partnership is that no investment is perfect. Each one has its own risks, however esoteric or idiosyncratic, and risks change over time, as do the operations and other intricacies of investment management.

Offering Day Passes
Scale your support without burning holes in your pocket
The next time you need a couple of extra hands on high-traffic support days or before any D-day, simply use day passes by Freshservice to temporarily add extra agents whenever you need them. You could just add your super-users as occasional agents, define their roles, and they are good to go. Use the day pass for each day they need access to your support desk instead of spending on a full-time agent for a few hours' or days' of work.

Whoa there!

			Looking for some fine-print stuff? You know, the kind where we talk about how much we'll charge you for all the other teensy-weensy things you'll need to add with us a la carte?
		

Sorry, there isn’t really anything here.


			We are customers too, and boy, do we HATE guys that nickel-and-dime...
		

			So with Freshservice, you pay for exactly what you sign up for and that’s that. No extras, no under-the-rug, no balderdash...
