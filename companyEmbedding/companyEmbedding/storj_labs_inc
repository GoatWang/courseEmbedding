				About Us			





				Our purpose is to help people be free, private and secure online. The last two major computing revolutions brought us desktops on every desk and a mobile phone in every pocket. We are on the verge of a new computing revolution – one that puts the user and their data first by decentralizing the net. This will require new approaches to user experiences, design, marketing, engineering and delivering products to users. We are building the foundation for this transformation.
 
Privacy Labs was founded by seasoned entrepreneurs with a successful track record and decades of experience shipping products to hundreds of millions of users. We are well funded by a group of great early stage investors.

"Storj is like an Internet filesystem. Data blocks are encrypted and distributed across a globally distributed set of storage nodes using block-chain algorithm. It is quite impressive and much needed innovation in the storage space."








Vitalik Buterin
Ethereum





"Decentralized file storage systems like Storj have the potential to eliminate high markup costs and market inefficiencies and provide a much higher level of privacy, reliability and quality of service than we see today."








Tyler Scriven
Techstars





"The power of the Storj platform is its unique ability indiscriminately utilize the free capacity of a storage node, whether a single end-user PC or a massive data center. Storj is bringing an unprecedented degree of efficiency to globally distributed data storage."








Pavel Cherkashin
Vestor.in





"Storj is a unique market phenomena. It sets new standards of unit economics for distributed data storage."








Simon Dixon
BnkToTheFuture





"As a seed investor, we were more than happy to join the next round for Storj with a great line up of co-investors. We want storing files to be cheaper, faster and more secure and the progress the team has made towards that mission has been phenomenal to watch. We are looking forward to putting more and more of our documents on the Blockchain thanks to Storj."








Chris Dannen
Iterative Instinct





"I believe that Storj Labs is one of the most established blockchain-based enterprise plays today."

Storj - Terms of Service




























Storage Terms of Service
Last Updated: March 15, 2017.





By clicking to agree to these Storage Terms of Service (“Storage Terms”) during the
                account setup process, or by otherwise accessing or using the Storage Services of Storj Labs Inc. (“Company,” “we,”
                or “us”) that enable you to use the open source, distributed cloud storage platform (“Storage
                  Platform”), you agree to be bound by these Storage Terms and all terms incorporated by
                reference. If you do not agree to these Storage Terms, you may not access or use our Storage
                Services. The term “Storage Services” refers to the websites, mobile
                applications and other online services of Company that you may use to access and use the Storage
                Platform.
              
You and Company agree as follows:
1. Storj Labs Terms of Use
These Storage Terms incorporate by reference and supplement the Storj Labs Terms of Use. The Storj Labs Terms of Use govern all access to and use of the Services,
                including the Storage Services. You agree to be bound by and comply with the Storj Labs Terms of
                Use in connection with your access and use of the Services (including the Storage Services). The
                Storj Labs Terms of Use and these Storage Terms are collectively referred to as
                the “Agreement.” PLEASE MAKE SURE YOU READ THE STORJ LABS TERMS OF USE
                CAREFULLY. THEY CONTAIN LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY, DISCLAIMERS AND A BINDING ARBITRATION CLAUSE AND
                CLASS ACTION WAIVER, WHICH AFFECT YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS.
              
2. Overview of Storage Platform
The Storage Services enable you to store data and other materials (“Storage Materials”)
                via a distributed network of third-party devices (“Storage Nodes”) that comprise the
                Storage Platform. The Storage Platform is an interconnected set of Storage Nodes that
                independently operate open source software to facilitate the storage of your Storage Materials. The
                Storage Services are designed to encrypt Storage Materials locally on your device and then facilitate
                the distribution of such encrypted data fragments to the Storage Nodes. The Storage Platform and
                Storage Nodes are not operated or maintained by Company, and Company has no responsibility or liability
                for the Storage Platform or Storage Nodes. The Storage Services enable you to protect against loss
                of your Storage Materials due to the failure of any individual Storage Node by allowing you to configure
                the redundancy and distribution of your Storage Materials. You are solely responsible for your use
                of the Storage Platform, including for configurations that you deem appropriate to maintain access to
                your Storage Materials in a manner that meets your expectations.
              
3. Account
In order to use the Storage Services, you will need to register for an account (“Account”).
                In connection with your creation of any Account, you will (i) provide accurate, current and
                complete Account information, (ii) maintain and promptly update your Account information as necessary,
                (iii) maintain the security of your Account, including by not using the same password for the Storage
                Services that you use for third-party services, (iv) not disclose your password or private keys to any
                third party, and (v) immediately notify us if you discover or otherwise suspect any unauthorized
                activities in connection with your Account or the Storage Services. You acknowledge and agree that
                if you lose your private keys, you may not be able to recover any Storage Materials.
              
4. Payment
(a) We will provide notice via the Storage Services of the fees applicable to use of the Storage Services
                ("Fees"). All Fees are exclusive of any applicable taxes, unless stated
                otherwise, which are your sole responsibility. We will provide notice at least 30 days in advance
                of any increase to the Fees.
              
(b)Except where otherwise indicated via the Storage Services, we will charge all Fees to a
                payment method designated by you via the Storage Services that is acceptable to us. You represent
                and warrant that you are authorized to use the payment method you designate via the Storage Services and
                authorize us to charge all Fees to that method. If your payment method cannot be verified, is
                invalid, or is not otherwise acceptable, your right to use the Storage Services may be suspended
                automatically. Fees will be charged on a monthly basis based on the prior month’s usage.
                You can avoid incurring Fees at any time by discontinuing your use of the Storage Services to
                store your Storage Materials.
              
(c) Except as prohibited by law, we may assess a late charge if you do not pay Fees on time. The late
                charge will be the lesser of 1.5 % of the unpaid amount each month or the maximum rate permitted by law.
                You are responsible for all costs we incur to collect any past due amounts, including reasonable
                attorneys' fees and other legal fees and costs. We may suspend your access to the Storage Services
                immediately without notice if you fail to pay Fees on time.
              
5. Storage Materials
(a) You grant Company a non-exclusive, royalty-free, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable and
                fully sublicenseable right to reproduce, modify, distribute, and export any Storage Materials solely as
                necessary to comply with your instructions to store such Storage Materials via the Storage Platform.
                This gives us the rights we need to store and retrieve your Storage Materials as you direct us to.
              
(b) Company will not be responsible for any loss, misuse, or deletion of Storage Materials or any failure
                of any Storage Materials to be stored or encrypted. You are solely responsible for backing up any
                Storage Materials. 
(c) You are responsible for properly configuring and using the Storage Services to store your Storage
                Materials via the Storage Platform, and for maintaining appropriate security of your Storage Materials,
                which may include the use of encryption. We reserve the right at any time, without notice, to
                remove, reject or delete any Storage Materials that contain plain text data or otherwise violate the
                terms of this Agreement (including the Storj Labs Terms of Use relating to
                User Content). 
(d) You are solely responsible for ensuring that any processing of Storage Materials via the Storage
                Services is in compliance with all applicable laws. We make no representations or warranties
                regarding the suitability of the Storage Services for the processing of any particular types of data.
                You will provide all notices to, and obtain any consents from, third parties as required by
                applicable law in connection with the processing of Storage Materials via the Storage Services. You
                must not process any Storage Materials that include sensitive data that require heightened security
                protections, including any (i) “protected health information,”
                as defined under HIPAA, (ii) “cardholder data,” as defined by the PCI DSS, or (iii) “Sensitive
                Personal Data”
                as defined under the EU Directive 95/46/EC as enacted in the member states of the European Union.
6. Effect of Suspension or Termination
If your access to the Storage Services is suspended or terminated, you will no longer have access to the
                Storage Materials processed via the Storage Services for storage in the Storage Platform, and your
                Storage Materials may not be recoverable.  If we terminate or suspend your access to the Storage
                Services for reasons other than your breach of the Agreement, we will make commercially reasonable
                efforts to provide you an opportunity to retrieve your Storage Materials via the Storage Services.
              
7. SLA
(a) Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to meet the following service level commitment (“SLA”):
                except for scheduled maintenance, our Storage Services will be available 99.99999% of the time. We
                calculate availability based upon the service records we maintain. We will use reasonable efforts
                to notify you in advance of any scheduled maintenance.
              
(b) Our SLA obligations do not extend to any unavailability of the Storage Services that is caused by:
                (i) any hardware or software that you use in connection with the Storage Services; (ii) misuse of our
                Storage Services or the Storage Platform, including use in breach of the Agreement or use other than in
                accordance with any documentation or other instructions provided by Company; (iii) circumstances or
                events beyond the reasonable control of Company; or (iv) our suspension or termination of your access to
                the Storage Services pursuant to the rights we have reserved under the Agreement.
              
(c) As the sole and exclusive remedy for our breach of the SLA, Company will provide a credit against
                Fees payable to Company (“Credits”) in the following amounts: (i) if availability
                during any calendar month is less than 99.99999% but above 99.0%, then we will provide a Credit of 10%
                of the monthly Fees actually paid during that month; and (ii) if availability during any calendar month
                is less than 99.0%, then we will provide a Credit of 20% of the monthly Fees actually paid during that
                month.
              
(d) You will only be eligible to receive Credits if you have paid all Fees on time, are not past due on
                any payments, and notify us of a request for Credits within 30 days of the end of the calendar month in
                which we have not met our SLA. We will issue Credits solely as an offset against future Fees that
                are payable by you to Company. You will not be entitled to a refund or other payment from Company
                in connection with any Credits you accrue. In no event will the total amount of Credits exceed 20%
                of the Fees payable by you for the corresponding month.
              
8. Promotional Credits
(a) The Company may also provide credits against fees payable to the company in relation to marketing, referrals, or other events ("Promotional Credits"). All credits not deemed to be Service Credits will be considered Promotional Credits.
              
(b) Promotional Credits must be redeemed within 12 months of issuance unless otherwise stated.
              
(c) After redemption, Promotional Credits are valid for a period of 12 months. Promotional Credits that have not been used at that time will expire.
              
(d) Promotional offers expressed in Gigabytes of storage or bandwidth will be treated as Promotional Credits in dollar equivalents. For example, a promotional offer of "50 GB free bandwidth" will be reflected on the account statement by a Promotional Credit of $2.50 (50GB bandwidth * $0.05 per GB).

But at the end of the day, that 332HP car spends most of its time in the garage, our quad-core processor idles while we struggle with MS Word, and the additional hard-disk space that we bought just to be on the safe side will remain empty forever. Even large parts of our brain lie waste while we check another 10'000 cat pictures on Reddit.
A lot of Altcoin projects aim to give purpose to all those unused resources, allowing end users to make a little money off their spare processing power, car mileage, personal information or even to farm their aww-inebriated minds for money, like in the case of Steemit.
In the second installment of our series about Altcoins, we present another project that goes for our unused hard disk space. Storj got us pretty excited by how far ahead it already is, but most of all by the way in which its developers try to strike a balance between perfect decentralization and overall usefulness.

The Technology
Like Sia, which we reviewed in the first installment, Storj offers decentralized, end-to-end encrypted cloud storage.
The core protocol allows for peer to peer negotiation and verification of storage contracts. Providers of storage are called "farmers" and those using the storage, "renters". Renters periodically audit whether the farmers are still keeping their files safe and, in a clever twist of similar architectures, immediately pay out a small amount of cryptocurrency for each successful audit. Conversely, farmers can decide to stop storing a file if its owner does not audit and pay their services on time. Files are cut up into pieces called "shards" and stored 3 times redundantly by default. The network will automatically determine a new farmer and move data if copies become unavailable. In the core protocol, contracts are negotiated through a completely decentralized key-value store (Kademlia). The system puts measures in place that prevent farmers and renters from cheating on each other, e.g. through manipulation of the auditing process. Other measures are taken to prevent attacks on the protocol itself.
Storj, like other similar services, offers several advantages over more traditional cloud storage solutions: since data is encrypted and cut into "shards" at source, there is almost no conceivable way for unauthorized third parties to access that data. Data storage is naturally distributed and this, in turn, increases availability and download speed thanks to the use of multiple parallel connections.
On top of the core protocol, the Storj developers have built a suite of tools that walks the line between complete decentralization and usefulness. We like this approach because we believe that fully decentralized, so to say "maximalist" blockchain plays lack the usability necessary for mainstream adoption.
Accessible to any end user is Storj Share, the client that allows farming free hard disk space on Windows, MacOS or Linux - a few clicks and you are a farmer. More on this in our usability review below.
The Storj Bridge centralizes and simplifies access to the network, handling contract negotiation, auditing, payment and availability. In a way, it can be compared to the Skype supernodes of yore.
The Storj Client accesses the Bridge and the API it provides to store the actual data in the network.
Account management and client pairing can be handled through the client or through a small central web-app.
This architecture eliminates the need for each and every client to become an integral part of the network and greatly increases the system's immediate usefulness for developers, without sacrificing too much of the advantages that stem from its decentralization.
The Economy
While the Storj protocol could work with any kind of currency, even, if economics permit, a non-crypto asset, the Storj tools rely on Storjcoin X (SJCX) for the payment of storage space.
SJCX is a Counterparty asset, Counterparty in turn relies on Bitcoin's blockchain for its transactions. There is a fixed total of 500'000'000 SJCX, 49'518'143 were available at the time of writing. The initial distribution of SJCX happened via a crowdsale that raised about 910 BTC at a rate of 38'500 SJCX per BTC. The crowdsale was preceded by a pre-crowdsale that sold about 8M SJCX. From 2014 to 2016, Storj Labs Inc. used approximately 2M SJCX per year, almost all of which have gone to fund community volunteers and pay farmers in the Test Groups. Storj Labs Inc. is working on a transparency plan for SJCX and told us that they will commit to a 10M SJCX cap per year on the amount of coins that can be used from the larger balance of funds that include the community pool, developer pool, and Bitcoin pool detailed in the Crowdsale Terms.
Like with other storage plays, money will primarily be entering the ecosystem through the purchase of storage space.
Storj is quite far ahead and plans to enter the commercial market somewhen later in 2016. Consequently, we had to look quite far ahead too when searching for potential pitfalls in Storj's economic model.
If Storj intends to primarily compete on price, there is a certain risk that beyond the initial enthusiasm, few rational actors will remain committed to farming out their unused hard-disk space. Neglecting traffic revenues, but also any profit for the renter, a theoretical max income for a 24/7 farmer could be one-third of Amazon's S3 prices in this setting - a negligible amount of money, about 0.01$/GB/Month at the time of writing. The classical argument against this is that storage space and bandwidth are sunk costs anyway. But after decades of environmental education, we believe that things will not work out like this: for many people, the perceived cost of leaving their desktop or laptop running 24/7 is probably higher than the real cost and farming only when the computer needs to be on anyway doesn't feel quite right. From this point of view, we hope that Storj will be able to take full advantage of the actual benefits it has to offer compared to classical storage services: privacy, reliability, and speed. The ideal Storj-based consumer offering would be some kind of "highly private" Dropbox that is able to charge a premium compared to the convenient but insecure-by-design US-based company's product.
For the renting side, Storj will mostly appeal to big-time storage guzzlers or to those who have a very high interest in privacy or global network resilience. For all but the biggest players, storage comes for almost free with the services that they are already using and they would probably rather consider farming their existing storage than buying new one. We hope that Storj will be adopted and loved by developers for the unique properties it has to offer and not just be considered a cheap alternative to S3 and the likes.
The company behind Storj, Storj Labs Inc. relies on a combination of crowdfunding and conventional venture capital. So far, the company has raised a $2M Seed Round in February/March 2016.
Developers and Community
Storj Labs Inc. has been able to attract a talented bunch of people and is looking for more.

The Storj founders, left to right: Tome Boshevski (Chief Design Officer), James Prestwich (COO & CFO), John Quinn (Chief Development Officer) and Shawn Wilkinson (CEO & CTO)
The Storj team structure too reflects the company's determination to strike a balance between technological prowess and real-world usefulness. Among others, it encompasses developers, business people and advisors, but also UX specialists and community workers.
The community around the project seems to be picking up too, with an encouraging number of outside contributions on GitHub and the user forums.
The Storj team reached out to us after we published the Sia Review here on Steemit. Little did they know that we had already become small-time farmers on their system a few days ago. They provided us with additional technological background info and important clarifications regarding the upcoming transparency plan for SJCX.
End-User Experience
Farming
Storj's farming solution, Storj Share, is exceedingly simple to use: download the client, install, define the storage location and your payment address, and you're good to go. We loved farming with Storj Share so much (we have peers! we make contracts, all the time!) that in the beginning, we didn't even think about the fact that we were actually providing resources to somebody else.

During the ongoing test phase, rewards are paid out in bulk via a script run by the Storj developers. Of course, a reward model that almost immediately shows (albeit small) payouts will add to the gamification of the system.
Storj Share ran just fine and out of the box on our typical home networks. At work, UPNP is disabled and we had to manually set up the correct firewall rules.
Storj Share behaved nicely on the systems we used to test. On the home network, the additional strain on the WiFi connection became noticeable for example when streaming music over the same network. Our Gigabit network at work didn't even notice the additional traffic.
Things got a bit more complicated when we tried to build a farming rig based on Ubuntu 16.04LTS: both the GUI and the command line clients refused to handle the four drives that we installed gracefully. After combining the drives into a RAID 0 and renting them out as one, everything went back to normal.
All in all: an impressive farming experience for such an early stage product.
Renting
Renting is free while the current testing phase called Test Group C lasts, farmers are paid through the Storj project.
Renting doesn't come with an easy to use GUI client, it is very obviously targeting developers. For those, however, quick starting by up- and downloading a few cat pictures is made easy thanks to a comprehensive documentation.
We experienced impressive throughput rates both up- and downloading files on various kinds of networks. There were a few hiccups, for example, when trying to store an entire HD episode of Game of Thrones (which we, of course, didn't share with anybody else), we experienced occasional hangups during up- and downloading.
Overall, the renting experience seemed stable enough to start building a beta product based on Storj right now.
For Fun and Profit
Besides speculating on the value of SJCX, is there a way to make money off Storj right here, right now?
Well, it's difficult to tell since payouts based on the actual provision of storage space are not happening yet. Current payouts are rewarding test group participants according to a formula developed and made transparent by the Storj team.
Out of parts that we had lying around at the office, we decided to build a small storage rig that is able to farm about one TB. A profitable rig would probably have to be bigger. Since, unlike GPU or ASIC farms, it's possible to build extremely power efficient and cheap storage rigs (try a raspberry pi with some used 500GB disks off eBay?), it's not completely unimaginable that such a system could work profitably on Storj, especially if the bandwidth it uses can be considered sunk cost.
Our rig seems to consume about 30W currently and to use a negligible amount of our flat rate gigabit internet connection. Since we got the parts for free, we'd have to only make about 40 $ per year for the rig to be "profitable" under our conditions, meaning: with the high electricity costs here in Zurich, Switzerland.
Anybody up for a solar powered low energy storage farm on his rooftop?
Conclusion
As you can probably tell if you got that far, we are pretty excited about Storj and about how far ahead the project already is compared to other blockchain-enabled storage plays.
In spite of all the excitement, we must not forget that the basic premise of such projects needs to be proven: that there's a need for truly decentralized, end-to-end encrypted storage solutions that are farming excess storage space. That there is indeed a need for that is the knee-jerk reaction of almost anybody working with the Internet for as long as we are, but we must not ignore that mass-market adoption of privacy-focused technologies has been slow at best. We see Storj as an invitation to create completely new kinds of services in this domain and hope that a lot of developers with a vision will jump on the opportunity.
We plan to continue this series and to eventually review most of the current crypto projects from a fundamentals perspective. Tell us what you think about Storj, what kind of info you’d like to see in our reviews and of course what kind of projects you’d like us to review.

I have been participating in the Storj test groups since the start of the year, and have gotten about 1000 SJCX in testing rewards so far for contributing 5 TB of capacity (of course this is in no way indicative of actual income after commercial launch).  Storj inspired me to buy a low end Synology NAS, which has been great for archiving backups of my desktop system and being a Storj farmer 24/7.  It was a bit complicated to setup farming on the NAS and required a bit of trial and error, but in the end I got it working with support from the fairly active Storj Slack community.  These days it pretty much runs on auto pilot, but I still log onto the NAS and check logs every couple days to make sure things are going smoothly, and occasionally I have to upgrade the software when new versions get released.
Overall, being a Storj farmer has been an educational experience and a fun little hobby.  Getting involved has expanded my personal horizons and taught me new tech skills, so even if farming doesn't become very profitable it's still worth it for me.
I wish the Storj team much success with future phases of the project!  It's off to a good start and I look forward to a solid level of adoption after commercial launch.$0.005 votes+ solar+ kingnuze+ iainc+ gmskov+ storjReply  ·[-]solar48  ·  11 months agoCould you share more about the NAS that you have? What is a NAS any way?$0.00Reply  ··[-]cryptomancer62  ·  11 months agoNAS means Network Attached Storage.  It's basically a very minimal computer without a keyboard or monitor, whose purpose is to house hard drives to provide extra storage space.  It can be attached to a home network, which allows you to access its drives from your desktop PC.  You can buy special hard drives which are optimized to run 24 hours a day for a NAS, such as the Western Digital Red 4 TB drives I have in mine.
My NAS is a Synology DS416.  Here's a link to the Amazon product page: https://www.amazon.com/Synology-DS416-Station-Diskless-Attached/dp/B016EWTC7E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1471576560&sr=8-1&keywords=synology+ds416
I like Synology because it provides an easy to use web admin interface that you can access using your desktop's web browser.  It was also one of the brands discussed on the Storj Slack and known to be compatible with Storj.  The DS416 is a relatively low end model, but still has enough memory and processing power to run the Storj software.  It's a 4 bay NAS, meaning it can hold up to 4 hard drives all linked together.  I only use 2 bays right now, but it's nice to have the extra bays available for future expansion.$0.001 vote+ solarReply  ·[-]dharmakirti28  ·  11 months agoi was participating in the  Storj testing group and i manage to lose 10000 SJCX on coinbase.$0.002 votes+ cryptomancer+ bitsnapsReply  ··[-]cryptomancer62  ·  11 months agoOh man, I feel your pain!
