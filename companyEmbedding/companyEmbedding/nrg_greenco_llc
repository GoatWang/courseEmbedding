What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

Company, to any of the Members, to the creditors of the Company or
to any other third party, and (y) have any personal liability
whatsoever in its capacity as a Member or otherwise, whether to the

the Member is commenced prior to the expiration of the twelve-month

in such action.
 

(c)

Forbes WelcomeCLOSE   More Options   Quote of the Day  Drop the idea of 'having it all.' That's an impossible standard for anybody. Arianna Huffington, Cofounder of The Huffington Post     
 Split Decision: NRG Severs GreenCo from Retail Energy Business - Energy Manager Today                      News and Best Practices for Commercial & Industrial Energy Managers  Skip to content&n=abab4b2c’ border=’0′ alt=” />        Split Decision: NRG Severs GreenCo from Retail Energy Business September 23, 2015September 23, 2015 by Cheryl Kaften  NRG Energy – the operator of Texas-based retail energy provider Reliant Energy, as well as a roster of renewable and fossil fuel energy firms – announced plans to restructure and “streamline” on September 18, following a disappointing quarter, during which the company ‘s stock dropped nearly 30 percent.The reorganization will split NRG into two divisions – one, the high-stakes, but low-profit clean energy business; and the other, its conventional generation and electricity retailing subsidiaries.In a conference call with the media and investment analysts, CEO David Crane said that, under an initiative called NRG Reset, the company would form a new “GreenCo” unit as of January 1, 2016 – which would comprise NRG Home Solar, NRG evGo, and NRG Renew.NRG’s other business interests would have a separate bottom line – including its wholesale generation division; the Reliant retail business; and the company’s yieldco, NRG Yield.Concurrently, NRG also announced plans to execute a drop-down, for $210 million, to NRG Yield, of 75 percent of the equity interests in an 814-megawatt (MW) portfolio of wind projects gained through the acquisition in 2014 of Edison Mission Energy.The restructuring will, according to SNL Financial, allow for a simpler NRG Group, and be coupled with a companywide effort to “unlock capital,” and shrink the balance sheet.Indeed, Crane said that, although GreenCo initially will be operated completely under the NRG imprimatur, NRG also will pursue strategic partnering alternatives for the new entity. In response to an analyst inquiry regarding a sale or spin-off of GreenCo, Crane said that discussions regarding the future of the new division are “just starting,” but that NRG intends to at least retain a stake in GreenCo.Crane, who to date had been an unabashed advocate of green energy, now has been forced to take a step back by the economics of the industry. He pledged that NRG’s financial support of GreenCo will not exceed $125 million, and went a step further – noting that, if the division’s renewable businesses cannot find a way to be profitable, NRG may have to shutter one or more of them, or find alternative funding.This is not the first time that NRG has restructured in hopes of operating more cost-efficiently. Indeed, just a year ago, the company split into three parts – NRG Home, NRG Business,  and NRG Renew – in hopes of creating a better platform for growth.Among NRG’s professed reasons for not exiting the green energy market entirely is the value that the company may accrue in Texas from the relationship between GreenCo and Reliant Energy. The retail energy provider has 1.6 million customers in the Lone Star State who may be interested in a cross-sell.

	NRG Energy announced the conclusion of the GreenCo process on its first-quarter earnings call this week, with the majority interest sale of NRG EVgo to investment firm Vision Ridge Partners and a restructuring of NRG Home Solar that will result in layoffs involving 500 employees.

	With the restructuring, the residential solar business will move back under NRG’s retail arm by the end of the year. NRG Home Solar will also shift its business model to focus on customer acquisition, installation and direct third-party sales. NRG has entered into agreements with Sunrun and Spruce Finance to purchase and support solar contracts originated by NRG, an approach management said will simplify financial reporting by providing immediate revenue recognition.

	“We have turned the page on this period of uncertainty and now are focused on executing on our plan,” said CEO Mauricio Gutierrez on Thursday’s earnings call.

	“While [NRG Home Solar] is not a business you can expect to hear about each quarter, our strategy for this business is important to our organization, allowing us to maintain a viable yet right-sized structure,” he added.

	To streamline the business, NRG plans to refocus its residential solar business on three Northeast markets -- New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts -- where the company believes it has a competitive advantage. According to Gutierrez, this move positions NRG to offer residential solar to its existing 3 million retail customers in Texas when the economics for residential solar in ERCOT improve.

	In the meantime, an NRG spokesperson confirmed that the streamlining process will result in “around 500 layoffs” across the country. Kelcy Pegler Jr. resigned as CEO of NRG Home Solar last month.

	“The NRG Home Solar integration allows NRG to remain in the residential solar business in a more effective and economical way, continuing to provide the best value to investors and customers and enable the long-term success of employees,” according to the spokesperson. “As opportunities arise for serving other markets, we will evaluate them on a case-by-case basis.”

	In 2015, NRG Home Solar saw an EBITDA loss of $175 million. In 2016, the home solar division is already running at a loss of $60 million. NRG expects to pay a one-time restructuring cost of $20 million, which Gutierrez said will enable the home solar business to break even on an EBITDA basis by 2017.

	Home solar demoted?

	The market responded positively to NRG’s first-quarter earnings report, with NRG’s stock price climbing roughly 3 percent on Friday. Julien Dumoulin-Smith, executive director of equity research at UBS Securities, said the restructuring of NRG’s home solar business is “ideal.”

	“While many investors wanted to see NRG exit this market entirely, we think this is ultimately the right move,” he wrote in a note to investors. A complete sell-down of the business would have removed the opportunity for a long-term upside from marketing solar to NRG’s 3 million retail customers in Texas.

	The front-end monetization for complete sales to a Spruce or Sunrun also makes sense, Dumoulin-Smith said. This structure is likely to generate around cash margins of 30 cents per watt on sales for NRG, according to a UBS analysis. Assuming a modest initial pace of 20 megawatts per year could ramp up to 50 megawatts per year, UBS calculates NRG would generate roughly $15 million in free cash flow per year.

	“The solar partnership will be a small incremental contributor off the wider retail franchise, but a positive rather than a historical negative,” Dumoulin-Smith wrote in a note to investors.

	The near-term focus on breaking even may erode any advantages NRG has in the residential solar space, however. Subordinating NRG Home Solar to NRG Retail could see the business waste away in the highly competitive U.S. solar marketplace.

	“The restructuring of NRG Home Solar makes it apparent that residential solar is, unsurprisingly, not a strategic priority for the company,” said Nicole Litvak, senior solar analyst at GTM Research. “With home solar demoted from its own division to simply an offering through the retail business, it seems unlikely that it will be able to sustain the growth it experienced over the past year.”

	“NRG says it will focus its efforts on Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York -- all strong growth markets for residential solar -- but it faces stiff competition from installers like Trinity Solar and Amergy that are quickly scaling in those states, in additional to the national players,” she said.

	In 2015, NRG was the No. 4 residential installer in the U.S., with a market share of 2 percent. It was No. 4 in New Jersey and No. 3 in Massachusetts and New York.

	A vision for EV expansion

	NRG also announced that Vision Ridge, a climate-action-oriented investment firm, has made a $50 million investment in NRG’s EVgo electric car charging network. Vision Ridge will pay $19.5 million in cash to NRG and invest the remainder in the EVgo business. This new capital, in conjunction with NRG’s remaining commitment of $70 million under the California settlement, is said to position EVgo with more than $100 million of infrastructure funding to expand the charging network beyond existing metro areas. Going forward, NRG has no capital commitments to EVgo save for the settlement obligation.

	NRG became one of the most aggressive builders of electric-vehicle infrastructure with the launch of EVgo in 2011. EVgo currently operates 665 fast chargers in more than 50 metro markets across the country, but it’s been a money-losing business (with $17 million in losses in 2014), hurt by sluggish electric-vehicle sales.

	Despite the segment’s underwhelming performance, Vision Ridge, as an investment firm with substantial experience in late-stage sustainable and clean energy projects, believes it’s a strategic time to invest in electric-vehicle charging.

	“Electric vehicles are here now. American consumers are starting to see how much better these cars are, not just for the planet but as fun to drive and cheaper to maintain,” Reuben Munger, the managing partner at Vision Ridge, wrote in an email. “Battery technology and range keep improving, and a charging network is a key part of the solution for American drivers. Our investment is a sign of how excited we are about both where this technology is today and its enormous growth potential.”

	“NRG is proud of the leadership that EVgo has established under our guidance,” said Arun Banskota, president of EVgo, in a statement. “As NRG looked at potential partners and investors for EVgo, it was important for us to align our business with a firm that is focused on building and investing in a sustainable energy future. We are confident that Vision Ridge will provide the added resources and specific expertise to take EVgo to the next level in sustainable transportation.”

	The changes announced this week bring an end to the GreenCo, which was formed last fall as former CEO David Crane came under pressure for making an expensive push into clean energy. The restructuring eliminates the need for the $125 million GreenCo fund, and has allowed NRG to reaffirm its 2016 guidance of $3 billion to $3.2 billion, said Gutierrez.

	To help strengthen the company’s balance sheet, NRG reintegrated its business renewables division into the company last quarter, which is expected to provide a growth opportunity for NRG Yield. The YieldCo showed strong performance in the first quarter of 2016 and reaffirmed its guidance for the year. NRG Yield also announced a new CEO, Christopher Sotos, who has served on the board of NRG Yield since its initial public offering in July 2013. Sotos previously served as NRG’s head of strategy and mergers and acquisitions.

NRG Energy to Form Renewable Unit, Sell Wind Assets to Yieldco 








September 22, 2015



By
Mark Chediak and Matthew Monks, Bloomberg 








































NRG Energy Inc., the worst-performing member of the S&P 500 Utilities Index this year, said it will form a renewable energy unit and sell wind assets to its existing yield-focused business.
The biggest U.S. independent power producer will place its home solar, electric car charging unit and large-scale solar development business in a so-called GreenCo, the Princeton, New Jersey-based company last week in a slide presentation for investors posted on its website. The GreenCo will be created on Jan. 1, 2016.
NRG will also drop-down 814 megawatts of wind assets into NRG Yield Inc., a sale that will produce $210 million in cash for NRG, according to the presentation. In addition, NRG will buy back $250 million in shares this year and has committed $1.3 billion in share buybacks and debt reduction through 2016.
NRG has been facing increasing pressure from investors to show how the company plans to invest in its renewable energy business while hanging onto conventional resources such as coal- fired and natural gas-fired power plants. The company’s stock has dropped almost 30 percent in the last four months amid a slump in energy prices.
Affiliate NRG Yield, the owner of long-contracted renewable and gas-fired generation, is the worst performer this year in the seven-company Bloomberg Industries North American Power Yieldco Valuation Peers index. The shares have lost 37 percent this year, compared with a decline of 23 percent for the index.[Native Advertisement]
“NRG will transfer distributed solar-energy assets with business and commercial contracts to NRG Yield, CEO David Crane said on its 1Q call, further diversifying the yieldco,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Stacy Nemeroff said in a report Thursday.
In an Aug. 4 call with investors, Crane said the company would consider carving out parts of its green energy business into a separate company next year.
NRG’s power plants can generate more than 50,000 megawatts, according to its website. The company and its subsidiaries serve customers in all U.S. states and Washington, the website shows.

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.
