Marcus Lemonis, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, stated, “Our
      business in the fourth quarter and fiscal 2016 was very strong and we
      are pleased with the results. The fourth quarter and full year benefited
      from strong consumer demand for recreational vehicles and our ability to
      sell our comprehensive portfolio of products and services across a
      growing proprietary customer database. In particular, our focus on the
      towable segment of the RV industry and higher-margin product and service
      revenue is driving our operating margin growth and flowing through to
      our bottom line. Being the only provider of a comprehensive portfolio of
      services, protection plans, products and resources for RV enthusiasts,
      and operating the largest national network of RV-centric retail
      locations in the United States, we believe we are well positioned to
      benefit from continued growth in the installed base of RV owners that is
      being partially driven by higher levels of first-time buyers and new
      younger consumers, as well as the aging of the baby boomer demographic.”
    

Presentation


      This press release presents historical results, for the periods
      presented, of Camping World Holdings, Inc. (“CWH”) and its subsidiaries
      that are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally
      accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), unless noted as a non-GAAP
      financial measure. The Company’s initial public offering (“IPO”) and
      related reorganization transactions (“Reorganization Transactions”) that
      occurred on October 6, 2016 resulted in CWH as the sole managing member
      of CWGS Enterprises, LLC (“CWGS, LLC”), with sole voting power in and
      control of the management of CWGS, LLC. Despite its position as sole
      managing member of CWGS, LLC, CWH has a minority economic interest in
      CWGS, LLC. As of December 31, 2016, CWH owned 22.6% of CWGS, LLC.
      Accordingly, the Company consolidates the financial results of CWGS, LLC
      and reports a non-controlling interest in its consolidated financial
      statements. As the Reorganization Transactions are considered
      transactions among entities under common control, the financial
      statements for the periods prior to the IPO and related Reorganization
      Transactions have been adjusted to combine the previously separate
      entities for presentation purposes. Unless otherwise indicated, all
      financial comparisons in this press release compare our financial
      results from the 2016 fourth quarter and full year to our financial
      results from the 2015 fourth quarter and full year, respectively.
    

Fourth Quarter 2016 Results Compared to Fourth
      Quarter 2015 Results


Units and Average Selling Prices


      New vehicle units sold increased 24.5% to 7,986 and the average selling
      price of a new vehicle decreased 8.5% to $41,731 in the fourth quarter
      fiscal 2016. The increase in new vehicle units sold was primarily driven
      by strong consumer demand for both new and used vehicles and a shortage
      of supply of used vehicles. The decrease in the average selling price of
      a new vehicle was driven by a higher mix of lower-priced towable units,
      which was partially driven by an increase in the number of first-time
      vehicle buyers.
    

      Used vehicle units sold decreased 19.1% to 5,330 and the average selling
      price of a used vehicle decreased 0.8% to $24,189 in the fourth quarter
      fiscal 2016. The decrease in used vehicle units sold was primarily
      driven by a shortage of supply of used vehicles, which was partially
      driven by an increase in the number of first-time vehicle buyers over
      the past several quarters.
    

Revenue


      Total revenue increased 3.5% to $670.0 million from $647.3 million in
      the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
    

      Consumer Services and Plans revenue increased 4.4% to $48.9 million from
      $46.9 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The increase was
      primarily driven by increases in: club memberships, roadside assistance
      contracts, and vehicle insurance written premiums.
    

      Retail revenue increased 3.4% to $621.1 million from $600.5 million in
      the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Within the Retail segment, new
      vehicle revenue increased 13.8% to $333.3 million, used vehicle revenue
      decreased 19.7% to $128.9 million, parts, services and other revenue
      increased 3.2% to $117.7 million and finance and insurance revenue
      increased 24.9% to $41.2 million. Strong consumer demand for
      recreational vehicles combined with a shortage of supply of used
      vehicles benefited new vehicle sales and finance and insurance sales,
      and hindered used vehicle sales. Finance and insurance net revenue as a
      percentage of total new and used vehicle revenue increased to 8.9% from
      7.3% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, and benefited from a sales
      mix shift toward lower-priced towable units and continued employee
      training on the sale of finance and insurance related programs.
    

      Same store sales of the 107 retail locations that were open both at the
      beginning of the preceding fiscal year and at the end of the preceding
      fiscal year increased 5.4% to $534.0 million. The increase in same store
      sales at retail locations was primarily driven by a 10.6% increase in
      new vehicle same store sales, a 23.7% increase in finance and insurance
      same store sales, and a 2.9% increase in parts, services and other same
      store sales, partially offset by an 8.3% decrease in used vehicle same
      store sales.
    

      The Company operated a total of 122 retail locations as of December 31,
      2016 compared to 115 retail locations at December 31, 2015.
    

Gross Profit


      Gross profit increased 9.2% to $196.6 million and gross margin increased
      154 basis points to 29.3% from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
      Consumer Services and Plans gross profit increased 13.5% to $28.7
      million and gross margin increased 469 basis points to 58.7% of segment
      revenue from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The increase in Consumer
      Services and Plans gross margin was primarily driven by an increase in
      roadside assistance contracts in force with a reduction in claim costs,
      increased membership in the Good Sam Club with reduced wage-related
      expenses and administrative costs, and increased vehicle insurance
      written premiums. Retail gross profit increased 8.6% to $167.9 million
      and gross margin increased 127 basis points to 27.0% of segment revenue
      from the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. The increase in Retail gross
      margin was driven primarily by an increase in the finance and insurance
      penetration rate to 8.9% of vehicle sales from 7.3% of vehicle sales in
      the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
    

Operating Expenses


      Total operating expenses increased 4.4% to $162.4 million from the
      fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, and included $1.2 million of
      non-recurring debt restructuring expense related to the refinancing of
      the Company’s senior secured credit facility on November 8, 2016.
      Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses increased 4.0% to
      $154.9 million from $149.0 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
      The increase in SG&A expenses was driven by a $6.3 million increase in
      wage-related expenses, primarily related to increased vehicle unit sales
      and seven additional retail locations opened in 2016, partially offset
      by a $0.4 million decrease in store and corporate overhead expenses. As
      a percentage of total gross profit, SG&A expenses declined 399 basis
      points to 78.8% primarily from the level of fixed costs within SG&A.
      Depreciation and amortization expense increased 3.7% to $6.6 million.
    

Interest & Other Expenses


      Floor plan interest expense increased to $4.0 million from $1.9 million
      in the fourth quarter of 2015. The increase was primarily attributable
      to higher inventory from the seven new dealerships added in 2016 and an
      81 basis point increase in the average floor plan borrowing rate. Other
      interest expense decreased to $10.3 million from $12.6 million in the
      fourth quarter last year. The decrease was primarily attributable to a
      lower interest rate and amount of borrowings under our term loan
      facility that was refinanced on November 8, 2016.
    

Net Income, Adjusted Pro Forma Net Income(1)
      and Adjusted Pro Forma Earnings Per Fully Exchanged and Diluted Share(1)


      Net income increased 13.6% to $13.6 million and adjusted pro forma net
      income(1) increased 104.2% to $11.8 million from $5.8 million
      in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Adjusted pro forma earnings per
      fully exchanged and diluted share(1) increased 105.9% to
      $0.14 from $0.07 in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
    

Adjusted EBITDA(3)


      Adjusted EBITDA(3) increased 27.1% to $39.2 million from
      $30.8 million and adjusted EBITDA(3) margin increased 109
      basis points to 5.9% from 4.8% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015.
    

Select Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Items


      The Company's working capital and cash and cash equivalents balance at
      December 31, 2016 were $266.8 million and $114.2 million, respectively,
      compared to $187.9 million and $92.0 million, respectively, at December
      31, 2015. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2016, the Company had no
      borrowings under its $35 million revolving credit facility, $645.0
      million of term loan principal outstanding under its senior secured
      credit facilities and $625.2 million of floor plan notes payable
      outstanding under its floor plan financing facility. Inventory at the
      end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 increased 5.5% to $909.3
      million compared to $861.8 million at the end of the fourth quarter of
      fiscal 2015.
    

Reclassifications and Revisions to Prior Periods


      Certain prior-period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the
      current period presentation.
    

      Certain revisions have been recorded in prior periods to correct for
      immaterial errors on previously-reported consolidated financial
      statements. In connection with the preparation of the financial
      statements for the year ended December 31, 2016, errors were identified
      within the elimination of intercompany revenue, costs, and profit in
      ending inventory relating to a portion of parts, supplies, freight and
      labor used in upgrades and repairs to new and used RVs. To quantify this
      error management performed an analysis of internal work orders within
      the parts and service departments. The Company evaluated the materiality
      of this error both qualitatively and quantitatively in accordance with
      Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 99, Materiality, and concluded that the
      impact of this error on the Company's previously-issued consolidated
      financial statements was not material. However, while not material, in
      order to enhance comparability and transparency, the Company has
      determined to revise its previously-reported consolidated financial
      statements for the years ended and as of December 31, 2015 and 2014, to
      correct for this immaterial error. As a result of this and another
      immaterial error, revenue, costs applicable to revenue, and selling,
      general and administrative expenses, and floor plan interest expense
      within the retail segment were each corrected as presented in the table
      below. There was no effect on any per share amounts as the periods
      corrected were before the Company’s IPO:

Earnings Per Share


      On October 6, 2016, the limited liability company agreement of CWGS, LLC
      was amended and restated to, among other things, (i) provide for a new
      single class of common membership interests, the common units of CWGS,
      LLC, and (ii) exchange all of the then-existing membership interests in
      CWGS, LLC for common units of CWGS, LLC (collectively, the
      “Recapitalization”). This Recapitalization changed the relative
      membership rights of the owners of membership interests in CWGS, LLC
      such that retroactive application of the Recapitalization to periods
      prior to the IPO for the purposes of calculating earnings per share
      would not be appropriate.
    

      Prior to the IPO, the CWGS, LLC membership structure included membership
      units, preferred units, and profits units. The Company analyzed the
      calculation of earnings per unit for periods prior to the IPO using the
      two-class method and determined that it resulted in a value that would
      not be meaningful to the users of the consolidated financial statements.
      Therefore, earnings per share information has not been presented for
      periods prior to the IPO on October 6, 2016. The basic and diluted
      earnings per share period for the quarter and year ended December 31,
      2016 represents only the period of October 6, 2016 to December 31, 2016.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures


      To supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared
      and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally
      accepted in the U.S. (“GAAP”), we use the following non-GAAP financial
      measures: EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted pro forma net income and
      adjusted pro forma earnings per fully exchanged and diluted share
      (collectively the "Non-GAAP Financial Measures"). We believe that these
      Non-GAAP Financial Measures, when used in conjunction with GAAP
      financial measures, provide useful information about operating results,
      enhance the overall understanding of past financial performance and
      future prospects, and allow for greater transparency with respect to the
      key metrics we use in our financial and operational decision making.
      These non-GAAP measures are also frequently used by analysts, investors
      and other interested parties to evaluate companies in the Company’s
      industry. The presentation of this financial information is not intended
      to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to,
      the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with
      GAAP, and they should not be construed as an inference that the
      Company’s future results will be unaffected by any items adjusted for in
      these non-GAAP measures. In evaluating these non-GAAP measures, you
      should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that
      are the same as or similar to some of those adjusted in this
      presentation. The Non-GAAP Financial Measures that we use are not
      necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures used by other
      companies due to different methods of calculation.
    

      EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA
    

      We define “EBITDA” as net income before other interest expense
      (excluding floor plan interest expense), provision for income taxes and
      depreciation and amortization. We define “Adjusted EBITDA” as EBITDA
      further adjusted for the impact of certain non-cash and other items that
      we do not consider in our evaluation of ongoing operating performance.
      These items include, among other things, loss (gain) on debt
      restructure, loss (gain) on sale of assets and disposition of stores,
      gain on derivative instruments, monitoring fees, equity-based
      compensation, an adjustment to rent on right to use assets, and other
      unusual or one-time items. We caution investors that amounts presented
      in accordance with our definitions of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA may not
      be comparable to similar measures disclosed by our competitors, because
      not all companies and analysts calculate EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in
      the same manner. We present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA because we
      consider them to be important supplemental measures of our performance
      and believe they are frequently used by securities analysts, investors
      and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our
      industry. Management believes that investors’ understanding of our
      performance is enhanced by including these Non-GAAP Financial Measures
      as a reasonable basis for comparing our ongoing results of operations.

          paydown from the IPO proceeds, and rating agency fees and legal

          quarter of 2015 due to lease modifications that resulted in the
          leases meeting the requirements to be reported as operating leases.
          The adjustments represent additional rent expense that would have
          been incurred for the periods presented had the leases previously
          been classified as operating leases.
        







           
        





      Adjusted Pro Forma Net Income and Adjusted Pro Forma Earnings Per Fully
      Exchanged and Diluted Share
    

      We define “Adjusted Pro Forma Net Income” as net income attributable to
      CWH adjusted for the reallocation of income attributable to
      non-controlling interests from the assumed exchange of all outstanding
      common units in CWGS, LLC (or the common unit equivalent of membership
      interests in CWGS, LLC for periods prior to the IPO) for shares of Class
      A common stock of CWH and further adjusted for the impact of certain
      non-cash and other items that we do not consider in our evaluation of
      ongoing operating performance. These items include, among other things,
      loss (gain) on debt restructure, loss (gain) on sale of assets and
      disposition of stores, gain on derivative instruments, monitoring fees,
      equity-based compensation, an adjustment to rent on right to use assets,
      other unusual or one-time items, and the income tax expense effect of
      (i) these adjustments and (ii) the pass-through entity taxable income as
      if the parent company was a subchapter C corporation in periods prior to
      the IPO. We define “Adjusted Pro Forma Earnings Per Fully Exchanged and
      Diluted Share” as Adjusted Pro Forma Net Income divided by the
      weighted-average shares of Class A common stock outstanding, assuming
      (i) the full exchange of all outstanding common units in CWGS, LLC (or
      the common unit equivalent of membership interests in CWGS, LLC for
      periods prior to the IPO for shares of Class A common stock of CWH),
      (ii) the Class A common stock issued in connection with the IPO was
      outstanding as of January 1 of each year presented, and (iii) the
      dilutive effect of stock options and restricted stock units, if any. We
      present Adjusted Pro Forma Net Income and Adjusted Pro Forma Earnings
      Per Fully Exchanged and Diluted Share because we consider them to be
      important supplemental measures of our performance and we believe that
      investors’ understanding of our performance is enhanced by including
      these non-GAAP financial measures as a reasonable basis for comparing
      our ongoing results of operations.
    

      The following table reconciles Adjusted Pro Forma Net Income and
      Adjusted Pro Forma Earnings Per Fully Exchanged and Diluted Share to the
      most directly comparable GAAP financial performance measure, which is
      net income attributable to Camping World Holdings, Inc. and
      weighted-average shares of Class A common shares outstanding — diluted:

            write-off of a portion of the original issue discount and
            capitalized finance costs from the Previous Term Loan Facilities,
            rating agency fees and legal expenses related to the New Term Loan

            Represents an adjustment to eliminate the gains and losses on
            sales of various assets, including (i) aggregate non-recurring
            losses from two non-performing locations that were sold in 2015;
            and (ii) a loss equal to the present value of the remaining net
            obligation under the non-cancellable operating leases in locations
            with no operating business, which represented $0.8 million for the

            Represents monitoring fees paid pursuant to a monitoring agreement
            to Crestview and Stephen Adams. The monitoring agreement was
            terminated on October 6, 2016 in connection with our IPO.

            (f)
          





            Represents an adjustment to rent expense for the periods presented
            for certain right to use assets that were derecognized in the
            fourth quarter of 2015 due to lease modifications that resulted in
            the leases meeting the requirements to be reported as operating
            leases. The adjustments represent additional rent expense that
            would have been incurred for the periods presented had the leases
            previously been classified as operating leases.

            the parent company was a subchapter C corporation in periods prior
            to the IPO. This assumption uses an effective tax rate of 38.5%
            for the adjustments and the pass-through entity taxable income.

            of each period
          












           
        





Uses and Limitations of Non-GAAP Financial Measures


      Management and our board of directors use the non-GAAP financial
      measures:
    


        as a measurement of operating performance because they assist us in
        comparing the operating performance of our business on a consistent
        basis, as they remove the impact of items not directly resulting from
        our core operations;
      

        for planning purposes, including the preparation of our internal
        annual operating budget and financial projections;
      

        to evaluate the performance and effectiveness of our operational
        strategies; and
      

        to evaluate our capacity to fund capital expenditures and expand our
        business.
      


      By providing these non-GAAP financial measures, together with
      reconciliations, we believe we are enhancing investors’ understanding of
      our business and our results of operations, as well as assisting
      investors in evaluating how well we are executing our strategic
      initiatives. In addition, our new senior secured credit facilities use
      EBITDA to measure our compliance with covenants such as consolidated
      leverage ratio. The non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as
      analytical tools, and should not be considered in isolation, or as an
      alternative to, or a substitute for net income or other financial
      statement data presented in our condensed consolidated statements of
      income and our condensed consolidated balance sheets included in this
      press release as indicators of financial performance. Some of the
      limitations are:
    


        such measures do not reflect our cash expenditures, or future
        requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments;
      

        such measures do not reflect changes in, or cash requirements for, our
        working capital needs;
      

        some of such measures do not reflect the interest expense, or the cash
        requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on
        our debt;
      

        some of such measures do not reflect our tax expense or the cash
        requirements to pay our taxes;
      

        although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the
        assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced
        in the future and such measures do not reflect any cash requirements
        for such replacements; and
      

        other companies in our industry may calculate such measures
        differently than we do, limiting their usefulness as comparative
        measures.
      


      Due to these limitations, the non-GAAP financial measures should not be
      considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest
      in the growth of our business. We compensate for these limitations by
      relying primarily on our GAAP results and using these non-GAAP financial
      measures only supplementally. As noted in the tables above, certain of
      the non-GAAP financial measures include adjustments for loss (gain) on
      debt repayment, loss (gain) on sale of assets and disposition of stores,
      gain on derivative instruments, equity-based compensation, an adjustment
      to rent on right to use assets, and other unusual or one-time items. It
      is reasonable to expect that these items will occur in future periods.
      However, we believe these adjustments are appropriate because the
      amounts recognized can vary significantly from period to period, do not
      directly relate to the ongoing operations of our business and complicate
      comparisons of our internal operating results and operating results of
      other companies over time. In addition, these certain non-GAAP financial
      measures adjust for other items that we do not expect to regularly
      record in periods after the IPO, including monitoring fees. Each of the
      normal recurring adjustments and other adjustments described in this
      paragraph and in the reconciliation tables above help management with a
      measure of our core operating performance over time by removing items
      that are not related to day to day operations.

The R. L. Drake Company is a manufacturer of electronic communications equipment located in Springboro, Ohio. It is also known for its line of equipment for amateur radio and shortwave listening, built in the 1950s through the 1980s. The company operates as a separate entity owned by Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc.

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1943 by radio design engineer Robert L. Drake. The company began as a manufacturer of low pass and high pass filters for the government and amateur radio market, and after World War II, produced amateur radio transmitters and receivers.[1]
Amateur stations made up of Drake gear were used on a number of record-breaking hot air balloon flights, the RMS Queen Mary, and the Rutan Voyager.[2] Many of the Drake receivers, transmitters, and transceivers manufactured in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s are still in active use today. Several of the products, built in limited quantities, are considered very rare.
When founder Robert L. Drake died in 1975, the operation and management of the company was turned over to his 2nd son, Peter W. Drake.[2]
Today, Drake produces products and solutions for cable television systems, SD and HD video encoders, video signal distribution, and digital television reception under the Drake and Dracom brand.[3]
In February 2012, Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc. acquired R.L. Drake, LLC, reportedly for a purchase price of approximately $6.5 million, however, the companies will operate as separate entities; Blonder Tongue in Old Bridge, New Jersey, and R.L. Drake in Miamisburg, Ohio.[4]
Amateur radio products[edit]
Drake manufactured equipment for amateur radio operators and short wave listeners for more than three decades.
Long wave, medium wave, and high frequency (HF) equipment[edit]
The Drake 1A receiver was the company’s first meant specifically for radio amateurs. Introduced in 1957, it was revolutionary in at least two ways. First, it was much smaller than most receivers of the time period. The design emphasized simplicity and ease of operation. Second, it was designed specifically for reception of the relatively new and increasingly popular single sideband (SSB) mode of voice transmission.
In 1959 they followed the 1A with the 2A, a more traditional looking receiver that was a bit larger but still much more compact than its contemporaries. The 2A had more features, increased sensitivity and selectivity, and was introduced at the same price as the 1A. It was followed two years later by the 2B, very similar in appearance but with improved performance and a new set of controls for adjusting the selectivity (bandwidth) and center frequency.




Drake 2B radio receiver circa 1960s


Rather than produce a transmitter to match the 2B, Drake designed a new line of equipment beginning with an SSB transceiver, the TR-3, in 1963. Again emphasizing size efficiency, the TR-3 was designed as a complete SSB station in a small package. Other design innovations included crystal bandwidth filters and a permeability tuned oscillator (PTO) capable of extremely linear, stable tuning and a dial resolution of better than 1 kHz across all amateur HF (shortwave) bands. Its size was so small, in part, because the power supply was in a separate chassis, connected to the transceiver with a multi-conductor cable. The AC-3 power supply could be installed inside a matching speaker cabinet, later designated the MS-4. An optional remote VFO (PTO), the RV-3 could be added to the system to enable split frequency operation (i.e., transmitting on a frequency different from the receiving frequency). The RV-3 (and, later, the RV-4) also contained a speaker.
Beginning with the TR-3, Drake adopted a scheme for illuminating tuning dials and panel meters on its equipment using small incandescent bulbs behind greenish-blue transparent plastic filters. This lighting color became one of the most recognizable and distinguishing features of Drake radios.
The TR-3 was superseded by several versions of the TR-4, ending with the TR-4C and its variants in 1978. The TR-6, covering the 50 MHz (6-meter) amateur band, was also introduced in 1968 and was produced for about six years.
Because of their small size, the Drake transceivers were widely used for mobile operation, along with the DC-3 or DC-4 power supplies.
In 1965, Drake introduced the matching T-4X transmitter and R-4 receiver.[5] The "4-Line" twins satisfied a desire for high performance, operational flexibility and a set of features not possible to squeeze into the TR-4’s small size. The matching units used the same PTO technology as the TR-4, and were capable of transceive operation using either the receiver’s or the transmitter’s PTO to control the operating frequency. Drake introduced the T-4 "reciter" which was a transmitter add on for the R4 series receivers (it had nbo PTO of its own and used the PTO and other signals from the R4 receiver to generate the transmit signal), making them a two piece "transceiver", but it saw limited sales and is a rare item on the used ham gear lists these days.
The 4-Line continued to be improved through ‘A’ and ‘B’ versions, and underwent a significant receiver redesign when the “C-Line” came out in 1973. The T-4XC transmitter and R-4C receiver employed a few more solid state devices but were still primarily vacuum tube designs.




Drake R-4B receiver circa 1971


Along with transceivers and separates, the 4-Line included a set of matching accessories including the L-4 linear amplifier, C-4 control console, W-4 and WV-4 power meters, transmit and receive converters for the 50 MHz (6 meter) and 144 MHz (2 meter) bands, and antenna impedance matching networks (tuners), the MN-4 and MN-2000.
Midway through the 4-Line’s run, in 1967, Drake introduced a receiver and transmitter pair meant for the Novice licensee - the 2-C receiver and 2-NT transmitter. The 2-C was an improved receiver based on the 2-B design using a few more solid state devices. Thus, it was a sophisticated design compared to most other receivers targeting Novices. The 2-NT used a crystal oscillator to control its frequency, a requirement of the Novice license at that time (the restriction was later removed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)).
For short wave listeners, Drake produced the SW-4 receiver in 1967 (and later the SW-4A), which matched the rest of the 4-Line in appearance, was based on the R-4 design, but greatly simplified to be easier for the casual listener to use. It was replaced in 1973 by the SPR-4, a receiver similar in appearance to the R-4C but, again, simplified for ease of use. Its biggest difference, however, was that it was Drake’s first all solid state design. It covered a greater portion of the high frequency (HF) and medium wave spectrum than did the SW-4, by using a large set of selectable heterodyne oscillator crystals for selecting the tuning range, each covering a 500 kHz wide segment. The receiver came supplied with 10 crystals and a user could add up to 14 more.
In 1978 Drake abandoned vacuum tubes (except for their use in power amplifiers) in favor of solid state designs and digital frequency synthesis. The new “7-Line” included the TR-7 transceiver, the R-7 receiver, and various accessories including two linear amplifiers, the L-7 and L-75.
The TR-5, largely a solid state version of the TR-4, was built and briefly sold during the early 1980s. Because so few of them were made they have become comparatively scarce.
Drake’s final entry into the Amateur radio and Shortwave listening markets was the R-8 receiver in 1991 – a high performance digital design with advanced features specifically meant for shortwave broadcast listening. The receiver, which primarily covered medium and short wave bands, could be expanded to cover two VHF ranges with an optional, internal adapter. Further improvements led to R-8A and R-8B models before it was discontinued in 2005 after a long production run.[6][7]
Very high frequency (VHF) and ultra high frequency (UHF) equipment[edit]
In addition to the converters designed as part of Drake’s 4-Line, they began designing and selling compact VHF and UHF transceivers in the early 1970s. Powered by 12V DC, they were primarily intended for mobile use.
Drake marketed a series of VHF transceivers manufactured in Japan, under the Drake brand. The ML-2 “Marker Luxury” was a crystal controlled FM transceiver for the 2-meter (144 MHz) band.
The TR-22, TR-22C, and TR-33 were very small 2-meter FM transceivers that were entirely self-contained, including a telescoping antenna and rechargeable battery. They each came with a microphone and carrying case with shoulder strap. These transceivers were manufactured by Trio-Kenwood in Japan and marketed worldwide as TR-2200 and TR-2300 under their manufacturer's own brands.
Drake’s UV-3 FM transceiver, manufactured in the US, covered the 144, 220, and 440 MHz bands. A different model was available for covering one, two, or three bands. A user could start with one or two and add more later by purchasing modular add-in boards. It was their first VHF/UHF transceiver to use frequency synthesis instead of crystals for establishing the operating frequency. It was a model ahead of its time and the later compact multiband Kenwood TM-x41/x42 series that was sold in the late 1980s to mid 1990s, which could handle three band modules; the modules produced covered the 10,6,2,220,440 and 1200 MHz FM amateur bands).
The TR-72 was a crystal controlled 2-meter FM transceiver that bore a striking resemblance to TR-7200 transceivers from Trio-Kenwood (now Kenwood Corporation), indicating its manufacturing origin.[8]

History[edit]
The company was founded in 1943 by radio design engineer Robert L. Drake. The company began as a manufacturer of low pass and high pass filters for the government and amateur radio market, and after World War II, produced amateur radio transmitters and receivers.[1]
Amateur stations made up of Drake gear were used on a number of record-breaking hot air balloon flights, the RMS Queen Mary, and the Rutan Voyager.[2] Many of the Drake receivers, transmitters, and transceivers manufactured in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s are still in active use today. Several of the products, built in limited quantities, are considered very rare.
When founder Robert L. Drake died in 1975, the operation and management of the company was turned over to his 2nd son, Peter W. Drake.[2]
Today, Drake produces products and solutions for cable television systems, SD and HD video encoders, video signal distribution, and digital television reception under the Drake and Dracom brand.[3]
In February 2012, Blonder Tongue Laboratories, Inc. acquired R.L. Drake, LLC, reportedly for a purchase price of approximately $6.5 million, however, the companies will operate as separate entities; Blonder Tongue in Old Bridge, New Jersey, and R.L. Drake in Miamisburg, Ohio.[4]
Amateur radio products[edit]
Drake manufactured equipment for amateur radio operators and short wave listeners for more than three decades.
Long wave, medium wave, and high frequency (HF) equipment[edit]
The Drake 1A receiver was the company’s first meant specifically for radio amateurs. Introduced in 1957, it was revolutionary in at least two ways. First, it was much smaller than most receivers of the time period. The design emphasized simplicity and ease of operation. Second, it was designed specifically for reception of the relatively new and increasingly popular single sideband (SSB) mode of voice transmission.
In 1959 they followed the 1A with the 2A, a more traditional looking receiver that was a bit larger but still much more compact than its contemporaries. The 2A had more features, increased sensitivity and selectivity, and was introduced at the same price as the 1A. It was followed two years later by the 2B, very similar in appearance but with improved performance and a new set of controls for adjusting the selectivity (bandwidth) and center frequency.




Drake 2B radio receiver circa 1960s


Rather than produce a transmitter to match the 2B, Drake designed a new line of equipment beginning with an SSB transceiver, the TR-3, in 1963. Again emphasizing size efficiency, the TR-3 was designed as a complete SSB station in a small package. Other design innovations included crystal bandwidth filters and a permeability tuned oscillator (PTO) capable of extremely linear, stable tuning and a dial resolution of better than 1 kHz across all amateur HF (shortwave) bands. Its size was so small, in part, because the power supply was in a separate chassis, connected to the transceiver with a multi-conductor cable. The AC-3 power supply could be installed inside a matching speaker cabinet, later designated the MS-4. An optional remote VFO (PTO), the RV-3 could be added to the system to enable split frequency operation (i.e., transmitting on a frequency different from the receiving frequency). The RV-3 (and, later, the RV-4) also contained a speaker.
Beginning with the TR-3, Drake adopted a scheme for illuminating tuning dials and panel meters on its equipment using small incandescent bulbs behind greenish-blue transparent plastic filters. This lighting color became one of the most recognizable and distinguishing features of Drake radios.

The TR-72 was a crystal controlled 2-meter FM transceiver that bore a striking resemblance to TR-7200 transceivers from Trio-Kenwood (now Kenwood Corporation), indicating its manufacturing origin.[8]

Garry,
I installed Hatch Lifts on both main bay doors and they work great. No more problems with the doors falling down unexpectedly. Thanks for a good product!

Product Information

Hatchlift Kits and Bedlift Kits are hydraulically assisted lift kits for RV applications. The kits are designed to provide assistance in opening and closing lightweight doors and bed platforms found in many RV’s, including Fifth Wheels, Travel Trailers, and Motor Homes.
The kits are complete with easy to read instructions and include all the brackets and hardware needed to install. The installation can be done by one person - typically in 30 minutes or less with basic hand tools. Having a helper is recommended.
Other applications include: food service trucks, race car trailers, boat engine covers, root cellar doors and many more. If you have a custom application, please send  the details to info@hatchlift.com and we will try to assist.
