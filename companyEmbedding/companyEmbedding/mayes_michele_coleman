Michele Coleman Mayes













                    
                    Michele Coleman Mayes, vice president, general counsel and secretary for The New York Public Library (“NYPL”), has paved the way for women in the legal profession to achieve their professional goals.  Co-author of Courageous Counsel, which chronicles the rise of women general counsel in the Fortune 500, Mayes brings extensive legal, corporate and government experience and perspective to all of her endeavors.  From 1976 through 1982, Mayes served in the United States Department of Justice as Assistant United States Attorney in Detroit and Brooklyn, eventually assuming the role of Chief of the Civil Division in Detroit.  Mayes entered the corporate sector in 1982, as managing attorney of Burroughs Corporation and was appointed staff vice president and associate general counsel for Worldwide Litigation when Burroughs and Sperry Corporation merged and formed Unisys Corporation.  In 1992, she joined Colgate-Palmolive Company as vice president and associate general counsel U.S.  Quickly rising through the ranks, she was promoted to vice president, legal and assistant secretary.  In 2003, Mayes joined Pitney Bowes as senior vice president and general counsel.  And in 2007, she assumed the role of executive vice president and general counsel for Allstate Insurance Company, a position she held until joining NYPL.  A recipient of numerous industry awards, including the American Bar Association, Commission on Women in the Profession - The Margaret Brent Award, the Minority Corporate Counsel Association Trailblazer Award, and the Lifetime Achievement Award from The American Lawyer, Mayes leads by example and demonstrates through her own talent, persistence and commitment that women can reach their highest potential in every organization they touch.  She observes that it's fine to be the first and as long as you are not the last.

Why Repair?
By repairing your own household appliances and electronics, you are giving them a second chance and saving them from the landfill. You'll also reduce the amount of waste, power and gas it requires to manufacture and deliver new products.


 



							I Don’t See My Coleman Model Number						



							If you’re lucky enough to still have the box or even the manual for your Coleman product, you’ll be able to grab the model number directly off of it. If not, it may be a little more difficult to find.

Most of the time, Coleman will stamp or etch the product’s model number directly into the paint/plastic/metal. Just scan your Coleman for these numbers. For example, on a Coleman lantern, you can find the model number etched into the paint right below the globe.

The format of their model numbers ranges from just letters to a combination of letters and numbers. So a good way to check if you’ve found the right information is to enter in any numbers you find into the search box above. If it brings up results, you’ve found the right number. 						
 





							Coleman Repair? Need Help?						

							Camping equipment is durable and Coleman camping products are extremely durable. But over the years any product will see some wear and tear, and you’ll need a repair source to keep your equipment working properly. 

Luckily for you, you’ve found all the help you’ll ever need here at eReplacementParts.com. Not only can we supply you with replacement mantles for your lantern, tanks for your stove, and lids for your coolers, we also give you all of the help you need to install them. And if you ever want a place to discuss your passions, your knowledge, or your warnings about products, our forum is one of the more comprehensive places to do it.

So don’t take our word for it, check it out for yourself and see everything eReplacementParts.com has to offer.

					Roughin’ It				

					Some might ask, “why innovate products for camping?” The balance of technology use during camping is a debate many of families have had over the generations. Some would argue that the point of camping is to “get away from it all.” Others would say that you can experience the outdoors while being comfortable (with technolgy). No matter what side you lie on, you surely have your preference in the brands of gear you bring to the wilderness with you.

Coleman has been revolutionizing the camping industry since 1905 when the company’s founder invented a wildly popular gas lamp. They now make everything you’ll ever need for camping, including camp stoves, coolers, tents, and even portable sinks. So whether you want to live lavishly in the outdoors or “rough it” with only a sleeping bag and a tent, Coleman has the products you’ll need.
