Attention
Dependent Eligibility Verification 2017ACTION MAY BE REQUIRED BY YOU!UFCW and Employers Benefit Trust (UEBT) is currently conducting a confidential Dependent Eligibility and Working Spouse/Proof of Continued Marriage Verification. Providing coverage to ineligible dependents increases healthcare costs and jeopardizes the Trustees' ability to continue to provide these comprehensive benefits to you and your eligible enrolled Dependents. This Verification process helps ensure that coverage is only extended to those who are eligible for Plan benefits. The Trust Fund appreciates your cooperation in this important effort to manage UEBT health care expenses.Your family’s missing documentation is due to the Trust Fund Office no later than June 1, 2017, or your Dependents will be removed from coverage effective January 1, 2018.
