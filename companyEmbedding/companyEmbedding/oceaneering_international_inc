Oceaneering International Inc Jumps Back Into the Black
While the offshore service and product company still expects to remain marginally profitable this year, it sees better days ahead.

Oceaneering International's (NYSE:OII) financial results bounced back in the second quarter after the company reported a meager profit and ended a string of losses. While the company expects further improvement in the back half of the year, it still doesn't expect to report more than a marginal profit for the full year because of the continued pressure on the offshore drilling sector.

What happened with Oceaneering this quarter? 
Oceaneering's results bounced back off the bottom.

Revenue from the company's remotely operated vehicles (ROV) segment was up 10% from the first quarter to $103.4 million, though it was down 26% year over year. Driving the sequential improvement was higher utilization, due in part to retiring four ROVs during the quarter while only putting one new ROV into service. That rise in revenue, along with a slight improvement in margin, drove operating income up 75% versus last quarter, though it's still down more than 40% from last year's second quarter.
Subsea products revenue rose 16% from last quarter to $174 million, though it's still down 8% from the year-ago quarter. Furthermore, despite the sequential improvement in revenue, operating income still fell "due to the continued weakness and competitive nature of the service and rental market."
The subsea projects segment was one of the brighter spots, delivering a 20% increase in revenue to $75.5 million because of seasonal improvements in the Gulf of Mexico. That helped fuel an eye-catching 1,500% surge in operating income, though that's off a meager base last quarter.
Asset integrity's sales were up 11% to $58.2 million, primarily due to seasonality, which also drove an increase in operating income.
Finally, the advanced technology segment delivered a 20% increase in revenue, which came in at $103 million for the quarter because of increased commercial activity and work for the U.S. Navy. That sparked a more than 50% improvement in operating income.






What management had to say 
Recently installed CEO Rod Larson commented on the company's second-quarter results, noting that: 

Our overall operating results during the quarter were in line with expectations. We were pleased that each of our operating segments remained profitable. On a consolidated basis, for the first half of 2017, we have generated $112 million of EBITDA and $61 million of free cash flow. We believe our cash flow and liquidity position us well to manage our business through the continuing industry downturn; at the end of the quarter, we had $482 million in cash and an undrawn $500 million revolving credit facility. Based on these strengths, the Board maintained our current dividend rate and declared a $0.15 per share dividend to be paid during the third quarter of 2017.

As Larson noted, the company continues to navigate through the challenging market environment by keeping its costs down so it can generate cash and strengthen its financial position. This improving liquidity gives it the flexibility to pursue opportunities that "may emerge to grow our company," according to Larson. In particular, he noted that Oceaneering is focusing its attention on capturing more of the operating expenditures of its customers in the production phase, as opposed to its current focus on exploration drilling. That should provide the company with a more stable revenue stream if it's successful in securing those opportunities.
Looking forward 
Oceaneering announced that it was successful in securing several longer-term contracts during the quarter. It won a three-year contract with Norway's Statoil (NYSE:STO) to develop and implement an inspection and maintenance program at 14 of its facilities. Furthermore, Statoil can expand that agreement to other fields in the future. Meanwhile, Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS-A) (NYSE:RDS-B) awarded the company a products and services contract relating to its Appomattox development in the Gulf. Shell expects to start the project later this year and should complete it sometime in 2019. These contract wins support Oceaneering's view that demand for its products and services is starting to improve. 
That said, Oceaneering doesn't expect those new agreements to help it this year. Instead, Larson noted that the company's outlook for the year "has not changed," with it continuing to project that it will be "marginally profitable" in 2017.

The Oceaneering Story





From a small diving company to a leading global provider of engineered products and services. Read the story below.
 
 
 









In 1964, Mike Hughes and Johnny Johnson formed a Gulf of Mexico diving company called World Wide Divers. The company grew in response to increasing demand for their services and in 1969 merged with two other diving companies to form Oceaneering International, Inc.

Oceaneering International Inc Jumps Back Into the Black
While the offshore service and product company still expects to remain marginally profitable this year, it sees better days ahead.

Oceaneering International's (NYSE:OII) financial results bounced back in the second quarter after the company reported a meager profit and ended a string of losses. While the company expects further improvement in the back half of the year, it still doesn't expect to report more than a marginal profit for the full year because of the continued pressure on the offshore drilling sector.

What happened with Oceaneering this quarter? 
Oceaneering's results bounced back off the bottom.

Revenue from the company's remotely operated vehicles (ROV) segment was up 10% from the first quarter to $103.4 million, though it was down 26% year over year. Driving the sequential improvement was higher utilization, due in part to retiring four ROVs during the quarter while only putting one new ROV into service. That rise in revenue, along with a slight improvement in margin, drove operating income up 75% versus last quarter, though it's still down more than 40% from last year's second quarter.
Subsea products revenue rose 16% from last quarter to $174 million, though it's still down 8% from the year-ago quarter. Furthermore, despite the sequential improvement in revenue, operating income still fell "due to the continued weakness and competitive nature of the service and rental market."
The subsea projects segment was one of the brighter spots, delivering a 20% increase in revenue to $75.5 million because of seasonal improvements in the Gulf of Mexico. That helped fuel an eye-catching 1,500% surge in operating income, though that's off a meager base last quarter.
Asset integrity's sales were up 11% to $58.2 million, primarily due to seasonality, which also drove an increase in operating income.
Finally, the advanced technology segment delivered a 20% increase in revenue, which came in at $103 million for the quarter because of increased commercial activity and work for the U.S. Navy. That sparked a more than 50% improvement in operating income.






What management had to say 
Recently installed CEO Rod Larson commented on the company's second-quarter results, noting that: 

Our overall operating results during the quarter were in line with expectations. We were pleased that each of our operating segments remained profitable. On a consolidated basis, for the first half of 2017, we have generated $112 million of EBITDA and $61 million of free cash flow. We believe our cash flow and liquidity position us well to manage our business through the continuing industry downturn; at the end of the quarter, we had $482 million in cash and an undrawn $500 million revolving credit facility. Based on these strengths, the Board maintained our current dividend rate and declared a $0.15 per share dividend to be paid during the third quarter of 2017.

As Larson noted, the company continues to navigate through the challenging market environment by keeping its costs down so it can generate cash and strengthen its financial position. This improving liquidity gives it the flexibility to pursue opportunities that "may emerge to grow our company," according to Larson. In particular, he noted that Oceaneering is focusing its attention on capturing more of the operating expenditures of its customers in the production phase, as opposed to its current focus on exploration drilling. That should provide the company with a more stable revenue stream if it's successful in securing those opportunities.
Looking forward 
Oceaneering announced that it was successful in securing several longer-term contracts during the quarter. It won a three-year contract with Norway's Statoil (NYSE:STO) to develop and implement an inspection and maintenance program at 14 of its facilities. Furthermore, Statoil can expand that agreement to other fields in the future. Meanwhile, Royal Dutch Shell (NYSE:RDS-A) (NYSE:RDS-B) awarded the company a products and services contract relating to its Appomattox development in the Gulf. Shell expects to start the project later this year and should complete it sometime in 2019. These contract wins support Oceaneering's view that demand for its products and services is starting to improve. 
That said, Oceaneering doesn't expect those new agreements to help it this year. Instead, Larson noted that the company's outlook for the year "has not changed," with it continuing to project that it will be "marginally profitable" in 2017.

Oceaneering International Inc's Decline Is Starting to Slow
The offshore service and product company should still be marginally profitable this year.











                Matthew DiLallo
            

                (TMFmd19)

While the oil market is starting to heal after a prolonged and painful downturn, not all regions are getting better just yet. Offshore, in particular, remains a challenge, which is having an adverse impact on Oceaneering International's (NYSE:OII) financial results. That said, the company expects to keep its head above water this year even though its results continue sinking.

What happened with Oceaneering this quarter? 
The revenue slide is slowing down.

While revenue plunged 27% versus last year's fourth quarter, sales were only down 8.7% from last quarter, which is a slight improvement over the sequential decline of 11% Oceaneering experienced last quarter. The culprits were the asset integrity, remotely operated vehicles (ROV), and subsea projects segments, which experienced sequential declines of 12.1%, 13.2%, and 33.1%, respectively. Those weaknesses offset improvements in the subsea products and advanced technologies segments, where revenue rose 1.1% and 11.5%, respectively.
Profitability, on the other hand, improved slightly versus last quarter on a GAAP basis, going from an $0.11 per-share loss to a $0.08 per-share loss. However, after adjusting for one-time items, profitability continued to erode, falling from a $2.6 million, or $0.03 per-share profit last quarter, to an adjusted loss of $4 million, or $0.04 per share, during the first quarter.
That said, all the company's segments remained in the black during the quarter. However, operating income in the subsea projects segment plunged 92.3%, to just $0.2 million, due to reduced demand and pricing in the Gulf of Mexico for deepwater vessel and diving services. Meanwhile, asset integrity's operating profit also fell due to seasonality. On a more positive note, the advanced technologies segment benefited from increased commercial activities and work for the U.S. Navy.
Despite the reported loss, Oceaneering still generated $41.2 million in free cash flow, up from $31.4 million in the year-ago period.






What management had to say
CEO Kevin McEvoy commented on the first quarter, noting:

Our first quarter operating results were slightly better than our expectations. Again, we are pleased that each of our operating segments generated positive results and, overall, maintained positive EBITDA and free cash flow.

While Oceaneering's financial results remain under pressure, it wasn't all bad news, as McEvoy notes, since its results did come in better than its forecast. Furthermore, all of its operating segments continue operating in the black, and its underlying business is generating free cash flow.
McEvoy also noted in the press release that the company saw some positives in its two largest segments: ROVs and subsea products. ROV EBITDA margin rose slightly, improving from 35% in the fourth quarter to 37% in the first quarter. Further, the company put two more ROVs into service during the quarter and maintained 53% market share. However, McEvoy did state that "although we endeavor to maintain our drill support market share and place more ROVs on vessels, we need a sizable increase in our customers' offshore spending levels for there to be a discernible increase in ROV fleet utilization and profitability."
Meanwhile, he noted that while subsea products revenue was flat, operating income improved due to cost-reduction measures. Meanwhile, thanks to rising new orders, the company's book-to-bill ratio improved from 0.74 over the past year to 0.84 during the quarter.
Looking forward
While Oceaneering sees some positives in its business, McEvoy still only expects the company to be "marginally profitable" this year. Still, he does expect to see operating income improvements next quarter in all segments except subsea production, which should remain flat. That said, the company won't see a noticeable improvement in results until offshore drilling starts picking up; the timing of that recovery, however, remains unclear.

The Oceaneering Story





From a small diving company to a leading global provider of engineered products and services. Read the story below.
 
 
 









In 1964, Mike Hughes and Johnny Johnson formed a Gulf of Mexico diving company called World Wide Divers. The company grew in response to increasing demand for their services and in 1969 merged with two other diving companies to form Oceaneering International, Inc.
Since the beginning, the company has transformed from a small regional diving company into a global provider of engineered products and services.
 
 
 




Today, we develop products and services for use throughout the lifecycle of an offshore oilfield, from drilling to decommissioning. We operate the world's premier fleet of work class ROVs. Additionally, we are a leader in offshore oilfield maintenance services, umbilicals, subsea hardware, and tooling.
We also serve the aerospace, defense, and theme park industries.

History[edit]
Oceaneering was founded in 1964.[3]
In the early 1970s, Oceaneering supported a considerable amount of research into techniques to increase safety of their divers as well as general operation efficiency including their collaboration with Duke University Medical Center to explore the use of trimix breathing gas to reduce the incidence of high-pressure nervous syndrome.[4]
Oceaneering purchased the rights to the JIM suit in 1975. By 1979, a team from Oceaneering assisted Dr. Sylvia Earle in testing the application of Atmospheric diving suits for scientific diving operations by diving a JIM suit to 1,250 fsw.[5] Oceaneering also used WASP atmospheric diving suits.[6]
A dive team from Oceaneering salvaged three of the four propellers from the RMS Lusitania in 1982.[7]
From 1984 to 1988, Michael L. Gernhardt worked as Manager and then Vice President of Special Projects for Oceaneering International. During this time he led the development of a telerobotic system for subsea platform cleaning and inspection as well as a variety of new diver and robot tools.[8] In 1988, Gernhardt founded Oceaneering Space Systems, a company formed to transfer subsea technology and operational experience to the ISS program.[8]
Following the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, Oceaneering teams recovered the Solid Rocket Booster that contained the faulty O-ring.[9]
Oceaneering was a NASDAQ listed company until 1991 when they moved to the New York Stock Exchange.
Oceaneering ROVs were used to determine what happened to the cargo ship Lucona in the 1991 murder and fraud investigation that claimed uranium mining equipment was lost when the vessel went down.[9]
Recovery of the airplane cockpit voice recorder in the loss of ValuJet Flight 592 was a priority in early 1996.[9] In the days following the loss of TWA Flight 800 later that same year, Oceaneering was contacted to provide ROV support to the US Navy lead search and recovery effort.[9]
Boeing and Fugro teamed up with Oceaneering in 2001 to begin integration of their advanced technology solutions into deep sea exploration.[10]
The company helped recover the Confederate submarine H. L. Hunley, which sank in 1864.[11][12] Several plans for the recovery were evaluated with the final recovery including a truss structure with foam to surround the body of the submarine.[13] On August 8, 2000, at 8:37 a.m., the sub broke the surface for the first time in more than 136 years.




Image of early Constellation Space Suit prototype - February 2010


On August 2, 2006, NASA indicated plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the design, development, certification, production, and sustaining engineering of the Constellation Space Suit to meet the needs of the Constellation Program.[14] On June 11, 2008, NASA awarded a USD$745 million contract to Oceaneering for the creation and manufacture of this new space suit.[15]
NAVSEA awarded Oceaneering a maintenance contract for the Dry Deck Shelter program in 2006.[16] Dry Deck Shelters are used for transport of equipment like the Advanced SEAL Delivery System or a Combat Rubber Raiding Craft aboard a submarine.[17][18]
In 2009, a demonstrator crane was installed and integrated aboard the SS Flickertail State to evaluate the crane's performance in transporting containers between two moving ships in an operational environment using commercial and oil industry at-sea mooring techniques in the Gulf of Mexico.[19] Developed by the Sea Warfare and Weapons Department in the Office of Naval Research along with Oceaneering International, the crane has sensors and cameras as well as motion-sensing algorithms that let it automatically shift with the rolling and pitching of the sea, making it much easier for operators to center the crane over cargo and transfer it.[20][21]
Oceaneering teamed up with the Canadian company GRI Simulations to design and produce the ROV simulators they utilize for training, development of procedures, and equipment staging.[22] After a dispute over theft of trade secrets and copyright infringement that lasted several years, Oceaneering now licenses the VROV simulator system from GRI Simulations.[22][23]
A 2009 collaboration with Royal Dutch Shell saw the installation of a wireline at a record 2,673 ft of water for repairing a safety valve.[24]
On April 22, 2010, three Oceaneering ROV crews on board the Oceaneering vessel Ocean Intervention III, the DOF ASA Skandi Neptune, and the Boa International Boa Sub C began to map the seabed and assess the wreckage from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The crews report "large amounts of oil that flowed out."[25] Oceaneering ROV Technician Tyrone Benton was later called as a witness to provide information on the leaks associated with BOP stack investigation but gave no reason why he later failed to appear in court.[26][27]
Petrobras, the biggest deepwater oilfield company in the world, placed the largest umbilical order in company history in 2012.[28]
As of 2012, eighty percent of Oceaneering's income was involved in deepwater work.[29] They are also the world's largest operator of ROVs.[29][30]
BAE Systems was contracted in October 2013 to build a support vessel to supplement their "subsea intervention services in the ultra-deep waters of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico".[31] Delivery is expected in 2016.[31]
Other Non-Oilfield Services[edit]
The company is also an active developer of educational and entertainment technology like the Shuttle Launch Experience at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Florida.[32] Oceaneering has developed motion-based dark ride vehicles for Transformers: The Ride, Justice League: Battle for Metropolis at Six Flags parks, Antarctica: Empire of the Penguin, and Speed of Magic, among others.[33][34][35] The company also developed animatronics for Universal Studios' Jurassic Park and Jaws rides.[36] In 2013, The Themed Entertainment Association awarded their Thea Award to Oceaneering Entertainment Systems (OES) for their Revolution™ Tru-Trackless™ ride system [37]
Community Outreach[edit]
Oceaneering donated a hyperbaric chamber to assist with the treatment on the Miskito Indian population in 1986.[38] The company donated a compressor in 1997 that along with money from the Divers Alert Network supported the continued medical coverage of the Miskito population.[39]
The Stavanger offshore tekniske skole, a Norwegian technical college, received a donated ROV in November 2009 to facilitate qualification examinations for their learners.[40] An ROV was donated to the South Central Louisiana Technical College in 2011 to support their unique ROV maintenance curriculum.[41]

The Oceaneering Story





From a small diving company to a leading global provider of engineered products and services. Read the story below.
 
 
 









In 1964, Mike Hughes and Johnny Johnson formed a Gulf of Mexico diving company called World Wide Divers. The company grew in response to increasing demand for their services and in 1969 merged with two other diving companies to form Oceaneering International, Inc.
Since the beginning, the company has transformed from a small regional diving company into a global provider of engineered products and services.
 
 
 




Today, we develop products and services for use throughout the lifecycle of an offshore oilfield, from drilling to decommissioning. We operate the world's premier fleet of work class ROVs. Additionally, we are a leader in offshore oilfield maintenance services, umbilicals, subsea hardware, and tooling.
We also serve the aerospace, defense, and theme park industries.

History[edit]
Oceaneering was founded in 1964.[3]
In the early 1970s, Oceaneering supported a considerable amount of research into techniques to increase safety of their divers as well as general operation efficiency including their collaboration with Duke University Medical Center to explore the use of trimix breathing gas to reduce the incidence of high-pressure nervous syndrome.[4]
Oceaneering purchased the rights to the JIM suit in 1975. By 1979, a team from Oceaneering assisted Dr. Sylvia Earle in testing the application of Atmospheric diving suits for scientific diving operations by diving a JIM suit to 1,250 fsw.[5] Oceaneering also used WASP atmospheric diving suits.[6]
A dive team from Oceaneering salvaged three of the four propellers from the RMS Lusitania in 1982.[7]
From 1984 to 1988, Michael L. Gernhardt worked as Manager and then Vice President of Special Projects for Oceaneering International. During this time he led the development of a telerobotic system for subsea platform cleaning and inspection as well as a variety of new diver and robot tools.[8] In 1988, Gernhardt founded Oceaneering Space Systems, a company formed to transfer subsea technology and operational experience to the ISS program.[8]
Following the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, Oceaneering teams recovered the Solid Rocket Booster that contained the faulty O-ring.[9]
Oceaneering was a NASDAQ listed company until 1991 when they moved to the New York Stock Exchange.
Oceaneering ROVs were used to determine what happened to the cargo ship Lucona in the 1991 murder and fraud investigation that claimed uranium mining equipment was lost when the vessel went down.[9]
Recovery of the airplane cockpit voice recorder in the loss of ValuJet Flight 592 was a priority in early 1996.[9] In the days following the loss of TWA Flight 800 later that same year, Oceaneering was contacted to provide ROV support to the US Navy lead search and recovery effort.[9]
Boeing and Fugro teamed up with Oceaneering in 2001 to begin integration of their advanced technology solutions into deep sea exploration.[10]
The company helped recover the Confederate submarine H. L. Hunley, which sank in 1864.[11][12] Several plans for the recovery were evaluated with the final recovery including a truss structure with foam to surround the body of the submarine.[13] On August 8, 2000, at 8:37 a.m., the sub broke the surface for the first time in more than 136 years.

On August 2, 2006, NASA indicated plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the design, development, certification, production, and sustaining engineering of the Constellation Space Suit to meet the needs of the Constellation Program.[14] On June 11, 2008, NASA awarded a USD$745 million contract to Oceaneering for the creation and manufacture of this new space suit.[15]
NAVSEA awarded Oceaneering a maintenance contract for the Dry Deck Shelter program in 2006.[16] Dry Deck Shelters are used for transport of equipment like the Advanced SEAL Delivery System or a Combat Rubber Raiding Craft aboard a submarine.[17][18]
In 2009, a demonstrator crane was installed and integrated aboard the SS Flickertail State to evaluate the crane's performance in transporting containers between two moving ships in an operational environment using commercial and oil industry at-sea mooring techniques in the Gulf of Mexico.[19] Developed by the Sea Warfare and Weapons Department in the Office of Naval Research along with Oceaneering International, the crane has sensors and cameras as well as motion-sensing algorithms that let it automatically shift with the rolling and pitching of the sea, making it much easier for operators to center the crane over cargo and transfer it.[20][21]
Oceaneering teamed up with the Canadian company GRI Simulations to design and produce the ROV simulators they utilize for training, development of procedures, and equipment staging.[22] After a dispute over theft of trade secrets and copyright infringement that lasted several years, Oceaneering now licenses the VROV simulator system from GRI Simulations.[22][23]
A 2009 collaboration with Royal Dutch Shell saw the installation of a wireline at a record 2,673 ft of water for repairing a safety valve.[24]
On April 22, 2010, three Oceaneering ROV crews on board the Oceaneering vessel Ocean Intervention III, the DOF ASA Skandi Neptune, and the Boa International Boa Sub C began to map the seabed and assess the wreckage from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The crews report "large amounts of oil that flowed out."[25] Oceaneering ROV Technician Tyrone Benton was later called as a witness to provide information on the leaks associated with BOP stack investigation but gave no reason why he later failed to appear in court.[26][27]
Petrobras, the biggest deepwater oilfield company in the world, placed the largest umbilical order in company history in 2012.[28]
As of 2012, eighty percent of Oceaneering's income was involved in deepwater work.[29] They are also the world's largest operator of ROVs.[29][30]
BAE Systems was contracted in October 2013 to build a support vessel to supplement their "subsea intervention services in the ultra-deep waters of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico".[31] Delivery is expected in 2016.[31]
Other Non-Oilfield Services[edit]
The company is also an active developer of educational and entertainment technology like the Shuttle Launch Experience at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Florida.[32] Oceaneering has developed motion-based dark ride vehicles for Transformers: The Ride, Justice League: Battle for Metropolis at Six Flags parks, Antarctica: Empire of the Penguin, and Speed of Magic, among others.[33][34][35] The company also developed animatronics for Universal Studios' Jurassic Park and Jaws rides.[36] In 2013, The Themed Entertainment Association awarded their Thea Award to Oceaneering Entertainment Systems (OES) for their Revolution™ Tru-Trackless™ ride system [37]
Community Outreach[edit]
Oceaneering donated a hyperbaric chamber to assist with the treatment on the Miskito Indian population in 1986.[38] The company donated a compressor in 1997 that along with money from the Divers Alert Network supported the continued medical coverage of the Miskito population.[39]
The Stavanger offshore tekniske skole, a Norwegian technical college, received a donated ROV in November 2009 to facilitate qualification examinations for their learners.[40] An ROV was donated to the South Central Louisiana Technical College in 2011 to support their unique ROV maintenance curriculum.[41]

History[edit]
Oceaneering was founded in 1964.[3]
In the early 1970s, Oceaneering supported a considerable amount of research into techniques to increase safety of their divers as well as general operation efficiency including their collaboration with Duke University Medical Center to explore the use of trimix breathing gas to reduce the incidence of high-pressure nervous syndrome.[4]
Oceaneering purchased the rights to the JIM suit in 1975. By 1979, a team from Oceaneering assisted Dr. Sylvia Earle in testing the application of Atmospheric diving suits for scientific diving operations by diving a JIM suit to 1,250 fsw.[5] Oceaneering also used WASP atmospheric diving suits.[6]
A dive team from Oceaneering salvaged three of the four propellers from the RMS Lusitania in 1982.[7]
From 1984 to 1988, Michael L. Gernhardt worked as Manager and then Vice President of Special Projects for Oceaneering International. During this time he led the development of a telerobotic system for subsea platform cleaning and inspection as well as a variety of new diver and robot tools.[8] In 1988, Gernhardt founded Oceaneering Space Systems, a company formed to transfer subsea technology and operational experience to the ISS program.[8]
Following the 1986 Space Shuttle Challenger disaster, Oceaneering teams recovered the Solid Rocket Booster that contained the faulty O-ring.[9]
Oceaneering was a NASDAQ listed company until 1991 when they moved to the New York Stock Exchange.
Oceaneering ROVs were used to determine what happened to the cargo ship Lucona in the 1991 murder and fraud investigation that claimed uranium mining equipment was lost when the vessel went down.[9]
Recovery of the airplane cockpit voice recorder in the loss of ValuJet Flight 592 was a priority in early 1996.[9] In the days following the loss of TWA Flight 800 later that same year, Oceaneering was contacted to provide ROV support to the US Navy lead search and recovery effort.[9]
Boeing and Fugro teamed up with Oceaneering in 2001 to begin integration of their advanced technology solutions into deep sea exploration.[10]
The company helped recover the Confederate submarine H. L. Hunley, which sank in 1864.[11][12] Several plans for the recovery were evaluated with the final recovery including a truss structure with foam to surround the body of the submarine.[13] On August 8, 2000, at 8:37 a.m., the sub broke the surface for the first time in more than 136 years.

On August 2, 2006, NASA indicated plans to issue a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the design, development, certification, production, and sustaining engineering of the Constellation Space Suit to meet the needs of the Constellation Program.[14] On June 11, 2008, NASA awarded a USD$745 million contract to Oceaneering for the creation and manufacture of this new space suit.[15]
NAVSEA awarded Oceaneering a maintenance contract for the Dry Deck Shelter program in 2006.[16] Dry Deck Shelters are used for transport of equipment like the Advanced SEAL Delivery System or a Combat Rubber Raiding Craft aboard a submarine.[17][18]
In 2009, a demonstrator crane was installed and integrated aboard the SS Flickertail State to evaluate the crane's performance in transporting containers between two moving ships in an operational environment using commercial and oil industry at-sea mooring techniques in the Gulf of Mexico.[19] Developed by the Sea Warfare and Weapons Department in the Office of Naval Research along with Oceaneering International, the crane has sensors and cameras as well as motion-sensing algorithms that let it automatically shift with the rolling and pitching of the sea, making it much easier for operators to center the crane over cargo and transfer it.[20][21]
Oceaneering teamed up with the Canadian company GRI Simulations to design and produce the ROV simulators they utilize for training, development of procedures, and equipment staging.[22] After a dispute over theft of trade secrets and copyright infringement that lasted several years, Oceaneering now licenses the VROV simulator system from GRI Simulations.[22][23]
A 2009 collaboration with Royal Dutch Shell saw the installation of a wireline at a record 2,673 ft of water for repairing a safety valve.[24]
On April 22, 2010, three Oceaneering ROV crews on board the Oceaneering vessel Ocean Intervention III, the DOF ASA Skandi Neptune, and the Boa International Boa Sub C began to map the seabed and assess the wreckage from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. The crews report "large amounts of oil that flowed out."[25] Oceaneering ROV Technician Tyrone Benton was later called as a witness to provide information on the leaks associated with BOP stack investigation but gave no reason why he later failed to appear in court.[26][27]
Petrobras, the biggest deepwater oilfield company in the world, placed the largest umbilical order in company history in 2012.[28]
As of 2012, eighty percent of Oceaneering's income was involved in deepwater work.[29] They are also the world's largest operator of ROVs.[29][30]
BAE Systems was contracted in October 2013 to build a support vessel to supplement their "subsea intervention services in the ultra-deep waters of the U.S. Gulf of Mexico".[31] Delivery is expected in 2016.[31]
Other Non-Oilfield Services[edit]
The company is also an active developer of educational and entertainment technology like the Shuttle Launch Experience at the Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex in Florida.[32] Oceaneering has developed motion-based dark ride vehicles for Transformers: The Ride, Justice League: Battle for Metropolis at Six Flags parks, Antarctica: Empire of the Penguin, and Speed of Magic, among others.[33][34][35] The company also developed animatronics for Universal Studios' Jurassic Park and Jaws rides.[36] In 2013, The Themed Entertainment Association awarded their Thea Award to Oceaneering Entertainment Systems (OES) for their Revolution™ Tru-Trackless™ ride system [37]
Community Outreach[edit]
Oceaneering donated a hyperbaric chamber to assist with the treatment on the Miskito Indian population in 1986.[38] The company donated a compressor in 1997 that along with money from the Divers Alert Network supported the continued medical coverage of the Miskito population.[39]
The Stavanger offshore tekniske skole, a Norwegian technical college, received a donated ROV in November 2009 to facilitate qualification examinations for their learners.[40] An ROV was donated to the South Central Louisiana Technical College in 2011 to support their unique ROV maintenance curriculum.[41]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
