                Jeff Turnas, president of 365 by Whole Foods Market, was Austin Business Journal's Face 2… more 

                Arnold Wells/Staff            








 



Launching a startup chain in the highly competitive grocery industry has consumed the energies of Jeff Turnas for the past 20-plus months.
Of course, it helps to have the financial and organizational heft of Whole Foods Market Inc. and its $9 billion-plus market capitalization behind you.

                            Jeff Turnas, president of 365 by Whole Foods Market, was Austin Business Journal's Face 2… more 
Arnold Wells/Staff










 


Turnas is the president of 365 by Whole Foods, a line of smaller, cheaper stores by the Austin-based company. He was the guest Tuesday for Austin Business Journal's monthly Face 2 Face interview series and spoke about the challenges of starting a new brand within an established corporation as well as his background and the team he's assembled.
Whole Foods (Nasdaq: WFM) announced the 365 brand in May 2015 and the first location opened in May 2016 near Los Angeles. Nos. 2 and 3 came online not long after near Portland and in the Seattle suburb of Bellevue, which was only 1.6 miles away from a traditional Whole Foods store.




"You're not going to go to 365 for the wow factor that you get at Whole Foods," Turnas said. "You're going to go for the wow factor of price and exciting products."
The first location in the Austin area is scheduled to open in spring 2017 in Endeavor Real Estate Group's The Parke development in Cedar Park. Turnas said Tuesday the store will partner with Austin's Easy Tiger Bake Shop & Beer Garden and JuiceLand for its "Friends of 365" program, which brings outside business into 365 locations to sell their unique wares and services.
Turnas also said the Austin area could support "several stores" but declined to give a specific number of how many 365 locations Central Texans can expect. He did say the company is already working on a second site in the area.
When John Mackey started the first Whole Foods store in Austin in 1980, he was a pioneer in organic and natural foods and the thorough sourcing of product providers. Now larger retail chains and upstarts are pressuring Whole Foods on both sides to cut prices as the entire industry deals with shifting consumer trends. The company has faced stiff competition from legacy grocery companies and big-box stores such as Kroger Co. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. as well as growing players in the sector, such as Trader Joe’s and Sprouts. Turnas said he even keeps an eye on Amazon.com, which is likely getting into bricks and mortar.

Turnas has been part of the shifting grocery landscape for about 30 years. He has been with Whole Foods since 1998, after it acquired the chain of small stores where he worked in Detroit. He has held various leadership positions at Whole Foods, most recently for six-plus years as president of the company's United Kingdom operations.




 


The goal of 365 by Whole Foods Market is to "keep our quality standards ... and deliver them at more competitive prices," Turnas said. He leads a team of about 30 people in a small office above the Recreational Equipment Inc. retail store in downtown Austin — across the street from Whole Foods' headquarters.
By controlling all of the purchasing for the 365 chain, Turnas said executives can promise more to vendors on issues such as product placement. 365 by Whole Foods Market also prices foods differently — by item or serving instead of by the pound.
"Someone can pick up an apple and see exactly what it costs," he said.
The 365 brand is also a chance for the company to experiment with new retail technology, such as improving the self-checkout process. Further advances, like checking out by the cart-load and using drones to deliver products, are farther off, Turnas said, but concepts that intrigue him.
Ultimately, 365 by Whole Foods Market will be a test for Austin's largest public company, which has about 90,000 employees worldwide — and whether it can deliver the same experience that made it a household name at lower prices. It aims to achieve that by reducing capital and labor costs — the 365 locations don't employ butchers or fishmongers — and using a loyalty program with customer discounts.
"Competition is certainly like we've never seen before," Turnas said. "It's so easy to get good food now .... Online, meal solutions — it's just everywhere you look there's competition. This is not the only thing we're doing at Whole Foods, it's one of the things.
"We've always been ahead," he added. "People have caught up a little faster than they used to in the past."

Whole Foods veteran Jeff Turnas’s plans for 365 by Whole Foods Market, a more efficient, lower-cost line of grocery stores, could have a ripple effect on the entire company.
By Sarah Kessler5 minute ReadWhen the first 365 by Whole Foods Market location opens on May 25 in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, Whole Foods fans will recognize the new grocery store’s quality standards, but not much else: Gone will be the seemingly endless selection of olive oils, the expert cheesemongers, and the artful displays of seasonal produce, single-origin coffee beans, and natural cosmetics. In their place will be simple design, streamlined product offerings—and markedly lower prices. “We’re like Whole Foods’ scrappy kid sister or brother,” says Jeff Turnas, the 21-year Whole Foods veteran at the new brand’s helm.advertisement






See this year’s list of 100 Most Creative People and all the other leaders who are shaping the future of business in creative ways.

Launching 365 is a huge strategic move for the Austin-based company. As organic and natural food continues its mainstream spread, Whole Foods, which developed its signature foodie-focused shopping experience throughout the ’90s and aughts, is facing competition from value-minded stores like Trader Joe’s, Sprouts, and Fresh Market, which cater to younger and less affluent shoppers. With Whole Foods’ same-store sales declining (they were down 1.8% in the first quarter of 2016), the company is hoping its new brand will appeal to a broader demographic and fit into neighborhoods that might not support a higher-end store. And if 365 teaches the company a thing or two about cost efficiency, all the better. “Imagine that Whole Foods Market is like a large cruise ship,” says co–CEO John Mackey. “It’s not that easy to turn a cruise ship. You can do it, but it takes time: 365 doesn’t have anything it has to overcome.”




A Whole New Vision
How Jeff Turnas and his team are trimming costs and lowering prices in the new 365 by Whole Foods Market stores
Store Design
A standardized layout with shorter shelves and freezer cases makes the stores cheaper to build and easier for customers to navigate, and requires fewer employees. Interiors will be left largely unfinished, with exposed ductwork and unpainted ceilings.
Product Displays
Digital price tags can be changed to reflect promotions without moving physical stickers or signs. Whenever possible, produce will be left in its original shipping crates, saving stocking time and reducing the chance of employees bruising or dropping items.
Customer Service
Instead of individual service counters, one unified team will oversee the entire store, which means customers are going to have to be much more self-reliant. The 365 mobile site will also do some heavy lifting. Much like the Whole Foods Market App, it will function as a loyalty card and digital shopping portal for Instacart delivery, but it will also tell shoppers which products are GMO–free, dairy-free, kosher, or “good for the earth.”
Employee Communication
Rather than using bulletin boards, log books, and back-of-house posters for communication, 365 employees will access announcements, including video demonstrations of new products, from a mobile app.
Operations And Ordering
Although each Whole Foods store selects its own products, only 10% of the inventory for 365 stores will come from local purveyors. A central team in Austin will take care of the rest, anchored by Whole Foods’ own 365 line. 

To pilot this new, agile boat, Mackey looked to Turnas, who started his career at Whole Foods as a beer buyer in 1995 and worked in five different territories before becoming president of the U.K. region in 2009. While there, he introduced partnerships that let popular restaurants operate inside his stores and pulled the cheesemonger out from behind the counter to interact more with customers. “Jeff led [the U.K.] entrepreneurially,” says Whole Foods Market executive VP of operations David Lannon. “We felt that he would have that same independent spirit when we launched this brand.” Last summer, Turnas moved to Austin and was given about a year to create an entirely new retail concept.He began with the stores’ basic design. While Whole Foods markets are built from scratch to reflect the communities in which they’re located, Turnas and his team created store formats that can be easily replicated across the country. “At Whole Foods, cookie-cutter is kind of a bad word,” Turnas says. “At 365, we love it because it allows us to be efficient and meet our goal of getting healthier food to more people.” The aim is for each 365 store to cost about half as much to build as a Whole Foods Market. Averaging about 30,000 square feet each, they’ll also be significantly smaller.Getting the product mix right has been key. Whereas Whole Foods prides itself on variety, Turnas whittled offerings down to what was most essential and affordable, which allows for a more streamlined central-ordering system. Nearly 50% of the nonperishable items will come from Whole Foods’ own lower-cost 365 label. The rest will be rigorously selected. A regular Whole Foods store, for instance, might carry 20 or 30 brands of water. In its efforts to keep prices lower, 365 plans to carry just four. Turnas and his team applied this approach—what they call “thoughtful simplicity”—to everything from store design to product displays.But even with a focus on value, Turnas found a way to keep some of Whole Foods’ flair in his new brand. He developed a “Friends of 365” program that installs third-party vendors inside the stores, similar to the partnerships he launched in the U.K. “With our lower-labor, lower-cost model, we can’t do everything,” he says. “So why not allow others to do it?” The Silver Lake store features a café by Allegro Coffee Company that sells both coffee and tap beer, and By Chloe, a New York City–based vegan-burger restaurant.“Our hope is that, as we grow, we can put these [365] stores all over,” Turnas says, “and put them in places where Whole Foods would never be able to go.” The company expects to launch three 365 stores by the end of the year (next up: Lake Oswego, Oregon; and Bellevue, Washington) and another 10 in 2017. But the ambition for the project is much larger. “We have to adapt Whole Foods to the future, and we can use 365 as an inspiration,” Lannon says. In other words, you may have Turnas to thank if you start finding a little more value at your local Whole Foods, too.advertisementRelated StoriesLeadershipThe One Question I Ask To Stop Negative Thoughts From Ruining My DayLeadershipFrom Office Footwear To Bad Interview Answers: This Week’s Top Leadership StoriesLeadershipHow To Structure The Week Before Vacation So The Friday Isn’t A NightmareadvertisementVideoIdeasIdeasNight Out For Safety and Liberation Asks How To Go Beyond Policing To Keep Communities SafeIdeasThis App Lets You Request Mental Health Help For A Homeless Person In DistressIdeasHow Sweden Is Fast Tracking Refugees Into The WorkforceEntertainmentEntertainmentNew Absolut Campaign Celebrates The Ongoing Fight For LGBTQ RightsEntertainment7 Times Obama’s Official Photographer Was Trump’s Classiest TrollEntertainment“Stranger Things 2” Thriller, Gucci Goes Trekkie: The Top 5 Ads Of The WeekCo.DesignCitiesThis Woman’s Travel Photos Are Better Than Yours — And She Never Leaves The HouseProductThis Airbnb For Great Architecture Is Curated By Two ArchitectsGraphicsThis Photo Captures Every Color In A Single Twinkling StarFast CompanyIdeasNight Out For Safety and Liberation Asks How To Go Beyond Policing To Keep Communities SafeIdeasThis App Lets You Request Mental Health Help For A Homeless Person In DistressTechnologyInside The ICO Bubble: Why Initial Coin Offerings Have Raised More Than $1 Billion Since January

365 by Whole Foods Market President Jeff Turnas Talks What to Expect; Sets Opening Date as May 25thThursday, Apr. 7th, 2016by Jessica DonnelVolume :   Read   Speed Read  AUSTIN, TX - Earlier this week, 365 by Whole Foods Market™ announced the opening date for its highly-anticipated first location, choosing May 25th for its Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles debut. Designed to accompany the Whole Foods brand by bringing fresh, healthy food to a younger, maybe less-affluent demographic, 365 has hopes to streamline and curate its products specifically to maximize that target market.

As reported by the Washington Post, Jeff Turnas, President of 365 by Whole Foods Markets, said he and his team have “looked and turned over every stone to find efficiencies…. We’re not putting as much capital into these stores as we would a traditional Whole Foods.”
This means taking steps to lay out the stores to reduce work and stocking times, and creating cheaper, simply designed displays—all in an effort to keep product pricing down. Even providing fewer product options is on the agenda for these stores that are expected to be only about 30,000-square-feet, compared to the 40,000 to 50,000-square-feet that is typical for a Whole Foods.

“Rather than 50 or 60 olive oils, we’re going to have 10,” Turnas said about his strategy to streamline the company’s stock of products. “But they’re going to be well-represented from around the world and [different] price points.”
Another big key difference is an emphasis on “prepared foods” and foodservice opportunities. The Washingon post reports that Turnas refers to 365’s program as “a little more get-it-yourself, self-serve” than what you see in a traditional Whole Foods. 365 is also introducing a program called “Friends of 365,” in which it will give other retailers or foodservice companies their own independent retail spaces inside of various locations.


“We’ve really dedicated ourselves to partnering with like-minded companies that are doing new and interesting things in their respective field to bring a truly unique shopping experience that complements our thoughtfully curated selection of foods,” Turnas added in a press release.
The first store in Silver Lake will include a 1,245-square-foot vegan fast-casual restaurant called Chloe, a 396-square-foot Allegro Coffee Company bar that will serve craft coffee and beer, and a self-serve kiosk called TeaBot that allows shoppers to mix up to three of 18 different teas and herbal ingredients. Shoppers will also be able to order online and get delivery services through Instacart, the company says.

As Whole Foods plans to open two additional 365 locations in 2016, and another 10 in 2017, the company looks to be trying to take on a significant part of the retail space in the near future.

Jeff Turnas: LOWERING THE GROCERY BILLFast Company May 24, 2016When the first 365 by Whole Foods Market location opens on May 25 in the Silver Lake neighborhood of Los Angeles, Whole Foods fans will recognize the new grocery store’s quality standards, but not much else: Gone will be the seemingly endless selection of olive oils, the expert cheesemongers, and the artful displays of seasonal produce, single-origin coffee beans, and natural cosmetics.

About Fast Company
Fast Company doesn’t cover today’s innovators and entrepreneurs by observing them from afar. Thanks to its writers’ hands-on coverage, Fast Company gets right in there – brainstorming, planning, acting and reacting – to bring readers those important examples of success that aren’t found in the framed quotations in an office lobby.
The “How I Did It” profiles that were once mainstays in business sections across the country have become, by their very nature, obsolete. Your readers don’t need the usual robotic Q&As with the corner-office protégés pointing out what worked 10 years ago. They’re not even sure they can relate to what worked last month, much less last year. Instead, they’re looking to reinvent themselves or their businesses by using examples that are at the forefront of innovation. And if those examples are still works in progress, even better.
Move those readers to the here-and-now with content from Fast Company, the country’s gold standard in coverage of forward-thinking businesses and the practices they choose to embrace. Magazine founders Alan Webber and Bill Taylor, former editors of the Harvard Business Review, sought to create a publication that focused on the latest trends in technology, ethical economics, design and leadership, and judging by Fast Company’s quick rise to hearts, minds and lips of today’s – no, make that tomorrow’s – generation of business leaders, they’ve succeeded in a big, big way.

Jeff Turnas


Jeff Turnas is President of 365 by Whole Foods Market™. He was appointed to lead Whole Foods Market’s new retail store brand in June 2015. In this role, Turnas has overall responsibility for launching the streamlined, quality-meets-value store concept in locations across the U.S. His strong operational and product background, combined with his design acumen and passion for customer experience, food and overall excellence, make him the ideal leader for 365 by Whole Foods Market. The new stores are slated to open in 2016 and will offer convenience and quality with everyday low prices on natural and organic products that meet Whole Foods Market’s industry-leading quality standards.
 After graduating from Michigan State University’s Eli Broad College of Business, Turnas began his career at Merchant of Vino in Detroit in 1995 and joined Whole Foods Market when the companies merged in 1998. His first job with the company was as an associate store team leader in Chicago’s Lakeview store. He also worked as the regional specialty coordinator in the Mid-Atlantic Region before moving back to the Midwest to become the regional specialty coordinator. Turnas then spent two years as the regional vice president of purchasing in the Midwest Region, followed by two years working as the Northeast Region vice president of purchasing. From 2007 to 2009, Turnas served as president of the North Atlantic Region.
In March 2009, Turnas was named president of the then newly developed U.K. Region, which expanded into Scotland in November 2011, and continues to grow. He has leadership experience in five different regions, with a varied background in both operations and product buying and sourcing.
Turnas serves on the board of Whole Planet Foundation, which is dedicated to alleviating poverty through microcredit in communities around the world that supply Whole Foods Market stores with products. He will reside in Austin, Texas, with his wife, Megan, daughters Raina and Remi, and son, Rocco.
