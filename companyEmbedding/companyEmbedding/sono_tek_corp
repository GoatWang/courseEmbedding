SonoFlux 2000F



SonoFlux 2000F Ultrasonic Spray Fluxer for Wave Soldering

Sono-Tek’s 2000F ultrasonic spray fluxing system was designed and developed for those manufacturers who run high volume dedicated lines, with the ability to run all flux types (including high solids rosin).
The 2000F ultrasonic spray fluxing system is ideal for high volume production using high solids rosin flux. It features very low maintenance and is equipped with a high velocity flux transfer system to help with PCBs that have difficulty with topside fill, such as those with thick back planes, tight lead-to-hole ratios, or contaminated components. PCB width range of 2-13 inches (50-330 mm) or 2-24 inches (50-610 mm) with flux deposition range of 300 – 2500 ug/in2 (for typical no-clean fluxes). Sono-Tek offers full service and support for all of our ultrasonic spray fluxing equipment.












SonoFlux 2000F Features:

Only a monthly clean up, even with rosin flux
High velocity flux transfer for maximum top-side fill
Uniform coverage
Reduction in flux consumption up to 80%
Non-clogging ultrasonic design
Elimination of thinner
Easy operation and maintenance
Compatibility with all fluxes
Deposition density control micrograms/inch
Single or dual nozzle configurations available

The 2000F is designed with a high transfer efficiency spray assembly and a closed spray chamber, to capture any rosin flux vapor in the environment.The system can either be installed internally in your wave solder machine, or can be available as a stand-alone unit, both with a variety of optional features.




Sono-Tek uses the ECD Fluxometer to test edge to edge coverage and through-hole penetration. Click on the image for an enlarged view.

Low maintenance and no operator intervention are the primary features of the SonoFlux 2000F. Only a monthly cleaning is necessary (even with sticky rosin flux).
The system is also equipped with a high velocity flux transfer system, to help with PCBs that have difficulty with topside fill, such as those with thick back planes, tight lead-to-hole ratios, or contaminated components.

SelectaFlux Retrofit



SelectaFlux Retrofit Spray Fluxing System

The SelectaFlux retrofit system is a complete, ready-to-integrate selective fluxing system. SelectaFlux easily retrofits into all major selective wave soldering machines and features minimal waste and overspray with a significant reduction in flux consumption.
SelectaFlux Retrofit Control Module Features:

Compatible with ALL fluxes
Requires only a trigger signal to operate
Controlled-velocity spray will not harm or disturb components
Wide range of delivery rates from 1 – 250 microliters/second
Also ideal for tinning and odd-shaped components
Spray pattern adjustable from 0.070 – 1.50 inches
Self-cleaning ultrasonic nozzle – no clogging
No overspray means no waste



Complete SelectaFlux OEM System Includes:

Control Module
Broadband generator
Electrical inputs and outputs
Digital display for nozzle power and liquid delivery pressure
Panel-mounted nozzle power
Flow rate and air pressure adjustments
Air shroud pressure control

Optional: SelectaFlux Dual Retrofit control module is available to control 2 nozzles from one control box.

Operating Principle
The SelectaFlux Retrofit system is a complete, ready-to-integrate selective fluxing system. It combines Sono-Tek’s unique Microspray ultrasonic atomizing nozzle with low-pressure air to produce a controlled, highly focused beam of spray. A separate control module handles input/output system functions.
Compressed air, typically at 1 psi, is introduced into the diffusion chamber of the air shroud,which produces a uniformly distributed flow of air around the nozzle stem.
The ultrasonically produced spray at the tip of the stem is immediately entrained in the air stream.
The spray envelope is bow-shaped. The width of the bow is controlled by adjusting the distance between the nozzle tip and substrate. The distance between nozzle and substrate can be varied from near-contact to approximately two inches.

WideTrack Flat Glass Manufacturing



Wide Area Glass Coating Systems

WideTrack flat glass coating systems deposit a soft, uniform, controllable spray over any size sheets of flat glass panels with no dripping and very little overspray and atmospheric contamination. The WideTrack System offers significant advantages over conventional pressure spray methods in a broad range of applications. Whether you are coating moving webs of automotive manufacturing flat glass, architectural glass, anti-reflection layers onto solar glass, flat panel displays, or touch screens, the WideTrack system maintains precise control of the coating at the flow rate you specify.
Waste is greatly reduced when using ultrasonic spray, since the low velocity spray produces minimal overspray with no bounceback of material off the substrate, and maintenance is kept to a minimum because ultrasonic nozzles will not clog. In addition, the titanium and 316 stainless steel construction of the WideTrack makes it compatible with glass manufacturing solutions. Ultrasonic spray enables very thin uniform layers and tight deposition control that is not possible with pressure spray.












The WideTrack Coating System uses a non-clogging ultrasonic atomizing nozzle to produce a low-velocity, highly controllable spray for reliable, consistent results.
WideTrack system benefits for glass manufacturing processes:

Economical alternative to CVD deposition methods
Non-clogging ultrasonic nozzle ensures drip free spray mist
Ultra-low flow rate capabilities, intermittent or continuous
Covers up to 24” with one nozzle or use multiple nozzles to cover any width substrate
Uniform coating with high transfer efficiency
Low-velocity spray – minimal bounceback and overspray
No moving parts
Proven in glass manufacturing plants worldwide
Reduced material consumption



Operating Principle: Each spray assembly contains a pair of air jets which alternately pulse to drive the spray downward. The timing and force of the pulses produces a spray pattern that oscillates back and forth across the substrate.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Four Easy Steps to Market Your Practice OnlineThanks to advancing technology, marketing a medical practice online doesn't have to be costly and confusing. In fact, it can be distilled down into four basic steps that anyone can take. These are: (1) Creating a viable, enhanced practice website, (2) utilizing techniques to be found by patients online, (3) engaging in social media and mobile health apps, and (4) monitoring your online reputation. We'll discuss these in this whitepaper as well as the best practices for each.

A mix of SEO tips, good marketing strategy, and tested usability features, here's the eight must-haves for your medical practice website.Download This ResearchAutomated On-Call Scheduling: Small Step, Big GainsTackling administrative challenges in healthcare enterprises often means big resource commitments that take years to pay off.

Advanced Search

                There are 3 types of search. Please only use one option at a time.
                
1) Build a boolean search string.
Ensure that document matches include...

...all of these word(s):



...and optionally include these word(s):



...but do not have these word(s):




2) Search for a phrase:

Enter your phrase:




3) Search on part of a word:

Enter the first few characters of a word:




Submit



Information on how to use Search

                    There are 2 types of basic queries: Terms and Phrases.
                    A Term is a single word search.
                    A Phrase would wrap a string of words in quotes and find matches on the extact string.
                

Boolean Operators
You can combine basic queries with Boolean operators to form a more complex query. Boolean operators define the relationships between Terms or Phrases. Our search supports the following Boolean operators: AND, "+", OR, NOT and "-". Please note that Boolean operators must be all uppercase.
                

AND
example search: default AND document
                    This is the default operator. It will be used if there is no Boolean operator between two terms. For example:
                    default document is the same as default AND document. In this case both terms need to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.The + character is synonymous with using AND.
                

OR
example search: default OR document
                    In this case just one of the terms needs to exist within a listing to find a match on that listing.
                

NOT
example search: default NOT "document type"
                    The NOT operator excludes documents that contain the term (or phrase) after NOT. So a listing match would have to include the word default but not the phrase "document type". The - character is synonymous with using NOT.
                

Wildcard/Prefix queries
You can perform "wildcard" or "prefix" queries using the '*' operator. Whereas all of the previous search found exact matches on the whole term or phrase, a wildcard search will find partial matches.
                    example search: ehr*
                    This query will match all documents containing words beginning with the prefix 'ehr' like the word Ehrlichia.
