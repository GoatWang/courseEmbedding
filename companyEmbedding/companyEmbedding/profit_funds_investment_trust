Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

Investment Philosophy & Process

Investment PhilosophyProfit Investments utilizes a valuation-sensitive growth investing style. Our investment philosophy is based on the belief that mispriced businesses can be found within the stock market at any point within the market cycle. Mispriced businesses occur for a variety of reasons, including stocks trading down in sympathy with the industry, another stock or the market. We look to own quality companies trading at a discount, that have a catalyst to help them reach their intrinsic value (i.e.  the value our analysts assign to a company) after a rigorous evaluation process. That evaluation process blends bottoms-up analysis, quantitative and qualitative analysis and risk-control guidelines.Investment ProcessUtilizing our investment philosophy, Profit Investments seeks to invest in companies that exhibit strong fundamentals, solid growth rates and attractive franchises, where the stock market price reflects a discount to a company's intrinsic values at the time of purchase. Our investment process includes thorough Research, developing a Stock Thesis, having Conviction on a stock and Monitoring that stock on an ongoing basis.

Managing Risk
Risk control is critically important to our firm.We build portfolios one stock at a time, based on fundamental valuation criteria. Our primary risk control measure is careful stock selection through fundamental financial statement analysis and investment thesis consideration.Profit Investments also has developed a warning system designed to identify potential underperformance in our portfolios. This system employs price triggers that call for reevaluation of the position to outright liquidation. We research each instance where the warning system is called to action to determine what, if any changes, need to be made to our investment process.

Our approach

Leaders of small and mid-sized businesses have multiple roles and competing priorities. You want a best-in-class retirement plan but may be unsure about all the complexities and requirements. You may be uncertain about the costs and fees involved. You need a provider focused solely on retirement and aligned with your needs and goals—and fully committed to you, your participants, and the ongoing improvement of retirement investing.

Vanguard is committed to the retirement business and is a leader in the retirement plan industry. Best of all, you can benefit from Vanguard's unique ownership structure: We're owned by our clients and not by outside investors or stockholders. That means you never need to question whose interests come first for us. This approach serves as a foundation for all that we do with Vanguard Retirement Plan Access™, our 401(k) offer for small and mid-sized plans. You can count on our expertise to remove the uncertainties from managing your plan and our leadership to help you offer a strong plan for your participants. 



Key benefits




You can:

Have confidence in your plan.
Understand your costs.
Focus on your business.





Cost-conscious?
As a business owner and plan fiduciary, you want to eliminate ambiguity in retirement plan costs. Research has shown that plan costs for the smaller end of the market tend to be higher, and you need a retirement plan provider that not only provides transparent pricing but has a fair and reasonable cost structure.1
With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access:

You receive an All-in Fee Report that shows the total cost of your plan.
You have access to low-cost Vanguard index funds, plus the opportunity to choose from among more than 12,000 non-Vanguard funds.
Your annual recordkeeping price is based on a per-participant fee—a fee that doesn't jump as your assets grow, as with many small to mid-sized retirement plans.
You have flexibility in how you cover your plan costs—including a recordkeeping credit depending on the share class selected.




Too busy?
 As a business owner, you're pressed for time and focused on many aspects of business. With Vanguard Retirement Plan Access, you can rely on high-quality recordkeeping and administration to ease your administrative burden and help your employees stay on track for retirement.

History[edit]
Profit Investment Management was founded in 1996 by Eugene Profit as Investor Resources Group. The firm began with $300,000 of capital under management. After taking over the position of portfolio manager on November 1, 1997, Eugene launched the Profit Fund, the firm’s flagship retail mutual fund.[1] Under Profit’s management, the Profit Fund rose 62% from late 1997 to 1999, compared with 51% for the S&P 500.[2]
On July 9, 1999, the Profit Fund was given a 5-star rating from Mutual Funds Magazine, and from then on has consistently provided rates of returns surpassing those of the S&P 500, Russell 1000, and Russell 2000.[3]
On June 30, 2000, the Profit Fund was ranked Number 2 among 232 large-cap value funds with a three-year average annual return of 23.22%.[4]
In June 2008, Profit Investment Management was named one of the nation’s largest black-owned businesses by Black Enterprise Magazine, ranking 14th in the Asset Manager category. The firm had $1.358 billion under management at the time.[5]
As of December 31, 2009, the firm’s asset under management reached approximately $1.7 billion.[6]
Investment Style[edit]
Profit is often cited for its unique investment strategy which combines elements of value and growth investing. Over the firm's 14-year history, the strategy has evolved from a "value strategy with a growth overlay" to a "valuation-sensitive growth strategy,"[7] which selects growth stocks deemed as mispriced relative to their peers and their own price history. The expectation of the strategy is that a catalyst will eventually incite investors to re-evaluate such stocks, thereby causing prices of these equities to rise.[8]
Profit in the Media[edit]
Profit Investment Management has appeared on several financial media sources. The firm’s CEO and several of its employees have provided financial commentary on prominent financial news networks including Business Week,[9] SmartMoney, Black Enterprise,[10] Pension & Investments,[11] Investor's Business Daily,[12] Dow Jones Newswires,[13] The Wall Street Transcript,[14] Wall Street Week, Money Line, CNBC, and CNN.[15]

History[edit]
Profit Investment Management was founded in 1996 by Eugene Profit as Investor Resources Group. The firm began with $300,000 of capital under management. After taking over the position of portfolio manager on November 1, 1997, Eugene launched the Profit Fund, the firm’s flagship retail mutual fund.[1] Under Profit’s management, the Profit Fund rose 62% from late 1997 to 1999, compared with 51% for the S&P 500.[2]
On July 9, 1999, the Profit Fund was given a 5-star rating from Mutual Funds Magazine, and from then on has consistently provided rates of returns surpassing those of the S&P 500, Russell 1000, and Russell 2000.[3]
On June 30, 2000, the Profit Fund was ranked Number 2 among 232 large-cap value funds with a three-year average annual return of 23.22%.[4]
In June 2008, Profit Investment Management was named one of the nation’s largest black-owned businesses by Black Enterprise Magazine, ranking 14th in the Asset Manager category. The firm had $1.358 billion under management at the time.[5]
As of December 31, 2009, the firm’s asset under management reached approximately $1.7 billion.[6]
Investment Style[edit]
Profit is often cited for its unique investment strategy which combines elements of value and growth investing. Over the firm's 14-year history, the strategy has evolved from a "value strategy with a growth overlay" to a "valuation-sensitive growth strategy,"[7] which selects growth stocks deemed as mispriced relative to their peers and their own price history. The expectation of the strategy is that a catalyst will eventually incite investors to re-evaluate such stocks, thereby causing prices of these equities to rise.[8]
Profit in the Media[edit]
Profit Investment Management has appeared on several financial media sources. The firm’s CEO and several of its employees have provided financial commentary on prominent financial news networks including Business Week,[9] SmartMoney, Black Enterprise,[10] Pension & Investments,[11] Investor's Business Daily,[12] Dow Jones Newswires,[13] The Wall Street Transcript,[14] Wall Street Week, Money Line, CNBC, and CNN.[15]

Important Disclosure

Unless otherwise stated, portfolio facts and statistics are shown for Class A shares; other classes may have different characteristics.

 †NAV: Unless you are eligible for a waiver, the public offering price you pay when you buy Class A shares of the Fund is the Net Asset Value (NAV) of the shares plus an initial sales charge. The initial sales charge varies depending upon the size of your purchase.  No sales charge is imposed where Class A or Class C shares are issued to you pursuant to the automatic investment of income dividends or capital gains distributions. It is the responsibility of the financial intermediary to ensure that the investor obtains the proper “breakpoint” discount. Class C, Class I and Class Y do not have an initial sales charge; however, Class C does charge a contingent deferred redemption charge.  See the 
                          
    prospectus for more information.
1Van Eck Associates Corporation (the “Adviser”) has agreed to waive fees and/or pay Fund expenses to the extent necessary to prevent the operating expenses of the Fund (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, interest expense, trading expenses, dividends and interest payments on securities sold short, taxes and extraordinary expenses) from exceeding 1.38% for Class A, 2.20% for Class C, 0.95% for Class I, and 1.13% for Class Y of the Fund’s average daily net assets per year until May 1, 2018. During such time, the expense limitation is expected to continue until the Board of Trustees acts to discontinue all or a portion of such expense limitation.
2The S&P North American Natural Resources Sector (SPGINRTR) Index (the "Index") provides investors with a benchmark that represents U.S. traded securities that are classified under the GICS® energy and materials sector excluding the chemicals industry; and steel sub-industry. The MSCI ACWI Commodity Producers Index captures the global opportunity set of commodity producers in the energy, metal and agricultural sectors. All indices are unmanaged and include the reinvestment of all dividends, but do not reflect the payment of transaction costs, advisory fees or expenses that are associated with an investment in the Fund. An index’s performance is not illustrative of the Fund’s performance. Indices are not securities in which investments can be made.
The views and opinions expressed are those of VanEck. Fund manager commentaries are general in nature and should not be construed as investment advice. Opinions are subject to change with market conditions. Any discussion of specific securities mentioned in the commentaries is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation to buy these securities. Fund holdings will vary.
You can lose money by investing in the Fund. Any investment in the Fund should be part of an overall investment program, not a complete program. The Fund is subject to risks associated with concentrating its investments in hard assets and the hard assets sector, including, precious metals and natural resources, and can be significantly affected by events relating to these industries, including international political and economic developments, inflation, and other factors. The Fund’s portfolio securities may experience substantial price fluctuations as a result of these factors, and may move independently of the trends of industrialized companies. The Fund’s investments in foreign securities involve risks related to adverse political and economic developments unique to a country or a region, currency fluctuations or controls, and the possibility of arbitrary action by foreign governments, including the takeover of property without adequate compensation or imposition of prohibitive taxation. The Fund is also subject to inflation risk, short-sales risk, market risk, non-diversification risk, leverage risk, credit risk and counterparty risk. Please see the 
        
    prospectus and      
    summary prospectus for information on these and other risk considerations.
Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. An investor should consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the investment company carefully before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contain this and other information.  Please read them carefully before investing.

Meet Wendy Kirkland
 
How  did an award-winning artist and sculptor who owned an eclectic gift shop in  Historic Biltmore Village, end up an option guru?  Let’s see…
In  2004 a freak flood destroyed the retail business Wendy and her husband had  poured every bit of their time and money into for more than 25 years. 
Since  they had no flood insurance, they lost everything… and were in real trouble.  Fortunately, a friend introduced Wendy to options trading.
Desperate  to save her family from financial ruin, Wendy started reading books, watching  financial news, and taking courses… struggling with the same sort of ups and  downs as most new traders.
Then  one day she stumbled upon a miraculous discovery.  By combining two common indicators into one,  she created a hybrid indicator that’s nearly 100% infallible!
Practically  overnight Wendy was making more money trading than she and Jack had ever made  in their store!
Inspired to help other women enjoy the financial security  she had found, Wendy started giving onIine classes. And in 2009 she  co-authored a book entitled: “Option Trading In Your Spare Time—A Guide to  Financial Independence for Women”.
“I feel I was  given a second chance,” Wendy said. “So I felt I owed it to society to give  back, and help others.  And go make a  difference”
And that’s exactly what she’s done… in spades!
Get this, undeterred by the title and pretty pink cover of her first  book, even more men than women ended up buying it!   And  that led to 6 more books, trading courses, newsletters, and advisory services.
Written about in Money Magazine, Small Business Opportunities Magazine,  and Investor’s Business Daily… Wendy is quoted as saying :  “I LOVE  that my books have helped so many people achieve financial independence through  trading, just like I had.”
Grandma’s  Simple Secret for Extra Income is Wendy’s gift to you... ENJOY!
 
Option and stock investing involves risk and is not suitable  for all investors. Only invest money you can afford to lose in stocks and  options. Past performance does not guarantee future results. The trade entry  and exit prices represent the price of the security at the time the recommendation  was made. The trade record does not represent actual investment results. Trade  examples are simulated and have certain limitations. Simulated results do not  represent actual trading. Since the trades have not been executed, the results  may have under or over compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market  factors such as lack of liquidity. No representation is being made that any  account will or is likely to achieve profit or losses similar to those shown.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
