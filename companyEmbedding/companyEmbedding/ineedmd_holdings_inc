A stock fund or ETF with a higher beta than the S&P 500 will rise or fall to a greater degree. In contrast, a stock fund or ETF with a low beta will rise or fall less.

Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
New York, NY (UPTICK Newswire – November 15th, 2016) – This annual report on Form 10-K and other reports filed by iNeedMD Holdings, Inc. (OTC:NEMD) (the “Company”) from time to time with the SEC (collectively, the “Filings”) contain or may contain forward-looking statements and information that are based upon beliefs of, and information currently available to, the Company’s management as well as estimates and assumptions made by Company’s management. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which are only predictions and speak only as of the date hereof. When used in the Filings, the words “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “expect,” “future,” “intend,” “plan,” or the negative of these terms and similar expressions as they relate to the Company or the Company’s management identify forward-looking statements. Such statements reflect the current view of the Company with respect to future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions, and other factors, including the risks relating to the Company’s business, industry, and the Company’s operations and results of operations. Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ significantly from those anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended, or planned.
ADVERTISING
inRead invented by Teads
Although the Company believes that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements are reasonable, the Company cannot guarantee future results, levels of activity, performance, or achievements. Except as required by applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, the Company does not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these statements to actual results.
Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates, judgments and assumptions. We believe that the estimates, judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates, judgments and assumptions are made. These estimates, judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Our financial statements would be affected to the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP and does not require management’s judgment in its application. There are also areas in which management’s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report.

We intend for this discussion to provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles affect our financial statements.
Business Overview
iNeedMD Holdings, Inc. (“iNeedMD” or the “Company” and formerly Clutterbug Move Management, Inc.) was incorporated on February 1, 2012, under the laws of the State of Nevada. iNeedMD is a medical device company that has developed a disposable device called The EKG Glove that standardizes and simplifies the placement of a system of electrodes and lead wire circuitry required to obtain a diagnostic, 12-lead Electrocardiogram (“ECG” or “EKG”). An ECG is the mainstay in the assessment of cardiac health and is used in the diagnosis, prevention, and monitoring of cardiovascular disease. The EKG Glove is FDA-cleared and CE-Marked and therefore has the appropriate regulatory clearances for sale in the US and the EU.

Revenue
Revenue was $44,165 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $910 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The increase in revenue is primarily attributable to orders from international distribution partners, for products used for demonstration purposes in order to increase product awareness and generate future sales among their customer bases. The Company also had direct sales activity with a US governmental agency who is assessing the use of The EKG Glove System. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company focused their efforts on research and development and finalizing the commercial version of The EKG Glove.
Gross Profit
Gross profit percentage for the year ended December 31, 2015 was (213.0)%; as compared to 66.4% for the year ended December 31, 2014. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company accepted some orders from international distribution partners, some at discounted prices, for demonstration purposes in order to increase product awareness and generate future sales. The Company also had direct sales activity with a US governmental agency who is assessing the use of The EKG Glove system. The gross profit decline is also attributable to a write-off of $105,499 for obsolete inventory recorded by the Company during the year ended December 31, 2015.
Compensation
Compensation was $970,246 for the year ended December 31, 2015 compared to $35,038,488 for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $34,068,242. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company expensed $580,154 in share based payments for warrants issued compared to share based payments of $34,408,043 for shares issued to consultants during the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease is offset by the Company hiring employees to perform business functions instead of hiring consultants.
Consulting Fees
Consulting fees, including related party consulting fees, were $452,806 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $1,293,522 for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $840,716. The decrease is attributable to the Company hiring employees instead of consultants to perform business functions. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company utilized consultants to transition from a private to a publicly traded company.
Sales and Marketing
Sales and marketing expenses, including related party sales and marketing fees, were $109,068 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $356,944 for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $247,876. The decrease is attributable to the Company no longer incurring significant marketing expenses associated the India subsidiary formed during the first quarter of 2014. This was partially offset by the Company incurring significant expenses sending product demos to potential customers during the year ended December 31, 2015.
Research and Development
Research and development expenses were $87,300 for the year ended December 31, 2015 versus $697,142 for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $609,842. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company incurred less research and development expenses as it primarily focused on introducing the commercialized version of The EKG Glove in the international marketplace. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company focused on refining the design of The EKG Glove and initiating the development of a portable Electrocardiography acquisition device that will feature a wireless interface with application software.
General and Administrative Expenses
General and administrative expenses were $1,109,260 for the year ended December 31, 2015 versus $1,207,946 for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $98,686. The decrease is attributable to the additional legal, audit and accounting expenses associated with the transition from a private to a publicly traded company during the prior year.
Interest Expense
Interest expense was $19,000 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $96,444 for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of 77,444. The decrease is attributable to the Company repaying and converting most of its outstanding debt by the end of 2014.
Amortization of Debt Discount and Issuance Costs
Amortization of debt discount was $59,177 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $1,233,334 for the year ended December 31, 2014, a decrease of $1,174,157. The decrease is attributable to the Company repaying and converting most of its outstanding debt by the end of 2014. The majority of the expense during the year ended December 31, 2014 was attributable to the warrants issued in connection with Ayer Notes I & II.
Amortization of debt issuance costs was $0 for the year ended December 31, 2015 as compared to $129,459 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease is attributable to the Company repaying Ayer Notes I and II during the summer of 2014.
Derivative Expense
Derivative expense was $0 for the year ended December 31, 2015 versus $1,141,407 for the year ended December 31, 2014. The decrease in the derivative expense is attributable to the value of the warrants issued in the first quarter of 2014 as consideration for extending the maturity date on Ayer Note I.
Change in Fair Value of Derivative Liabilities
Change in fair value of derivative liabilities was a gain of $27,583 for the year ended December 31, 2015 versus a gain of $944,994 for the year ended December 31, 2014.
Net Loss
For the reasons mentioned above, net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 was $4,948,188, or a loss per share of $0.010 to Common A shareholders. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $40,312,486 or loss per share of $1.45 to Common A shareholders.
Liquidity and Capital Resources
The following table summarizes total current assets, liabilities and working capital at December 31, 2015, compared to December 31, 2014:
December 31, Increase 2015 December 31, 2014 (Decrease) Current Assets $ 1,117,184 $ 2,616,029 $ (1,498,845 ) Current Liabilities $ 3,888,847 $ 2,324,338 $ 1,564,509 Working Capital (Deficit) $ (2,771,663 ) $ 291,691 $ (3,063,354 )
At December 31, 2015, we had working capital deficit of $2,771,663 as compared to working capital of $291,691 at December 31, 2014, a decrease in working capital of $3,063,354. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in cash of $2,345,427.
Net Cash
Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $2,345,427 and $4,566,234, respectively. The net loss for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $4,948,188 and $40,312,486, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2015, the net loss was offset by share based payments for warrants issued, amortization of debt discount, and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses, and the recording of the accrued settlement liability these increases were offset by the increase in inventory in anticipation of future fulfillment of distribution agreements. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the net loss was offset by share based payments to employees and consultants, the amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount on the notes payable, and the derivative expense.
Investing
Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2014 was $417,017 paid for the purchase of equipment and payment of reverse merger fees.
Financings
During the year ended December 31, 2015, the Company did not engage in any financing activities. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we received proceeds of $7,513,965 from the issuance of Class A common shares and $600,000 from the issuance of a convertible note. The issuance of additional debt during the year ended December 31, 2014 resulted in the payment of $27,000 in debt issuance costs. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we also repaid $1,350,000 and $150,000 of convertible notes and notes payable, respectively.
Going Concern
As reflected in the accompanying financial statements, the Company had a net loss and net cash used in operations of $4,948,188 and $2,345,427, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015. Furthermore, the Company had a working capital deficiency and an accumulated deficit of $2,771,663 and $120,288,517, respectively, as of December 31, 2015. The Company does not generate significant revenue. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The ability of the Company to continue its operations as a going concern is dependent on Management’s plans, which include the raising of capital through debt and/or equity markets with some additional funding from other traditional financing sources, including term notes, until such time that funds provided by operations are sufficient to fund working capital requirements. The Company may need to incur additional liabilities with certain related parties to sustain the Company’s existence.
The Company will require additional funding to finance the growth of its current and expected future operations as well as to achieve its strategic objectives. The Company believes its current available cash along with anticipated revenues may be insufficient to meet its cash needs for the near future. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. These financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recovery of the recorded assets or the classification of the liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the Company had no off-balance sheet arrangements.
Critical Accounting Policies
We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.”
Revenue Recognition
The Company follows paragraph 605-10-S99-1 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for revenue recognition. The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.
Use of Estimates
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.
The Company’s significant accounting estimates and assumptions affecting the consolidated financial statements were the estimates and assumptions used in valuation of equity and derivative instruments. Those significant accounting estimates or assumptions bear the risk of change due to the fact that there are uncertainties attached to those estimates or assumptions, and certain estimates or assumptions are difficult to measure or value.
Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Management regularly reviews its estimates utilizing currently available information, changes in facts and circumstances, historical experience and reasonable assumptions. After such reviews, and if deemed appropriate, those estimates are adjusted accordingly. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
Stock Based Compensation
All stock-based payments to employees, non-employee consultants, and to nonemployee directors for their services as directors, including any grants of restricted stock and stock options, are measured at fair value on the grant date and recognized in the statements of operations as compensation or other expense over the relevant service period. Stock- based payments to nonemployees are recognized as an expense over the period of performance. Such payments are measured at fair value at the earlier of the date a performance commitment is reached or the date performance is completed. In addition, for awards that vest immediately and are non-forfeitable the measurement date is the date the award is issued.
Fair Value of Financial Instruments
We follow paragraph 825-10-50-10 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification for disclosures about fair value of our financial instruments and paragraph 820-10-35-37 of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (“Paragraph 820-10-35-37”) to measure the fair value of our financial instruments. Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”), and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. To increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements and related disclosures, Paragraph 820-10-35-37 establishes a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into broad levels. The fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs.
Derivative Instruments
We evaluate our convertible debt and warrants to determine if those contracts or embedded components of those contracts qualify as derivatives to be separately accounted for in accordance with Paragraph 810-10-05-4 and Paragraph 815-40-25 of the Codification. The result of this accounting treatment is that the fair value of the embedded derivative is marked-to-market each balance sheet date and recorded as a liability. In the event that the fair value is recorded as a liability, the change in fair value is recorded in the statements of operations as other income or expense. Upon conversion or exercise of a derivative instrument, the instrument is marked to fair value at the conversion date and the fair value is reclassified to equity.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In May 2014, FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers. The revenue recognition standard affects all entities that have contracts with customers, except for certain items. The new revenue recognition standard eliminates the transaction and industry-specific revenue recognition guidance under current GAAP and replaces it with a principle-based approach for determining revenue recognition. On July 9th the effective date was delayed one year by a vote by the FASB. Public business entities, certain not-for-profit entities, and certain employee benefit plans would apply the guidance in ASU 2014-09 to annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. Earlier application would be permitted only as of annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2016, including interim reporting periods within that reporting period. The Company has reviewed the applicable ASU and has not, at the current time, quantified the effects of this pronouncement, however it believes that there will be no material effect on the consolidated financial statements.
In June 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-12, Compensation- Stock Compensation. The amendments in this update apply to reporting entities that grant their employees share-based payments in which the terms of the award provide that a performance target can be achieved after the requisite service period. This Accounting Standards Update is the final version of Proposed Accounting Standards Update EITF-13D-Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Accounting for Share-Based Payments When the Terms of an Award Provide That a Performance Target Could Be achieved after the Requisite Service Period, which has been deleted. The amendments require that a performance target that affects vesting and that could be achieved after the requisite service period be treated as a performance condition. A reporting entity should apply existing guidance in Topic 718 as it relates to awards with performance conditions that affect vesting to account for such awards. As such, the performance target should not be reflected in estimating the grant-date fair value of the award. Compensation cost should be recognized in the period in which it becomes probable that the performance target will be achieved and should represent the compensation cost attributable to the period(s) for which the requisite service has already been rendered. If the performance target becomes probable of being achieved before the end of the requisite service period, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost should be recognized prospectively over the remaining requisite service period. The total amount of compensation cost recognized during and after the requisite service period should reflect the number of awards that are expected to vest and should be adjusted to reflect those awards that ultimately vest. The requisite service period ends when the employee can cease rendering service and still be eligible to vest in the award if the performance target is achieved. As indicated in the definition of vest, the stated vesting period (which includes the period in which the performance target could be achieved) may differ from the requisite service period. The amendments in this update are effective for annual periods and interim periods within those annual periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and early adoption is permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the effects of ASU 2014-12 on consolidated financial statements.
In August 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2014-15, Presentation of Financial Statements- Going Concern.
In March 2015, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2015-03, Interest-Imputation of Interest. To simplify presentation of debt issuance costs, the amendments in this Update would require that debt issuance costs be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of debt liability, consistent with debt discounts or premiums. The recognition and measurement guidance for debt issuance costs would not be affected by the amendments in this update. This Accounting Standards Update is the final version of Proposed Accounting Standards Update 2014-250-Interest-Imputation of Interest (Subtopic 835-30), which has been deleted. The amendments in this update are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2015, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company early adopted ASU 2015-03 on these consolidated financial statements.
In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-11, “Inventory (Topic 330):
In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update ASU No. 2015-17, Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes, which will require entities to present deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet. The ASU simplifies the current . . .

iNeedMD Signs Agreement With Turkish Distributor




















June 09, 2015 12:44 ET

 | Source: iNeedMD Holdings, Inc.





NEW YORK, June 9, 2015 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- iNeedMD Holdings, Inc. (OTC:NEMD) ("iNeedMD") a medical device development company, is proud to announce the signing of a distribution agreement with Mayar Medical, a leading supplier of medical equipment and devices in Istanbul, Turkey. Mayar Medical will represent iNeedMD's first-in-class disposable electrocardiogram lead set, The EKG Glove™ and related products, to public and private sector hospitals, physicians and emergency medical providers.

	The EKG Glove™ is an FDA-cleared and CE-marked disposable medical device that standardizes and simplifies the acquisition of an electrocardiogram (EKG/ECG). An EKG assesses the electrical activity of an individual's heart and is one of the most enduring diagnostic tools utilized by cardiologists. Traditionally, the accuracy of the test has been dependent on a skilled technician's ability to correctly affix a complex network of 10 electrodes and 10 corresponding lead wires onto a patient's chest prior to initiating the EKG test. The configuration process for these 20 individual components can be time-consuming and fraught with the potential for error due to electrode misplacement or lead reversal.

	The EKG Glove™ streamlines this usually cumbersome pre-test procedure by integrating pre-positioned electrodes and printed circuit technology into a single-use, "peel-and-stick" glove-like sheath. In approximately 30 seconds, a user can simply remove the backing, insert his or her right hand, and apply The EKG Glove™ to the patient's chest. The EKG Glove™ is versatile - it can be paired with legacy EKG machinery or with a Portable Bluetooth Interface device, also offered by iNeedMD, to facilitate EKG testing in virtually any location.

	Thomas A. Nicolette, Chief Executive Officer and President of iNeedMD Holdings, Inc. commented, "We are excited to be launching The EKG Glove™ in the emergency medical sector due to the product's focus on time-efficiency, diagnostic accuracy and portability. We are thrilled to be working with the progressive sales and marketing team at Mayar Medical. Hakan Gürbüz, Mayar Medical's General Manager, has already shown his dedication to our products through the purchase of an initial inventory of The EKG Glove™ and attendance at various emergency medical congresses throughout Turkey. We look forward to supporting Mayar Medical's selling efforts, which are set to formally launch in the second half of 2015."

Zacks Rank:



 




Style Scores:



NA Value | NA Growth | NA Momentum | NA VGM                


The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.


Value Score
A


Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.



Value Score

Growth Score

Momentum Score

VGM Score

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

It also includes an industry comparison table to see how your stock compares to its expanded industry, and the S&P 500.
Researching stocks has never been so easy or insightful as with the ZER Analyst and Snapshot reports.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.
