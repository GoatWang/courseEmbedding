 NexPoint Credit Strategies Fund Announces Multifamily REIT Spin-Off



in Press Releases 
29 Sep 2014 

DALLAS–(BUSINESS WIRE)–NexPoint Credit Strategies Fund (NYSE: NHF) announced today a plan to separate its business into two separate and independent publicly traded companies:

NexPoint Credit Strategies Fund (“NHF”), which will continue to operate as a non-diversified, closed-end investment company; and
NexPoint Residential Trust, Inc. (“NXRT”), which will acquire, own, operate and selectively develop multifamily real property.

NHF plans to effect the separation through a spin-off in which it will distribute all of the outstanding shares of NXRT common stock to NHF’s shareholders on a pro rata basis. At the time of the spin-off, NXRT, which is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of NHF, will hold all or a majority interest in all of the multifamily properties that NHF holds interests in through its subsidiary Freedom REIT, LLC prior to the spin-off.
NXRT intends to qualify and elect to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with its first taxable year of operations as a separate public company. NXRT intends to file an application to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “NXRT.”
NXRT will be externally managed by NexPoint Real Estate Advisors, L.P., an affiliate of NexPoint Advisors, the advisor for NHF, and Highland Capital Management, L.P., a leading global alternative asset manager and an SEC-registered investment advisor which, together with its affiliates, has approximately $19 billion in assets under management as of June 30, 2014. NexPoint Real Estate Advisors, L.P. will conduct substantially all of NXRT’s operations and manage NXRT’s real estate investments. The members of the management team of NexPoint Real Estate Advisors, L.P. are expected to be James Dondero, Scott Ellington, Brian Mitts, Matt McGraner, and Matthew Goetz. The management team has significant experience across real estate investing, private lending, and private equity.
“We believe the spin-off of NXRT from NHF allows us to continue developing and optimizing our real estate portfolio as a standalone product,” said Brian Mitts, Chief Operating Officer of NexPoint Advisors.
NXRT has filed a registration statement on Form 10 relating to the spin-off with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The spin-off is subject to customary conditions, including effectiveness of the registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, execution of inter-company agreements and final approval by NHF’s board of trustees. NHF anticipates that the spin-off will be completed in the fourth quarter of 2014, but there can be no assurances regarding the final terms and structure of the spin-off or that it will be completed. In addition, NHF management affirmed that NHF does not intend to “stand still” or otherwise abate its acquisition program during the pendency of the transaction, and references to the property counts, capitalization or financial condition of either NHF or NXRT and similar statements may change as a result of acquisitions, expenditures or other changes made prior to the effective date of the spin-off.
“Our experienced and dedicated real estate team continues to see attractive investments in multifamily properties in Texas and the Southeastern United States. This spin-off offers a more flexible and efficient platform to invest in these opportunities,” said Matt McGraner, Managing Director of Real Estate at Highland Capital Management.
Ladenburg Thalmann Financial Services, Inc. will be serving as financial advisor to NHF in connection with the spin-off. Jones Day is serving as legal advisor to NXRT. Dechert LLP is serving as legal advisor to NHF.
About NexPoint Credit Strategies Fund
NexPoint Credit Strategies Fund is a closed-end fund managed by NexPoint Advisors, L.P. NHF’s investment objectives are to provide both current income and capital appreciation. NHF is invested primarily in below investment grade debt and equity securities and has the ability to hedge risk. The manager attempts to exceed the return of the Dow Jones Credit Suisse Hedge Fund Index in a transparent, registered fund format with monthly dividends. An investment in NHF is not appropriate for all investors. No assurance can be given that NHF will achieve its investment objectives.
Shares of closed-end investment companies frequently trade at a discount to net asset value. The price of NHF’s shares is determined by a number of factors, several of which are beyond the control of NHF. Therefore, NHF cannot predict whether its shares will trade at, below or above net asset value. Past performance does not guarantee future results. More information about NexPoint Credit Strategies Fund is available at www.nexpointadvisors.com.

Overview







Healthcare is the largest component of the American economy, accounting for more than 17.2 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product. It is also the fastest growing segment, forecast to increase above 20 percent of GDP in the next few years. (Source: Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2012)*
In the midst of this growth, the Affordable Care Act (“ACA” or as commonly referred to as “Obamacare”) is driving dynamic changes to the healthcare economy as it transforms patient access to care while modernizing and reengineering the current infrastructure of medical delivery.
We believe the changes precipitated by the implementation of the ACA will result in “winners” that are able to effectively adapt and thrive in the new environment, as well as “losers” that are unable to access the necessary capital and expertise to compete.
For investors, this historic period of change may offer significant opportunity to those able to identify the difference between those firms able to thrive and those that will struggle.
NexPoint Capital is a healthcare focused BDC (business development company) sponsored by NexPoint Advisors, an affiliate of Highland Capital Management, L.P. Highland Capital Management, L.P. and its affiliate advisors (together “Highland”) is an institutional investment firm with approximately $13.4 billion of assets under management with particular expertise in the healthcare sector.
We believe that with Highland’s specialized expertise, we will be able to successfully identify the “winners” and to provide NexPoint Capital investors with a unique opportunity to potentially benefit from the ongoing strength and historic change in the quickly evolving healthcare sector.**
 
*There is no assurance that the healthcare industry will experience growth in line with this forecast.
**Prior performance is no guarantee of future results.

NexPoint Credit Strategies Fund Announces Multifamily REIT Spin-Off






Business Wire




Sep 29, 2014 7:01 AM EDT













 




























































  NexPoint Credit Strategies Fund (NYSE: NHF) announced today a plan to separate its business into two separate and independent publicly traded companies:   NexPoint Credit Strategies Fund (“NHF”), which will continue to operate as a non-diversified, closed-end investment company; and   NexPoint Residential Trust, Inc. (“NXRT”), which will acquire, own, operate and selectively develop multifamily real property.    NHF plans to effect the separation through a spin-off in which it will distribute all of the outstanding shares of NXRT common stock to NHF’s shareholders on a pro rata basis. At the time of the spin-off, NXRT, which is currently a wholly owned subsidiary of NHF, will hold all or a majority interest in all of the multifamily properties that NHF holds interests in through its subsidiary Freedom REIT, LLC prior to the spin-off.  NXRT intends to qualify and elect to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, commencing with its first taxable year of operations as a separate public company. NXRT intends to file an application to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “NXRT.”  NXRT will be externally managed by NexPoint Real Estate Advisors, L.P., an affiliate of NexPoint Advisors, the advisor for NHF, and Highland Capital Management, L.P., a leading global alternative asset manager and an SEC-registered investment advisor which, together with its affiliates, has approximately $19 billion in assets under management as of June 30, 2014. NexPoint Real Estate Advisors, L.P. will conduct substantially all of NXRT’s operations and manage NXRT’s real estate investments. The members of the management team of NexPoint Real Estate Advisors, L.P. are expected to be James Dondero, Scott Ellington, Brian Mitts, Matt McGraner, and Matthew Goetz. The management team has significant experience across real estate investing, private lending, and private equity.  “We believe the spin-off of NXRT from NHF allows us to continue developing and optimizing our real estate portfolio as a standalone product,” said Brian Mitts, Chief Operating Officer of NexPoint Advisors.

                you can learn how it is that you too can renovate homes and either rent, sell, or hold them for added value. Your investor experience begins today.

"Funded.com has been great and my project is in the final stages of being funded by an investor I found on here. I was surprized at the quick process and how fast investors funded my project. Website was a big help!" 

Rick R 
Entreprenuer





Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again. 

Faith D

I am grateful I had the opportunity to access your network of investors. I am reasonably confident that the current negotiations with one of your investors will go through for our film production. I will be back for my next production.
