Laurent C. Lutz












Laurent C. Lutz is Executive Vice President, General Counsel, and Corporate Secretary of Sallie Mae.
In this role, he is responsible for providing legal advice and assistance to our business areas and board of directors with regard to all legal matters, including regulatory compliance, securities reporting and offerings, litigation management, and corporate governance. Laurent also has responsibility for coordinating our government relations and legal activities.
Laurent believes that while there may be several right answers to the legal issues our company and our customers may face, his job is to find the best answer — a process that involves consideration of many points of view, including those of our leadership, internal and external legal counsel, regulators, employees, and directors.
Laurent has experienced first-hand — initially from his father’s experience and then his own — the importance of financial assistance from unexpected sources in making higher education opportunities possible. Over the years, he has worked to combine altruism with educational opportunity, from funding high school and university scholarships, to endowing a family law fellowship for Tulane public-interest law graduates working to represent children and families, to distance running on behalf of scholarship funds for the children of veterans.





















Hard work is important, but many opportunities just don’t exist unless somebody provides them for you. I’d like to think that in some small way that’s what we do here at Sallie Mae.













Prior to joining Sallie Mae in 2011, Laurent was Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary of BearingPoint, Inc. As Associate General Counsel at Accenture PLC, he was instrumental in the design and implementation of the legal aspects of its transition to a public company. He has also served as Counsel to The Allstate Corporation and practiced law with Mayer Brown, Chapman and Cutler, and Snell & Wilmer.
Laurent earned his law degree from Tulane University School of Law and a bachelor’s degree in accounting from Louisiana State University. He has also been licensed as a Certified Public Accountant.
