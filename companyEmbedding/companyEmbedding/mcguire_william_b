Lyndhurst Residential Community, LLC, et al., App. Div. (per curiam) 2008. Pyramid Construction, who prevailed at the trial level with a ruling that Essex Ins. Co., its commercial general liability insurer, was obligated to defend and indemnify them as a prime contractor on a construction project, in connection with claims asserted against it in litigation for the wrongful death of a subcontractor's employee. The trial court agreed with Pyramid that the policy was, at best, ambiguous, and that it was entitled to coverage. In affirming, the panel pointed out the apparent facial conflict between the policy's declarations page, which indicates unrestricted coverage for subcontractors, and the exclusionary language upon which Essex relied. The language of the policy also created an ambiguity, and so the policy should be interpreted to conform to the reasonable expectations of the insured.FraudKimberly D.
