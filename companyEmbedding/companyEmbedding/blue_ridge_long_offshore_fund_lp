Background[edit]
The founder of Blue Ridge Capital, John Griffin, is believed to have been a "right-hand man" to the billionaire manager Robertson.[6] Blue Ridge Capital generally targets "absolute returns" by investing in and short-selling companies, with a focus on "going long" (i.e. buying the stock of companies rather than selling it short.) Blue Ridge's investment thesis is based on fundamental analysis, and focuses on companies that have competitive advantages in their industries, while shorting those thought to have "fundamental problems." The principal, Griffin, is highly compensated and after a 65% return on the fund in 2007 he reportedly made $625 million.[6] That was their best year, however: after surviving the financial crisis with a loss of only 8%, the fund has since underperformed the S&P 500.[7]
Investment process[edit]
Blue Ridge has a lengthy process for vetting both long and short investments. Generally, they are focused on individual companies rather than a sector; a "checklist methodology" is used to identify good performers in a given category. Industry outlook is also taken into account in the investment process. Key factors in the consideration of industry-relevant matters are the power of stakeholders, barriers to market entries, ingredients of success, and business development opportunities. Analysts at Blue Ridge also need to address the business model, the management, the financial structure, and the risks of the company they're considering; a detailed time line is also created, which attempts to pin down catalysts for a changed valuation in the share price.[7] A prospective investment must also be evaluated for the presence of questionable accounting practices.
Joint ventures[edit]
In 2008, Blue Ridge Capital's division in China started a joint venture with Equity International investing in Xinyuan Real Estate. In December 2007, Xinyuan Real Estate went public on the NYSE as an ADR ticker symbol XIN. It traded slightly above $15 per share but settled between $1–$3.[8]
Political activities[edit]
Blue Ridge donated $100,000 to Restore Our Future, the Super PAC supporting Mitt Romney's presidential candidacy.[9]

Background[edit]
The founder of Blue Ridge Capital, John Griffin, is believed to have been a "right-hand man" to the billionaire manager Robertson.[6] Blue Ridge Capital generally targets "absolute returns" by investing in and short-selling companies, with a focus on "going long" (i.e. buying the stock of companies rather than selling it short.) Blue Ridge's investment thesis is based on fundamental analysis, and focuses on companies that have competitive advantages in their industries, while shorting those thought to have "fundamental problems." The principal, Griffin, is highly compensated and after a 65% return on the fund in 2007 he reportedly made $625 million.[6] That was their best year, however: after surviving the financial crisis with a loss of only 8%, the fund has since underperformed the S&P 500.[7]
Investment process[edit]
Blue Ridge has a lengthy process for vetting both long and short investments. Generally, they are focused on individual companies rather than a sector; a "checklist methodology" is used to identify good performers in a given category. Industry outlook is also taken into account in the investment process. Key factors in the consideration of industry-relevant matters are the power of stakeholders, barriers to market entries, ingredients of success, and business development opportunities. Analysts at Blue Ridge also need to address the business model, the management, the financial structure, and the risks of the company they're considering; a detailed time line is also created, which attempts to pin down catalysts for a changed valuation in the share price.[7] A prospective investment must also be evaluated for the presence of questionable accounting practices.
Joint ventures[edit]
In 2008, Blue Ridge Capital's division in China started a joint venture with Equity International investing in Xinyuan Real Estate. In December 2007, Xinyuan Real Estate went public on the NYSE as an ADR ticker symbol XIN. It traded slightly above $15 per share but settled between $1–$3.[8]
Political activities[edit]
Blue Ridge donated $100,000 to Restore Our Future, the Super PAC supporting Mitt Romney's presidential candidacy.[9]

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer

Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year
