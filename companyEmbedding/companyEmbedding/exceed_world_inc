This report is not for commercial use. Thorough reviews have been conducted to assure this data accurately reflects disclosures. However for a complete and definitive understanding of the pay practices of any company, users should refer directly to the actual, complete proxy statement. 


Use of Data / Disclaimer
The information shown here is a reporting of information included in the company's proxy statement. The proxy statement includes footnotes and explanations of this information plus other information that is pertinent in assessing the overall value and appropriateness of the compensation information. For those interested in conducting a detailed compensation analysis, we recommend that you review the entire proxy statement. You may retrieve the full proxy statement by going to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website at www.sec.gov and entering the company's name and then looking in the first column for an entry of "Form DEF 14A" (or any similar code). You may also find the annual proxy statement by going directly to the company's website.


What is a proxy statement?
A proxy statement (or "proxy") is a form that every publicly traded U.S. company is required to file with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) within 120 days after the end of its fiscal year. The proxy must be sent to every shareholder in advance of the company's annual shareholders meeting. All proxy statements are public filings made available to the general public by the SEC.


The proxy statement's main purpose is to alert shareholders to the annual meeting and provide them information about the issues that will be voted on during the annual meeting, including decisions such as electing directors, ratifying the selection of auditors, and other shareholder-related decisions, including shareholder-initiated initiatives. Also, proxies must disclose specific detailed information regarding the pay practices for certain executives.

    may reduce your speeds. The thresholds are in place to help ensure optimum performance for all
    customers. See also ViaSat's Bandwidth Usage Policy.
Service may be temporarily unavailable in your area. Short-term beam outages are currently

Exede® FAQ
What is the Exede Data Allowance Policy?
All Exede Internet plans come with our fastest speeds available in your area. The only
              difference between the plans is the amount of data you can use every month, your data allowance. View
              the official policy document here.
How is my data usage measured?
Starting on the first day of your monthly billing period, all uploaded and downloaded data
              you use counts toward your data allowance, except from midnight to 5 a.m. (Exede Classic plans) or 3 a.m
              to 8 a.m. (Exede Evolution and Exede Business plan) or 3 to 6 a.m (Liberty 12, 25 and 50). That’s the Free
              Zone, when usage is unmetered and does not count toward your allowance. This is a great time to schedule
              larger downloads like movies, software updates and cloud backups.
How am I notified that my data usage is getting high?
You will receive a courtesy notification email when your usage reaches 70% of your data
              allowance in a monthly measurement period. We will send a second email alerting you when you’ve reached
              100% of your data allowance.
What happens if I go over my data allowance?
If your total data usage exceeds the data allowance, we may significantly slow and/or restrict
              your service until the end of your monthly measurement period. At the end of each monthly measurement period,
              your data usage meter resets to zero and you can use your full data allowance again. If your service has
              been slowed and/or restricted due to excessive use, it will be restored.
Do I get the Free Zone if I’m on the Freedom plan?
No, you don’t need it. If you have the Freedom Plan, you get virtually unlimited data without
              a strict data allowance during all hours of the day and night. That means you don’t need to wait
              until the wee hours to download movies, music and other big files. For more details, please see the
              Bandwidth Usage Policy associated with the Freedom plan.
How do I keep track of how much data I’m using?
We encourage you to monitor your usage. Customers who receive their Exede Internet bill
              directly from us and not through another provider such as DISH or a local telephone or electric company,
              may review their current data usage online:

Go to the customer portal, My.Exede.net *Note: MyExede is currently available to Exede Classic
                subscribers. Evolution and Freedom subscribers will be added in the near future. Evolution, Exede Business,
                Freedom and WildBlue subscribers will continue to access their account billing information as before.
Log in with your username and password.
You’ll see your usage prominently displayed on the dashboard once you’re logged in.
For additional information on monitoring your usage, please read our Help Center article about data usage.

Does the data usage measure operate in real time?
No, usage records are sent from the modem in 15-minute intervals. So even if you unplug your
              modem to check the meter, it will record usage and send those records once the modem is plugged back in,
              making it appear as if usage was incurred while the modem was unplugged.
What if I receive my service through another provider?
See the chart below to review the policy from the company that sends your monthly service bill.
              Please note that these policies may be called the “Fair Access Policy” rather than the “Data
              Allowance Policy.”
Does WildBlue have the same Data Allowance Policy as Exede?
No, the WildBlue service is measured using a different data allowance policy.
What are my Data Allowance Policy usage thresholds?
Please note:

Your download and upload data usage is combined.
If you are a WildBlue Recovery Act Program subscriber, your data allowance shall be as stated in the Recovery
                Act Addendum to your Customer Agreement.
Exede Evolution and Exede Freedom have a different kind of data plan; see below for more or call
                1-866-989-3105 for details.

How can I get a higher data allowance?

If you currently have the Evolution, 10 GB or 15 GB service plan, you may upgrade to a different service
                plan which provides a larger monthly data allowance. There may be some other options depending on where you
                live; contact Customer Care for more information.
If you occasionally need more data in a single month, our Buy More feature gives you the flexibility to
                purchase more data in 1 GB increments for $9.99 per GB. Call 1-866-989-3105 for details.

If I use my full data allowance, is my access restored at full speed during the Free Zone?
Yes, your speeds and access will return to normal during the Free Zone, even if you have no data
              allowance remaining during your billing cycle
What are my data allowances with Exede Evolution?
Exede Evolution gives you unlimited access to web pages and email, with some restrictions. It
              also has a 5GB data allowance for everything else, such as video, music streaming, downloads and more.
What are my data allowances with Exede Freedom?
There is no data allowance. Customers who use greater than 150 GBs of data during their monthly
              billing period may be contacted and given the option to reduce their usage or transition to another service
              plan per the Bandwidth Usage Policy. Service is for residential and non-commercial use only.
What type of usage may cause me to exceed my data allowance?
Some activities use more data than others. Here are a few examples.

Full-length movie downloads
Access by others if you have an unsecured wireless router
Heavy use of peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing programs
Continuous downloading or viewing streaming media content such as online video and radio
Extended use of web cameras
Extensive downloading of large applications or files
Extensive uploading of home movies, photos, and/or large email attachments
Extensive use of online backup services such as Carbonite, Mozy, SOS, iCloud and HP Upline.
Some kinds of gaming

For discussion about these situations, please visit our online community.
What kind of speeds does Exede offer?
We have two Exede services available, depending on your region.
              Exede12: a 12 Mbps downstream / 3 Mbps upstream service in the regions covered by our new ViaSat-1 satellite.
              That’s 8 out of 10 households in the U.S.
              Exede5: a 5 Mbps downstream / 1 Mbps upstream service for most of the rest of the nation.
I have no idea how much data I need. How do I choose an Exede plan?
We can help. Call 1-866-989-3105 and we will assist you with your data requirements.
Do I get the highest speed available no matter which plan I buy?
Yes. We believe that you should not have to pay extra in order to get the highest speed we offer.
How can you offer such fast speeds? Isn’t satellite internet supposed to be really slow?
Exede high speed internet is the culmination of a process that began in 2008 when ViaSat started
              construction on its next-generation satellite, ViaSat-1. The new technology delivers the most significant
              capacity leap in the history of satellite technology.
What about latency?
The reason older versions of satellite internet service were slow had more to do with the
              technology available at the time than latency. Our satellites are in orbit a bit more than 22,000 miles
              above the Earth, but the speed of light is approximately 186,282 miles per second. So while there is a
              tiny bit of latency, it’s not enough to make a big difference in most uses of the internet.
              Our new service incorporates groundbreaking web acceleration technology which dramatically speeds up page
              load times, minimizing the effect of latency. So in addition to the much higher speeds enabled by our
              high capacity satellite, you will experience a much faster, more responsive web browsing experience.
Can I use VoIP (internet phone) on the Exede service?
Yes. We recently launched Exede Voice, which is optimized specifically for our network
              and includes unlimited local and long-distance calling in the U.S. and Canada. See the
              Exede Voice page for details. Other VoIP services usually work fine with Exede,
              but you’ll likely see much better results with Exede Voice. Plus, calls don’t count toward
              your data allowance as they would with other VoIP services.
Can I use VPN (virtual private network) on the Exede service?
Virtual Private Networks (‘VPN’) and other remote computer access software such as those
              used to connect business servers to at-home workers may be very slow with Exede Internet. Some VPNs may
              not work at all.
What about gaming with Exede satellite internet service?
The performance of some games is very poor. Or some may not work at all. Read more on how
              latency impacts gaming.
What’s the installation process like?
A certified professional installer quickly and efficiently installs equipment and activates
              the Exede Internet service at your chosen location. The satellite mini-dish is about 30 inches wide by
              28 inches high and can be easily mounted on a roof, outside wall or in the ground. A cable from the dish
              connects to the modem which connects to your computer via an Ethernet connection.
Can I install my own dish?
No, installation requires an installation professional to make sure that the dish is pointed
              at the satellite accurately and to verify that all connections are made properly.
Will my Home Owners Association allow mounting the Exede dish?
The Exede dish comes under the FCC Over-the-Air Reception Devices Rule. This means it has
              the same classification as other residential dishes like satellite television and legally permissible
              for mounting on your home. As always, please check with your HOA for specific rules and covenants.
I’m a current WildBlue customer. Can I get the new Exede service?
Absolutely. As a valued current customer, we want you to experience the super-fast speeds
              of Exede Internet. The upgrade will require a brand new satellite dish and modem which will be installed
              and configured by a certified technician. We may be able to use the existing wiring and bracket for the
              satellite dish outside your home. The new service does require a new 24-month contract to get started,
              but there is usually no fee for upgrading. Please call us at 1-866-989-3105
              so we can fill you in on all the details.
What if I choose to stay with my current WildBlue service?
We remain dedicated to providing high quality service to customers who wish to continue
              their WildBlue service. In fact, since the launch of Exede Internet, we have implemented technology
              upgrades for WildBlue customers that have resulted in much faster speeds.
Who is ViaSat?
ViaSat is the company delivering both the existing WildBlue service and the new Exede
              service. ViaSat is an innovator and leader in the satellite industry, providing products and services
              for consumers, businesses, the U.S. military, and the U.S. government. For more information, please
              call 1-866-989-3105.
