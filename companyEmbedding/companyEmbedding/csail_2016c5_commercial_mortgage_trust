                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

      Certificates; Presale Issued
    





January 19, 2016 04:38 PM Eastern Standard Time



CHICAGO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on the CSAIL 2016-C5 
      Commercial Mortgage Trust pass-through certificates. Fitch expects to 
      rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as follows:
    

      --$28,557,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$121,570,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$46,821,000ab class X-D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;

      --$9,365,000a class F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$9,365,000ab class X-F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      (a) Privately placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      (b) Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Jan. 18, 2016. Fitch does not expect to rate the $39,797,933 class NR 
      and class X-NR certificates.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 59 loans secured by 241 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $936.4 
      million as of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by Column Financial, Inc., Rialto Mortgage Finance, LLC, The Bank of New 
      York Mellon, Silverpeak Real Estate Finance LLC, and Jeffries LoanCore 
      LLC.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral 
      including site inspections on 70.9% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 79.7%, and asset summary reviews on 79.7% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Additional Debt: There are five loans representing 21.8% of the pool 
      with subordinate debt. This is higher than the 2014 average of 10.4% and 
      the 2015 average of 9.1%, respectively for similar Fitch-rated 
      fixed-rate multiborrower transactions.
    

      Investment Grade Credit Opinion Loan: The largest loan in the pool, GLP 
      Portfolio Pool A (9.3%), received a credit opinion of 'Asf' on a 
      stand-alone basis. The loan is secured by 114 industrial properties 
      across nine states in 11 markets. The sponsor is Global Logistics 
      Properties, Ltd, which is currently rated 'BBB+' by Fitch.
    

      Fitch Leverage: The pool has a Fitch DSCR of 1.19x, which is above the 
      2015 average DSCR of 1.18x, and a Fitch LTV of 106.1%, which is below 
      the 2015 average LTV of 109.3%.
    

      Property Type Concentration: The pool's largest concentration by 
      property type is multifamily at 25.8%, followed by industrial properties 
      at 21.5%. Hotels make up 21.2% of the pool. The industrial concentration 
      is above the 2015 average of 4.2%. Additionally, the hotel concentration 
      is above the 2015 average of 17% for other Fitch-rated fixed-rate 
      multiborrower transactions.
    

      Pool Concentration: The pool has a higher loan concentration index 
      compared to other recent Fitch-rated fixed-rate multiborrower 
      transactions. The top 10 loans represent 53.3% of the pool, which is 
      higher than the 2015 average top 10 concentration of 49.3%. The pool's 
      LCI of 414 is higher than the 2015 average LCI of 367.
    

      Low Mortgage Coupons: The pool's weighted average mortgage coupon is 
      4.55%, well below historical averages, but higher than the 2015 average 
      of 4.45%. Fitch accounted for increased refinance risk in a higher 
      interest rate environment by analyzing sensitivity to increased interest 
      rates.
    

      Amortization: Five loans representing 27.5% of the pool are interest 
      only, which is higher than the 2015 average of 23.3% for other 
      Fitch-rated multiborrower transactions. There are 32 loans, representing 
      49.6% of the pool, that are partial interest-only. Based on the 
      scheduled balance at maturity, the pool is expected to pay down by 8.8%.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 12.1% below the 
      most recent year's net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a 
      full year NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing 
      during this period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level 
      NCF could result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted 
      loans and in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to CSAIL 2015-C5 
      certificates and found that the transaction displays average sensitivity 
      to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a 
      further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' 
      certificates to 'A-sf' could result. In a more severe scenario, in which 
      NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result. The presale report 
      includes a detailed explanation of additional stresses and sensitivities 
      on pages 10-11.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with due diligence information from KPMG LLP. The due 
      diligence focused on a comparison and re-computation of certain 
      characteristics with respect to each of the 59 mortgage loans. Fitch 
      considered this information in its analysis and the findings did not 
      have an impact on our analysis.

Take advantage of our competitive rates on loans and lines of credit with low closing costs, secured by commercial property valued up to $5 million.  No application fee and no appraisal fee Low 1% origination fee, maximum $5,000 due at closing Fixed-rate and Prime-based loans with a variety of terms  Feel confident that you are getting the most competitive offer. We’ll match or beat a competing offer (rate and fee combination) when a competitor’s formal written approval is provided to us — or pay you $200.


  Questions? Ready to apply? Call 1-877-322-4648, Monday – Friday, 6:00 am – 6:00 pm, Pacific Time.

Maximum $500,000 for cash-out. All financing is subject to credit approval.  Low closing costs and competitive rates are based upon analysis of application, appraisal and origination fees, and interest rates, for competing U.S. lenders as compiled by an independent third-party research firm on a quarterly basis, beginning April 2016.  You will need to pay a deposit of up to $1,000 when accepting the terms of any loan or line of credit. The deposit is nonrefundable, unless the loan closes; in that case, the unused portion of the deposit (if any) will be returned or credited after closing in the same form as your original deposit. If environmental insurance is required, you will be responsible for this one-time fee of $1,866. You will also be responsible for the cost of any mortgage or deed of trust filing fee imposed by a state or other taxing authority. In states that require attorney closings, you will be responsible for title-related costs and attorney title work that exceeds $375. For purchase loans, you will be responsible for title and escrow fees. In addition, for purchase loans you will need to provide proof of funds for any required down payment. All financing is subject to credit approval.  Prepayment or early closure fees may apply. Contact your banker for details.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
