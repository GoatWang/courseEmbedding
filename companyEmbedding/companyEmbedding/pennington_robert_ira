Benefits of a Traditional IRA










Tax advantages while you save.






All or part of your contributions may be tax-deductible, which may reduce your taxable income each year you make a contribution.
Your contributions will accumulate earnings and grow tax-deferred until you begin taking withdrawals, and they could be in a lower tax bracket.















No income limit.






There are no income restrictions on eligibility to contribute. But there could be a limit on tax deductions if you are also contributing to a 401(k).

You must begin taking required minimum distributions (RMDs) when you reach age 70½.

Why T. Rowe Price for a Traditional IRA?


















Low Fees and Minimums




 



You need to maximize your return potential, so we work to keep our fees competitive. That’s why our solutions include no-load mutual funds with low expense ratios. Keep in mind that an IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. Here’s more information on fees.
























Convenient and Flexible Fund Choices




 



You can choose from target date funds with strategic asset allocation and diversification, or select from more than 100 mutual funds to suit your investing needs.

Frequently Asked Questions









	            Are there IRA contribution limits?
            



Annual contribution limits for your combined IRAs are adjusted periodically by the IRS. You can contribute up to $5,500 ($6,500 if age 50 or older) in 2017.













	            Can I make automatic contributions to my IRA?
            



Our Automatic Asset Builder (AAB) service allows you to make recurring contributions of at least $100 directly into your mutual fund accounts.
Log in to add or update automatic transactions.













	            Can I contribute to an IRA for my spouse?
            



If you are married and file a joint tax return, you can contribute to an IRA for your spouse in addition to your own IRA.
Log in to get started.













	            What should I do if I've inherited an IRA or employer-sponsored retirement plan assets?
            



You can take ownership of assets inherited from an IRA or employer-sponsored retirement plan, such as a 401(k), can be rolled into your own IRA, provided you are a spouse beneficiary.
Non-spouse beneficiaries of an IRA or an employer-sponsored retirement plan, such as a 401(k), can roll over their inherited retirement account assets into an Inherited IRA.
Inherited IRAs must be established through a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer. If the beneficiary receives the distribution directly from the IRA or retirement plan, the money is not rollover eligible and may not be invested in an Inherited IRA.
This option extends to some beneficiaries the ability to spread distributions (and tax obligations) over the course of their lifetime, while keeping the balance invested in an IRA where it can potentially compound tax-deferred. For assistance, call 1-877-200-5503.

All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal.
*Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 5/31/17, 72 of 106 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

**This chart displays relative risk of each U.S. mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns. Those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart.
Methodology: We evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific risk/return category on an annual basis. A fund is generally placed in a risk/return category based on the 10-year standard deviation of its performance. If a fund is less than 10 years old, the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years. For an Asset Allocation fund with less than 10 years of performance history, sub-strategy returns are used. When a sub-strategy is less than 10 years old, the actual sub-strategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.
Risk return categories overlap; a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories, denoted by a plus (+), is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of T Rowe Price.
When a fund has a cash-like benchmark, denoted by a double plus (++), its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns. If the fund is less than 10 years old, benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full 10-year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate.
All investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal. Standard deviation of returns, a measure of price volatility, is one measure of risk. Please consult the funds’ prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the funds’ risks.

Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.


Investing involves risk, including risk of loss.


          1.
	
	
	       
        There is no opening cost or annual fee for Fidelity's traditional, Roth, SEP, and rollover IRAs. A $50 account closeout fee may apply. Fund investments held in your account may be subject to management, low-balance, and short-term trading fees, as described in the offering materials. For all securities, see Fidelity.com/commissions for trading commission and transaction fee details.


          2.
	
	
	       
        A distribution from a Roth IRA is tax free and penalty free, provided the five-year aging requirement has been satisfied and one of the following conditions is met: age 59½, disability, qualified first-time home purchase, or death.


          All customer ratings and reviews are provided to Fidelity on a voluntary basis and are screened in accordance with the guidelines set forth in our Customer Ratings and Reviews Terms of Use. For additional information on which ratings and reviews may be posted, please refer to our Customer Ratings and Reviews Terms of Use. Featured reviews have been selected based on subjective criteria and have been reviewed by Fidelity Investments. The average rating is determined by calculating the mathematical average of all ratings that are approved for posting per the Customer Ratings and Reviews Terms of Use, and does not include any ratings that did not meet the guidelines and were therefore not posted. Ratings and reviews are added continuously to the Web site (after a delay for screening against guidelines), and average ratings are updated dynamically as reviews are added or removed.


The ratings and experiences of customers may not be representative of the experiences of all customers or investors and are not indicative of future success. The accuracy of information included in the customer ratings and reviews cannot be guaranteed by Fidelity Investments. Customers who post ratings may be responsible for disclosing whether they have a financial interest or conflict in submitting a rating or review.

Benefits of a Traditional IRA










Tax advantages while you save.






All or part of your contributions may be tax-deductible, which may reduce your taxable income each year you make a contribution.
Your contributions will accumulate earnings and grow tax-deferred until you begin taking withdrawals, and they could be in a lower tax bracket.















No income limit.






There are no income restrictions on eligibility to contribute. But there could be a limit on tax deductions if you are also contributing to a 401(k).

You must begin taking required minimum distributions (RMDs) when you reach age 70½.

Why T. Rowe Price for a Traditional IRA?


















Low Fees and Minimums




 



You need to maximize your return potential, so we work to keep our fees competitive. That’s why our solutions include no-load mutual funds with low expense ratios. Keep in mind that an IRA may be subject to an annual fee, and a fee may be assessed when an IRA is closed. Here’s more information on fees.
























Convenient and Flexible Fund Choices




 



You can choose from target date funds with strategic asset allocation and diversification, or select from more than 100 mutual funds to suit your investing needs.

Frequently Asked Questions









	            Are there IRA contribution limits?
            



Annual contribution limits for your combined IRAs are adjusted periodically by the IRS. You can contribute up to $5,500 ($6,500 if age 50 or older) in 2017.













	            Can I make automatic contributions to my IRA?
            



Our Automatic Asset Builder (AAB) service allows you to make recurring contributions of at least $100 directly into your mutual fund accounts.
Log in to add or update automatic transactions.













	            Can I contribute to an IRA for my spouse?
            



If you are married and file a joint tax return, you can contribute to an IRA for your spouse in addition to your own IRA.
Log in to get started.













	            What should I do if I've inherited an IRA or employer-sponsored retirement plan assets?
            



You can take ownership of assets inherited from an IRA or employer-sponsored retirement plan, such as a 401(k), can be rolled into your own IRA, provided you are a spouse beneficiary.
Non-spouse beneficiaries of an IRA or an employer-sponsored retirement plan, such as a 401(k), can roll over their inherited retirement account assets into an Inherited IRA.
Inherited IRAs must be established through a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer. If the beneficiary receives the distribution directly from the IRA or retirement plan, the money is not rollover eligible and may not be invested in an Inherited IRA.
This option extends to some beneficiaries the ability to spread distributions (and tax obligations) over the course of their lifetime, while keeping the balance invested in an IRA where it can potentially compound tax-deferred. For assistance, call 1-877-200-5503.

Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.


Investing involves risk, including risk of loss.


          1.
	
	
	       
        There is no opening cost or annual fee for Fidelity's traditional, Roth, SEP, and rollover IRAs. A $50 account closeout fee may apply. Fund investments held in your account may be subject to management, low-balance, and short-term trading fees, as described in the offering materials. For all securities, see Fidelity.com/commissions for trading commission and transaction fee details.


          2.
	
	
	       
        A distribution from a Roth IRA is tax free and penalty free, provided the five-year aging requirement has been satisfied and one of the following conditions is met: age 59½, disability, qualified first-time home purchase, or death.


          All customer ratings and reviews are provided to Fidelity on a voluntary basis and are screened in accordance with the guidelines set forth in our Customer Ratings and Reviews Terms of Use. For additional information on which ratings and reviews may be posted, please refer to our Customer Ratings and Reviews Terms of Use. Featured reviews have been selected based on subjective criteria and have been reviewed by Fidelity Investments. The average rating is determined by calculating the mathematical average of all ratings that are approved for posting per the Customer Ratings and Reviews Terms of Use, and does not include any ratings that did not meet the guidelines and were therefore not posted. Ratings and reviews are added continuously to the Web site (after a delay for screening against guidelines), and average ratings are updated dynamically as reviews are added or removed.


The ratings and experiences of customers may not be representative of the experiences of all customers or investors and are not indicative of future success. The accuracy of information included in the customer ratings and reviews cannot be guaranteed by Fidelity Investments. Customers who post ratings may be responsible for disclosing whether they have a financial interest or conflict in submitting a rating or review.
