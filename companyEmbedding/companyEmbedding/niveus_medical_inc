Niveus Medical raising $3.6 million for its muscle atrophy-treating device
By Meghana Keshavan

Without stimulation and movement, a patient’s muscles can slowly waste away – a major concern among the immobile patient set.
Palo Alto medtech startup Niveus Medical has developed a device that uses electrodes to shock a muscle back to liveliness, and is raising $3.6 million to push that technology further along, according to regulatory filings. In 2011, it raised $2 million from a syndicate that included Band of Angels, Life Science Angels, Sand Hill Angels and others.
One critical component of shortening hospital visits – particularly in the ICU – is to increase mobility, but muscles can deteriorate rapidly when a patient is bedridden and in recovery. Niveus posits its technology can get patients out of the ICU faster, simply by keeping a patient’s muscles engaged even when sedentary
Its device has received marketing clearance from the FDA, Niveus said. The company asserts a case for its technology:

In the US, there are 6M annual admissions to the ICU. Niveus will initially target the 1.8 million patients who have an ICU stay longer than 5 days. At a conservative price point, these patients create a revenue opportunity exceeding $1.2B in the U.S. alone. Additional opportunities outside of the ICU are envisioned.
The muscle stimulation system has a number of indications: Maintaining or increasing range of motion of the knee joint, preventing or retarding disuse atrophy in the quadriceps, muscle re-education of the quadriceps, relaxation of muscle spasms and increasing local blood circulation.

Sep 10 16
NinePoint Medical, Inc. Presents at Redefining Early Stage Investments (RESI) Conference, Sep-13-2016 . Venue: The Westin Copley Place, 10 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02116, United States.


NinePoint Medical, Inc. Announces FDA 510(k) Clearance of a Real-Time Targeting Feature for the NvisionVLE Imaging System
May 10 16
NinePoint Medical, Inc. announced that it has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 510(k) clearance to market its Real-time Targeting feature for its product, the NvisionVLE Imaging System. In addition, the first procedures with this new system were performed at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts. The NvisionVLE Imaging System employs proprietary Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) technology allowing physicians to perform a Volumetric Laser Endomicroscopy (VLE) procedure that produces real-time, high-resolution cross-sectional images. This system enables gastroenterologists to evaluate tissue for potential disease that may not be visible with conventional medical imaging technologies such as endoscopy and ultrasound. The NvisionVLE Imaging System was launched in the U.S. in late 2013. To date, over 5,000 VLE procedures have been performed at hospitals in the U.S. The addition of this Real-time Targeting feature allows physicians to not only locate, but now to mark areas of interest. This marking feature, in combination with an improved workflow, enables more accurate targeting, potentially to improved diagnosis and more effective therapeutic treatment options for patients. The NvisionVLE Imaging System provides a unique and clinically valuable new perspective of esophageal disease: The ability to image within the wall of the esophagus. By providing a high-resolution, real-time scan of the esophagus using Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) a technology similar to ultrasound but using infrared light rather than sound waves - the system enables physicians to view structures not evident with conventional imaging, and potentially identify disease that would have otherwise been missed. With the recent addition of a Real-time Targeting feature, physicians can not only locate, but now mark areas of interest. This marking feature, in combination with an improved workflow, enables more accurate targeting, potentially leading to improved diagnosis and more effective therapeutic decisions for patients. The NvisionVLE Imaging System has been cleared by the FDA and is commercially available in the U.S.
