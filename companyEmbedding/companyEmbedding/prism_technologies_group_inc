				Disaster Recovery As A Service			


		Technology is vital in today's business environment. When companies lose IT capabilities, operations come to a halt. For most businesses, the impact can be crippling due to the loss of productivity and revenue. Approximately 25 percent of businesses that experience a major disaster don’t reopen, according to the Institute for Business and Home Safety.  In addition, Storage Magazine revealed more than 34 percent of businesses with backup methods didn’t test them, and of those that did, only 23 percent were successful restoring their network.   In short, a majority of companies do not backup, and those that do, fail to test their disaster recovery methods.  Planning is the key to disaster recovery. The way we see it, planning for the worst and testing recovery components is just as important as the IT system itself. Disaster recovery as a service means more than backing up your data. It means being able to recover rapidly from an outage situation and implementing ways to carry on with your business endeavors in spite of it. 
Business Continuity
We help organizations develop and implement the plans, policies, procedures and solutions needed to maintain business operations in the event of a loss. Our goal is to ensure that critical business functions are available at all times. 
Learn More: Managed Cloud   
Backup and Recovery
Having the right backup process in place can accelerate your recovery process.  We can make recommendations that are in line with your company's requirements now and in the future. Our intent is to, not only have the right systems in place, but to also make this a simple process for backing up and recovering data.
Learn More: Managed Replication   
Instant Failover
We can provide a virtual infrastructure, so if a failure occurs, the system is switched to another instantly. Hence, the impact to your daily operations will be minimal.
Bare Metal Restore
In the event of catastrophic failure, we can completely restore your computer’s hardware loss.  By utilizing backup images, we have the ability to recover the operating system, applications and data to new dissimilar hardware, which in turn, reduces recovery time.
De-duplication
De-duplication reduces the amount of data that needs to be transferred, backed up and stored.  This procedure utilizes storage space more efficiently and reduces time and costs using intelligent compression technologies.  
Archiving
Storing outdated and unused data is a process in itself, and we can help you establish that workflow with the proper tools.  Providing our clients with easy access to files in long-term retention in a separate data storage center is one of our specialties.  We’re mindful of compliance requirements, and we’re extremely thorough about the retention of this sensitive information.

				Telecom Services			


		Prism Technologies Group is unlike other IT companies, in that we take a broad look at the technologies your business utilizes, including the phone systems you have in place. Telecommunications should be included in your business needs assessment, and we provide ways to integrate your telecom network with the larger infrastructure.  
There is great value in having one or more of these telecom solutions:
Hosted Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)
VoIP is the latest telephone technology that has gained popularity because of its ability to transmit calls via the Internet.  The advantage of VoIP is it has unmatched scalability and flexibility – it forms to fit your business needs.  Also, there is no PBX equipment on the premises, and you don’t incur surcharges for the amount of calls you make; similar to not being charged for the number of emails you send. 
Internet Services
We also have the ability to establish Internet services for your company.  Having worked with numerous Internet Service Providers (ISPs), such as AT&T and Time Warner Cable, we can help you determine which program best suits your business needs. 
PBX
Most of our medium-sized business clients prefer a Private Branch Exchange (PBX) because of high call volume internally.  We can help you decide on the number of lines you need for incoming calls, and we will setup inner-office phone numbers using three or four digit extensions. 
Call Center
When the number of incoming calls increases by leaps and bounds, your business needs a call center.  Prism Technologies Group can establish a system to fit your requirements, to include unique features such as Automatic Call Distribution (ACD) and queuing. 
Video Conferencing
Many of our clients with representatives in other regions utilize video conferencing frequently.  We recommend the equipment best suited for your work environment, and we setup the system and demonstrate how it works.  
Unified Communications
Our innovative unified communications platform allows you to bring voice, video and other streaming media, such as desktop sharing and web conferencing together by utilizing any or all of your personal or company provided devices such as iPods, iPhones, iPads and laptops.
Digital Phone
Prism Technologies Group can establish a digital phone system for your business.  Due to the fact digital phone utilizes high speed Internet to process telephone calls, we can determine the best way to integrate your digital phone with your existing network.

This is where Prism excels. The difference is our perspective because we examine the entire system and its intended purpose, not just the dysfunctional parts.But this is only the beginning. 
The Prism Process

Next, we perform a thorough inventory of all equipment including network appliances, servers, desktops, laptops, printers, cabling, phones, storage and virtual presence. In addition, we review your third party service and maintenance agreements, licensing, warranties, software, network security and regulatory compliance.

This keen insight into our clients’ business allows Prism Technologies Group to determine long-term strategies and short-term plans for maximum performance of our clients’ IT systems. We won’t make a single recommendation without first having a firm understanding of the workflow and departmental needs of the environment. We want to do more than just fix the problem; we want to improve the way your IT performs.

Prism Technologies Group, Inc. Company Profile

   Somehow it seems appropriate to sell the least tangible of products -- insurance distribution -- via a virtual marketplace. InsWeb maintains a portfolio of online insurance distribution patents which it licenses out to others. Previously it operated online portals that allowed consumers to shop for quotes on various property/casualty and life insurance products. The company maintained alliances with about 50 insurance companies and their affiliated agency networks, which paid transaction fees to InsWeb for providing qualified customer leads. Consumers obtained quotes through the company's websites at no charge. InsWeb sold its insurance lead generation assets to Bankrate for $65 million in 2011.
