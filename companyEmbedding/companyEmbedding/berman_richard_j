Rich Berman, a registered US patent attorney and partner of the firm, practices in the areas of patent litigation, transactions, and prosecution in the chemical, pharmaceutical, and biotechnology fields. Rich chairs the Prescription Drugs Group, an interdisciplinary team of attorneys focused on the patent, regulatory, health care, and corporate issues unique to the pharmaceutical industry.

For Patent AttorneysPatent-Pilot helps patent attorneys and patent law firms to analyze clients and competitors. Which foreign law firms are potential partner for cooperation on your filings? Which other law firms are serving your clients? Who is the law firm representing the opposing party in your case?For Patent Attorneys




For CompaniesPatent-Pilot helps companies to benchmark the patent attorneys and patent law firms representing their company and identify new partners. Are you working with law firms you are experts in your field of expertise? Are you aware of potential conflicts of interest with other clients of your representative?For Companies




How Patent-Pilot WorksPatent-Pilot analyzes more than 2.3 million patent applications. Based on those documents, we create profiles of patent attorneys and patent law firms and developed an algorithm which allocates patent attorneys to their most recent law firm and generates the statistics and visualizations.How It Works


Register or loginRegister nowIn case you want to gain full access to all information, you have to register for free or login.
Register or login


Identify Patent Attorneys and Patent Law Firms
You can search through more than 2.3 million patent documents for intellectual property firms from more than 67 countries.
Searching for names includes patent attorneys, patent law firms and patent applicants.
Or you can search using a technical keyword. In this case, you will receive a result list containing all patent attorneys who have represented applications regarding those keywords.
Patent-Pilot is based on all PCT patent applications which were filed before the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO). In our database you can find all patent attorneys and patent law firms who represented at least 5 PCT applications.




 




Analyze Patent Attorneys in Law Firms
Patent-Pilot allocates all patent attorneys to their most recent law firm.
Not only patent law firms can be analyzed. You can also see inside of law firms and on the level of patent attorneys who is responsible for certain technical fields and most experienced.
This is crucial if you want to know who the real experts are. Moreover, we make sure that the experience displayed is connetcted to the patent attorneys who actually work for a law firm. If an attorney leaves, she takes expertise and experience with her.

 

Check technical experience
The technical experience of your attorneys or your cooperating patent law firms is often very important in patent filing and prosecution for achieving comprehensive property rights that also stand in opposition or infringement cases.
Patent-Pilot delivers charts that illustrate the technical areas in an understandable categorization. This is much more practicable than the traditional IPC classification. It’s based on those classes but arrange them in a different way.
You can limit the charts to certain areas or display only applications tht were represented for a certain client.
Thereby, you can gain a fast and objective overview of technical experience of these patent law firms









Analyze client relationships of patent law firms
Patent-Pilot can show you which clients patent attorneys are working
This makes the relationship between clients and law firms transparent. Who are the most important clients of a law firm? Are the winning or loosing mandates? Which companies that are not on the client list might be interesting prospects and who are the representatives of those companies?
Very important is also the question of conflicts of interests and mandate collisions.

Dorman Products Inc., the Colmar-based maker of automotive replacement parts, said its CEO is "receiving treatment for an illness."



Richard N. Berman, who co-founded the company originally known as R&B Inc. in 1978, told employees today that he would continue to serve as CEO.
Shares of Dorman closed down $1.14, or 9 percent, to $11.13 on Friday.



 


The company said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that Berman "may not be able to provide full time service" to Dorman. The nature of the illness was not disclosed.
The company goes on to say that if he can't, "his duties will be performed by other members of senior management."
Berman's brother, Stephen, is president and a co-founder of Dorman.


According to the company's proxy statement from earlier this year, Richard Berman was 51 years old as of March 28.
As of the end of 2007, the company had 1,005 employees worldwide. It had net income of $19.2 million, or $1.06 per share, on net sales of $327.7 million for 2007.

Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Minnesota:













Does Berman, Richard J carry a valid contracting license?



Licenses are required for all residential building contractors and residential remodelers who contract with a homeowner to construct or improve dwellings by offering more than one special skill. Owners working on their own property must also be licensed if they build or remodel for the sole purpose of speculation or resale.











How important is contractor licensing in Minnesota?



Contractors acting as sole proprietors, or qualifying persons for a construction related business entity, must pass a two part exam. The first section tests building code compliance knowledge. Section two tests a candidate's understanding of Minnesota business and law.











Your liability risk when hiring Berman, Richard J



Licensed contractors in Minnesota must carry both active workers' compensation and general liability insurance policies. Request a copy of the insurance certificate for each before any work begins. 











Financial recourse when hiring Berman, Richard J



The purpose of the Minnesota Contractor Recovery Fund is to compensate consumers who have suffered losses due to a licensed contractor's fraudulent, deceptive, or dishonest practices, conversion of funds, or failure to perform. All licensed contractors are required to pay a fee to the fund. The total amount that can be paid out against any one licensed contractor is $75,000. If multiple claims are filed against the same contractor, they are prorated. In these situations, you may not be able to recover your entire loss. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Minnesota, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.
