Products Liability Attorney
New Jersey Product Liability Lawyer
Products Liability
When manufacturers, suppliers, and retailers make or sell products that cause injuries when used in the way they were meant to be used, applicable state and federal laws may hold them responsible for those injuries. Injuries caused by defective products can result in pain and suffering, disabilities, and loss of income. The cost of an injury, the medical bills, the loss of health and time, can bring serious misfortune to an individual or family.

Caused by negligence of another person, company, or entity

Unsafe Products
Injuries can arise from manufacturing defects, design defects, or a failure of the maker to warn about dangers. In New Jersey and New York in recent years, a wide range of unsafe products, from cars, SUVs, ATVs, tires, and motorcycles to guns, heart implants, and children’s toys, to name just a few, have caused serious injuries and death. The experienced products liability attorneys of the Law Offices of G. Martin Meyers will fight to vindicate your rights and maximize the value of those rights to the greatest possible extent. This page provides a partial listing of cases that may involve products liability claims. Whether or not your specific problem is listed here, please call the office for a free, no-obligation assessment of your case. You can reach us at (973) 625-0838.

Mass Torts
Too often, products that can seriously injure the people who use them reach the market. Hundreds or even thousands may be injured in a similar fashion. Many suffer serious injuries before a harmful drug or defective machine is appropriately restricted or taken off the market. The stakes are high for the manufacturers, who can stand to lose millions if their products are recalled or removed from the marketplace. The attorneys at the Law Offices of G. Martin Meyers are prepared to fight against the powerful pharmaceutical companies and global corporations when they put their own interests ahead of your health and safety.
Many Injuries Traced to Same Cause
When large numbers of people are injured in similar ways by a single product, a hazardous substance, or a disaster, the injured can join together in a Mass Tort lawsuit. While their injuries can vary in severity (and in some cases the unsafe product has caused the user’s death), the injuries and fatalities can all be connected and traced back to a common cause.
A Range of Mass Tort Successes
In these cases, the Law Offices of G. Martin Meyers often works with attorneys throughout the country to take swift and aggressive action. Mr. Meyers’ goal is always to achieve the best outcome for each individual plaintiff. In many cases, Mr. Meyers’ lifelong interest in science and engineering enhances his ability to explain to a judge or jury what happened and exactly how you or your loved one was harmed. Mr. Meyers has succeeded in helping hundreds of plaintiffs in a range of mass torts to recover the compensation they deserve.
Negligence, Fraud, and Failure to Warn
Mass tort cases can arise from a manufacturer’s negligence in making a product or failing to warn users of a product’s potential dangers or a drug’s side effects. Mass tort lawsuits may involve toxic torts (such as exposure to lead paint, asbestos, or toxic waste); unsafe or defective products (breast implants, harmful drugs, flammable fabrics, or car seat failure); or various types of securities litigation, aviation, or employment cases.
Dangerous Drugs: Fosamax Linked to Femur Fractures
Fosamax and similar drugs are widely prescribed to women for the treatment of osteoporosis, a disease in which the bones become increasingly weak and porous. Fosamax and its generic equivalent, Alendronate, are prescribed to strengthen the bones but have been linked to spontaneous fractures of the femur. In addition to broken femurs, irregular heartbeat and a serious bone disease of the jaw have been linked to Fosamax in a recent study. If you have taken Fosamax, Actonel, Boniva, Reclast, or Zometa for an extended period of time and are experiencing pain or have suffered a fractured femur, contact G. Martin Meyers to discuss your options.
Dangerous Drugs: Accutane Linked to Birth Defects
In 2009, Hoffmann-La Roche stopped making Accutane, a drug that was widely prescribed for severe acne and taken by 13 million patients since 1982. Generic versions of Accutane (isotretinoin, sold as Sotret, Claravis, and Amnesteen) are still available from several manufacturers. However, the drug can have serious side effects, and has been the subject of numerous warnings by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and consumer advocacy groups. In pregnant women, Accutane has been linked to birth defects. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), severe pancreatitis, depression, aggressive behaviors, and even suicide are among other potential side effects. If you or someone you love has taken Accutane or isotretinoin and suffered any of these side effects, tell G. Martin Meyers what happened. You may be entitled to compensation for your pain and suffering.
Dangerous Drugs: Yaz, Yasmin Linked to Stroke and Clots
Bayer HealthCare makes Yaz and Yasmin, America’s top-selling oral contraceptives. In the past, major advertising campaigns promoted Yaz and Yasmin to young women as also treating acne as well as the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMMD), which can include severe depression. Recently, however, researchers and health advocates have voiced concerns that Yaz and Yasmin put women at higher risk of strokes and blood clots in the legs and lungs than other oral contraceptives. The F.D.A. sent a warning letter to Bayer, noting that its drugs were not approved for treatment of premenstrual syndrome, and forced it to stop making the claims that had sent its sales through the roof. In late 2009, the F.D.A. warned Bayer again about deviations from quality control standards at the plant where Yaz is made. If you or a loved one have taken Yaz or Yasmin and have experienced blood clots or stroke, contact G. Martin Meyers to protect your legal rights.

The Law Offices of G. Martin Meyers
New Jersey Wrongful Death – Products Liability – Medical Malpractice
The Law Offices of G. Martin Meyers is a New Jersey-based litigation boutique that has repeatedly proven its ability to deliver “large firm” results in a small-firm atmosphere. Mr. Meyers and his legal team are able to deliver these results without compromising the personal attention and personal touch so vital to success in trial.
Trial Lawyers with a Record of Results
Known for a long history of successes in complex cases, the Meyers firm concentrates its practice in the areas of Wrongful Death, Products Liability, Medical Malpractice, Car Accidents, Investment/Securities Fraud, Class Actions, Employment Law and Estate Planning. With a list of multi-million dollar settlements and verdicts to its credit, the Meyers firm has a strong record of results. Among them:

A $9.9 million verdict in a product liability action against Harley Davidson for a motorcycle design defect
A $9.5 million settlement for 800 investors against the Ridgewood Energy Corp.
A $2.1 million settlement for 25 investors, victims of a financial planner who stole from their retirement funds over a five-year period
A $1.15 million verdict for a medical equipment saleswoman, a victim of job discrimination after she became pregnant
A 2.7 million jury verdict for breach of contract against a medical equipment manufacturer, for research work performed on the company’s behalf by a prominent physician.
Mr. Meyers won an arbitration award in the amount of $99,355, in January of 2011, in the case of Giller v. Oracle USA., Inc.,

A Strong Legal Team on Your Side
G. Martin Meyers, the firm’s founder, is a Certified Civil Trial Attorney with more than 25 years of experience in all forms of civil litigation and trial practice. Mr. Meyers is one of a very small percentage of lawyers who are certified as Civil Trial Attorneys by the Supreme Court of New Jersey. He also is one of a very small percentage of lawyers who has won verdicts and appeals in both state and federal courts in New Jersey, including products liability verdicts in both state and federal court. Justin A. Meyers, of counsel to the firm, is admitted to practice in both New York, New Jersey, and Washington, D.C.  He is among the small percentage of attorneys with a Masters in Business Administration (“M.B.A.”), and a reported Appellate Division decision in Murnane v. Finch Landscaping, LLC, 420 N.J. Super. 331, cert. denied, 208 N.J. 600 (2011).  Thomas A. Whelihan, also of counsel to the firm, is a tax attorney who specializes in estate planning and corporate transactions.  Susan S. Singer, also of counsel to the firm, is a trial lawyer with extensive experience and prominence in the field of employment discrimination and civil rights. Her reputation is enhanced by the fact that she is one of the few attorneys in the nation who has prevailed in appeals before the Third Circuit Court of Appeals for both Plaintiffs and Defendants in employment cases.
Successful Negotiators
This legal team’s trial experience and track records are valuable assets in settlement negotiations. Since the majority of all cases are settled out of court, choosing a law firm that is experienced in delivering highly favorable settlements and jury verdicts provides you with the best opportunity to maximize the value of your legal rights.
The Driving Force
G. Martin (Gary) Meyers holds a B.S.E. from the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce and a J.D. from New York University School of Law. He takes pride in giving personal attention to every client. Asked what gets him up every morning, his response is quick: “The opportunity to right wrongs, and to fight against widespread fraud and abuse.”
Free Consultation
Based in Denville, New Jersey (Morris County), the firm accepts cases from throughout the United States. If you believe that you may have a case in the area of Wrongful Death, Products Liability, Medical Malpractice, Car Accidents, Investment/Securities Fraud, Class Actions, Employment Law and Estate Planning, call the Law Offices of G. Martin Meyers at (973) 625-0838.

Description


Product Details




                    The solitude and quiet peace of a flickering candle has long been a symbol of remembrance.
The Memorial Candle Program has been designed to help offset the costs associated with hosting this Tribute 
Website in perpetuity. Through the lighting of a memorial candle, your thoughtful gesture will be recorded
 and the proceeds will go directly towards helping ensure that the 
family and friends of Gary A. Myers can continue to memorialize, re-visit, interact with each 
other and enhance this tribute for future generations.

                



Candle will be lit for the limited time of one month


Candle will be lit for the limited time of one year


Candle will be lit indefinitely

Candle message preserved on the memorial site for perpetuity
