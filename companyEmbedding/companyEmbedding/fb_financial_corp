IPO Preview: FB Financial Corp. - FB Financial (NYSE:FBK) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»IPO Preview: FB Financial Corp.Sep.13.16 | About: FB Financial (FBK) Don Dion Long/short equity, special situations, momentum, event-drivenMarketplaceIPO InsightsSummaryFBK filed its S-1/A with the SEC announcing its IPO, scheduled for Sept. 16, 2016.The bank is the third largest in Tennessee with 45 branches and $2.9 billion in assets; it has shown very steady growth.Investors might keep in mind that FBK's loan portfolio is made up of 75 percent of real estate loans; an additional risk is that of high geographic concentration.We look forward to this IPO and suggest investors consider a modest allocation.Recent Financial IPOs have performed well.FB Financial Corp. (NYSE:FBK) filed its S-1/A with the Securities and Exchange Commission, announcing that it plans to raise $121,764,672 in its upcoming initial public offering on Sept. 16. We previewed this deal on our IPO Insights platform with a solid rating. The company plans to offer 5,882,352 shares of its common stock at a price range of $16 to $18 per share. Of the offered amount, 882,352 shares are offered as an overallotment option. The lead underwriters for the offering include J.P. Morgan, UBS Investment Bank and Keefe, Bruyette & Woods and the co-managers for the offering are Raymond James, Sandler O'Neill + Partners, L.P. and Stephens Inc. Business Summary and Assets Under Management Headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee, FB Financial Corp. wholly owns its subsidiary bank, FirstBank, which is the third largest bank in the state. It has 45 full-service bank branches located in Tennessee and certain markets in Alabama and Georgia. The bank reports it had $2.9 billion in assets as of June 30, 2016; along with $2.5 billion in deposits and $2.1 billion in loans. It is expected that FB Financial Corp. will price during the week of Sept. 12, 2016. Executive Management Team Christopher T. Holmes is the CEO and president of FirstBank and the chief banking officer of FirstBank Corporation. He joined FirstBank in 2010. He has served as the CEO since Feb. 2013 and as the president since May 1, 2012. Prior to coming to work for FirstBank, Holmes served as the senior executive vice president and chief retail banking officer for The South Financial Group Inc. from 2008 to 2010. His banking experience dates to 1994 working in a variety of increasingly responsible roles for various banks and financial corporations.
 James W. Ayers is the founder of First Financial Investors and serves as the chairman and executive chairman of FirstBank and FB Financial Corp. He is also the director of Premium Surgery LLC. He is the sole shareholder of FirstBank. A Range of Competitors FB Financial Corp. states that it has many competitors, including other banks, credit unions, online mortgage lenders, mortgage banking firms and numerous others. The company states that the banking industry is very competitive, and it notes that an increasing number of banks have entered the Tennessee market in the main metropolitan areas where FirstBank also operates. Additional Financial Highlights and Risks For the first six months of 2016, FB Financial Corp. indicates it had $30.4 million in net income. For the year ending on Dec. 31, 2015, the company reports that it had $47.86 million in net income. FB Financial has a market cap of $393.1 million. A risk that FB Financial Corp. notes is that it is primarily centered in Tennessee, making its revenue sources geographically concentrated. The company's biggest market is Nashville, and it notes that adverse economic conditions in Nashville's metropolitan area or statewide could have an adverse impact on the bank's profitability. The bank also notes that its loan portfolio is made up of 75 percent of real estate loans. If there is a downturn in the real estate market, the bank could suffer harm if mortgagees are unable to repay their loans. Regulators have warned about banks concentrating too high percentages of their loan portfolios to real estate loans, especially involving commercial real estate. Conclusion: Consider A Modest Allocation FB Financial Corp. and its subsidiary bank, FirstBank, has a strong regional presence in Tennessee. It has consistently generated profits and has grown substantially since it was first founded in 1984 by James Ayers from one bank to 45 branches. The bank's loan portfolio percentage of 75 percent devoted to real estate loans is concerning.
 Recent regional bank IPOs have gone well including First Hawaiian Bank (NASDAQ:FHB), which we previously previewed. We suggest investors consider a modest allocation.
Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in FBK over the next 72 hours.

FB Financial Corporation Launches IPO Roadshow | Business Wire
























































FB Financial Corporation Launches IPO Roadshow




Parent Company of FirstBank






September 06, 2016 07:57 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NASHVILLE, Tenn.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--FB Financial Corporation (“FB Financial” or “The Company”), a holding 
      company that operates through its wholly owned banking subsidiary, 
      FirstBank, announced today that it has launched a roadshow for its 
      proposed initial public offering.
    

      In the initial public offering, FB Financial is selling 5,882,352 shares 
      of its common stock, and the initial public offering price is currently 
      expected to be between $16 and $18 per share. FB Financial has applied 
      to list its common stock on the NYSE under the ticker symbol “FBK.” The 
      Company previously announced on Aug. 19, 2016, that it had filed a 
      registration statement on Form S-1 with the Securities and Exchange 
      Commission relating to the proposed IPO.
    

      J.P. Morgan, UBS Investment Bank, and Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc., are 
      acting as the joint book-running managers in the proposed offering, and 
      Raymond James, Sandler O’Neill + Partners, L.P., and Stephens Inc. are 
      acting as co-managers. The offering will be made only by means of a 
      prospectus. A copy of the preliminary prospectus related to the offering 
      may be obtained, when available, from J.P. Morgan, c/o Broadridge 
      Financial Solutions, 1155 Long Island Avenue, Edgewood, NY 11717, or by 
      telephone at (866) 803-9204; from UBS Investment Bank, 1285 Avenue of 
      the Americas, New York, NY 10019, attention: Prospectus Department, or 
      by calling (888) 827-7275; or from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc., A 
      Stifel Company, 787 Seventh Avenue, Fourth Floor, New York, NY 10019, 
      attention: Equity Capital Markets, or by calling (800) 966-1559.
    

      A registration statement relating to these securities has been filed 
      with the Securities and Exchange Commission but has not yet become 
      effective. These securities may not be sold, nor may offers to buy be 
      accepted prior to the time the registration statement becomes effective. 
      This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or the 
      solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there be any sale of these 
      securities in any state or jurisdiction in which such offer, 
      solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or 
      qualification under the securities laws of any such state or 
      jurisdiction.
    

About FB Financial Corporation


      FB Financial Corporation is a bank holding company headquartered in 
      Nashville, Tennessee. FB Financial operates through its wholly owned 
      banking subsidiary, FirstBank, the third largest Tennessee-headquartered 
      bank, with 45 full-service bank branches across Tennessee, North Alabama 
      and North Georgia, and a national mortgage business with offices across 
      the Southeast. FirstBank serves five of the largest metropolitan markets 
      in Tennessee and has $2.9 billion in total assets.
    

Forward-Looking Statements


      This press release contains “forward-looking statements.” You can 
      identify forward-looking statements because they contain words such as 
      “believes,” “expects” and “intends.” Forward-looking statements are 
      based on FB Financial’s current expectations and assumptions. Because 
      forward-looking statements relate to the future, they are subject to 
      inherent uncertainties, risks and changes in circumstances that may 
      differ materially from those contemplated by the forward-looking 
      statements, which are neither statements of historical fact nor 
      guarantees or assurances of future performance. Important factors that 
      could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the 
      forward-looking statements are set forth in the Company’s filings with 
      the SEC, including its registration statement on Form S-1, as amended 
      from time to time, under the caption “Risk factors.”

We estimate that the net proceeds to us from this offering, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses, will
be approximately $100.0 million, or approximately $115.6 million if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, based on the initial
public offering price of $19.00.

We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering (i) to fund a cash
distribution to our sole shareholder immediately after the closing of this
offering in the amount of $55 million, which is intended to be non-taxable to
our sole shareholder and represents a significant portion of our S Corporation
earnings that have been taxed to our sole shareholder, but not distributed to
him, and (ii) subject to regulatory approval, to repay all $10.1 million
aggregate principal amount of subordinated notes held by our sole shareholder,
plus any accrued and unpaid interest thereon. We intend to use the remainder of
the net proceeds to us from this offering, which we estimate to be approximately
$34.9 million, to support our growth, including to fund our organic growth and
implement our strategic initiatives, which may include the potential expansion
of our business through opportunistic acquisitions of depository institutions
and other complementary businesses, and selective acquisitions of assets,
deposits and branches that we believe present attractive risk—adjusted returns
or provide a strategic benefit to our growth strategy, for working capital and
for other general corporate purposes, and to strengthen our regulatory capital.

Our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds
from this offering to us, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our
management regarding the application of the proceeds. Pending their use, we plan
to invest our net proceeds from this offering in short term, interest bearing
obligations, investment grade instruments, certificates of deposit, or direct or
guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government.

The subordinated notes held by our sole shareholder consist of three series of
subordinated notes with aggregate principal amounts outstanding of $775
thousand, $3.3 million and $6.0 million, respectively. These series of notes
accrue interest (i) at an annual rate equal to the prime rate less 100 basis
points, in the case of the $775 thousand principal amount of notes, (ii) at a
quarterly rate equal to the 30 day LIBOR rate plus 200 basis points, in the case
of the $3.3 million principal amount of notes, and (iii) at a quarterly rate
equal to the 90 day LIBOR rate plus 170 basis points, in the case of the $6.0
million principal amount of notes. The maturity date of each series of
subordinated notes is December 31, 2021.


We conduct our core banking operations primarily in Tennessee and compete in the
commercial banking industry solely through our wholly-owned banking subsidiary,
FirstBank. The banking industry is highly competitive, and we experience
competition in our market areas from many other financial institutions. We
compete with commercial banks, credit unions, savings institutions, mortgage
banking firms, online mortgage lenders, consumer finance companies, securities
brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market funds and other mutual funds,
as well as super-regional, national and international financial institutions
that operate offices in our market areas and elsewhere. In addition, a number of
out-of-state financial intermediaries have opened production offices, or
otherwise solicit deposits, in our market areas. Increased competition in our
markets may result in reduced loans and deposits, as well as reduced net
interest margin and profitability. Furthermore, the Tennessee market has grown
increasingly competitive in recent years with a number of banks entering this
market, with a primary focus on the state’s metropolitan markets. We believe
this trend will continue as banks look to gain a foothold in this growing
market. This trend will result in greater competition primarily in our
metropolitan markets. However, we firmly believe that our market position and
client-focused operating model enhances our ability to attract and retain
clients.


Company Description
We are a bank holding company, headquartered in Nashville, Tennessee. Our
wholly-owned bank subsidiary, FirstBank, is the third largest
Tennessee-headquartered bank, based on total assets. FirstBank provides a
comprehensive suite of commercial and consumer banking services to clients in
select


 markets in Tennessee, North Alabama and North Georgia. Our footprint
includes 45 full-service bank branches serving the Tennessee metropolitan
markets of Nashville, Chattanooga, Knoxville, Memphis, Jackson, and Huntsville
(AL) in addition to 12 community markets. FirstBank also provides mortgage
banking services utilizing its bank branch network and mortgage banking offices
strategically located throughout the southeastern United States in addition to a
national internet delivery channel. As of June 30, 2016, we had total assets of
$2.9 billion, total loans of $2.1 billion, deposits of $2.5 billion, and
shareholder’s equity of $266 million.

Throughout our history, we have steadfastly maintained a community banking
approach of personalized relationship-based service. As we have grown,
maintaining this relationship-based approach utilizing local, talented and
experienced bankers in each market has been an integral component of our
success. Our bankers leverage their local knowledge and relationships to deliver
timely solutions to our clients. We empower these bankers by giving them local
decision making authority complemented by appropriate risk oversight. In our
experience, business owners and operators prefer to deal with decision makers
and our banking model is built to place the decision maker as close to the
client as possible. We have designed our operations, technology, and centralized
risk oversight processes to specifically support our operating model. We deploy
this operating model universally in each of our markets, regardless of size. We
believe we have a competitive advantage in our markets versus both smaller
community banks, larger regional and national banks. Our robust offering of
products, services and capabilities differentiates us from community banks and
our significant local market knowledge, client service level and the speed with
which we are able to make decisions and deliver our services to customers
differentiate us from larger regional and national banks.

We seek to leverage our operating model by focusing on profitable growth
opportunities across our footprint, consisting of both high-growth metropolitan
markets and stable community markets. As a result, we are able to strategically
deploy our capital across our markets to take advantage of the opportunities
with the greatest certainty of profitable growth and the highest returns.
