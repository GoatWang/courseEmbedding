About UsWorking With Us
Investments In Israel
 

The O in Opus is for operations. Opus has been instrumental from the start in helping to shape Payfone from an idea to a company.
– Rodger Desai CEO Payfone




Working With Us




Our Purpose
We founded Opus Capital for the sole purpose of assisting entrepreneurs to build market leading enterprises. Great entrepreneurs represent the cornerstone of successful companies, so getting to know you at the earliest stages of your company formation is important to us.
Below is an outline of what you can expect during our investment decision-making process.
Getting Started
First, submit an executive summary or presentation to one of our investment professionals. A warm introduction from someone who knows both you and us helps accelerate the process – but is not required.
It is best to direct your information to the partner who appears to be most closely aligned with your sector. We will review your business idea, and reply to you if there is interest in learning more about your company.
If there is interest, we will respond and request an initial in-person meeting (or phone if you are geographically remote), which will not exceed one hour. A presentation length of 15 to 20 slides is usually adequate. During this time we want to learn about:

The leadership      of the company
Your product (a      demonstration is encouraged if applicable)
Your target      customer
The problem you      solve for your customer
How you plan to      reach your customers
Competition
Market      opportunity
Business model      and high level financial forecasts
Your capital      requirements

Next Steps
After the first meeting, we will determine if it makes sense to continue on diligence. If there is a continued interest on our part, we will introduce you to a second partner who will complete the deal team.  Both partners need to be supportive to move forward with diligence.  We will likely have several additional meetings with your team to review the topics below in more detail:

Team dynamics      and additional needs on the management team
Analysis of the      customer need and product fit
Technology      review
Marketing plan
Financial      projections
Terms of      financing

Upon completion of the diligence process, we will talk with you about our interest in moving forward with an investment proposal.

Why is this contact information displayed? [Close]
The USPTO makes this data available for search by the public so that individuals can locate ownership information for intellectual property, much the same way a county might make real estate property ownership information available.
Since our website is synchronized with the USPTO data, we recommend making any data changes with the USPTO directly. Our website will auto-update when the USPTO data is updated.
You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.  Such requests must be made in writing and will be subject to verification of ownership.  This policy allows verified trademark owners to specify: (A) that their identifiable information be masked, or (B) that their trademark pages permanently deleted from Trademarkia.com.  
                                                Requests may be made directly to customer.service@trademarkia.com and every effort will be made to honor them within 48 hours.
