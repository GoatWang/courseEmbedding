Our Story - James + James Furniture

In 2011, while unemployed and job hunting, James Smith noticed there was a large void in the furniture industry for affordable, quality, and real-wood furniture. So he bought a $40 skill saw, some stain, and wood and built a coffee table in his garage. He listed the coffee table online and although that first table didn't sell for a month, orders started flowing in for dining tables, benches, night stands, and more. It was obvious people wanted solid, attractive, real-wood furniture at an affordable price. Smith quickly partnered with college friend James Eldridge to help meet the growing demand and James+James was born.
Today, James+James is one of the fastest growing furniture companies in the country, with James+James products found in nearly every state from coast to coast. Job creation right here in the U.S. continues to remain a top priority. James+James now provides work to over 15 team members and growing. We feel so blessed to be able to do exactly what we love and meet so many great people across the country.
We still build by hand in Northwest Arkansas from real, solid wood and every James+James built item is branded with the James+James mark. Thanks for supporting local craftsmen and garage-started businesses.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.
