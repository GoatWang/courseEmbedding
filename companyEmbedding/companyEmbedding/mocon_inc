 Materials Product Brief | 
April 10, 2014 


Mocon: Oxygen permeation test system 

 
See it at Interpack, Hall 5, Stand J03! Suitable for food, pharmaceutical, medical device, and material producers who need to test packaging structures for oxygen permeation, the new fully-automated and user-friendly OX-TRAN Model 2/22 H oxygen permeation test system from Mocon uses advanced technology and design enhancements to significantly reduce test times depending on barrier quality.  






 Machine Product Brief | 
January 27, 2014 


MOCON: Oxygen transmission rate test instrument 

 
The OX-TRAN Model 2/21 10x oxygen transmission rate test instrument from Mocon accurately and repeatably measures films or packages at precise temperature and relative humidity conditions to 5x10-4 cc/(m2 x day), ten times lower than previous levels.  






 Machine Product Brief | 
November 30, 2013 


Mocon: Organism test improves food safety 

 
An “indicator organism” testing capability, which simultaneously tests for enterobacteriaceae and total coliform counts using an oxygen depletion sensor and automated reader, has been added to Mocon’s GreenLight microbial detection platform, which already provided total count testing capability.  






 Machine Product Brief | 
February 28, 2013 


MOCON, Inc: Water vapor measurement instrument 

 
Designed to measure the water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) of ultra-high barrier films, Mocon’s new generation AQUATRAN Model 2 WVTR measurement instrument targets commercial or developmental ultra-high barrier structures, including flexible films for organic light-emitting display (OLED), solar, and similar demanding applications.

  MOCON, Inc.       763-493-7281    http://www.mocon.com  7500 Mendelssohn Ave N Minneapolis Minnesota USA    atraylor@mocon.com   MOCON, Inc., is an international manufacturing company headquartered in Minneapolis, Minnesota USA with operations in Texas, Colorado, Germany and China.
While working as a research physicist for General Mills in Minneapolis, Les Demorest, our founder, saw a need for the type of moisture measurement instrumentation that became our first product. In 1966, he founded Modern Controls, Inc., and in 1968 it became a public company trading locally in Minnesota.  In 1979 the company became a nationally traded public company on the NASDAQ exchange with the symbol "MOCO". 
In 1999 the company name changed to MOCON, Inc.  MOCON has expanded its product lines over the years to include a wide variety of specialized instruments for the food, pharmaceutical, packaging and many other industries.  We design, manufacture and sell products for gas detection, measurement and analysis.  Our customers use MOCON products in several areas including research and development, production/manufacturing and quality control.
A word often heard at MOCON is "growth".  The company has experienced excellent growth over the years and is committed to continuing this growth in the future.  There is a strong sense of accountability to our shareholders to deliver consistent earnings through being a step ahead in anticipating, responding to, and delivering market needs.
As a part of MOCON’s growth commitment, we acquired Microanalytics, near Austin, Texas in January 1998. Founded by Donald Wright, Microanalytics produces multidimensional gas chromatographs for specific industrial applications.  Microanalytics added unique expertise in aroma and odor analysis to our technology base.
In October, 2001 MOCON acquired Baseline Industries located north of Denver, in Lyons, Colorado.  Baseline, formed in 1969 by Kenneth Forsberg, is known as an industry leader in the development and manufacture of gas analyzers.  Baseline prides itself on its worldwide reputation for providing quality instrumentation and technical support.  Baseline adds a new line of gas monitoring instruments to our product line, and is a complementary and synergistic addition to the gas analysis instrumentation that we already offer.  
In February, 2004 MOCON acquired Lippke Handels, our distributor located in Germany.  This acquisition aids in MOCON’s efforts to build distribution channels which reach all of the markets in Europe and broaden MOCON’s product and service offerings. 
In March, 2007 MOCON opened a sales and support office in Shanghai, China. This MOCON staffed office allows MOCON to provide a focal point in Asia specifically aimed at supporting the MOCON brand name, the numerous instruments already in place and ongoing sales.
Additionally, MOCON is a consulting compa
