        Press Releases
Cooperative Announces New Venture
December 1, 1999
South Dakota Soybean Processors, Inc., a new generation value-added   cooperative owned by 2,103 producers who live in Minnesota, South Dakota, North   Dakota and Iowa, announced yesterday its partnership with Urethane Soy Systems   Company, Inc., a manufacturer of SoyOyl™. The product utilizes crude soybean   oil, a renewable resource, as the base for countless industrial products, making   today’s producer a more environmentally-friendly partner in the global universe.   The product technology is the only one of its kind in the world and a portion of   the technology is exclusive to SDSP. 
The venture moves SDSP from a commodity business to a consumer business,   adding even more value to its members’ soybeans by moving one step closer to the   consumer. 
"SoyOyl™ is our first step into adding value to the products we produce at   the Volga processing facility," stated Rodney Christianson, Chief Executive   Officer. "We are excited to be the supplier of this competitively priced,   environmentally-friendly product that does not rely on public policy or   government subsidies for success. With SDSP’s end in mind of returning a maximum   value-added payment to our members, our Board and Management team will continue   to actively pursue other opportunities to strategically position this   cooperative in the soybean industry."

Current Postings for SDSP LLC (Capital Unit)


Match History for SDSP LLC (Capital Unit)
















South Dakota Soybean Processors, LLC (“SDSP”) owns and operates a soybean processing plant and a soybean oil refinery in Volga, South Dakota. SDSP is owned by approximately 2,200 members. Its members principally reside in South Dakota and neighboring states, many of whom deliver and sell soybeans to the plant for processing.

SDSP began producing crude soybean oil, soybean meal and soybean hulls in late 1996. Since then the company has made significant capital improvements and expanded its business to include the development of vertically integrated product lines and services. In 2002, SDSP completed the construction of a refining facility and began refining crude soybean oil. In April 2011, SDSP completed construction of a deodorizer and now has the capacity to deodorize its refined oil.

 SDSP’s core business consists of processing locally grown soybeans into soybean meal and soybean oil. Approximately 80% of a bushel of soybeans (60 pounds) is processed into soybean meal or hulls, and the remaining 20% is extracted as oil. SDSP markets its soybean meal primarily to resellers, feed mills, and livestock producers as livestock feed. SDSP also markets and sells multiple grades of soybean oil – crude, refined, and a deodorized salad oil, which are marketed and sold primarily to the food and biodiesel industries. Under certain market conditions, SDSP may also register and deliver warehouse receipts for crude oil according to the terms and conditions of a Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) soybean oil futures contract

 Posting Offers

General Rules  Registered users may post offers to buy or sell by contacting VIA in person, by telephone or via the VIA Web site, as listed above. If logging into the Web site, provide the information requested when prompted. If posting by telephone or in person, provide the information requested to the VIA representative who will enter the information into the Trading Service. There is no charge to post offers to buy or sell. 

Bid/Ask Price Buyers are required to post a bid price, and Sellers are required to post an ask price. The "bid" price is the price the interested Buyer is willing to pay to purchase capital units. The "ask" price is the lowest price at which the interested Seller is willing to sell Seller's capital units. If there is a match between an offer to buy and an offer to sell, the purchase price will be the bid price of the offer to buy.
Firm Offers All posted offers to sell and offers to buy are non-firm and non-binding, meaning that capital units posted for sale by Sellers are only matched and settled with Buyers' posted bids at the time the parties sign the Sale Confirmation and Contract.
Waiting Period An offer to sell will not be matched with an offer to buy, unless the offer to sell has been posted for at least 15 days including the day of post. Any modification of an offer to sell activates a new 15 day waiting period.
Multiple Offers Buyers and Sellers may make multiple offers to buy or sell capital units at different prices. The Buyer or Seller cannot post multiple offers and pick the best one that matches, nor can any Seller post more capital units for sale than owned.
No Brokers/Dealers Buyers and Sellers may not use a broker-dealer or other representative to post offers or make trades on their behalf through the Trading Service. Buyers and Sellers may only post offers and make trades for their own accounts.

Things are "soy-good" at South Dakota Soybean Processors. The agricultural cooperative turns the 219.7 million bushels per year of soybeans from its 2,200 farmer/members into soybean oil, soybean hulls, and soybean meal. Its soybean meal is mainly sold to livestock feed companies and independent livestock producers. Most of South Dakota Soybean's crude soybean oil is processed into refined and bleached oil under the name Soyol, which is sold to manufacturers of various consumer items (plastics and biodiesel manufacturers, for example), who further process it for use in their products. The co-op owns 91% of Urethane Soy Systems Company (USSC), which it supplies with Soyol products.

Tosteds Granola Bars
Posted by Laura Soybeans - Paula and Jonathan
    on 
      Oct 7th 2016
    

Homemade Granola Bars with Tosteds Ingredients: 2 cups uncooked quick oats 1 1/2 cups lightly chopped almonds 1 cup Tosteds 1 - 8oz package Deglet Noor Pitted Dates 1/2 cup sunflower seeds 1/4 cup chia seeds 6 dried apricot halves - chopped 1/2 cup dark chocolate chips  1/2 cup raw honey 1/2 cup natural creamy peanut butter Directions: Roast the quick oats and almonds for 15 minutes at 350F.
 Mix the dates in a high power blender and put in a medium sized mixing 
bowl.  Add to the dates, the oats, almonds, Tosteds, sunflower seeds, 
chia seeds and apricots. Mix (I found it easiest to use my hands to get 
the dry ingredients mixed into the dates.)  Melt the peanut butter and the honey on low heat.   To the oat mixture add the chocolate chips and honey peanut butter mixture, blend well.  (my chocolate chips melted) Press the mixture into a 9" by 13" pan lined with parchment paper.  Flatten the bars and refrigerate for 1/2 hour.   Cut and serve!  We wrapped the bars left over in plastic wrap and put in freezer to snack on later.
