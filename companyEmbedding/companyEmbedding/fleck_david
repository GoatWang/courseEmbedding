Working daily between illustration, humanitarian architecture, and design, David is interested in the crossover between art, architecture, people and our cities. 
Having trained as an architect, his illustrations are informed by the detail and complexity of architectural drawings, creating discovery, a world of chaos and experience waiting to be uncovered and shared in each image. Inspired by writing, travel, and his own experiences exploring cities, David’s images are full of stories.
"Until I have a go at drawing something I often don’t realise just how complex and beautiful it really is. So that's what I try my best to show- complexity, imperfection, beauty, and a bit of naivety too."

AI Shoots Down Fighter Planes, Treats Bipolar Disorder
Advancements in machine learning are leading to new ways of treating diseases.



The artificial intelligence that can blow human pilots out of the sky  in air-to-air combat accurately predicted treatment outcomes for  bipolar disorder, according to a new medical study by the University of  Cincinnati. The findings open a world of possibility for using AI, or machine learning, to treat disease, researchers said.David Fleck, an associate professor at the UC College of Medicine,  and his co-authors used artificial intelligence called "genetic fuzzy  trees" to predict how bipolar patients would respond to lithium. Bipolar disorder affects as many as six million  adults in the United States or four percent of the adult population in a  given year."In psychiatry, treatment of bipolar disorder is as much an art as a  science," Fleck said. "Patients are fluctuating between periods of  mania and depression. Treatments will change during those periods. It's  really difficult to treat them appropriately during stages of the  illness."The study authors found that even the best of eight common models  used in treating bipolar disorder predicted who would respond to lithium  treatment with 75 percent accuracy. By comparison, the model UC  researchers developed using AI predicted how patients would respond to  lithium 100 percent of the time.  Even more impressively, the UC model  predicted the actual reduction in manic symptoms after lithium treatment  with 92 percent accuracy.It turns out that the same kind of artificial intelligence that  outmaneuvered Air Force pilots last year in simulation after simulation  at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base is equally adept at making beneficial  decisions that can help doctors treat disease. The findings were  published this month in the journal Bipolar Disorders."What this shows is that an effort funded for aerospace is a  game-changer for the field of medicine. And that is awesome," said Kelly  Cohen, a professor in UC's College of Engineering and Applied Science. Cohen's doctoral graduate Nicholas Ernest is founder of the company  Psibernetix, Inc., an artificial intelligence development and  consultation company.  Psibernetix is working on applications such as  air-to-air combat, cybersecurity and predictive analytics. Ernest's  fuzzy logic algorithm is able to sort vast possibilities to arrive at  the best choices in literally the blink of an eye. "Normally the problems our AIs solve have many, many googolplexes of  possible solutions -- effectively infinite," study co-author Ernest  said.His team developed a genetic fuzzy logic called Alpha capable of  shooting down human pilots in simulations, even when the computer's  aircraft intentionally was handicapped with a slower top speed and less  nimble flight characteristics. The system's autonomous real-time  decision-making shot down retired U.S. Air Force Col. Gene Lee in every  engagement."It seemed to be aware of my intentions and reacting instantly to my  changes in flight and my missile deployment," Lee said last year. "It  knew how to defeat the shot I was taking. It moved instantly between  defensive and offensive actions as needed." The American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics honored Cohen  and Ernest this year for their "advancement and application of  artificial intelligence to large scale, meaningful and challenging  aerospace-related problems."Cohen spent much of his career working with fuzzy-logic based AI in  drones. He used a sabbatical from the engineering college to approach  the UC College of Medicine with an idea: What if they could apply the  amazing predictive power of fuzzy logic to a particularly nettlesome  medical problem?Medicine and avionics have little in common. But each entails an  ordered process -- a vast decision tree -- to arrive at the best  choices. Fuzzy logic is a system that relies not on specific definitions  but generalizations to compensate for uncertainty or statistical noise.  This artificial intelligence is called "genetic fuzzy" because it  constantly refines its answer, tossing out the lesser choices in a way  analogous to the genetic processes of Darwinian natural selection.Cohen compares it to teaching a child how to recognize a chair.  After seeing just a few examples, any child can identify the object  people sit in as a chair, regardless of its shape, size or color."We do not require a large statistical database to learn. We figure  things out. We do something similar to emulate that with fuzzy logic,"  Cohen said.Cohen found a receptive audience in Fleck, who was working with UC's  former Center for Imaging Research. After all, who better to tackle one  of medical science's hardest problems than a rocket scientist? Cohen,  an aerospace engineer, felt up to the task.Ernest said people should not conflate the technology with its  applications. The algorithm he developed is not a sentient being like  the villains in the Terminator movie franchise but merely a tool, he  said, albeit a powerful one with seemingly endless applications. "I get emails and comments every week from would-be John Connors out  there who think this will lead to the end of the world," Ernest said.Ernest's company created EVE, a genetic fuzzy AI that specializes in  the creation of other genetic fuzzy AIs. EVE came up with a predictive  model for patient data called the LITHium Intelligent Agent or LITHIA  for the bipolar study. "This predictive model taps into the power of fuzzy logic to allow you to make a more informed decision," Ernest said.And unlike other types of AI, fuzzy logic can describe in simple language why it made its choices, he said. The researchers teamed up with Dr. Caleb Adler, the UC Department of  Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience vice chairman of clinical  research, to examine bipolar disorder, a common, recurrent and often  lifelong illness. Despite the prevalence of mood disorders, their causes  are poorly understood, Adler said."Really, it's a black box," Adler said. "We diagnose someone with  bipolar disorder. That's a description of their symptoms. But that  doesn't mean everyone has the same underlying causes." Selecting the appropriate treatment can be equally tricky."Over the past 15 years there has been an explosion of treatments  for mania. We have more options. But we don't know who is going to  respond to what," Adler said. "If we could predict who would respond  better to treatment, you would save time and consequences." With appropriate care, bipolar disorder is a manageable chronic illness for patients whose lives can return to normal, he said.UC's new study, funded in part by a grant from the National  Institute of Mental Health, identified 20 patients who were prescribed  lithium for eight weeks to treat a manic episode. Fifteen of the 20  patients responded well to the treatment.The algorithm used an analysis of two types of patient brain scans,  among other data, to predict with 100 percent accuracy which patients  responded well and which didn't. And the algorithm also predicted the  reductions in symptoms at eight weeks, an achievement made even more  impressive by the fact that only objective biological data were used for  prediction rather than subjective opinions from experienced physicians."This is a huge first step and ultimately something that will be very important to psychiatry and across medicine," Adler said. How much potential does this have to revolutionize medicine?"I think it's unlimited," Fleck said. "It's a good result. The best  way to validate it is to get a new cohort of individuals and apply their  data to the system."Cohen is less reserved in his enthusiasm. He said the model could  help personalize medicine to individual patients like never before,  making health care both safer and more affordable. Fewer side-effects  means fewer hospital visits, less secondary medication and better  treatments.Now the UC researchers and Psibernetix are working on a new study  applying fuzzy logic to diagnosing and treating concussions, another  condition that has bedeviled doctors. "The impact on society could be profound," Cohen said.

David Fleck
David Fleck had his first solo exhibition “Our Ancestors” here in The Red Door Gallery in April 2012.
Our Ancestors presents portraits of city life as a collection of limited edition screenprints, digital prints and 3D models from architect and illustrator, David Fleck. His whimsically enchanting linear studies use a clean and fresh palette to celebrate trusted, architectural forms as if they were built yesterday.  Although void of perspective, these city streets are layered, creating an undulating wave of building facades and natural landscapes with a reassuring reminder of simpler times gone by.
Although inspired by local towns and cities, Fleck’s final folio of works could well be associated with many international locations (an idea discussed in Italio Calvino’s influential book, Invisible Cities). Every city is a playground of discovery, a world of chaos and experience waiting to be uncovered and shared. The relationship between a cutting edge, contemporary city and its people is, of course, reciprocal and influenced by the town planning and the priorities of our ancestors. Fleck’s cities depict this oxymoron, by illustrating classical architecture in a contemporary style – a pairing down of complex structures to their most prominent features. Fleck captures the character of a population through an illustration of the city, and characterizes a city through a drawing of one person. It is in the combination that we find a portrait of city life.
David Fleck is currently living in Glasgow where he is finishing his Masters in Architecture.
