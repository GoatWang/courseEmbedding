 Career History



Secretary

                                    Current                


Chou America Management, Inc.


                  Chou America Management (CAM) employs a value-oriented investment approach and manages the Chou Equity Opportunity Fund and the Chou Income Opportunity Fund.The Chou Equity Opportunity Fund seeks to achieve long-term growth of capital. The fund invests primarily in equity and debt securities of companies located throughout the world that CAM believes are available at market prices less than their value, and financial instruments that provide exposure to these equity and debt securities. Portfolio holdings are typically concentrated in 25 to 35 companies without limits as to the size of an issuer, its earnings or the industry in which it operates. During times of high market valuations and volatility, CAM may decide to maintain a larger portion of the fund's assets in short-term fixed income securities during periods of high market valuations and volatility. The fund's net assets may be invested in debt securities including government and corporate bonds, high yield bonds, ABS and repurchase agreements. The Chou Income Opportunity Fund seeks to provide capital appreciation and income production, with capital preservation as a secondary consideration. The fund seeks to achieve its investment objective by investing at least 80% of its net assets in fixed income securities and financial instruments that provide exposure to fixed income securities. The fixed income investments primarily include U.S. and Canadian government and municipal securities, distressed securities, corporate bonds (both investment grade and below-investment grade), preferred securities, income trusts, bank debt, mortgage- or asset-backed securities, and convertible securities. The fund invests in fixed income securities in both developed markets and emerging markets. The fund may invest in distressed securities and corporate bonds that are rated below-investment grade.

SAMPLE LEGAL CASES

 to him for the purpose of determining his child support obligation. ... [¶ 7] Lord contends only that
 the court erred in relying on Department of Labor statistics in imputing income to him. ...

Comfort Level - Are you comfortable telling the lawyer personal
information? Does the lawyer seem interested in solving your problem?

the lawyer worked on other cases similar to yours? 
Cost - How are the lawyer's fees structured - hourly or flat
fee? Can the lawyer estimate the cost of your case? 
City - Is the lawyer's office conveniently located?
Not sure what questions to ask a lawyer?Here are a few to get you started:

How long have you been in practice?
How many cases like mine have you handled?
How often do you settle cases out of court?
What are your fees and costs?
What are the next steps?
