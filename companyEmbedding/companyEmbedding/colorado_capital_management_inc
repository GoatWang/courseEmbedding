Young Professional - Colorado Capital Management






























































 













			Young Professional

			2017-04-01T16:37:34+00:00		



Young Professional
There’s no shortage of investment advice for young professionals to be found in the media or on the internet today. But piecing together that information into a solid strategy can be an overwhelming, time-consuming and often frustrating task. That’s why many young professionals saving for retirement, college or other goals, conclude that hiring a trusted money manager like Colorado Capital Management is the best investment decision they can make.
Colorado Capital Management’s experienced advisors can create a tailor-made investment strategy that helps you achieve your short-term and long-term goals without the hassle or frustration you’ve likely experienced in the past.
Case Study
Daniel – Young, Married Professional with Two Children
Daniel had limited success in managing his family’s investments. At times, he would devote considerable time to researching investments and identifying promising opportunities, but would invariably end up buying at just the wrong time. Often, he would have large amounts of idle cash waiting for the next opportunity, only to have the market move up strongly while he watched from the sidelines. Finally, Daniel decided to hire a professional to manage his family’s investments on an ongoing basis.
The Details

Married with two children
$250,000 combined annual income
Roughly $750,000 in investments, including 401K
Goals include saving for college education and retirement

Financial Planning & Investment Needs

A personalized financial strategy based on his goals and objectives, which integrated his 401k investment options
Ongoing investment management
Help in choosing the right college savings plan

The Solution
After unimpressive sit-downs with Wall Street brokerage firms, a friend referred Daniel to Colorado Capital Management. We were able to provide him with the comprehensive investment strategy he was looking for so he could spend more time focusing on his wife and young children and building his burgeoning career. He appreciated our independent and unbiased, “fee-only” approach to managing his investments, the level of attention he received – and, of course – the growth in his family’s portfolio.

Hedging Strategies

Simple Short Exposure. This strategy effectively shorts the S&P 500 by
        buying shares in the S&P 500 Short ETF.
        Simple Hedging will assume that 100%
        of the backtest's invested principal is always in the backtest's long positions.

        For example, if you choose a 25% hedging rate, then for a $10,000 portfolio,
        you will be long $10,000 and have a $2,500 short on the S&P 500.
        The short position will adjust each rebalancing period to match 25% of the total portfolio.
        Any gains/losses from the short are added to the overall available capital for the long positions in the
        portfolio.
      

Moving Average Hedge.  With this strategy, your portfolio will be hedged
        by shorting the S&P 500 whenever your long portfolio's performance drops below the monthly moving average.
        So if you set a 25% hedge, 25% of your long portfolio will be sold and the funds reallocated to the short
        whenever the hedge is in effect.
        Once your long portfolio performance goes back over the moving average, the short hedge will be removed
        and the funds from the short will be reallocated to your long positions.
      

        When hedging strategies are being used, backtests can only go back as far as 2006.  This is the date
        the S&P 500 Short ETF first appeared.

Stock Sell Buffer

      You can optionally include a stock sell buffer in your backtesting model.
      It works by keeping a stock in your portfolio even when it would otherwise drop out
      during rebalancing as long as it remains within your sell buffer threshold.
      For example, you are backtesting with the top 20 stocks each quarter and set a sell buffer of 50.
      In the first quarter, AAPL is one of the top 20 stocks and is included in the portfolio.
      In quarter 2, AAPL drops down to number 25. Without the sell buffer, AAPL would drop out
      for that quarter, but since it is still within the sell buffer threshold of 50,
      it will remain in the portfolio.
      Your portfolio size remains the same. The stocks that would have fallen out stay in and the
      stocks that would otherwise have been added stay out. Using the sell buffer may
      help produce a lower turnover rate.
    

      Sell Buffer Size (must be greater than # of holdings in portfolio to work):
      
No sell buffer
10
25
35
50
100




Rebalancing Frequency

      By default backtester rebalances quarterly using new 13F filing data. You can
      adjust the rebalancing frequency using the dropdown below. Reasons for
      changing the frequency include lower turnover and possible tax advantages
      by keeping stocks at least one year before selling.
    


        Do not rebalance after each quarter

or rebalance:
        
Every quarter (default)
 Every other quarter
 Once a year

Inheritor
When you inherit wealth, it’s not unusual to experience varied and conflicting emotions. You may gain a sense of well-being from your new financial security, or excitement about possibilities that were previously out of reach. However, new wealth also brings the added responsibility and pressure of making smart financial decisions, and this is where Colorado Capital Management can help.
Our experienced money managers can give you the personal guidance and independent investment advice necessary to help protect and grow your inheritance while also relieving you of the burden of day-to-day management.
Case Study
Emily, Young Inheritor
After Emily’s inheritance was distributed, she was frustrated by the lack of attention he received from the big Wall Street brokerage firm her parents had been using. This lack of attention was evident when analyzing her $1,500,000 portfolio, which consisted of a handful of individual stocks and very expensive, under-performing mutual funds, high fees and rapidly falling market values. Not surprisingly, Emily was struggling with how to properly manage and invest her inheritance and plan for her family’s long-term financial security.
The Details

Received a $1.5 million distribution from a trust
Recently married and expecting a first child
Frustrated by current brokerage firm
Portfolio only consisted of a handful of individual stocks and very expensive, under-performing mutual funds

The Solution
Emily and her husband interviewed several firms, but chose the financial planners at Colorado Capital Management based on our track record and reputation, our service offerings, and their comfort level with our people and our approach. We worked with Emily to help her answer all of her key financial questions, including:
“Should I sell now, or wait and hope the share price goes back up?”
“Are these good investments for me?”
“What should I be doing about saving for my child’s college education?”
“I want to start a business. How should the business be worked into the overall plan?”

Once these questions were answered, we came up with a comprehensive wealth management strategy that was designed to meet both her family’s current and long-term financial needs.
