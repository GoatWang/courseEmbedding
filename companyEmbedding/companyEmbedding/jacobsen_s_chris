      Chris Jacobsen's research
        group is focused on developing new methods in x-ray
      microscopy, and applying them to interesting problems in biology,
      environmental science, and materials science.  Using either
      diffractive optics (like Fresnel zone plates fabricated using
      electron beam lithography), or lensless methods where iterative
      phase retrieval methods are used to reconstruct an image from a
      coherent diffraction pattern, images with a spatial resolution of
      30 nm or better can be obtained.  In absorption contrast, one
      can combine imaging with spectroscopy to study chemical speciation
      at the nanoscale, or one can use fluorescence detection to study
      trace element distributions with parts-per-billion
      sensitivity.  We are also developing detectors and image
      reconstruction algorithms that can be used to obtain quantitative
      phase contrast images with hard X rays, and thus put elemental
      distributions into their ultrastructural context and also go from
      measurements of content to measurements of concentration (since
      concentration gradients drive chemical processes).  Finally,
      we are interested in understanding the limitations that radiation
      damage presents to x-ray microscopy studies, and in developing
      both cryo instrumentation and sample preparation methods to
      mitigate those limitations.  These efforts require bright
      x-ray beams, so we use synchrotron radiation sources at Argonne
      Lab, Berkeley Lab, and elsewhere.  Students in the group
      explore interesting problems in optical physics and in
      instrumentation, and get to broaden their perspective by working
      with collaborators from other research fields like biology,
      environmental science, and materials science.

Biography[edit]
Early life and education[edit]
Arne Jacobsen was born on 11 February 1902 in Copenhagen. His father Johan was a wholesale trader in safety pins and snap fasteners. His mother Pouline was a bank teller whose hobby was painting floral motifs.[1] He first hoped to become a painter but was dissuaded by his father who encouraged him to opt instead for the more secure domain of architecture. After a spell as an apprentice mason, Jacobsen was admitted to the Architecture School at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts where from 1924 to 1927 he studied under Kay Fisker and Kaj Gottlob, both leading architects and designers.[2]
Still a student, in 1925 Jacobsen participated in the Paris Art Deco fair, Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes, where he won a silver medal for a chair design. On that trip, he was struck by the pioneering aesthetic of Le Corbusier's L'Esprit Nouveau pavilion. Before leaving the Academy, Jacobsen also travelled to Germany, where he became acquainted with the rationalist architecture of Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius. Their work influenced his early designs including his graduation project, an art gallery, which won him a gold medal.[3] After completing architecture school, he first worked at city architect Poul Holsøe's architectural practice.[4]
In 1929, in collaboration with Flemming Lassen, he won a Danish Architect's Association competition for designing the "House of the Future" which was built full scale at the subsequent exhibition in Copenhagen's Forum. It was a spiral-shaped, flat-roofed house in glass and concrete, incorporating a private garage, a boathouse and a helicopter pad. Other striking features were windows that rolled down like car windows, a conveyor tube for the mail and a kitchen stocked with ready-made meals.[5] A Dodge Cabriolet Coupé was parked in the garage, there was a Chris Craft in the boathouse and an Autogyro on the roof.[6] Jacobsen immediately became recognised as an ultra-modern architect.
Pre-World War II career[edit]




One of Jacobsen's lifeguard towers at Bellevue Beach


The year after winning the "House of the Future" award, Arne Jacobsen set up his own office. He designed the functionalist Rothenborg House, which he planned in every detail, a characteristic of many of his later works.[7]
Soon afterwards, he won a competition from Gentofte Municipality for the design of a seaside resort complex in Klampenborg on the Øresund coast just north of Copenhagen. The various components of the resort became his major public breakthrough in Denmark, further establishing him as a leading national proponent of the International Modern Style. In 1932, the first item, the Bellevue Sea Bath, was completed. Jacobsen designed everything from the characteristic blue-striped lifeguard towers, kiosks and changing cabins to the tickets, season cards and even the uniforms of the employees.[8] The focal point of the area was supposed to have been a lookout tower, more than a hundred metres high with a revolving restaurant at the top but it was abandoned after huge local protests. Still, it is reflected in the overall arrangement of buildings in the area which all follow lines that extend from their missing centre. In 1934, came the Bellavista residential development, built in concrete, steel and glass, with smooth surfaces and open floor planning, free of any excesses or ornaments. Completing the white trilogy in 1937, the Bellevue Theatre featured a retractable roof allowing open-air performances.[8] These early works clearly show the influence of the White Cubist architecture Jacobsen had encountered in Germany, particularly at the Weissenhof Estate in Stuttgart. The cluster of white buildings at Bellevue also includes the Skovshoved Filling Station. In their day, these projects were described as "The dream of the a modern lifestyle".[9]




Århus City Hall


Despite considerable public opposition to his avant-garde style, Jacobsen went on to build Stelling House on Gammeltorv, one of Copenhagen's most historic squares. Although the modernistic style is rather restrained and was later seen as a model example of building in a historic setting, it caused virulent protests in its day. One newspaper wrote that Jacobsen ought to be "banned from architecture for life".[10]
When, together with Erik Møller, he won a competition for the design of Århus City Hall it was with yet another controversial design. It was deemed too modern and too anti-monumental. In the end Jacobsen had to add a tower as well as marble cladding.[11] Still, it is considered one of his most important buildings. It consists of three offset volumes.
World War II exile and return[edit]




Søholm I terraced houses, Klampenborg


During World War II, scarcity of building materials and Nazi racial laws against Jewish citizens made assignments difficult to obtain. In 1943, due to his Jewish background, Arne Jacobsen had to flee his office and go into exile to escape the Nazis' planned deportation of Jewish Danes to concentration camps. Along with other Jewish Danes and with the help of the Danish resistance, he fled Denmark, rowing a small boat across Øresund to neighboring Sweden where he would stay for the next two years. His architectural work was limited to a summer house for two doctors.[3] Instead he spent his time designing fabrics and wallpaper.
When the war ended in 1945, Jacobsen returned to Denmark and resumed his architectural career. The country was in urgent need of both housing and new public buildings but the primary need was for spartan buildings which could be built without delay.
After some years Jacobsen got his career back on track and with projects such as the Allehusene complex from 1952 and his Søholm terraced houses from 1955, he embarked on a more experimental phase. He moved into one of the Søholm houses and lived there until his death.[12]

Rødovre Town Hall, built from 1952 to 1956, shows how well Jacobsen combined the use of different materials: sandstone, two types of glass, painted metalwork and stainless steel. It is also noted for its central staircase, suspended from the roof on orange-red steel rods. The sides are cut from 5 cm steel plate, painted a dark grey; the steps, only a few millimeters thick, are stainless steel with a rubber coating on the upper side for better grip.
The Munkegaard School consists of pavilions connected by glass corridors, arranged in a grid system around small courtyards. It received considerable attention in international school circles and contributed to his growing international reputation.[13][14]
Large commissions[edit]
With the SAS Royal Hotel, built from 1956 to 1960, Jacobsen was given the opportunity to design what has been called "the world's first designer hotel".[15] He designed everything from the building and its furniture and fittings to the ashtrays sold in the souvenir shop and the airport buses.

These larger assignments started to attract attention and commissions from abroad. Rødovre Town Hall secured him an invitation for his first competition in Germany which was followed by a number of other German projects.
A delegation of Oxford dons visited the SAS Hotel and the Munkegård School in their search for an architect for St Catherine's College. They were soon convinced he was the right choice for their important commission.[3] Again Jacobsen designed everything, including the garden, down to the choice of fish species for the pond. The dining hall is notable for its Cumberland slate floor. The original college buildings received a Grade I listing on 30 March 1993.[16]
Uncompleted works[edit]
When Arne Jacobsen died unexpectedly in 1971, he had a number of large projects under way. These included a new town hall in Mainz, Germany, the Danish National Bank and the Royal Danish Embassy in London. These projects were completed by Dissing+Weitling, a firm set up by his former key employees Hans Dissing and Otto Weitling.
Furniture and product design[edit]

Today, Arne Jacobsen is remembered primarily for his furniture designs. However, he believed he was first and foremost an architect. According to Scott Poole, a professor at Virginia Tech, Arne Jacobsen never used the word 'designer', notoriously disliking it.
His way into product design came through his interest in Gesamtkunst and most of his designs which later became famous in their own right were created for architectural projects. Most of his furniture designs were the result of a cooperation with the furniture manufacturer Fritz Hansen with which he initiated a collaboration in 1934 while his lamps and light fixtures were developed with Louis Poulsen. In spite of his success with his chair at the Paris Exhibition in 1925, it was during the 1950s that his interest in furniture design peaked.
A major source of inspiration stemmed from the bent plywood designs of Charles and Ray Eames. He was also influenced by the Italian design historian Ernesto Rogers, who had proclaimed that the design of every element was equally important "from the spoon to the city" which harmonized well with his own ideals.




No. 7 chairs in the auditorium of the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen


In 1951, he created the Ant chair for an extension of the Novo pharmaceutical factory and, in 1955, came the Seven Series. Both matched modern needs perfectly, being light, compact and easily stackable. Two other successful chair designs, the Egg and the Swan, were created for the SAS Royal Hotel which he also designed in 1956.
Other designs were made for Stelton, a company founded by his foster son Peter Holmbl. These include the now classic Cylinda Line stainless steel cocktail kit and tableware.
Other interior design is a line of faucets and accessories for bathroom and kitchen, created after he won a competition in 1961 for his design of the National Bank of Denmark. This classic design is still in production today by Danish company Vola.
Style and legacy[edit]
According to R. Craig Miller, author of "Design 1935-1989, What Modern was", Jacobsen’s work "is an important and original contribution both to modernism and to the specific place Denmark and the Scandinavian countries have in the modern movement" and continues "One might in fact argue that much of what the modern movement stands for, would have been lost and simply forgotten if Scandinavian designers and architects like Arne Jacobsen would not have added that humane element to it".[5]
Arne Jacobsen is noted for his sense of proportion. Indeed, he himself saw this as one of the main features of his work. In an interview he said; "The proportion is exactly what makes the beautiful ancient Egyptian temples [...] and if we look at some of the most admired buildings of the Renaissance and Baroque, we notice that they were all well-proportioned. Here is the basic thing".[5]

In culture and media[edit]

Arne Jacobsen's No. 7 chair is known for being the prop used to hide Christine Keeler's nakedness in the iconic photograph of her taken by Lewis Morley in 1963.[21] Morley just happened to use a chair that he had in the studio, which turned out to have been a copy of Jacobsen's design. Since then 'Number 7' chairs have been used for many similar portraits imitating the pose.
The Seven has featured on the set of the BBC soap opera EastEnders.[3]
Jacobsen's flatware design, with right and left-handed spoons, is used by Stanley Kubrick in his movie 2001: A Space Odyssey. It was selected for the film because of its 'futuristic' appearance.
Arne Jacobsen's grandson, Tobias Jacobsen, is also a designer for furniture; he created for example the chair "Vio" (according to the elements of a violin) and the sideboard "Boomerang" (named after the curved throw stick).[22]

Biography[edit]
Early life and education[edit]
Arne Jacobsen was born on 11 February 1902 in Copenhagen. His father Johan was a wholesale trader in safety pins and snap fasteners. His mother Pouline was a bank teller whose hobby was painting floral motifs.[1] He first hoped to become a painter but was dissuaded by his father who encouraged him to opt instead for the more secure domain of architecture. After a spell as an apprentice mason, Jacobsen was admitted to the Architecture School at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts where from 1924 to 1927 he studied under Kay Fisker and Kaj Gottlob, both leading architects and designers.[2]
Still a student, in 1925 Jacobsen participated in the Paris Art Deco fair, Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes, where he won a silver medal for a chair design. On that trip, he was struck by the pioneering aesthetic of Le Corbusier's L'Esprit Nouveau pavilion. Before leaving the Academy, Jacobsen also travelled to Germany, where he became acquainted with the rationalist architecture of Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius. Their work influenced his early designs including his graduation project, an art gallery, which won him a gold medal.[3] After completing architecture school, he first worked at city architect Poul Holsøe's architectural practice.[4]
In 1929, in collaboration with Flemming Lassen, he won a Danish Architect's Association competition for designing the "House of the Future" which was built full scale at the subsequent exhibition in Copenhagen's Forum. It was a spiral-shaped, flat-roofed house in glass and concrete, incorporating a private garage, a boathouse and a helicopter pad. Other striking features were windows that rolled down like car windows, a conveyor tube for the mail and a kitchen stocked with ready-made meals.[5] A Dodge Cabriolet Coupé was parked in the garage, there was a Chris Craft in the boathouse and an Autogyro on the roof.[6] Jacobsen immediately became recognised as an ultra-modern architect.
Pre-World War II career[edit]




One of Jacobsen's lifeguard towers at Bellevue Beach


The year after winning the "House of the Future" award, Arne Jacobsen set up his own office. He designed the functionalist Rothenborg House, which he planned in every detail, a characteristic of many of his later works.[7]
Soon afterwards, he won a competition from Gentofte Municipality for the design of a seaside resort complex in Klampenborg on the Øresund coast just north of Copenhagen. The various components of the resort became his major public breakthrough in Denmark, further establishing him as a leading national proponent of the International Modern Style. In 1932, the first item, the Bellevue Sea Bath, was completed. Jacobsen designed everything from the characteristic blue-striped lifeguard towers, kiosks and changing cabins to the tickets, season cards and even the uniforms of the employees.[8] The focal point of the area was supposed to have been a lookout tower, more than a hundred metres high with a revolving restaurant at the top but it was abandoned after huge local protests. Still, it is reflected in the overall arrangement of buildings in the area which all follow lines that extend from their missing centre. In 1934, came the Bellavista residential development, built in concrete, steel and glass, with smooth surfaces and open floor planning, free of any excesses or ornaments. Completing the white trilogy in 1937, the Bellevue Theatre featured a retractable roof allowing open-air performances.[8] These early works clearly show the influence of the White Cubist architecture Jacobsen had encountered in Germany, particularly at the Weissenhof Estate in Stuttgart. The cluster of white buildings at Bellevue also includes the Skovshoved Filling Station. In their day, these projects were described as "The dream of the a modern lifestyle".[9]




Århus City Hall


Despite considerable public opposition to his avant-garde style, Jacobsen went on to build Stelling House on Gammeltorv, one of Copenhagen's most historic squares. Although the modernistic style is rather restrained and was later seen as a model example of building in a historic setting, it caused virulent protests in its day. One newspaper wrote that Jacobsen ought to be "banned from architecture for life".[10]
When, together with Erik Møller, he won a competition for the design of Århus City Hall it was with yet another controversial design. It was deemed too modern and too anti-monumental. In the end Jacobsen had to add a tower as well as marble cladding.[11] Still, it is considered one of his most important buildings. It consists of three offset volumes.
World War II exile and return[edit]




Søholm I terraced houses, Klampenborg


During World War II, scarcity of building materials and Nazi racial laws against Jewish citizens made assignments difficult to obtain. In 1943, due to his Jewish background, Arne Jacobsen had to flee his office and go into exile to escape the Nazis' planned deportation of Jewish Danes to concentration camps. Along with other Jewish Danes and with the help of the Danish resistance, he fled Denmark, rowing a small boat across Øresund to neighboring Sweden where he would stay for the next two years. His architectural work was limited to a summer house for two doctors.[3] Instead he spent his time designing fabrics and wallpaper.
When the war ended in 1945, Jacobsen returned to Denmark and resumed his architectural career. The country was in urgent need of both housing and new public buildings but the primary need was for spartan buildings which could be built without delay.
After some years Jacobsen got his career back on track and with projects such as the Allehusene complex from 1952 and his Søholm terraced houses from 1955, he embarked on a more experimental phase. He moved into one of the Søholm houses and lived there until his death.[12]




Rødovre Town Hall central staircase


Rødovre Town Hall, built from 1952 to 1956, shows how well Jacobsen combined the use of different materials: sandstone, two types of glass, painted metalwork and stainless steel. It is also noted for its central staircase, suspended from the roof on orange-red steel rods. The sides are cut from 5 cm steel plate, painted a dark grey; the steps, only a few millimeters thick, are stainless steel with a rubber coating on the upper side for better grip.
The Munkegaard School consists of pavilions connected by glass corridors, arranged in a grid system around small courtyards. It received considerable attention in international school circles and contributed to his growing international reputation.[13][14]
Large commissions[edit]
With the SAS Royal Hotel, built from 1956 to 1960, Jacobsen was given the opportunity to design what has been called "the world's first designer hotel".[15] He designed everything from the building and its furniture and fittings to the ashtrays sold in the souvenir shop and the airport buses.

Biography[edit]
Early life and education[edit]
Arne Jacobsen was born on 11 February 1902 in Copenhagen. His father Johan was a wholesale trader in safety pins and snap fasteners. His mother Pouline was a bank teller whose hobby was painting floral motifs.[1] He first hoped to become a painter but was dissuaded by his father who encouraged him to opt instead for the more secure domain of architecture. After a spell as an apprentice mason, Jacobsen was admitted to the Architecture School at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts where from 1924 to 1927 he studied under Kay Fisker and Kaj Gottlob, both leading architects and designers.[2]
Still a student, in 1925 Jacobsen participated in the Paris Art Deco fair, Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes, where he won a silver medal for a chair design. On that trip, he was struck by the pioneering aesthetic of Le Corbusier's L'Esprit Nouveau pavilion. Before leaving the Academy, Jacobsen also travelled to Germany, where he became acquainted with the rationalist architecture of Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius. Their work influenced his early designs including his graduation project, an art gallery, which won him a gold medal.[3] After completing architecture school, he first worked at city architect Poul Holsøe's architectural practice.[4]
In 1929, in collaboration with Flemming Lassen, he won a Danish Architect's Association competition for designing the "House of the Future" which was built full scale at the subsequent exhibition in Copenhagen's Forum. It was a spiral-shaped, flat-roofed house in glass and concrete, incorporating a private garage, a boathouse and a helicopter pad. Other striking features were windows that rolled down like car windows, a conveyor tube for the mail and a kitchen stocked with ready-made meals.[5] A Dodge Cabriolet Coupé was parked in the garage, there was a Chris Craft in the boathouse and an Autogyro on the roof.[6] Jacobsen immediately became recognised as an ultra-modern architect.
Pre-World War II career[edit]




One of Jacobsen's lifeguard towers at Bellevue Beach


The year after winning the "House of the Future" award, Arne Jacobsen set up his own office. He designed the functionalist Rothenborg House, which he planned in every detail, a characteristic of many of his later works.[7]
Soon afterwards, he won a competition from Gentofte Municipality for the design of a seaside resort complex in Klampenborg on the Øresund coast just north of Copenhagen. The various components of the resort became his major public breakthrough in Denmark, further establishing him as a leading national proponent of the International Modern Style. In 1932, the first item, the Bellevue Sea Bath, was completed. Jacobsen designed everything from the characteristic blue-striped lifeguard towers, kiosks and changing cabins to the tickets, season cards and even the uniforms of the employees.[8] The focal point of the area was supposed to have been a lookout tower, more than a hundred metres high with a revolving restaurant at the top but it was abandoned after huge local protests. Still, it is reflected in the overall arrangement of buildings in the area which all follow lines that extend from their missing centre. In 1934, came the Bellavista residential development, built in concrete, steel and glass, with smooth surfaces and open floor planning, free of any excesses or ornaments. Completing the white trilogy in 1937, the Bellevue Theatre featured a retractable roof allowing open-air performances.[8] These early works clearly show the influence of the White Cubist architecture Jacobsen had encountered in Germany, particularly at the Weissenhof Estate in Stuttgart. The cluster of white buildings at Bellevue also includes the Skovshoved Filling Station. In their day, these projects were described as "The dream of the a modern lifestyle".[9]




Århus City Hall


Despite considerable public opposition to his avant-garde style, Jacobsen went on to build Stelling House on Gammeltorv, one of Copenhagen's most historic squares. Although the modernistic style is rather restrained and was later seen as a model example of building in a historic setting, it caused virulent protests in its day. One newspaper wrote that Jacobsen ought to be "banned from architecture for life".[10]
When, together with Erik Møller, he won a competition for the design of Århus City Hall it was with yet another controversial design. It was deemed too modern and too anti-monumental. In the end Jacobsen had to add a tower as well as marble cladding.[11] Still, it is considered one of his most important buildings. It consists of three offset volumes.
World War II exile and return[edit]




Søholm I terraced houses, Klampenborg


During World War II, scarcity of building materials and Nazi racial laws against Jewish citizens made assignments difficult to obtain. In 1943, due to his Jewish background, Arne Jacobsen had to flee his office and go into exile to escape the Nazis' planned deportation of Jewish Danes to concentration camps. Along with other Jewish Danes and with the help of the Danish resistance, he fled Denmark, rowing a small boat across Øresund to neighboring Sweden where he would stay for the next two years. His architectural work was limited to a summer house for two doctors.[3] Instead he spent his time designing fabrics and wallpaper.
When the war ended in 1945, Jacobsen returned to Denmark and resumed his architectural career. The country was in urgent need of both housing and new public buildings but the primary need was for spartan buildings which could be built without delay.
After some years Jacobsen got his career back on track and with projects such as the Allehusene complex from 1952 and his Søholm terraced houses from 1955, he embarked on a more experimental phase. He moved into one of the Søholm houses and lived there until his death.[12]




Rødovre Town Hall central staircase


Rødovre Town Hall, built from 1952 to 1956, shows how well Jacobsen combined the use of different materials: sandstone, two types of glass, painted metalwork and stainless steel. It is also noted for its central staircase, suspended from the roof on orange-red steel rods. The sides are cut from 5 cm steel plate, painted a dark grey; the steps, only a few millimeters thick, are stainless steel with a rubber coating on the upper side for better grip.
The Munkegaard School consists of pavilions connected by glass corridors, arranged in a grid system around small courtyards. It received considerable attention in international school circles and contributed to his growing international reputation.[13][14]
Large commissions[edit]
With the SAS Royal Hotel, built from 1956 to 1960, Jacobsen was given the opportunity to design what has been called "the world's first designer hotel".[15] He designed everything from the building and its furniture and fittings to the ashtrays sold in the souvenir shop and the airport buses.

These larger assignments started to attract attention and commissions from abroad. Rødovre Town Hall secured him an invitation for his first competition in Germany which was followed by a number of other German projects.
A delegation of Oxford dons visited the SAS Hotel and the Munkegård School in their search for an architect for St Catherine's College. They were soon convinced he was the right choice for their important commission.[3] Again Jacobsen designed everything, including the garden, down to the choice of fish species for the pond. The dining hall is notable for its Cumberland slate floor. The original college buildings received a Grade I listing on 30 March 1993.[16]
Uncompleted works[edit]
When Arne Jacobsen died unexpectedly in 1971, he had a number of large projects under way. These included a new town hall in Mainz, Germany, the Danish National Bank and the Royal Danish Embassy in London. These projects were completed by Dissing+Weitling, a firm set up by his former key employees Hans Dissing and Otto Weitling.
Furniture and product design[edit]




Drop, Egg and Swan chairs designed by Jacobsen for use in the SAS Royal Hotel (pictured in background).


Today, Arne Jacobsen is remembered primarily for his furniture designs. However, he believed he was first and foremost an architect. According to Scott Poole, a professor at Virginia Tech, Arne Jacobsen never used the word 'designer', notoriously disliking it.
His way into product design came through his interest in Gesamtkunst and most of his designs which later became famous in their own right were created for architectural projects. Most of his furniture designs were the result of a cooperation with the furniture manufacturer Fritz Hansen with which he initiated a collaboration in 1934 while his lamps and light fixtures were developed with Louis Poulsen. In spite of his success with his chair at the Paris Exhibition in 1925, it was during the 1950s that his interest in furniture design peaked.
A major source of inspiration stemmed from the bent plywood designs of Charles and Ray Eames. He was also influenced by the Italian design historian Ernesto Rogers, who had proclaimed that the design of every element was equally important "from the spoon to the city" which harmonized well with his own ideals.




No. 7 chairs in the auditorium of the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen


In 1951, he created the Ant chair for an extension of the Novo pharmaceutical factory and, in 1955, came the Seven Series. Both matched modern needs perfectly, being light, compact and easily stackable. Two other successful chair designs, the Egg and the Swan, were created for the SAS Royal Hotel which he also designed in 1956.
Other designs were made for Stelton, a company founded by his foster son Peter Holmbl. These include the now classic Cylinda Line stainless steel cocktail kit and tableware.
Other interior design is a line of faucets and accessories for bathroom and kitchen, created after he won a competition in 1961 for his design of the National Bank of Denmark. This classic design is still in production today by Danish company Vola.
Style and legacy[edit]
According to R. Craig Miller, author of "Design 1935-1989, What Modern was", Jacobsen’s work "is an important and original contribution both to modernism and to the specific place Denmark and the Scandinavian countries have in the modern movement" and continues "One might in fact argue that much of what the modern movement stands for, would have been lost and simply forgotten if Scandinavian designers and architects like Arne Jacobsen would not have added that humane element to it".[5]
Arne Jacobsen is noted for his sense of proportion. Indeed, he himself saw this as one of the main features of his work. In an interview he said; "The proportion is exactly what makes the beautiful ancient Egyptian temples [...] and if we look at some of the most admired buildings of the Renaissance and Baroque, we notice that they were all well-proportioned. Here is the basic thing".[5]

In culture and media[edit]

Arne Jacobsen's No. 7 chair is known for being the prop used to hide Christine Keeler's nakedness in the iconic photograph of her taken by Lewis Morley in 1963.[21] Morley just happened to use a chair that he had in the studio, which turned out to have been a copy of Jacobsen's design. Since then 'Number 7' chairs have been used for many similar portraits imitating the pose.
The Seven has featured on the set of the BBC soap opera EastEnders.[3]
Jacobsen's flatware design, with right and left-handed spoons, is used by Stanley Kubrick in his movie 2001: A Space Odyssey. It was selected for the film because of its 'futuristic' appearance.
Arne Jacobsen's grandson, Tobias Jacobsen, is also a designer for furniture; he created for example the chair "Vio" (according to the elements of a violin) and the sideboard "Boomerang" (named after the curved throw stick).[22]

Biography[edit]
Early life and education[edit]
Arne Jacobsen was born on 11 February 1902 in Copenhagen. His father Johan was a wholesale trader in safety pins and snap fasteners. His mother Pouline was a bank teller whose hobby was painting floral motifs.[1] He first hoped to become a painter but was dissuaded by his father who encouraged him to opt instead for the more secure domain of architecture. After a spell as an apprentice mason, Jacobsen was admitted to the Architecture School at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts where from 1924 to 1927 he studied under Kay Fisker and Kaj Gottlob, both leading architects and designers.[2]
Still a student, in 1925 Jacobsen participated in the Paris Art Deco fair, Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes, where he won a silver medal for a chair design. On that trip, he was struck by the pioneering aesthetic of Le Corbusier's L'Esprit Nouveau pavilion. Before leaving the Academy, Jacobsen also travelled to Germany, where he became acquainted with the rationalist architecture of Mies van der Rohe and Walter Gropius. Their work influenced his early designs including his graduation project, an art gallery, which won him a gold medal.[3] After completing architecture school, he first worked at city architect Poul Holsøe's architectural practice.[4]
In 1929, in collaboration with Flemming Lassen, he won a Danish Architect's Association competition for designing the "House of the Future" which was built full scale at the subsequent exhibition in Copenhagen's Forum. It was a spiral-shaped, flat-roofed house in glass and concrete, incorporating a private garage, a boathouse and a helicopter pad. Other striking features were windows that rolled down like car windows, a conveyor tube for the mail and a kitchen stocked with ready-made meals.[5] A Dodge Cabriolet Coupé was parked in the garage, there was a Chris Craft in the boathouse and an Autogyro on the roof.[6] Jacobsen immediately became recognised as an ultra-modern architect.
Pre-World War II career[edit]




One of Jacobsen's lifeguard towers at Bellevue Beach


The year after winning the "House of the Future" award, Arne Jacobsen set up his own office. He designed the functionalist Rothenborg House, which he planned in every detail, a characteristic of many of his later works.[7]
Soon afterwards, he won a competition from Gentofte Municipality for the design of a seaside resort complex in Klampenborg on the Øresund coast just north of Copenhagen. The various components of the resort became his major public breakthrough in Denmark, further establishing him as a leading national proponent of the International Modern Style. In 1932, the first item, the Bellevue Sea Bath, was completed. Jacobsen designed everything from the characteristic blue-striped lifeguard towers, kiosks and changing cabins to the tickets, season cards and even the uniforms of the employees.[8] The focal point of the area was supposed to have been a lookout tower, more than a hundred metres high with a revolving restaurant at the top but it was abandoned after huge local protests. Still, it is reflected in the overall arrangement of buildings in the area which all follow lines that extend from their missing centre. In 1934, came the Bellavista residential development, built in concrete, steel and glass, with smooth surfaces and open floor planning, free of any excesses or ornaments. Completing the white trilogy in 1937, the Bellevue Theatre featured a retractable roof allowing open-air performances.[8] These early works clearly show the influence of the White Cubist architecture Jacobsen had encountered in Germany, particularly at the Weissenhof Estate in Stuttgart. The cluster of white buildings at Bellevue also includes the Skovshoved Filling Station. In their day, these projects were described as "The dream of the a modern lifestyle".[9]




Århus City Hall


Despite considerable public opposition to his avant-garde style, Jacobsen went on to build Stelling House on Gammeltorv, one of Copenhagen's most historic squares. Although the modernistic style is rather restrained and was later seen as a model example of building in a historic setting, it caused virulent protests in its day. One newspaper wrote that Jacobsen ought to be "banned from architecture for life".[10]
When, together with Erik Møller, he won a competition for the design of Århus City Hall it was with yet another controversial design. It was deemed too modern and too anti-monumental. In the end Jacobsen had to add a tower as well as marble cladding.[11] Still, it is considered one of his most important buildings. It consists of three offset volumes.
World War II exile and return[edit]




Søholm I terraced houses, Klampenborg


During World War II, scarcity of building materials and Nazi racial laws against Jewish citizens made assignments difficult to obtain. In 1943, due to his Jewish background, Arne Jacobsen had to flee his office and go into exile to escape the Nazis' planned deportation of Jewish Danes to concentration camps. Along with other Jewish Danes and with the help of the Danish resistance, he fled Denmark, rowing a small boat across Øresund to neighboring Sweden where he would stay for the next two years. His architectural work was limited to a summer house for two doctors.[3] Instead he spent his time designing fabrics and wallpaper.
When the war ended in 1945, Jacobsen returned to Denmark and resumed his architectural career. The country was in urgent need of both housing and new public buildings but the primary need was for spartan buildings which could be built without delay.
After some years Jacobsen got his career back on track and with projects such as the Allehusene complex from 1952 and his Søholm terraced houses from 1955, he embarked on a more experimental phase. He moved into one of the Søholm houses and lived there until his death.[12]




Rødovre Town Hall central staircase


Rødovre Town Hall, built from 1952 to 1956, shows how well Jacobsen combined the use of different materials: sandstone, two types of glass, painted metalwork and stainless steel. It is also noted for its central staircase, suspended from the roof on orange-red steel rods. The sides are cut from 5 cm steel plate, painted a dark grey; the steps, only a few millimeters thick, are stainless steel with a rubber coating on the upper side for better grip.
The Munkegaard School consists of pavilions connected by glass corridors, arranged in a grid system around small courtyards. It received considerable attention in international school circles and contributed to his growing international reputation.[13][14]
Large commissions[edit]
With the SAS Royal Hotel, built from 1956 to 1960, Jacobsen was given the opportunity to design what has been called "the world's first designer hotel".[15] He designed everything from the building and its furniture and fittings to the ashtrays sold in the souvenir shop and the airport buses.

These larger assignments started to attract attention and commissions from abroad. Rødovre Town Hall secured him an invitation for his first competition in Germany which was followed by a number of other German projects.
A delegation of Oxford dons visited the SAS Hotel and the Munkegård School in their search for an architect for St Catherine's College. They were soon convinced he was the right choice for their important commission.[3] Again Jacobsen designed everything, including the garden, down to the choice of fish species for the pond. The dining hall is notable for its Cumberland slate floor. The original college buildings received a Grade I listing on 30 March 1993.[16]
Uncompleted works[edit]
When Arne Jacobsen died unexpectedly in 1971, he had a number of large projects under way. These included a new town hall in Mainz, Germany, the Danish National Bank and the Royal Danish Embassy in London. These projects were completed by Dissing+Weitling, a firm set up by his former key employees Hans Dissing and Otto Weitling.
Furniture and product design[edit]




Drop, Egg and Swan chairs designed by Jacobsen for use in the SAS Royal Hotel (pictured in background).


Today, Arne Jacobsen is remembered primarily for his furniture designs. However, he believed he was first and foremost an architect. According to Scott Poole, a professor at Virginia Tech, Arne Jacobsen never used the word 'designer', notoriously disliking it.
His way into product design came through his interest in Gesamtkunst and most of his designs which later became famous in their own right were created for architectural projects. Most of his furniture designs were the result of a cooperation with the furniture manufacturer Fritz Hansen with which he initiated a collaboration in 1934 while his lamps and light fixtures were developed with Louis Poulsen. In spite of his success with his chair at the Paris Exhibition in 1925, it was during the 1950s that his interest in furniture design peaked.
A major source of inspiration stemmed from the bent plywood designs of Charles and Ray Eames. He was also influenced by the Italian design historian Ernesto Rogers, who had proclaimed that the design of every element was equally important "from the spoon to the city" which harmonized well with his own ideals.




No. 7 chairs in the auditorium of the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen


In 1951, he created the Ant chair for an extension of the Novo pharmaceutical factory and, in 1955, came the Seven Series. Both matched modern needs perfectly, being light, compact and easily stackable. Two other successful chair designs, the Egg and the Swan, were created for the SAS Royal Hotel which he also designed in 1956.
Other designs were made for Stelton, a company founded by his foster son Peter Holmbl. These include the now classic Cylinda Line stainless steel cocktail kit and tableware.
Other interior design is a line of faucets and accessories for bathroom and kitchen, created after he won a competition in 1961 for his design of the National Bank of Denmark. This classic design is still in production today by Danish company Vola.
Style and legacy[edit]
According to R. Craig Miller, author of "Design 1935-1989, What Modern was", Jacobsen’s work "is an important and original contribution both to modernism and to the specific place Denmark and the Scandinavian countries have in the modern movement" and continues "One might in fact argue that much of what the modern movement stands for, would have been lost and simply forgotten if Scandinavian designers and architects like Arne Jacobsen would not have added that humane element to it".[5]
Arne Jacobsen is noted for his sense of proportion. Indeed, he himself saw this as one of the main features of his work. In an interview he said; "The proportion is exactly what makes the beautiful ancient Egyptian temples [...] and if we look at some of the most admired buildings of the Renaissance and Baroque, we notice that they were all well-proportioned. Here is the basic thing".[5]

In culture and media[edit]

Arne Jacobsen's No. 7 chair is known for being the prop used to hide Christine Keeler's nakedness in the iconic photograph of her taken by Lewis Morley in 1963.[21] Morley just happened to use a chair that he had in the studio, which turned out to have been a copy of Jacobsen's design. Since then 'Number 7' chairs have been used for many similar portraits imitating the pose.
The Seven has featured on the set of the BBC soap opera EastEnders.[3]
Jacobsen's flatware design, with right and left-handed spoons, is used by Stanley Kubrick in his movie 2001: A Space Odyssey. It was selected for the film because of its 'futuristic' appearance.
Arne Jacobsen's grandson, Tobias Jacobsen, is also a designer for furniture; he created for example the chair "Vio" (according to the elements of a violin) and the sideboard "Boomerang" (named after the curved throw stick).[22]

These larger assignments started to attract attention and commissions from abroad. Rødovre Town Hall secured him an invitation for his first competition in Germany which was followed by a number of other German projects.
A delegation of Oxford dons visited the SAS Hotel and the Munkegård School in their search for an architect for St Catherine's College. They were soon convinced he was the right choice for their important commission.[3] Again Jacobsen designed everything, including the garden, down to the choice of fish species for the pond. The dining hall is notable for its Cumberland slate floor. The original college buildings received a Grade I listing on 30 March 1993.[16]
Uncompleted works[edit]
When Arne Jacobsen died unexpectedly in 1971, he had a number of large projects under way. These included a new town hall in Mainz, Germany, the Danish National Bank and the Royal Danish Embassy in London. These projects were completed by Dissing+Weitling, a firm set up by his former key employees Hans Dissing and Otto Weitling.
Furniture and product design[edit]




Drop, Egg and Swan chairs designed by Jacobsen for use in the SAS Royal Hotel (pictured in background).


Today, Arne Jacobsen is remembered primarily for his furniture designs. However, he believed he was first and foremost an architect. According to Scott Poole, a professor at Virginia Tech, Arne Jacobsen never used the word 'designer', notoriously disliking it.
His way into product design came through his interest in Gesamtkunst and most of his designs which later became famous in their own right were created for architectural projects. Most of his furniture designs were the result of a cooperation with the furniture manufacturer Fritz Hansen with which he initiated a collaboration in 1934 while his lamps and light fixtures were developed with Louis Poulsen. In spite of his success with his chair at the Paris Exhibition in 1925, it was during the 1950s that his interest in furniture design peaked.
A major source of inspiration stemmed from the bent plywood designs of Charles and Ray Eames. He was also influenced by the Italian design historian Ernesto Rogers, who had proclaimed that the design of every element was equally important "from the spoon to the city" which harmonized well with his own ideals.




No. 7 chairs in the auditorium of the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek in Copenhagen


In 1951, he created the Ant chair for an extension of the Novo pharmaceutical factory and, in 1955, came the Seven Series. Both matched modern needs perfectly, being light, compact and easily stackable. Two other successful chair designs, the Egg and the Swan, were created for the SAS Royal Hotel which he also designed in 1956.
Other designs were made for Stelton, a company founded by his foster son Peter Holmbl. These include the now classic Cylinda Line stainless steel cocktail kit and tableware.
Other interior design is a line of faucets and accessories for bathroom and kitchen, created after he won a competition in 1961 for his design of the National Bank of Denmark. This classic design is still in production today by Danish company Vola.
Style and legacy[edit]
According to R. Craig Miller, author of "Design 1935-1989, What Modern was", Jacobsen’s work "is an important and original contribution both to modernism and to the specific place Denmark and the Scandinavian countries have in the modern movement" and continues "One might in fact argue that much of what the modern movement stands for, would have been lost and simply forgotten if Scandinavian designers and architects like Arne Jacobsen would not have added that humane element to it".[5]
Arne Jacobsen is noted for his sense of proportion. Indeed, he himself saw this as one of the main features of his work. In an interview he said; "The proportion is exactly what makes the beautiful ancient Egyptian temples [...] and if we look at some of the most admired buildings of the Renaissance and Baroque, we notice that they were all well-proportioned. Here is the basic thing".[5]

In culture and media[edit]

Arne Jacobsen's No. 7 chair is known for being the prop used to hide Christine Keeler's nakedness in the iconic photograph of her taken by Lewis Morley in 1963.[21] Morley just happened to use a chair that he had in the studio, which turned out to have been a copy of Jacobsen's design. Since then 'Number 7' chairs have been used for many similar portraits imitating the pose.
The Seven has featured on the set of the BBC soap opera EastEnders.[3]
Jacobsen's flatware design, with right and left-handed spoons, is used by Stanley Kubrick in his movie 2001: A Space Odyssey. It was selected for the film because of its 'futuristic' appearance.
Arne Jacobsen's grandson, Tobias Jacobsen, is also a designer for furniture; he created for example the chair "Vio" (according to the elements of a violin) and the sideboard "Boomerang" (named after the curved throw stick).[22]

IS YOUR BUSINESS READY FOR THE UPTURN?

IS YOUR BUSINESS READY FOR THE UPTURN?
By: Chris S. Jacobsen  The sluggish economy has hit businesses across the board. While some businesses have started to see light at the end of the tunnel, others are still waiting for signs of encouragement. As the economy starts to turn, have you staged your business for resurgence, expansion and its eventual sale? Your efforts to tidy up your business house in this slow time may reap significant benefits as the markets and the economy move forward.
Business Records and Policies. Are your organizational documents (articles of organization or incorporation, partnership agreement, bylaws, etc.) organized and accessible? Have you reviewed these documents lately to assure that they accurately reflect your current business and operations? Are your minutes of meetings of the board of directors and shareholders up to date? Do you have an up-to-date employee handbook that sets forth your employment practices and policies, including (if applicable) the “at will” employment of your workers? Spend some time reinforcing this legal framework for your business; it is the foundation upon which you operate.
Shareholders and Partners. Have the interests of the owners of the business been properly documented? For corporations, stock certificates should be issued to each shareholder reflecting their interests in the business, and a stock ledger should evidence the history of stock issuances and transfers and the currently outstanding shareholdings. For limited liability companies, the interests of the members should be set forth in a written operating agreement signed by all members. For partnerships, the arrangements among the partners should be memorialized in a written partnership agreement signed by each partner. Further, if there are multiple owners of the business, they should have a buy-sell agreement in place that provides for the orderly transition of the business if one of more of the owners suffers a disability or death or otherwise desires to withdraw from the business. Nothing can be more distracting to your focus on advancing your day-to-day operations than the uncertainty of a potential business transition.
Filing Requirements. All corporations and limited liability companies doing business in California are required to file periodic Statements of Information with the California Secretary of State. Is your Statement of Information current? Filings are required annually from corporations and biennially from limited liability companies, with interim amendments required for any information changes between filings. Failure to file statements on a timely basis may result in the imposition of monetary penalties and the suspension of the business’s right to do business within the State. For entities that are organized outside California, those entities are required first to register with the Secretary of State in order to qualify to do business within the State. Do you operate your business under an assumed name? If so, you must file a fictitious business name statement with the County Clerk and renew that statement every five years.
Many cities outside Santa Clarita require that companies obtain and annually renew business licenses in order to do business within their boundaries—have you checked the jurisdictions in which you are currently operating to assure that you have the required business licenses? Stock, limited partnership interests and, with some exceptions, LLC membership interests issued or sold in California are securities and are required to be qualified with the California Department of Corporations unless an exemption is available. For most small business issuances, an exemption is available under section 25102(f) of the Corporations Code, but a Notice of Transaction filing is required to be made. Keeping these filings current is not difficult and will steer your business clear of potential penalties and restrictions.
Management and Operations. Are your financial systems up to date? Have your current accounting and bookkeeping practices been reviewed with your accountant? Company funds and assets should be segregated from personal funds and assets—are the personal dealings of owners, managers and officers with the business carefully documented in your records? When was the last time that you updated your business’s standard forms of purchase orders and other agreements? Have the company’s insurance coverages been reviewed with your insurance agent to assure that they are appropriate and adequate? In particular, have you obtained employment practices liability insurance?
Slow times in business are not all bad. While your revenues may be down, you can still profit from this time. Take the opportunity to tune up your business and have it ready to perform in the resurgence of the economy.

NEW LLC STATUTE IN THE WORKS




Close



NEW LLC STATUTE IN THE WORKS
By: Chris S. Jacobsen  Limited liability companies (“LLCs”) now seem like they have always been around. However, it was only in 1994 that California adopted the Beverly-Killea Limited Liability Company Act which recognized these entities in California. Around that time, nearly every other state also adopted statutes recognizing LLCs with widely varying provisions. Much has changed since that time and, in keeping with those changes, SB 323 has been introduced in the California Legislature to enact the Revised Uniform Limited Liability Company Act (the “Revised Act”).
At the time of the initial recognition of LLCs, their classification for federal tax purposes was uncertain—tax regulations generally classified unincorporated associations as corporations, not partnerships, and single-member LLCs just did not seem to have any fit in the regulations. A few years later, the Internal Revenue Service adopted the “check-the-box” regulations which removed the uncertainties of classification generally allowing partnership or disregarded entity treatment for all LLCs, unless an LLC makes an affirmative election to be taxed as a corporation. Single-member LLCs are now popular for sole proprietorships as well as corporate subsidiaries.
The Revised Act is based on the Revised Uniform Limited Liability Company Act (the “Uniform Act”) adopted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws, with modifications to continue in effect certain aspects of existing California law. The intent of the Uniform Act is to replace the varying LLC statutes in each state (including California’s Beverly-Killea Limited Liability Company Act) with uniform provisions to enable LLCs to more easily operate on a multi-state basis. As such, the Revised Act moves California LLC statutes toward national uniformity, sets forth a more robust set of default rules that apply to topics on which the LLC operating agreement is silent, but preserves unique California provisions such as dissenters’ rights (Section 17711.01 et seq.) and the prohibition on professional LLCs.
Provisions of note in the Revised Act include the following:

• The operating agreement, the foundational contract among the LLC’s owners, is authorized to be in a record (i.e., information on any medium that is retrievable in perceivable form), implied, written or oral, or any combination. Section 17701.02(s).• The operating agreement may alter or eliminate aspects of fiduciary duty and/or limit the liability of members or managers for money damages arising from any breach of duty. Section 17701.10.

The right of a member to dissociate from the LLC and its consequences are specifically recognized by the Revised Act. Section 17706.01 et seq.As currently proposed, the Revised Act is to become operative on January 1, 2014. As of June 7, 2012, the Revised Act has been approved by the California Senate and is currently being considered in the Assembly Judiciary Committee. Time will tell how quickly the Assembly acts on SB 323. Stay tuned for further developments.

CALIFORNIA’S NEW CORPORATIONS




Close



CALIFORNIA’S NEW CORPORATIONS
By: Chris S. Jacobsen  Two new forms of entities joined the California business landscape on January 1, 2012—the benefit corporation and the flexible purpose corporation. Traditional corporations are organized to pursue profits, while non-profit corporations are organized to pursue public, charitable or social benefits. The two new corporate forms are intended to allow business operators and their investors to pursue both profits and public benefits; however, benefit corporations and flexible purpose corporations take different routes to accomplish those purposes.
Benefit corporations have been adopted in several states (including Hawaii, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Vermont and Virginia) under similar legislation developed by B Lab (www.bcorporation.net), an organization that promotes and certifies benefit corporations. In California, benefit corporations are governed by new Part 13 of Title 1, Division 3 of the California Corporations Code, section 14600 and following. A benefit corporation is formed for the purpose of creating general public benefit, i.e., a material positive impact on society and the environment taken as a whole, or for one or more specific public benefits. The articles of incorporation of a benefit corporation must include the statement: “This corporation is a benefit corporation” and a provision identifying any specific public benefit purposes. Specific public benefit purposes may be added, amended or deleted from time to time by amendment to the articles of incorporation. Existing corporations may also elect to become benefit corporations by amending their articles of incorporation to meet these requirements, however such an amendment must be approved by at least a two-thirds vote of the shareholders of each class or series of outstanding shares of the corporation.
To ensure accountability of the benefit corporation in pursuing its public benefit purpose, the corporation is required to prepare an annual benefit report setting forth the ways in which the corporation pursued its general and specific public purposes and whether the corporation succeeded in pursuing those purposes as measured against an independent third-party standard. The annual report must also identify each person that owns five percent or more of the outstanding shares of the corporation. B Lab has developed such a third-party standard and offers its certification services at fees of several thousand dollars per year. Copies of each report are required to be delivered to each shareholder and are to be made publicly available by posting on the corporation’s website or, if it does not have a website, by making copies available upon request. Special benefit enforcement proceedings may be commenced to enforce the corporation’s pursuit of its public benefit purposes.
Flexible purpose corporations are established pursuant to the Corporate Flexibility Act of 2011, California Corporations Code section 2500 and following. This legislation is unique to California and is the result of the collaboration of a group of corporate attorneys from major California law firms who sought to create a flexible form of corporation which could devise its own mix of economic and social objectives. The articles of incorporation of a flexible purpose corporation must include, among other matters, a statement that it “is organized as a flexible purpose corporation under the Corporate Flexibility Act of 2011;” a corporate name that includes the words “flexible purpose corporation” or an abbreviation thereof (as “FPC”); and a statement that, in addition to engaging in any other lawful activities, a purpose of the corporation is to engage in one or more of the following: charitable and public purpose activities that could be carried out by a nonprofit public benefit corporation; or promoting positive short-term or long-term effects (or minimizing adverse short-term or long-term effects) of the corporation’s activities on its employees, suppliers, customers, creditors, the community and society and/or the environment. The special purpose of the corporation may be changed by amendment of its articles of incorporation that has been approved by at least a two-thirds vote of each class of outstanding shares of the corporation.
Directors and officers of a flexible purpose corporation are required to specify objectives for measuring the impact of the corporation’s efforts relating to its special purpose and to include a management discussion and analysis (“MD&A”) of those efforts in its annual reports. Unlike benefit corporations, flexible purpose corporations are not required to measure their efforts against an independent third-party standard. The flexible purpose corporations are also required (to the extent consistent with reasonable confidentiality requirements) to make the MD&A available to the public by posting on its website or providing it through similar electronic means.
How each of these corporate forms will be embraced by California businesses and investors remains to be seen. Which form of organization to choose will require case-by-case consideration of the organization’s intended purposes and operations, and formation activities will, no doubt, take more time and effort than traditional for-profit corporations, especially as legal practitioners will take some time to become familiar with the new requirements of these corporations. The benefit corporation offers the advantage of its use and recognition in other jurisdictions, while the flexible purpose corporation offers greater flexibility in determining the special purposes to be pursued and less onerous governance requirements.

NEW LAWS AGAINST FRAUDULENT SOLICITATIONS

NEW LAWS AGAINST FRAUDULENT SOLICITATIONS
By: Chris S. Jacobsen  
Have you received an official-looking form seeking your company’s compliance with a governmental requirement for a disclosure or other filing or for preparation of meeting minutes, and wondered whether it was just a scam to take your money? In the past, such solicitations have come from official sounding entities like the Board of Business Compliance or the Compliance Annual Minutes Board, which may have caused you to think twice about their legitimacy. New laws put into effect in 2012 aim to make such deceptions easier to spot and to punish solicitors who continue to engage in fraudulent activity.

Generally, these forms have accurately asserted that a corporation is required to maintain minutes of meetings of its shareholders and directors. They may even refer to Corporations Code Section 600 [requiring the holding on an annual meeting of shareholders for the purpose of electing directors], Section 1500 [requiring corporations to keep minutes of the proceedings of its shareholders and board of directors] and Section 6320, 8320 or 9510 [requiring record keeping by non-profit corporations]. Other solicitations have sought information from businesses to prepare annual or biennial Statement of Information required pursuant to Corporations Code Sections 1502 and 17060. In each case, fees of up to several hundred dollars have been asserted to be “due now” or to be “remitted immediately.”

Revisions to California Business and Professions Code section 17533.6 will make it easier to identify these scam solicitations. The new law now requires the front and back of each page of the solicitation to conspicuously display the following disclosure:

THIS PRODUCT OR SERVICE HAS NOT BEEN APPROVED OR ENDORSED BY ANY GOVERNMENT AGENCY, AND THIS OFFER IS NOT BEING MADE BY AN AGENCY OF THE GOVERNMENT.

Further, the front of the envelope or other outside cover or wrapper of any mailed solicitation must conspicuously display the following notice: “THIS IS NOT A GOVERNMENT DOCUMENT.” The “conspicuous display” must be in at least 12-point boldface font type that is at least 2-point boldface font type sizes larger than the next largest print on the solicitation [no more hiding of these disclosures in the fine print!] and the non-endorsement disclosure must also appear immediately below any amount specified as being due and payable by the recipient of the solicitation. Solicitors are further barred from using official-sounding titles or names, including, among others: “agency,” “board,” “bureau,” “collector,” “commission,” “committee,” “department,” “division,” or “unit.”

Any violation of the new restrictions is a misdemeanor punishable by imprisonment in a county jail for up to six months, or a fine of up to $2,500.00, or both. California businesses that receive scam solicitations are encouraged to file a written complaint with the Office of Attorney General, Public Inquiry Unit. Complaint forms are available on the Attorney General’s website at www.ag.ca.gov/consumers/general.php

BUSINESS ON THE HOME STRETCH

BUSINESS ON THE HOME STRETCH
By: Chris S. Jacobsen  
2011 has been another challenging year for local businesses. Many business owners are working hard each day to eke out a small profit and, in some cases, just to keep the doors open. With that day-to-day focus, it is all too easy to let slide the back office and organizational matters that are integral to the continuing future operations of the business. As we move through the home stretch for the 2011 calendar year, here is a brief checklist of the on-going behind the scene concerns for businesses.
Meetings and Minutes. Hold meetings of shareholders and directors, or managers and members, of the business and prepare minutes of those meetings. Also prepare minutes for all those past meetings that have been held, but which have never gotten into the minute book.
Employee Matters. Adopt or update an employee handbook to reflect current employee policies and benefits and to address labor and employment law requirements. Post all of the updated posters and notices to employees as required by state and federal law. Assure that you have I-9 Forms on file confirming the immigration status of all employees. Provide written annual reviews or evaluations to all employees.
Proprietary Information. Implement a system to restrict access to, and protect, trade secrets. Require employees to enter confidential information and invention agreements. Register trademarks and patent inventions.
Buy-Sell Agreements. Meet with co-owners and agree on buy-sell arrangements so that all owners are in agreement about what will happen when an owner withdraws, dies or otherwise desires to sell the owner’s stake in the business.
	

	Contract Forms. Review the business’s standard forms of contracts, invoices, standard terms and conditions, and other documents to assure that they are adequate to accomplish the matters for which they are used and, in particular, implement revisions for any inadequacies that are found or that have been experienced in the conduct of the business.
Securities. Update the records of shareholders or members and have those lists available at the principal office of business. File Notices of Transaction under Corporations Code section 25102(f) (or other appropriate filings) with the Department of Corporations for issuances of securities or ownership interests to shareholders or members, and make any similar filings required with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Annual Reports and Financials. Commence preparations for annual reports and financial statements to be delivered to shareholders and members after year-end and, for limited liability companies, be ready to deliver tax preparation information to members within 90 days after year end.
Insurance Check-Up. Meet with an insurance agent to review the adequacy of insurance coverages and, in particular: (1) key man life insurance to fund potential buy-outs pursuant to the owners’ buy-sell agreement and (2) employment practices liability insurance to address potential employee claims against the business.
Tax and Accounting Check-Up. Meet with an accountant to discuss: (1) tax planning for year-end and upcoming tax return preparation and (2) the adequacy of the accounting methods, policies and systems used by the business. Prepare tax and financial information so that it is ready before the accountant asks for it. Assure that all estimated tax payments have been made, including the minimum franchise tax for corporations and, for limited liability companies, the annual LLC tax and the additional estimated LLC fee.
The on-going requirements for the operation of businesses in California are many and the foregoing checklist is but a sample of those demands. For a more comprehensive organizational check-up for your business, please see our California Corporation & Limited Liability Checklist. Click here for: P&S Corp-LLC Checklist.pdf
The failure of a business to regularly and timely address the organizational aspects of its operation may lead to its foundering. A proactive approach to planning and operating your business, however, can assure that you are prepared for the future and any challenges that may be encountered along the way. Resolve now to make your business the best that it can be.

NEW CORPORATIONS FOR CALIFORNIA?

NEW CORPORATIONS FOR CALIFORNIA?
By: Chris S. Jacobsen  Are new forms of corporations in California's future? Two bills are currently wending their ways through the California legislature that would allow for-profit corporations to expand their primary mandate of earning profits for shareholders to also include the pursuit of charitable and public purposes. The bills are AB 361 and SB 201, each of which takes a different approach to this expansion.
AB 361 (Huffman) would create a new form of corporate entity to be known as a "benefit corporation." A benefit corporation could be formed for the purpose of creating general public benefit, i.e., a material positive impact on society and the environment taken as a whole, or it could identify specific public benefits as an additional purpose of the corporation. Specific purposes might include providing low-income or underserved individuals or communities with beneficial products or services, promoting economic opportunity for individuals or communities beyond the creation of jobs in the ordinary course of business, preserving the environment, and improving human health. The bill would also alter the general duties of the corporation's directors to the corporation and its shareholders so that, when the directors consider any proposed action of the corporation, they would also be required to consider the potential impact of the action on among others: employees, customers who are beneficiaries of the general or specific benefit purposes, and the environment. The corporation would also be required to prepare an annual benefit report setting forth the ways in which the corporation pursued its general and specific public purposes and whether the corporation succeeded in pursuing those purposes as measured against an independent third-party standard. Copies of each report would be filed with the Secretary of State. Special benefit enforcement proceedings would also be established as the vehicle to enforce the corporation's pursuit of its public benefit purposes.
SB 201 (DeSaulnier) would create a new form of corporate entity to be known as a "flexible purpose corporation." At the formation of a flexible purpose corporation, its articles of incorporation would set forth special purposes, in addition to any other lawful purpose, in which the corporation would engage. The special purposes could include, among others, charitable and public purpose activities that could be carried out by a nonprofit public benefit corporation, or promoting positive effects (or minimizing adverse effects) of the corporation's activities on its employees, suppliers, customers, creditors, society and/or the environment. Directors and officers of the corporation would be required to specify objectives for measuring the impact of the corporation's efforts relating to its special purpose and would be required to include an analysis of those efforts in its annual reports. Unlike AB 361, flexible purpose corporations would not be required to measure their efforts against an independent third-party standard. The corporation would also be required to make certain information regarding its pursuit of its special purpose available to the public.
As of September 16, 2011, both AB 361 and SB 201 have been approved by the State legislature and presented to the Governor. Stay tuned for further information on whether one or both bills are enacted into the California Corporations Code.

Jacobsen’s HoverKing hover mower trimming turf on a golf course.
 



Advertisement 



Jacobsen’s HoverKing is a lightweight hover mower. It weights in at 26 pounds (16-inch version). Its design and ergonomics make the unit easy to operate in difficult or constricted areas. The 20-inch version weighs 36.5 pounds. “Hover mowers typically maintain the most sloped areas on a golf course where mowing is very difficult,” said Chris Fox, product manager for Charlotte, N.C.-based Jacobsen. “We saw a real need for a lighter, more rugged hover mower that could be easily operated, maneuvered and transported.” Fox says the mower’s ergonomic handle design enables the unit to easily operate in all conditions. The mower also features integrated handle mounts that stand up to the rigors of daily use.  “During our field research, superintendents told us that one of the most common problem areas on current hover mowers is where the handle mounts to the deck,” said Fox. “Our engineers integrated the mower’s handle mounts into the engine mount, providing a durable attachment point that will hold up over time.” The mower offers a height-of-cut of 3 inches, the highest in the industry, according to the company. In addition, the HoverKing offers three cutting system options: metal blade, metal edge with nylon blade or nylon string. Jacobsen has over 90 years of experience in the turf maintenance industry. The firm’s turf-grooming equipment is used on golf courses, sports fields and other formal turf areas across the United States and the world. _____________ To get connected and stay up-to-date with similar content from American City & County:                              Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Watch us on Youtube

            Most successful family businesses don't begin their stories in the Great Depression. But Jacobsen Trailer, Inc. is an exception.During the 1930's, Ernest Jacobsen ( left - picture circa 1938 ) started Selma Trailer to manufacture farm trailers to farmers in California's San Joaquin Valley, one of the largest agricultural areas in the United States. he built trailers for cotton and grape farmers with parts salvaged from Model T fords, and may have built the first rubber tired farm trailers. Ernest Jacobsen's success during the Depression hinged on his ability to scavenge parts from his auto wrecking yard.The same adeptness Ernest ( right - picture circa 1938 ) used to supply customers with quality trailers can be seen in his son's ability to run his own successful trailer business. Gene Jacobsen grew up working for his father at Selma Trailer in Selma California. While Gene was away attending school, Ernest Jacobsen's company was sold in 1952. then in the early 1960's gene started another family business, Jacobsen Trailer in the nearby town of Fowler. And now Gene has his son Eric Jacobsen in sales making three generations.Each year Jacobsen builds hundreds of over the road trailers from tiltbeds and dump trailers to beavertails including flatbeds in drag coupler or gooseneck and fifth wheel couplers from 4, 000 lbs. up to 80, 000 lbs. GVWR. Also numerous fuel cell tank trailers are built for many engine manufacturers. They mount diesel engines on top of the fuel tanks to supply fuel to the mobile field sprinklers pumps or mobile generator set. ( left - picture circa 1942 of Gene Jacobsen )Jacobsen trailer also manufactures the unique Selma Hydraulic Trailer that raises and lowers to ground level. This trailer is used for low angle of loading equipment such as floor sweepers, pavement rollers, and printing presses. ( above - picture circa 1951 )Jacobsen Trailer, Inc is also a distributor for Wells Cargo and TPD enclosed trailers, Big-Tex utility trailers, truck beds, and many other utility manufacturers.Jacobsen Trailer, Inc, exhibits in the worlds largest agricultural show, Tulare Ag Exposition and many other California agricultural oriented shows and in the California/Nevada rental Shows. This way Jacobsen has direct contact with customers. ( left - picture circa 1999 Gene & Eric Jacobsen )The key to Jacobsen Trailers particular business success is diversification. When economic times are tough, trailer distributors that sell only one product have problems. Jacobsen Trailer is successful because it sells and manufactures a variety of trailers and components.

Jacobsen announced that Britton Harold is the new product manager responsible for multi-deck and outfront rotary products.  Prior to coming to Jacobsen almost 5 years ago, Britton served as Product Marketing Manager at Husqvarna.  His experience at Jacobsen includes parts product management and channel development.  He is also a Certified Six Sigma Black Belt.  Britton received his B.S. in Marketing and Management from Ohio Northern University and his MBA from The University of North Carolina at Charlotte.

Britton Harold joins Chris Fox and Rachel Luken on the Jacobsen product management team.

Chris Fox is product manager for walking and riding greens mowers, utility vehicles and sprayers.  He joined Jacobsen in July 2011 from Southern Pump and Tank where he was the Vice President of Sales.  Chris Fox’s previous experience includes time spent as Jacobsen’s Northeast Territory Sales Manager and Dealer Development Manager.  Chris has a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from North Carolina State University and an MBA from Wake Forest University.

Rachel Luken oversees the large area reel/fairway mower, trim mower, renovation and specialty equipment lines.  She is also responsible for Jacobsen’s product transition for Tier 4 emission regulations.  At Doosan Infracore (formerly Ingersoll-Rand,) Rachel was previously employed as Product Marketing Manager.  She received her B.S. in Industrial and Systems Engineering and Business minor from Virginia Tech.

Commenting on his product management team, Chris Vernon, Jacobsen’s Vice President of Marketing and Product Management said, “The product management group that we’ve put together has a lot of valuable industry and product knowledge.  We are excited about the projects they are working on to provide our customers with the products they need to make their jobs easier.”
