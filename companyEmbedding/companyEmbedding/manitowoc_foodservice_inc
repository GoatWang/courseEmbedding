Manitowoc News






Tuesday, July 25, 2017Barge-mounted MLC300 brings enhanced stability to Illinois bridge replacementWhen the Manitowoc MLC300 crawler crane debuted with Variable Position Counterweight (VPC) and VPC-MAX heavy lift attachment, one of its unique selling points was the crane’s barge-lifting capabilities. The reduced footprint and floating counterweight meant that it would be much more efficient for lifters to barge-mount a crawler crane. Contracting teams could erect the crane onto smaller water-based barges because the machine automatically adjusts its center of gravity for each lift.Tuesday, July 11, 2017In Florida power line erection, Grove GHC75 boosts efficiency to shorten schedule by two weeksNorth American companies are reaping the benefits of using Grove telescoping crawler cranes on a variety of jobs. Their combination of crawler maneuverability, telescoping boom versatility and 100 percent pick-and-carry capability is helping lifters increase efficiency on a wide variety of projects.Thursday, July 06, 2017Petro-Sea Logistics further bolsters its Grove all-terrain fleetPetro-Sea Logistics, a joint venture between Belgium’s Sea-Invest and Ivory Coast’s Petroci, began buying Grove all-terrain cranes in 2016, and that trend continues in 2017 with the addition of a GMK5180-1. The company made the switch from another brand’s all-terrain range and hasn’t turned back, thanks in part to the reliability of new Grove models, and especially for the aftermarket service that Manitowoc provides the company.Tuesday, July 04, 2017Three Potain MCT 85 cranes help deliver luxury residences in IndiaKolkata-based Indian real estate company PS Group is using three Potain MCT 85 topless cranes to help construct its much-anticipated residential project, PS Panache. Wednesday, June 28, 2017Potain and Grove cranes inspire sales at Turkish trade fair KomatekPotain and Grove cranes were showcased at international construction equipment trade fair, Komatek 2017, in Ankara, Turkey, this May. Manitowoc was represented at the show through two of its Turkish dealers, Istanbul-based TeknoVinç and Ankara-based Karun. Potain distributor, TeknoVinç, displayed a Hup 32-27 and a MDT 219 at the show, while Grove distributor, Karun, presented a GMK6300L.

Prior year net sales included $122.1 million from Kysor Panel Systems ("KPS"), which was sold in December 2015. In addition, foreign currency translation negatively impacted net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 by $26.4 million, or 1.8%.  Net sales in the EMEA segment for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased $6.0 million, or 2.1%, primarily driven by an increase in third party net sales of $16.1 million, partially offset by lower intersegment net sales of $10.1 million. Third party net sales increased due to stronger sales of hot-side products, including Merrychef(R) high-speed ovens, stronger sales of beverage products, an increase of $6.8 million in pricing realization from the Simplification and Right-Sizing Initiatives and an increase of $1.0 million from improvement in KitchenCare(R) sales in the region. Foreign currency translation had a $14.6 million negative impact on third party net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016.  -35-  Net sales in the APAC segment for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased $0.2 million, or 0.1%. Current year net sales included $11.2 million from the Welbilt Thailand acquisition in October 2015. Adjusted for the acquisition of Welbilt Thailand, which is a non-GAAP measure, net sales decreased $7.1 million and consisted of a decrease in third party net sales of $2.4 million and lower intersegment sales of $4.7 million. Foreign currency translation had a $3.7 million negative impact on third party net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016.  Analysis of Earnings from Operations Earnings from operations for our reportable segments comprised the following for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015: (in millions) 2016 2015 $ Change % Change Earnings from operations: Americas $ 190.6 $ 161.0 $ 29.6 18.4 % EMEA 38.7 20.8 17.9 86.1 % APAC 21.7 22.3 (0.6 ) (2.7 )% Elimination of intersegment sales (51.8 ) (44.2 ) (7.6 ) 17.2 % Total earnings from operations $ 199.2 $ 159.9 $ 39.3 24.6 %  Consolidated earnings from operations for the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $199.2 million, an increase of $39.3 million, or 24.6%, compared to the prior year, which was principally driven by savings from the Simplification and Right-Sizing Initiatives of approximately $56.8 million, partially offset by higher incentive compensation and the sale of KPS in December 2015.  Earnings from operations in the Americas segment for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $29.6 million, or 18.4%, despite the decrease in net sales. Adjusted for the impact of the divestiture of KPS of $12.8 million, earnings from operations increased from the prior year by $42.4 million. The increase in earnings from operations was primarily driven by $42.6 million of savings from the Simplification and Right-Sizing Initiatives, a $15.9 million improvement in KitchenCare(R) operations and operating efficiency improvements. These increases were partially offset by the negative impact from lower sales volume, higher incentive compensation and lower fixed cost absorption.  Earnings from operations in the EMEA segment for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $17.9 million, or 86.1%, which was primarily driven by cost savings of approximately $10.8 million from the Simplification and Right-Sizing Initiatives, a $4.0 million improvement in KitchenCare(R) operations in the region and better product mix from new product introductions. These increases were partially offset by the negative impact from foreign currency translation, higher incentive compensation and lower fixed cost absorption.  Earnings from operations in the APAC segment for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by $0.6 million, or 2.7%. The decrease was primarily driven by the negative impact of lower sales volume and fixed cost absorption, partially offset by savings from the Simplification and Right-Sizing Initiatives of $3.4 million and a $1.9 million improvement in KitchenCare(R) operations in the region.  Total selling, general and administrative expenses amounted to $290.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $1.5 million, or 0.5%, compared to the prior year. The decrease was principally driven by the impact from the divestiture of KPS of approximately $9.7 million, cost containment savings of $7.8 million and savings from the Simplification and Right-Sizing Initiatives of approximately $6.9 million. These decreases were partially offset by a $9.4 million increase in incentive compensation expense, a $5.8 million increase from the impact of foreign currency translation, $6.4 million of costs allocated to MFS in connection with the Spin-Off and the impact from the acquisition of Welbilt Thailand of $1.3 million.  Analysis of Non-Operating Income Statement Items For the year ended December 31, 2016, interest expense was $85.2 million, an $83.8 million increase from the prior year, which was due to the issuance of $1,400.0 million of long-term debt as a result of the Spin-Off in the first quarter of 2016. See "-Liquidity and Capital Resources" for further discussion on our long-term debt and related future interest obligations. "Interest expense (income) on notes with MTW-net" reflects net interest income on funding provided by MFS to MTW via intercompany debt settled immediately prior to the Spin-Off as disclosed in Note 24, "Net Parent Company Investment and Related Party Transactions," to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The remaining "Other expense (income)-net" reflects primarily amortization of deferred financing fees on the aforementioned long-term debt, gains and losses on the disposal of businesses and foreign currency gains and losses. The decrease in other income, net of $31.2 million was due primarily to a $9.9 million gain on the sale of KPS in December 2015, the $5.4 million gain on sale of a certain investment property in 2015, a $4.9 million gain on the acquisition of Welbilt Thailand in October 2015 and $4.8 million of deferred financing costs recognized during the year ended December 31, 2016 in connection with the aforementioned debt issuance.  -36-  Analysis of Income Taxes  Year Ended December 31, 2015 vs. Year Ended December 31, 2014 Our consolidated results comprised the following for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014:  Millions of dollars, except per share data 2015 2014 $ Change % Change Net sales $ 1,570.1 $ 1,581.3 $ (11.2 ) (0.7 )% Cost of sales 1,068.4 1,073.3 (4.9 ) (0.5 )% Gross profit 501.7 508.0 (6.3 ) (1.2 )% Gross profit margin 32.0 % 32.1 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 291.6 299.6 (8.0 ) (2.7 )% Amortization expense 31.4 31.8 (0.4 ) (1.3 )% Separation expense 5.2 0.4 4.8 1,200.0 % Restructuring expense 4.6 2.6 2.0 76.9 % Asset impairment expense 9.0 1.1 7.9 718.2 % Earnings from operations 159.9 172.5 (12.6 ) (7.3 )% Interest expense 1.4 1.3 0.1 7.7 % Interest expense (income) on notes with MTW - net (15.8 ) (16.6 ) 0.8 (4.8 )% Other expense (income) - net (22.1 ) 2.1 (24.2 ) (1,152.4 )% Earnings before income taxes 196.4 185.7 10.7 5.8 % Income taxes 39.3 25.9 13.4 51.7 % Net earnings $ 157.1 $ 159.8 $ (2.7 ) (1.7 )%  Analysis of Net sales  (in millions) 2015 2014 $ Change % Change Net sales: Americas $ 1,323.7 $ 1,301.9 $ 21.8 1.7 % EMEA 281.6 315.1 (33.5 ) (10.6 )% APAC 191.1 198.2 (7.1 ) (3.6 )% Elimination of intersegment sales (226.3 ) (233.9 ) 7.6 (3.2 )% Total net sales $ 1,570.1 $ 1,581.3 $ (11.2 ) (0.7 )%  -37-  Consolidated net sales totaled $1,570.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2015, representing a $11.2 million, or 0.7%, decrease compared to the prior year. The decrease in total net sales included an unfavorable foreign exchange impact of approximately $49.5 million due to the relative strength of the U.S. Dollar to foreign currencies, and product roll-outs in the first half of 2014, which generated sales of approximately $35.2 million, that did not recur in the first half of 2015. Favorable volume, product and price mix impact of $73.5 million partially offset the negative impacts of foreign exchange and product roll-outs over the prior year period. Sales in the Americas totaled $1,323.7 million, an increase of 1.7% over the prior year, on favorable sales volumes across both hot and cold brands. Sales in EMEA and APAC were down 10.6% and 3.6%, respectively, compared to the prior year period, due to unfavorable foreign exchange only partially offset by strength in particular markets and product types. Further analysis of the changes in sales by reportable segments is shown below.  In 2015, net sales in the Americas segment increased by $21.8 million, or 1.7%, to $1,323.7 million, compared to $1,301.9 million in 2014. This increase was principally driven by higher sales across both hot and cold brands, with new product roll-outs to chain customers for our Delfield(R) and Ovens products, and continued strength in our ice business related to our Koolaire ice machines.  Net sales in the EMEA region for 2015 decreased by $33.5 million, or 10.6%, to $281.6 million compared to $315.1 million in the prior year. This decrease was primarily driven by unfavorable foreign currency impact and a benefit to 2014 . . .  Feb 24, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

History[edit]




Launch of the USS Robalo (SS-273) at Manitowoc


Manitowoc Company, Inc. was founded by Charles West and Elias Gunnell in the lakeshore community of Manitowoc, Wisconsin, in 1902. It was known as a shipbuilding and ship-repair company under the name Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company. Since that time, the company has grown and diversified, entering the lattice-boom crane business in the mid-1920s and branching into commercial refrigeration equipment shortly after World War II. During World War II, the Department of the Navy contracted Manitowoc to build a total of 28 submarines, plus the canceled USS Chicolar (SS-464).[4] Before they built the submarines for the Department of the Navy, the company built car ferries.[citation needed] In November 2002, the company acquired the Grove Crane company for approximately $271 million.
Construction[edit]
Main article: Manitowoc Cranes
Manitowoc produces several lines of cranes to serve the construction industries. The company produces high-capacity lattice-boom crawler cranes, tower cranes, and mobile telescopic cranes for heavy construction, commercial construction, energy-related, wind farm,[5] infrastructure, duty-cycle and crane-rental applications. It is also a producer of boom trucks.
Main Brands:

Manitowoc cranes — Crawler cranes
Grove cranes — rough-terrain, truck-mounted, all-terrain, Grove YardBoss, industrial cranes and Shuttlelift carry deck cranes. Grove began producing cranes in 1947 in Shady Grove, Pa.





Potain at Reed Exhibitions event Batimat



Potain cranes — Tower cranes and Self erecting tower cranes. Founded in La Clayette, France in 1928.
National Crane — Telescoping Boom Trucks (articulating line was discontinued at the end of 2008). Founded in Waverly, Nebraska in 1963 and all production of National Crane Boom Trucks moved to Shady Grove, Pa. after the acquisition by Manitowoc.
Manitowoc Crane Care — customer service branch established in 2000. Crane Care operates in 15 countries at 22 locations.

Foodservice division[edit]
Manitowoc Foodservice is a sub-division of the Manitowoc Company that produces ice machines and refrigeration equipment for businesses.
In 2008, the company acquired Enodis PLC, a UK-based supplier of restaurant equipment, including fryers, ovens, and ice machines. Manitowoc Foodservice announced that they would be selling off the ice division of Enodis, and the sale of that division has been completed.[6]
On March 4, 2016 The Manitowoc Company completed a one for one common share split and created Manitowoc Foodservices. As of March 7, 2016 the newly created company began standard stock offerings on the NYSE under the symbol "MFS"[7]
The newly formed company is under the leadership of former Manitowoc Company executive Hubertus M. Muehlhaeuser, who currently has eight direct reports are the current executives.[8] They are supported by a seven-member board of directors which includes Mr. Muehlhaeuser.[9]
Manitowoc Foodservices consists of 23 global brands that include 12 holding either #1 or #2 position in their respected global markets.[10]
Marine division[edit]
Manitowoc Marine is a subdivision of the Manitowoc Company, which builds and repairs commercial and military ships at yards in Marinette, Wisconsin; Sturgeon Bay, Wisconsin; and Cleveland, Ohio. The Marinette shipyard, Marinette Marine, built the first Freedom class littoral combat ship for the United States Navy, and the United States Coast Guard Cutter Mackinaw. In August 2008, Manitowoc Marine Division repaired the SS Badger. The SS Badger is like the car ferries that were built by Manitowoc Company before they built 28 submarines for the defense department during World War II.[citation needed] The Manitowoc Company announced in August 2008 a proposal to sell the marine division to Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri.[11] The sale closed on December 31, 2008.[12]

History[edit]

Manitowoc Company, Inc. was founded by Charles West and Elias Gunnell in the lakeshore community of Manitowoc, Wisconsin, in 1902. It was known as a shipbuilding and ship-repair company under the name Manitowoc Shipbuilding Company. Since that time, the company has grown and diversified, entering the lattice-boom crane business in the mid-1920s and branching into commercial refrigeration equipment shortly after World War II. During World War II, the Department of the Navy contracted Manitowoc to build a total of 28 submarines, plus the canceled USS Chicolar (SS-464).[4] Before they built the submarines for the Department of the Navy, the company built car ferries.[citation needed] In November 2002, the company acquired the Grove Crane company for approximately $271 million.

In August 2008, Manitowoc Marine Division repaired the SS Badger. The SS Badger is like the car ferries that were built by Manitowoc Company before they built 28 submarines for the defense department during World War II.[citation needed] The Manitowoc Company announced in August 2008 a proposal to sell the marine division to Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri.[11] The sale closed on December 31, 2008.[12]

These smaller ice makers can potentially produce up to 35 pounds of ice a day, oftentimes with the first batch ready in just 10 minutes. This means no more hassling with heavy, inconvenient bags of ice. A countertop ice maker fits easily on a home bar or in an RV camper without taking up too much extra space. However there are a few important variables when it comes to portable ice makers. Look through these countertop appliances and their features in order to try and properly find the perfect portable ice make for your home.Production CapacityThe amount of ice that your countertop unit can produce in a day is going to be one of the most important attributes that you’ll need to consider while researching which unit to buy. Despite being small in size, these units can sometimes produce a surprising amount of ice in a day. You can find that there are units on the market that produce anywhere from 20 to 36 lbs of ice in 24 hour period. These machines will also generally have the capacity to store an additional 1 or 2 lbs of ice as well. Frequently these machines will work with surprising speed since, sometimes able to produce and have ice cubes ready in as little as 10 minutes from the start of operation.It is important to remember that while these small machines can produce a deceptively large amount of ice in regards to their size, and even store a small amount, they aren’t freezers. So, while the common countertop ice machine is typically well-insulated, they shouldn’t be relied on to store any amount of ice for long periods of time.Easy to Move & UseIn addition to the impressive amounts of ice these portable appliances can put out, they’re also designed for countertop use, and as is such, can be moved and placed in different locations with ease. Usually they fall in between the heights of 13 – 16 inches and can be found sometimes as wide as a mere 10 inches. They can even weigh as little as only 20 lbs, which makes moving it around the house or kitchen especially easy. What’s more, these units can be filled with tap or common bottled water.Countertop units, unlike some of the more complicated commercial icemakers, are very simple to use. Since they’re lightweight and easy to transport, they don’t generally require a drain hook-up. They typically come with simple, sometimes soft-button electronic controls that can include neat features like a timer and a clock.Attractive, Space Saving DesignsIt’s not just that these nifty portable ice makers have a small footprint and can be placed almost anywhere; these countertop appliances feature attractive designs and are made from quality components. Frequently these machines are constructed with commercial-grade stainless steel. On top of that, they’ll often be given an attractive color coating like red, titanium, white, or black. In this way, it’s easy to find a color and design to go along with almost any kitchen aesthetic.The Power of the PortableMaybe your refrigerator’s internal ice maker broke down; or, perhaps you’ve just been running out of ice at parties you throw at home. Regardless of why you’re in the market for a portable countertop ice maker, take a look at what’s being offered on the online market today and find the one that perfectly fits your needs.

Undercounter ice makers are made to be built into existing cabinetry, while freestanding home ice makers can be placed anywhere within reach of an outlet. Undercounter ice makers are frequently referred to as built-in ice makers. A lot of times though a freestanding unit will actually have the capabilities to be built-in to as well, whether it be a kitchen or home bar context. Some can produce up to 60 lbs of ice a day and come in a variety of finishes to match your other appliances and decor. Both types of ice makers have models that produce crescent or cube-shaped ice. In fact, residential ice makers for the home can be found for any ice type you’d like to make. Check out the different types of ice machines for the home today.Undercounter & Built-InUndercounter or Built-In ice makers are especially popular for the home kitchen environment. An undercounter ice maker will often be a little bit taller, so that it can fit into an island or counter in a kitchen. Some are perfect for replacing older, less used appliances like trash compactors. A lot of times a trash compactor will have the same general width as a residential ice machine. Popular, slim units are often around 15 inches wide, but can still produce pounds and pounds of ice a day.Some built-in icemakers will be considerably smaller, oftentimes in height. In this way they have the versatility of being able to be installed or built into a number of different kitchen settings, not just simply under the counter. You can even find built-in ice machines that are ADA-compliant, which means that they are 36 inches or under. Meeting ADA compliance means that the appliance meets the correct height standards set forth by the Americans with Disabilities Act. These types of ice makers can also be very slim, meaning that they can be installed in nearly any residential kitchen, and at the same time produce and store relatively large amounts of ice daily.Live the Freestanding Ice LifeIf a unit is labeled as freestanding, that doesn’t mean it cannot function as an undercounter appliance as well. Freestanding ice makers will typically sport front ventilation and finished sides, so it can look good standing up in any home setting. Oftentimes these units have reversible doors, allowing them to be able to switch between left hinged and right hinged doors, which gives them extra versatility in regards to installation. A freestanding ice machine will often also come with castors included, allowing them to be moved around easily. In conjunction with the castors, these units may also have leveling legs, which lets them be manipulated height-wise when necessary. All in all, a freestanding ice maker will often carry all the attributes and features an undercounter unit might, but give a little more options in the way of installation and home placement.Lots of Ice TypesThe residential ice machine works hard and can produce a lot of different kind of ice, just like commercial units. Here are some popular ice types you’re liable to find when shopping for a home icemaker.Clear IceClear ice refers to the when water is frozen in the range of 32 - 27 °F. This essentially super cools the water and gives the ice a transparent look. When an ice maker boasts that it makes “clear ice,” this is normally referring to the fact that the ice is literally clear and free of impurities.Nugget IceNugget ice is also known by a couple of other names. Sometimes called hospital ice, Sonic ice, or pellet ice, this ice type is useful because it can fill up a glass but still leave plenty of room for a liquid. Also, since it takes up so much space around the liquid, it works very well at keeping a cups’ contents cold and refreshing.Gourmet IceThis ice type is sometimes also referred to as top hat ice, since the cubes themselves have tiny lips around the base, giving them the appearance of a little hate. These cubes are generally larger and slower melting, making them popular for cocktails or neat drinks.Flake IceThis interestingly shaped ice type is similar to nugget ice in some ways. In addition to being put in beverages, flake ice is popular for acting as the base for foods on display like seafood or soft cheeses. In this way it’s good for large home-catered parties with buffet style serving tables.Square Cube IcePerhaps the most well-known and classic form of ice cube, this ice type can be seen in drinks everywhere. Popular due to ice trays that frequently make them, you can find undercounter and freestanding ice machine units alike that make this ubiquitous form of ice. Sometimes these cubes are smaller and called half-size or cubelet.For the Outdoor Ice MakerOften able to be used as an undercounter unit, some home ice makers are made from components that allow them to be operated in an outside environment. A stainless steel and corrosion-resistant exterior are common features for a model that boasts being able to be used outside. Also, this generally means these machines sport features which help them function outside of a home as well. For instance, in addition to a corrosion-resistant exterior, these appliances will have things like a thermal insulated cabinet, which helps them stay energy efficient and keep their cooling performance at its peak, despite being installed outside of a temperature controlled environment like a kitchen or living room.For nearly any type of commercial ice maker on the market there is a residential version that will do everything it’s commercial cousin does, but on a smaller scale. This includes things like stainless steel construction, included storage bins and scoops, corrosion resistant metal, and factory installed drain pumps. Take a look at the ever expanding number of residential icemakers icemakerdirect.com offers today and find the home ice machine of your dreams.×Login or sign up to save a list ofYour FavoritesLoginorSign Up×CloseSubmitPlease enter a valid email address!Thanks for Subscribing!We respect your privacy and promise to never spam you.

Details ▸ 17 Years of Service Owned and Operated in America since 1999. Encounter the Commercial KindCommercial ice makers are great for anything from a home business setting to a massive industrial environment. They produce clear ice, which means the water used is pure and has no impurities in it. Self-contained ice machines make ice and store it in one unit. These models can produce up to 700 pounds of ice a day, but can only store up to 300 pounds of ice at one time. Modular ice machines are larger and require an ice storage bin. Commercial ice storage bins are oftentimes refrigerated so the stored ice will not melt. Modular ice makers can produce up to 1400 pounds ice daily, and the attached ice bins can store up to 1800 pounds of ice. Additionally, there are also ice dispensers that are meant to produce large amounts of ice, and can sometimes even store the ice. These machines will also frequently dispense water too and can be found in environments like schools, hospitals and restaurants. It’s always important when making an important decision like purchasing a commercial ice machine to put in an appropriate amount of thought and research.Modular MachinesYou can make almost any amount of ice you might need with a modular ice machine unit. These commercial-quality machines can produce massive amounts of ice in a single day. Some of them even have the ability to make upwards of 2,000 lbs of ice per day. Generally these machines are made of stainless steel in order to increase their durability and overall longevity. Just like a normal, home portable ice maker, these commercial versions can produce a number of different ice types. Flake and nugget style ice cubes are quite popular. Because these machines make so much ice a day, they require more water and energy, and are typically suited for a commercial retail or business environment. They can also require more accessories or maintenance to keep them working at their maximum potential.For instance, since a modular machine is not stand alone and cannot store made ice by itself, it requires a commercial grade ice bin to be attached. It’s important to make sure that ice machine you pair with your storage bin doesn’t make more ice than your bin can hold. It’s also a good idea to check what type of electrical connection your modular unit needs. Large commercial ice machines might require a higher voltage than the typical 115-120 V. Frequently a great attribute of modular ice makers is that they have air-cooled condenser’s that are a part of the unit itself and don’t need to be purchased separately.Ice Storage BinsThere are about as many different type of ice storage bins as there are types of modular ice machines. This makes sense because however large of a daily production output a commercial ice machine may boast, you’ll need proper storage to keep all that ice. And if you need to hold on to that ice for a while, it helps if that storage bin is refrigerated or insulated. Your ice storage bin will also need to be NSF certified or listed. This certification is provided by the Public Health and Safety Organization and is placed on a product to show that it complies with a strict and extensive set of standards. The NSF is considered to be one of the most respected independent testing organizations.Self-Contained Ice MakersUnlike a modular ice machine which will need a large and appropriately fitted ice bin to store ice, a self-contained commercial ice unit can make and store ice without the need of an extra ice bin. While these ice machines don’t make as much ice as a typical modular unit, they still can boast impressive daily outputs. Of course just like any other commercial ice machine, self-contained units come in a lot of different ice-type varieties. From cube to half-cube to nugget type ice, self-contained units can be quite versatile. Some even have the option to switch between making different sized type ice, allowing the operator to choose between large or small cubes.As stated earlier, self-contained ice makers can come in a lot of output varieties. Some are meant to fit undercounter and are ADA certified, meaning they come in at height under 34 inches. This makes them especially useful for hospitals or retirement homes due to their ease of access. Since a self-contained ice machine doesn’t have a lot of extra pieces and peripheral parts, it’s often easier to install and also maintain throughout the years.Other Ice NeedsIce dispensers are popular in the commercial ice world. You see these types of machines in hospitals, schools, restaurants, and pretty much just about any other building that serves fountain-type drinks. Ice dispensers are fairly interesting because they often have a lot of other attributes. For instance, often time’s ice dispensers are also essentially ice storage. Ice dispensers can be standalone or modular, but regardless of their type, they generally work the same way. Ice is produced, stored in a component or bin and then dispensed when a customer or user wants ice. It’s not uncommon for these types of units to also dispense water or other types of beverages.A different type of ice storage type is a commercial ice merchandiser. Though this ice-themed unit doesn’t make ice, it’s used to store and display large amounts of ice, usually in bags. These units have to keep ice properly frozen and display them in an appealing manner for potential customers. Of course, sometimes these merchandisers have solid doors too. These ice merchandisers will generally be placed outside where is could potentially by sunny and hotter. The solid doors help keep out sunlight and heat from working against the merchandiser’s refrigeration.Check out some of the dependable commercial ice products on Ice Maker Direct. We carry products from the world's leading brands in commercial ice machines, including Scotsman, Ice-O-Matic, Manitowoc, and Hoshizaki.
