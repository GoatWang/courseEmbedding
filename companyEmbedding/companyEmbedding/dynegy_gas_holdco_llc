Value
 Is Dynegy undervalued based on future cash flows and its price relative to the stock market?

Value is all about what a company is worth versus what price it is available for. If you went into a grocery store and all the bananas were on sale at half price, they could be considered undervalued.



INTRINSIC VALUE BASED ON FUTURE CASH FLOWS 


Here we compare the current
share price of Dynegy to its discounted cash flow value.
The discounted cash flow value is simply looking at what the company is worth today, based on estimates of how much money it is expected to make in the future.



 How is this discounted cash flow calculated?

Current Discount
Amount off the current price Dynegy is available for.


>50%
Share price is $8.75 vs Future cash flow value of $22.11



Current Discount Checks 
For Dynegy to be considered undervalued it must be available for at least 20% below the current price. Less than 40% is even better.
Dynegy's share price is below the future cash flow value, and at a significant discount (> 20%).

Dynegy's share price is below the future cash flow value, and at a substantial discount (> 40%).





PRICE RELATIVE TO MARKET 


We can also value a company based on what the stock market is willing to pay for it. This is similar to the price of fruit (e.g. Mangoes or Avacados) increasing when they are out of season, or how much your home is worth.
The amount the stock market is willing to pay for Dynegy's earnings, growth and assets is considered below, and whether this is a fair price.




Price based on past earnings

Are Dynegy's earnings available for a low price, and how does this compare to other companies in the same industry?


No earnings or negative earnings.

No earnings or negative earnings.




Price based on expected Growth
Does Dynegy's expected growth come at a high price?


No earnings or negative earnings.




Price based on value of assets
What value do investors place on Dynegy's assets?


Good value based on assets compared to the Utilities industry average.







X
Value checks
We assess Dynegy's value by looking at:

Is the discounted cash flow value less than 20%, or 40% of the share price? (2 checks) (Click here or on bar chart for details of DCF calculation.)
Is the PE ratio less than the market average, and/ or less than the Utilities industry average (and greater than 0)? (2 checks)
Is the PEG ratio within a reasonable range (0 to 1)? (1 check)
Is the PB ratio less than the Utilities industry average (and greater than 0)? (1 check)
Dynegy has a total score of 3/6, see the detailed checks below.
Note: We use GAAP Earnings per Share in all our calculations including PE and PEG Ratio.
Note 2: PEG ratio is based on analysts EPS growth expectations in 1 year (90.87%).

Discounted cash flow (Free cash flow to Equity)
The calculations below outline how an intrinsic value for Dynegy is arrived at by discounting future cash flows to their present value. We use analyst's estimates of cash flows going forward 5 years.

Value = Total value / Shares Outstanding ($2,858 / 129)
Value per share: $22.11
Current discount (share price of $8.75): 60%

Estimate of Discount Rate
The discount rate, or required rate of return, is estimated by calculating the Cost of Equity.
Discount rate = Cost of Equity = Risk Free Rate + (Levered Beta * Equity Risk Premium)
Discount rate = 17.67% = 2.33% + (2 * 7.67%)

Estimate of Bottom Up Beta
The Levered Beta is the Unlevered Beta adjusted for financial leverage. It is limited to 0.8 to 2.0 (practical range for a stable firm).
Levered Beta = Unlevered beta (1 + (1- tax rate) (Debt/Equity))
3.407 = 0.504 (1 + (1- 30%) (823.87%))
Levered Beta used in calculation = 2

Assumptions

The risk free rate of 2.33% is from the 10 year government bond rate in US.
The bottom-up beta is estimated by analysing other companies in the same industry.
The Equity Risk Premium is calculated by subtracting the risk free rate from the market return premium (10%) (source: Buffet).
The dividend discount model is automatically used for companies in the following industries: Banks, Insurance, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), Diversified Financial Services and Capital Markets.














Future Performance
 How is Dynegy expected to perform in the next 1 to 3 years based on estimates from 9 analysts?

1 & 3 year estimated growth in earnings




Past and Future Earnings per Share

2 year growth check 

x1.5?


Which of the these is expected to increase by over 50% in 2 year's time?

X

Does the average analyst expect Operating Cash Flow to increase by 50% or more in 2 years? (1 check)
Does the average analyst expect Net Income (Profit) to increase by 50% or more in 2 years? (1 check)
Is the Return on Equity in 3 years expected to be over 20%? (1 check)

Some of the above checks will fail if the company is expected to be loss making in the relevant year.

Note: If no +3 year data is available, +2.5 year data may be used.
Note 2: We use GAAP per Share in all our calculations.
Full details on the Future part of the Simply Wall St company analysis model.












Past Performance

Negative return on shareholders funds (ROE) last year.
Dynegy performed worse than the Utilities industry average based on return on assets (ROA) last year.
Return based on revenue producing assets (ROCE) is negative or zero.





X

Has the EPS growth in the last year exceeded that of the Utilities industry? (1 check)
Is the current EPS growth higher than the average annual growth over the past 5 years? (1 check)
Is the Return on Equity (ROE) higher than 20%? (1 check)
Is the Return on Assets (ROA) above industry average? (1 check)
Has the Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) increased from 3 years ago? (1 check)

The above checks will fail if the company has reported a loss in the most recent earnings report. Some checks require at least 3 or 5 years worth of data.
Dynegy has a total score of 0/6, see the detailed checks below.
Note: We use GAAP Earnings per Share in all our calculations.

Dynegy's long term commitments exceed its cash and other short term assets.


Balance sheet

This treemap shows a more detailed breakdown of Dynegy's finances.
If any of them are yellow this indicates they may be out of proportion and red means they relate to one of the checks below.

Assets



Liabilities and shares


The 'shares' portion represents any funds contributed by the owners (shareholders) and any profits.


High level of stock/ inventory/ unsold assets.

Total debt is not covered by total short term assets.





Historical Debt 

Nearly all companies have debt. Debt in itself isn’t bad, however if the debt is too high, or the company can’t afford to pay the interest on its debts this may have impacts in the future.
The graphic below shows equity (available funds) and debt, we ideally want to see the red area (debt) decreasing.
If there is any debt we look at the companies capability to repay it, and whether the level has increased over the past 5 years.


The level of debt (385%) compared to net worth is high (greater 40%).

The level of debt compared to net worth has increased over the past 5 years (173% vs 385% today).

Total debt is not well covered by annual operating cash flow (less than 20% of total debt).

Interest on debt is not strongly covered (ideally 3x) by earnings (EBIT is 0.1x annual interest expense).
