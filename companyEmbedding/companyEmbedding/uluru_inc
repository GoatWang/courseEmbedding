					Full Description



ULURU Inc., incorporated on October 17, 1987, is a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing a range of wound care and muco-adhesive film products based on its Nanoflex and OraDisc technologies for patients, healthcare professionals and healthcare payers. The Company operates through the research, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products segment. Utilizing its technologies, three of its products have been approved for marketing in various global markets. Altrazeal Transforming Powder Dressing is based on its Nanoflex technology, which changes the way healthcare providers approach their treatment of wounds. The product is indicated for both exuding acute wounds, such as partial thickness burns, donor sites, non-healing surgical wounds, and trauma and for chronic wounds, such as venous leg ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers and pressure ulcers. Aphthasol is a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of canker sores. OraDisc is developed as an improved drug delivery system for the treatment of canker sores.Nanoflex TechnologyThe Nanoflex technology platform provides the ability to formulate a range of materials through the aggregation of hydrogel-like particles. The polymers used in the Nanoflex technology have been researched and commercialized into a range of medical products, including contact lenses and other FDA-approved implants. The Nanoflex technology system has at its core a system of hydrogel-like nanoparticles composed of a polymer used in manufacturing contact lenses and other FDA-approved implants. The Company, utilizing its Nanoflex technology, has developed over two separate development platforms, including Nanoflex Powder and Nanoflex Injectable Liquid. Materials from either platform are composed of polymer particles, which are stabilized to prevent aggregation prior to application to a physiological environment.The Nanoflex Powder is a wound treatment technology used to promote the healing of exuding wounds. The Nanoflex Powder is formulated as a two-polymer blend in a specific ratio. Nanoflex Powder can also serve as a drug delivery matrix for antiseptics. After application to the wound bed, Nanoflex Powder exhibits mechanical properties, which are similar to soft tissue. Nanoflex Powder can also serve as a drug delivery matrix for antiseptics and as a delivery platform for anti-inflammatory drugs, such as corticosteroids, pro-angiogenic agents and other actives, such as growth factors to accelerate wound healing. A suspension of hydrogel nanoparticles containing a small percentage of hyaluronic acid, when injected into tissue, immediately and irreversibly aggregates. With time, the hyaluronic acid portion of the aggregate is resorbed, leaving behind a porous, Nanoflex scaffold, which provides the basis for cellular infiltration and acts as the anchor for collagen attachment. This injectable system has been studied for safety and for applications as a dermal filler to provide a family of soft tissue filler materials with different degrees of permanency.Mucoadhesive OraDisc TechnologyThe Company has developed an erodible mucoadhesive film product to address oral conditions. This technology, known as OraDisc, comprises a multi-layered film having an adhesive layer, a pre-formed film layer and a coated backing layer. The Company's adhesive film technology has various applications, including the localized delivery of drug to a mucosal site, using a transmucosal delivery device for delivering drugs into the systemic circulation and incorporating the drug in the outer layer for delivery into the oral cavity. Additionally, the adhesive film has been formulated to adhere to the surface of teeth and gums for the delivery of dental health and cosmetic dental actives.AltrazealThe Altrazeal transforming powder dressing, based on its Nanoflex technology, which changes the way healthcare providers approach the treatment of wounds. The powder fills and seals the wound to provide an optimal moist wound healing environment. The wound exudate is controlled through the moisture vapor transpiration rate (MVTR) of the material. Other characteristics of Altrazeal that promote healing are oxygen permeability and bacteria impermeability. In addition, the ability of Altrazeal to manage wound exudates extends the wear time between dressing changes.Aphthasol (Amlexanox 5% Paste)Aphthasol accelerates the healing of canker sores, which results in a reduction in the level of pain a patient experiences over the duration of the ulcer episode. Additionally, a Phase IV clinical study was completed and results confirmed that Aphthasol was effective in preventing the formation of an ulcer when used at the first sign or symptom of the disease.OraDisc AThe OraDisc A is developed as a drug delivery system to treat canker sores using the same active ingredient (amlexanox) that is used in Aphthasol paste. The Company has conducted an irritation study, a 28-day safety study and drug distribution studies to support the development of additional products.OraDisc BThe Company has developed a second mucoadhesive disc product, OraDisc B for the treatment and management of oral pain. This product contains approximately 10 milligrams of benzocaine.The Company competes with Smith & Nephew plc, Systagenix Wound Management Limited, ConvaTec Inc., 3M Company and Molnlycke Health Care.

The investors will also receive warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 25,245,442 shares of ULURU Inc.'s common stock. The warrants have a fixed exercise price of $0.0871 per share and are exercisable at any time for a period of five years from the date of closing. The issue price of the shares being sold is based on a 10% discount to the average closing price between March 7, 2016 and March 11, 2016 and the warrant exercise price is based on a 10% premium to the same average closing price.
The shares of common stock to be issued and any shares issued resulting from the exercise of warrants have not been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be sold absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements.
Commenting on the transaction, Bradley J.

Details for the conference call to be held on April 1, 2016 to discuss the Company's financial results for 2015 were provided in a separate press release last week.

We are continuing to evaluate our position with respect to IPMD GmbH and the Operating Entities in light of this recent development.

 ULURU Inc. Announces Approval to Market Altrazeal@ in Australia 
 Thu, 02/23/2012 - 3:45am 
 Comments 
 by The Associated Press  

 



ULURU Inc. (NYSE AMEX:  ULU),announced today that an Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods  Certificate has been issued by the Therapeutic Goods Administration  approving the marketing of Altrazeal@ in Australia. Commenting on the approval in Australia, Kerry P. Gray, President and  CEO of ULURU, stated, "This is another important milestone in the  worldwide commercialization of Altrazeal@.  Strategically this is an  important market as the world's largest wound research program is  currently being conducted at the Wound Management Innovation  Cooperation Research Centre in Australia.  This centre's focus is the  development of clinically and cost effective treatment regimens for  the management of chronic wounds.  Gaining the support of this  influential group could have significant global implications for the  marketing of Altrazeal@.  It is anticipated that the initial  Altrazeal@ orders for Australia will occur in the next thirty days. Also, marketing approval in New Zealand is anticipated to occur in the  next thirty days."  The timing of this approval is beneficial as the major Australian  wound care meeting, the Australian Wound Management Association  Conference, will be held in Sydney, Australia on March 18-21, 2012. It is anticipated that over 1,000 delegates from Australia and New  Zealand will be attending this conference.  The conference will enable  pre-marketing launch activities to be conducted and provide maximum  exposure for Altrazeal@ to the most important wound treatment  healthcare professionals from both countries. In Australia and New Zealand approximately 2.5% of the population, or  700,000 patients, suffer from chronic wounds, with 80% of these wounds  caused by cardiovascular disease, endocrine disorders (including  diabetes), and infection.  With the increase in cardiovascular  disease, obesity, and the aging population, it is anticipated that the  wound care market will double in size over the next five to seven  years and the cost of treating chronic wounds will exceed $1.0 billion  annually. Mr. Gray continued, "The Australian state government's strategic  initiatives in wound care are focused on cost effective clinical  endpoints and patient health and wellbeing.  The pharmaco-economic  benefits offered by Altrazeal@ could enable rapid market penetration  in the Australian market."

This press release contains certain statements that are  forward-looking within the meaning of Section 27a of the Securities  Act of 1933, as amended.  These statements are subject to numerous  risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to our belief that  Altrazeal@ will be a major competitor in the wound care market,  anticipated product launches in Australia and New Zealand, the cost  effectiveness and cost savings of Altrazeal@ in healing chronic  wounds, the size of the wound care market and the cost of treating  chronic wounds in Australia and New Zealand, the world's largest wound  research program is currently being conducted at the Wound Management  Innovation Cooperation Research Centre in Australia, Altrazeal's  clinical and economic advantages, and Altrazeal's ability to penetrate  the Australian wound care market, and to the risk factors detailed in  the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December  31, 2010, and other reports filed by us with the Securities and  Exchange Commission.

Announces Strategic Financing AgreementPR NewswireFebruary 28, 2017ReblogShareTweetShareADDISON, Texas, Feb. 28, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- ULURU Inc. (ULUR), a specialty medical technology company focused on the development of a portfolio of wound management and oral drug delivery products, today announced it has entered into a Note, Warrant and Preferred Stock Purchase Agreement with Velocitas Partners, LLC and its affiliates ("Velocitas") under which the Company is expected to receive $3,000,000 in gross proceeds, and may receive proceeds of up to $6,000,000, in two closings (the "Financing") prior to the end of March 2017. The first closing, which has occurred, included the purchase by Velocitas of a $500,000 Secured Convertible Promissory Note (the "Initial Note") with the Initial Note accruing interest at 12.5% per annum and having a term of two years (subject to acceleration under certain circumstances).  The Initial Note is convertible into shares of common stock at a conversion price of $0.04 per share, subject to equitable adjustments under certain circumstances.  The Initial Note is secured by all of the assets of the Company. A second closing is expected to occur within 30 days of the initial closing, subject to conditions precedent set forth in the purchase agreement.  The Second Closing is expected to involve the purchase by Velocitas of a second $500,000 Secured Convertible Note on terms similar to the Initial Note ("Second Note) and an equity offering that includes the offer and sale to Velocitas of Series B Convertible Preferred Stock for net proceeds of not less than $2,000,000 nor more than $5,000,000, at an effective purchase price per ordinary share of $0.04 per share (the "Equity Offering").  As a condition and incentive for the financing, the Company has agreed to issue to Velocitas a warrant to purchase up to 57,055,057 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $0.04 per share during a 10-year term. Also occurring at the closing of the Second Note, the Company has agreed to acquire the Altrazeal distributor agreements Velocitas has with its sub-distributors in exchange for the issuance of 13,375,000 shares of common stock.   If the gross proceeds from the Equity Offering are less than $4,000,000 (with such deficit being referred to as "Proceeds Gap"), the Company is obligated to seek capital, in an amount at least equal to the Proceeds Gap, from third parties over the next 180 days.  If the Company is unable to raise additional capital equal to the Proceeds Gap from third parties, Bradley J. Sacks, Chairman of the Board of Directors, entered into a "backstop" agreement and has agreed to invest up to $2,000,000 towards the Proceeds Gap, at a purchase price of $0.04 per share.As part of the Financing, the Company has agreed to appoint Ms. Vaidehi Shah to serve as the Company's Chief Executive Officer and to also serve as a member of the Company's Board of Directors. Upon closing of the Equity Offering, the Company has agreed that both Mr. Anish Shah and Ms. Oksana Tiedt will join the Company to serve as part of the Company's executive management team and together with Mr. Arindam Bose will also join the Company's Board of Directors.Concurrent with the first closing and as a condition of the Financing, the Company received the resignation notice from Helmut Kerschbaumer, the Company's Interim President, Chief Executive and Director.  The Company has also received a resignation notice from Klaus Kuehne, a member of the Company's Board of Directors. Commenting on the financing, Bradley J. Sacks, Chairman of the Board of ULURU, stated, "ULURU has been undercapitalized for some time.  The financing transaction should provide ULURU with the necessary capital to realize on the promise of Altrazeal®, both in the near and long term.  The acquisition of the distribution rights held by Velocitas completes the process of consolidating all Altrazeal® primary distribution rights under a single entity.  In addition to improving liquidity, the capital will be used to improve and expand our commercialization activities.  This will also place the Company in a stronger position negotiating with strategic partners.  We are excited by the investment made by Velocitas and look forward to the energy and focus Ms. Shah and her team will bring to the Company."Read MoreThis announcement is neither an offer to sell nor a solicitation of an offer to buy any shares of common stock of the Company. No offer, solicitation or sale will be made in any jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale is unlawful.About ULURU Inc.:ULURU Inc. is a specialty medical technology company focused on the development of a portfolio of wound management and oral care products to provide patients and consumers improved clinical outcomes through controlled delivery utilizing its innovative Nanoflex™ Aggregate technology and OraDisc™ transmucosal delivery system.  For further information about ULURU Inc., please visit our website at www.ULURUinc.com.  For further information about Altrazeal®, please visit www.Altrazeal.com.ULURU Inc.
