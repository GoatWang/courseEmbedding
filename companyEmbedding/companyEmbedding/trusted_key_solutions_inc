The Democratsâ Better Way: Positive Messaging or Pandering to Trump Voters Who Are Never Coming Back?



George Washington law professor and economist praises Democrats for coming up with a message that preserves the partyâs commitment to social justice issues, rather than attempting to woo Trump voters by appealing to what Trump appealed to.

Get the latest news & insightsSubscribeTrusted Security Solutions - A98A98 ATM Key Management System  A98-R - Remote Key ModuleWith the introduction of its new "Remote Re-Key Module," A98-R automates both the generation and distribution of cryptographic keys for ATMs. The A98-R is compatible with ATMs that use RSA-enabled encrypting pin pads (EPPs). The A98-R implements Diebold and Triton's Certificate Based Protocol (CBP) and NCR, Wincor-Nixdorf, and Hyosung’s Signature Based Protocol (SBP) that are based on standards as defined in the ANS X9.24-2 Standard on Retail Cryptographic Key Management. The A98-R also is programmed to work with Wincor-Nixdorf’s Signature Based Protocol which TSS refers to as WSBP, and unit testing has been successfully completed, but has yet to be field tested.The Diebold approach uses X.509 certificates and PKCS message formats to transport key data. NCR's method relies on digital signatures to ensure data integrity. Triton's remote key protocol uses a Triton developed form of CBP integrated with a unique host identification which TSS refers to as TCBP. All remote key protocols require the ATM's EPP to be loaded at the factory with signed public keys or certificates. In addition, as part of the initialization process, at least one A98 key pair must be generated and the public key signed by a Certificate Authority (i.e. Diebold, NCR, or Triton) and imported back into the A98 before the A98 can successfully communicate with the public key ATM. A separate signed key pair or set of signed certificates are required for each ATM manufacturer.Remote key loading of ATMs is considered by most networks and standards groups as being more secure than traditional methods that use paper key components and the concepts of dual control, split knowledge to maintain compliance.With the A98-R Remote Key Module:Key Check Values and the ATM EPP serial number is automatically logged for later retrieval and reporting. Rekeying events can be initiated from authorized users using their desktops or a web portal New remote key protocols can and will be added in the form of field upgrades as they become commercially available.For more information about the A98-R please contact info@trustedsecurity.com.Featured PublicationsA98 Key Lock Box White Paper2016 Remote Key Loading Report: Updated October 2016Is your ATM network NETWORK compliant?Products and ServicesFeatured ProductA98 ATM Key Management System  A98-D - Direct Module with Multivendor Middleware Support The A98-Direct Module allows the A98 Remote Key module to talk directly to the ATM during a terminal master key remote key exchange.

                    Low-power, wide-area networks (LPWAN) are opening up new opportunities and connectivity options for applications that require low-power consumption and low bandwidth. Industries like smart cities and logistics have seen remarkable innovations in this area in the last few years. At the same time, the massive growth in connected devices increases the risk of cyberattacks.
                












                    Experts expect to see LPWAN connections rise to a total of 848 million in 2020 in 5 key application areas. G+D Mobile Security protects both LPWAN and LoRaWAN™ – Long Range Wide Area Network are a leading LPWAN technology – with end-to-end IoT security solutions – from onboarding, secure key provisioning, identification, and data transmission to device lifecycle management.

Trusted Security Solutions A98: Key Management with SafeNet ProtectServerThe A98™ system incorporates patented technology for establishing initial ATM keys in a manner that is compliant with all applicable industry standards and network operating rules, including Triple-DES requirements. The A98-R automates both the generation and distribution of cryptographic keys for ATMs and is compatible with ATMs that use RSA-enabled encrypting pin-pads (EPPs). The A98-R delivers random master keys in full compliance with the latest ANSI standards (X9.24 Part 2), TR-39 Section 5, and with all known network mandates for Triple-DES and unique keys per ATM. To provide additional security, including protecting digital keys, Trusted Security Solutions brings in SafeNet Luna PCI-E HSM. SafeNet Luna PCI-E protects cryptographic keys and accelerates sensitive cryptographic operations across a wide range of security applications. As a FIPS 140-2 validated, tamper-proof hardware security module, Luna PCI-E provides top security at the utmost level required by ATM machines.
