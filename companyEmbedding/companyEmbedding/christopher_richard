Along with computer software knowledge, I also have an in-depth knowledge of most shop tools, including milling machines and lathes. As well as 3D printers, CNC and laser cutters. With that I have worked with fabrics, aluminum, stainless steel, fiberglass, foam, wood and plastics.

Ideology:
	Well-designed products enrich our lives by interacting and moving with the life of the user. The ideal product heightens the users’ experience, not only creating satisfaction in their look and feel but also bringing enjoyment with use. It comes down to how the user works, enjoys, and finds meaning in a product. I deconstruct these complex issues with Solidworks to visually prototype ideas generated from research in the field. I create designs that push the boundaries and identify key elements at the heart of the user experience; what a product does for the user and how it can solve a current or an unknown problem depends on the culmination of solutions to all the little problems that create the best possible solution.

Brandon 60


The Brandon 60; a new approach to life on the water. 

Today, we use boats to go on adventures, going to new places, seeing new cultures, being with friends and family, and escaping the complexities of our everyday lives. New technologies have made this experience enjoyable, but as we find cheaper ways to enjoy this experience quality and design fail. I look to resolve these issues of poorly designed elements and bring the boating experience back to the quality it once was while introducing new technology that furthers the abilities of sailors.

Renderings Samples














Becker Enterprises Inc. (Boat Rebuild)


This is a 30 foot Ericsson that the owner was working on for several years then decided to bring it to our shop for completion. We ended up removing everything that the owner had installed and started from scratch. Re-working the structure of the hull and installing new bulkheads throughout. These images are of progress made over the year or so of construction. From glass, metal, plastic work to cabinetry. Everything is custom. Everything is hand built.

Fiberglass Repair


The fiberglass had cracked between the mahogany and glass work, allowing water to ingress and cause dry rot. I removed the crack, filling it with glass, faired it then painted to match the original color around the repair. These are select images from the repair.

Hull Repair


Vessel collided with a dock and punctured a hole through the hull. I repaired the hull, matching the interior gel coat and exterior gel coat, then applied new lettering to the exterior.

Sailboat Cup Holder


Designed for a custom sailboat, this aluminum part connects the steering pedestal, bail and a folding table together while allowing for an umbrella to be placed on top. The part was made from 6061 aluminum and handles the load of a person standing on it to reach the boom and mainsail. 

Vessel is still being built. Final photos to be posted on completion.
