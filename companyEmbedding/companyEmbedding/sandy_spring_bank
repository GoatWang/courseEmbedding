Current operations[edit]
The company operates the following subsidiaries:[2]

Sandy Spring Bank - a community bank serving the Washington metropolitan area. It operates 44 branches and 6 financial centers.[2]


Sandy Spring Insurance Corporation - offers commercial and personal lines of insurance as well as surety bonds, workers compensation insurance, and professional liability insurance protection.


West Financial Services, Inc. - offers financial planning, wealth management, and asset management for high-net-worth individuals, businesses, and associations.

History[edit]
In 1868, farmers who were Quakers founded Sandy Spring Bank in order to pool their savings to make home loans to people living nearby.[3]
In December 2001, Sandy Spring Bank acquired Chesapeake Insurance Group of Annapolis. Originally founded as Hartman Agency in Baltimore in 1943, the new subsidiary was renamed Sandy Spring Insurance Corp.[4][5]
In February 2007, Sandy Spring Bank acquired Potomac Bank of Virginia for $64.7 million.[6][7]
In June 2007, Sandy Spring Bank acquired County National Bank of Glen Burnie for $44.1 million.[8][9]
During the financial crisis of 2007–2008, Sandy Spring Bank removed many troubled commercial and residential loans from its balance sheet. The company received an investment of $82 million from the Troubled Asset Relief Program and the amount was repaid in December 2010, making Sandy Spring one of the first community banks in the Washington metropolitan area to repay its TARP investment.[10]
In January 2009, Daniel J. Schrider was promoted to chief executive officer, succeeding Hunter R. Hollar. Schrider joined the company as a lender in 1989.[11]
In May 2012, Sandy Spring Bank acquired CommerceFirst Bank of Annapolis for $25.4 million.[12][13]
In February 2016, the bank opened its first branch in the District of Columbia.[14][15]
In 2017, Sandy Spring acquired WashingtonFirst Bank for $489 million, creating the largest community bank headquartered in the Washington metropolitan area.[16]

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
