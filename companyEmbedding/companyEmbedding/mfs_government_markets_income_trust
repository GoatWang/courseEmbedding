US Federal Contractor Registration: SAM Registration | SAM.gov






























 





Call the SAM Registration Help Desk: 1-877-252-2700MenuRegister SAMOnline SAM RegistrationSystem for Award Management Registration, Renewal & MigrationNew RegistrationRenew RegistrationFull Service SAM RegistrationUS Federal Contractor Registration is a third-party registration firm who charges to complete a Full Service System for Award Management (SAM) Registration. Our service includes a dedicated case manager to physically process the SAM paperwork on the client’s behalf. The Government offers free registration forms at SAM.gov, but SAM will not physically process the forms for a client. All fees paid to US Federal Contractor Registration are for the filing of government paperwork on a client’s behalf, saving the entity time and ensuring complete and accurate filings.Search for ContractsBrowse fresh Government Contracts for your companyFind Your SAM RegistrationLook up your SAM Registration by DUNS, CAGE, or Business NameSimplified Acquistion ProgramAn easier federal buying process designed for small businessesDoes Your Business Qualify for Government Contracting?Learn More
Why Register

The federal government purchases products and services from just about every industry, from space ship parts to staplers, but in order to do business with the federal government, you must have an active SAM registration. The government makes the registration forms available for free, but completing the SAM Registration on your own can take between 20 and 40 hours — and, making sure your Registration is current and complete can take even longer. In 2016, the General Services Administration (GSA) made 77 client-facing enhancements and changes to the System for Award Management (SAM), including seven revisions to FAR subpart 4,18, FAR 52.204-17, FAR 52.204-3, and FAR 52.212-3. These changes affected the type of information a company must submit when completing a SAM Registration. For companies with current SAM Registrations at the time these regulation changes went into effect, the SAM Registration had to be updated to remain in compliance. The GSA also made an estimated 500 changes to Schedules in place during 2016, and we made sure that our clients with affected Schedules remained in compliance with these changes.
Simplified Acquisition Program

Our Simplified Acquisition Program helps get your products and/or services in front of the right government buyers and build your government brand. It is designed to help small and large businesses acquire no-bid contracts between $3,500 and $150,000. The better your business is marketed, and the better your name recognition, the more likely a government buyer will remember your name when reviewing bids. USFCR will qualify your business for the program to determine if is is an option for your business.

Advanced Federal Procurement Data Search

Our proprietary, state-of-the-art Advanced Federal Procurement Data Search (AFPDS) makes available in one place information about available opportunities in real time. Using our data search gives you information BEFORE the information is available elsewhere. Set up bid alert notifications to alert you each time a solicitation is posted for which you’re qualified to bid. Review the history of that specific opportunity, including when it was last offered and the company who won it. And identify the key buyers in your industry and how to best contact them. No other product gives you all of this information in one place. Our technology product will set you apart from your competition and give you a chance to thoroughly research and put together a competitive bid before your competition even knows that the opportunity is available.

About US Federal Contractor Registration

US Federal Contractor Registration is the world’s largest third-party registration firm. It helps business owners register to do business with the federal government; is a platinum rated D&B rated company; and has completed more than 65,000 federal registrations for federal contractors, nonprofits, state and local agencies, and even for the U.S. government.
The government won’t help you complete the registration, and it won’t tell you when you’ve submitted incorrect information. A business that submits incomplete or incorrect registration information can’t do business with the federal government until the information is complete and/or correct. US Federal Contractor Registration, the world’s largest third-party registration firm, can do it for you. It also can handle your mandatory SAM Registration renewal each year, enroll you in its Simplified Acquisition Program, make sure you’re qualified for all applicable set-asides, train you on submitting bids, and so much more. For more information, call a case manager today at 877-252-2700 ext. 1.

Simplified Acquisition Program™ - US Federal Contractor Registration, Inc.
































 





Call the SAM Registration Help Desk: 1-877-252-2700MenuRegister SAMSimplified Acquisition Program™Think you need help getting the attention of a procurement officer? You’re not alone. Thousands of businesses have used the US Federal Contractor Registration Simplified Acquisition Program™ to create a foothold in the federal marketplace.
The Simplified Acquisition Program is a program offered only by US Federal Contractor Registration. It is designed to help small businesses still in the dark about government contracting and help get them on the path to winning federal contracts.
This program streamlines the SAM registration process and gives enrolled members a government-branded website complete with business references, past performance, testimonials, business pictures, and more. It also includes registration in the SAM, if a business is not yet registered with it.
The Simplified Acquisition Program helps businesses more easily reach procurement officers. Having a government-branded website helps inform government buyers of your capabilities, and some purchasing officers may even require it. Often, government buyers must perform market research before awarding a contract for products or services. Having your information easily available gives you a leg up on the competition.
We develop a government-branded website for you, complete with branded domain name, web hosting, unlimited updates (for the first year), search engine optimization, and Google Places set up. Your site will be mobile ready and compatible with all iOS and Android devices.
You also get a complete government business plan designed to provide your business direct access to buyers and prime vendors in your industry. We add your business to the federal government search database, send you a monthly e-mail of bids and solicitations for which you may be eligible, and provide a year of contract support. We create a business plan (including a list of procurement officers who buy the goods and/or services your business supplies) and a SBA resume for you.

Woman Owned Small Business Registration (WOSB/EDWOSB) - US Federal Contractor Registration, Inc.





























 





Call the SAM Registration Help Desk: 1-877-252-2700MenuRegister SAMWoman Owned Small Business Registration (WOSB/EDWOSB)
The Woman Owned Small Business Program (WOSB) is designed to authorize government contracting officers to set aside certain requirements for competition solely amongst WOSBs or economically disadvantaged women-owned small businesses (EDWOSBs). The main difference between these types of businesses is that EDWOSBs are owned by economically disadvantaged women. The Small Business Administration defines “economic disadvantage” as having a personal net worth of less than $750,000, adjusted gross yearly income averaged over the three years not exceeding $350,000, and the fair market value of all assets not exceeding $6 million. Businesses certified as EDWOSBs qualify for extra funding and may be selected in smaller set-aside solicitations pools than businesses certified as WOSBs. Contracting officers must meet annual contracting goals by specifically limiting or setting aside certain solicitations for WOSBs or EDWOSBs.
According to the Small Business Administration (SBA), the federal government must award 5% (roughly $25 billion) of its prime and subcontract dollars to WOSBs/EDWOSBs. In 2012, a little over $9 billion was awarded to WOSBs over nearly 180,000 federal actions. Due to the newly signed National Defense Authorization Act of 2013, WOSBs now have uncapped contracting potential allowing contracting officers to award contracting dollars above the original Small Business Act limitations. These uncapped contracts are valid to any and all WOSBs and EDWOSBs that are currently registered in System for Award Management (SAM).
