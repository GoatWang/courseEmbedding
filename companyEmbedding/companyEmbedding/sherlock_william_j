Bill is a 38-year veteran of the hospitality and gaming industries. From 1997 to 2006, he was the chief operating officer and chief executive officer of Foxwoods Resort & Casino, owned by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribe. Currently, Bill serves on the board of the Foxwoods Development Company, as well as Nevada Gold Casinos (NYSE:UWN), and works as a gaming consultant.
As COO and CEO of Foxwoods, working directly with the Tribal Council, Bill developed and implemented capital budgets, revenue and expense forecasts, and annual marketing plans. He assembled, managed and directed the entire Foxwoods executive team.  During his tenure as CEO, Bill increased Foxwoods’ gaming and non-gaming revenues from $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion.  While growing the casino’s top and bottom lines, Bill reduced staffing by 450, increased efficiency, and implemented many organizational and structural changes.
For 15 years prior to joining Foxwoods, Bill was a CEO at various high-profile casino/hotel properties, including New York, New York Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Flamingo Laughlin, Flamingo Reno and the former Reno Hilton Casino.                        Bill played an integral management role in the transition of the Bally's Hotel & Casino to the Reno Hilton Casino.  This transition experience was the key to his successful management of the opening of New York, New York in Las Vegas. There, he delivered the second best rate of return in Las Vegas strip casino history.
Bill’s career in the hospitality business began with Hilton Hotels Corporation in 1973, first in finance, then in hotel management. His gaming career began in 1988 when he was named the vice president and general manager of the Flamingo in Las Vegas.
Bill earned his Business Administration degree from the University of South Carolina.
