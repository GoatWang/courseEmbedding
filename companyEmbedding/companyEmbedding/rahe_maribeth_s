Maribeth Rahe
 
by Marcy Lisle





 When you run one of the Tristate’s largest money management firms, what’s the first thing you think of each day?
"We control our destinies," says Maribeth S. Rahe, president and chief executive officer of Fort Washington Investment Advisors, a member of Western & Southern Financial Group. "I wake up every morning and I remind myself of that." 
For Rahe, realizing her destiny has been an exciting journey. She was president and board member of the U.S. Trust Company of New York and served as vice chair of the board of the Harris Bank in Chicago. She worked for J.P. Morgan in New York and London. 
Rahe has been called the first woman to shatter the highest glass ceiling, and in 1997, she was one of five female top executives in the Fortune 500. She has received many accolades—including being featured in Vanity Fair magazine as one of America’s Most Influential Women — and she doesn’t think her sex has ever held her back.
"I know this sounds so Pollyanna, but I honestly have not faced any obstacles as a woman," she says.
Rahe credits her mentor, president of Harris Bank (retired) Donald S. Hunt, for teaching her to be "cognizant of the chair you’re sitting in."
"Maybe I’ve always selected institutions that have wonderful values and culture," she says. "Institutions where I know I’d be very comfortable working."
It began at Bowling Green, where Rahe was a language major. After her father recommended she add a few business courses to her studies, her focus changed. Following a brief stint as a Ph.D. candidate at Ohio State University, she was hired as the first female branch manager trainee for a small savings and loan. That’s where she discovered her passion: financial services. She went on to earn her M.B.A. in international finance from Thunderbird School of Global Management in Arizona. 
"It’s a little bit of luck, a lot of hard work and being in the right place at the right time," she says of her career.
Rahe was brought to Cincinnati in 2003 by John F. Barrett, the chairman of Western and Southern Financial Group, to take over leadership of Fort Washington Investment Advisors. Under Rahe’s guidance, the firm has added a considerable number of clients regionally and nationally. 
She has also worked hard to create a positive work environment.
"We spend a good portion of our lives at work, so work should be a place you like to be everyday," she says.
Throughout her career, she has made it a priority to exhibit strong, compassionate leadership whether in the boardroom or community service.
"I’ve always felt it was very important to be a good role model and to make sure I mentor both men and women. It’s just something you should do as a good leader and a good manager," she says.
Rahe also gives back to the community. She’s a presence on a variety of boards, including The Committee of 200, an organization working to improve opportunities for women business leaders, the Cincinnati Arts Association, the United Way, Xavier University and the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur. She is a life trustee or advisor for many well-known philanthropies.
"My mother taught me it’s important to feel a part of a community," she says. "It adds a great deal of dimension to our lives."

This is a partial transcript from Your World with Neil Cavuto, June 24, 2002, that was edited for clarity. Click here for complete access to all of Neil Cavuto's CEO interviews.
Watch Your World w/Cavuto weekdays at 4 p.m. and 1 a.m. ET.
NEIL CAVUTO, HOST: But it seems no one trusts corporate America these days, even the wealthy. Sound a little surprising? Well, think about it. A lot of those rich folks are the very ones who hold top jobs in the corporate world. So, who better than they to know what's going on the corporate world. Results of the U.S. Trust Survey of affluent Americans out today, and some disturbing trends.
Joining us now from Fox central with details on this is the president of U.S. Trust, Maribeth Rahe. Miss Rahe, thanks for joining us. 
MARIBETH RAHE, PRESIDENT, U.S. TRUST: Thank you for inviting us. 
CAVUTO: So, in a nutshell, the rich are bummed out, right?
RAHE: Well, in a nutshell, one of the things that we learned in this survey that was very significant is that they have very grave concerns about what is going on in the economy. In fact, we asked them consistently about their worries and concerns. And two of the five concerns that they registered this year have to do with the world economy and the impact.
CAVUTO: All right. What is amazing is the overwhelming majority of whom say they don't even trust the information that they get and that they should be tired of regulation regarding financial disclosure. I think close to nine out of 10 of them feel that way. Odd.
RAHE: Neil, you are correct; 85 percent said that they feel that there should be tighter regulation on financial disclosures by public corporations. Over 70 percent indicated that they aren't sure that they can rely on the corporate financial statements that are being presented. 
Over 70 percent also said the same thing about their concerns about the stock market and corporate management. Sixty-six percent, in fact, said that they couldn't trust corporate management. And I think it was 58 percent that indicated that they had concerns about corporate auditors, independent corporate auditors.
CAVUTO: But here is what is interesting, Miss Rahe. A lot of these guys are corporate management. What is the criteria to be in this survey, $300,000 or more of income or a net worth in excess of $3.5 million. So I would imagine a good many of these guys, women, are in management, right? 
RAHE: Interestingly, I think the respondents are about maybe 30 percent corporate executives. 
CAVUTO: So they hate themselves. 
RAHE: Forty-one percent actually earned their income through the corporate employment, but it's only about 30 percent. The majority of the rest of the respondents actually are retired or in private business or in a profession.
CAVUTO: Now, what's interesting about this, and I'll leave it on this note here, it seems that if these are the folks who are saying, no mas, we have had it, we do not trust anyone, they are not putting the money in, then that is a very important barometer for this market, is it not? 
RAHE: Interesting, they are, in fact, still invested in the market; 70 percent of the respondents indicated that they are either holding their position, 52 percent, and 18 percent actually saw this as a buying opportunity. 
CAVUTO: But I would assume with 18 percent did, you know, 82 percent either did not or were just sort of mixed? 
RAHE: No, 70 percent actually are staying in the market. So it was about 22 percent that indicated that they were going to a safer investments. 
CAVUTO: All right. So staying in the market does not necessarily mean adding to the market, right, or does it?
RAHE: Staying in the market is, I think, an optimistic sign. 
CAVUTO: OK. Thank you very much. I appreciate, Miss Rahe, joining us in studio.

PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/24/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.
