More on Interfaces
The following is adapted from a MSDN page:

If a class implements two interfaces that contain a member with the same 
   signature, then implementing that member on the class will cause both 
   interfaces to use that member as their implementation. In the following 
   example, all the calls to Paint invoke the same method.

     class Test 
     {
      static void Main()
      {
       SampleClass SC = new SampleClass();
       IControl Ctrl = (IControl) SC;   // Ctrl has access only to members of IControl
       ISurface Srfc = (ISurface) SC;   // Srfc has access only to members of ISurface

       // The following lines all call the same method.
       SC.Paint();
       ctrl.Paint();
       srfc.Paint();
      }
     }

     interface IControl
     {
      void Paint();
     }

     interface ISurface
     {
      void Paint();
     } 

     class SampleClass : IControl, ISurface
     {
      // Both ISurface.Paint and IControl.Paint call this method. 
      public void Paint()
      {
       Console.WriteLine("Paint method in SampleClass");
      }
     }
When this is run, the output is:

     Paint method in SampleClass
     Paint method in SampleClass
     Paint method in SampleClass
If the two interface members do not perform the same function, however, this 
   can lead to an incorrect implementation of one or both of the interfaces. It 
   is possible to implement an interface member explicitly, creating a class 
   member that is only called through the interface, and is specific to that 
   interface. This is accomplished by naming the class member with the name of 
   the interface and a period. For example:


     public class SampleClass : IControl, ISurface
     {
      void IControl.Paint()
      {
       System.Console.WriteLine("IControl.Paint");
      }

      void ISurface.Paint()
      {
       System.Console.WriteLine("ISurface.Paint");
      }
     }
The class member IControl.Paint is only available through the IControl interface, and 
   ISurface.Paint is only available through ISurface. Both method implementations are 
   separate, and neither is available directly on the class. For example:

     // Call the Paint methods from Main.
     SampleClass Obj = new SampleClass();
     //Obj.Paint();  // Compiler error.

     IControl C = (IControl)Obj;        // C has access only to members of IControl  
     C.Paint();  // Calls IControl.Paint on SampleClass.

     ISurface S = (ISurface)Obj;        // S has access only to members of ISurface
     S.Paint(); // Calls ISurface.Paint on SampleClass.
When this is run, the output is:

     IControl.Paint
     ISurface.Paint

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Multiple Inheritance of Interfaces
While C# does not allow multiple inheritance of classes, it does allow this 
   for interfaces.  An interface may have several base interfaces.  An interface 
   inherits all members of its base interfaces, and a class which implements
   must implement all the members of all the interfaces involved.

The following example is adapted from the C# Language Specification.

     interface IControl
     {
      void Print();
     }
     
     interface IIdentify: IControl
     {
      void PrintID();
     }

     interface ITellAll: IControl
     {
      void DumpAll();
     }

     interface IDisclose: IIdentify, ITellAll 
     {
     }
The base interfaces of IDisclose are IControl, IIdentify, and ITellAll.
   In other words, the IDisclose interface above inherits members PrintID
   and DumpAll as well as Print.  (Of course, each of these could have
   other members as well, and they would accumulate.)

If I have classes whose headings are:

     public class ABC : IControl
     
     public class DEF : IIdentify

     public class GHI : ITellAll

     public class JKL : IDisclose
then:

class ABC must implement the Print method
 class DEF must implement the Print and PrintID methods
 class GHI must implement the Print and DumpAll methods
 class JKL must implement the Print, PrintID and DumpAll methods

Streamed live on Oct 1, 2015Read the full GoodCrowdinfo article and watch the interview here: http://bit.ly/1LQ0hi5.iDisclose is a new business providing private placement memorandum (PPM) preparation services through a web-based application for enterprises raising money, especially through (broadly defined) crowdfunding sites. In other words, iDisclose is bringing the offering memorandum into the 21st century.Co-Founder Doug Ellenoff is one of the industry’s leading legal voices. The iDisclose platform is designed for all the different players in the entrepreneurial capital raising marketplace: the entrepreneurs or issuers, the investors, the platforms and the lawyers.Doug explains, “iDisclose places the job of disclosure back into the hands of the entrepreneur (who is in the best position to provide all of the necessary details). Rather than provide un-contextualized information about a business to a lawyer, and then relying on the lawyer to prepare the first draft, the entrepreneur responds to an interactive online dialogue to identify the relevant disclosure issues and organizes the information into a legal document that requires limited attorney review.”Of course, investors are the consumers of the product. Doug notes that if investors are reviewing multiple PPMs, the standardized format provides investors with easier “apples to apples comparison.”For the platforms, he says, “iDisclose allows platforms to offer a value-added service to their users and standardizes the disclosure format across the entire platform. This allows the platform to create a vibrant marketplace of lowering the cost of capital for businesses, reducing risks to investors, and protecting the businesses seeking capital.”Finally, Doug says, the lawyers have an easier time of it as well, allowing them to spend more time providing valuable legal advice and review and less time with tedious drafting.

Companies can now use the KoreConX system to "make their own counsel" according to iDisclose, and save thousands in fees.KoreConX and iDisclose are working together to minimize the cost and the burden of raising capital, so companies don't spend all their money raising money.iDisclose is an online application that helps you prepare the legal documents you need to crowdfund your company. Like Turbo Tax, you simply fill out an adaptive questionnaire and iDisclose builds the legal document. After a quick legal review (which iDisclose or your own attorney can provide), you can simply click "file now" to file the documents with the SEC and begin raising money. iDisclose helps you raise money for a fraction of the time and cost of hiring and attorney, so you can get back to your business. Check them out at iDisclose.com.iDisclose founders Georgia Quinn and Douglas Ellenoff are recognized as experts in compliance and equity crowdfunding, and KoreConX is pleased to be partnered with the iDisclose thought leaders to make compliance and due diligence both easier and more rigorous, allowing companies to complete a risk factor analysis, full Private Placement Memorandum, or Title III Crowdfunding Form C using the KoreConX platform."We founded iDisclose with the goal of reducing legal fees and the cost of compliance for entrepreneurs and companies, and empowering them. Our partnership with KoreConX helps further this goal by making the process of preparing to raise money seamless and easier for companies," said Georgia Quinn."We're working to tie together all of the members of the equity crowdfunding ecosystem to ensure that companies can access capital with ease and at low cost, and our partnership with Fintech Legal industry leader iDisclose means that companies can complete the legal documents required with no pain," said Oscar Jofre, KoreConX founder, President, and CEO.About iDiscloseWith the passage of the JOBS Act and the many new avenues for accessing capital, such as crowdfunding (including Title III crowdfunding) and other online platforms, disclosure is more important than ever. iDisclose helps protect the company raising money, and those assisting with the offering, against investor suits and SEC actions and provides the necessary information to investors. iDisclose allows business owners to "make their own counsel", saving them thousands of dollars in fees as they draft their own, highly-accurate and comprehensive PPM and Form C documents in collaboration with their own team and attorney.About KoreConXKoreConX is a free all-in-one solution that helps companies navigate the process of raising equity capital, and simplifies shareholder communications to reduce risk. The KoreConX eco-system empowers stakeholders (regulated crowdfunding portals, shareholders, board directors, CEO, CFO, corporate secretary, lawyers, auditors, investor relations, members and 3rd party providers) to manage corporate information from a Single Point of Entry within a secure, hosted application that results in efficient and transparent corporate governance.

Funding portals committed to compliance are choosing iDisclose as a low cost high quality legal solution. Condensing the 686 pages of SEC rules in Regulation Crowdfunding into one streamlined application was no small feat, but it was essential to iDisclose to assist entrepreneurs through the regulatory process and ensure funding platforms comply with the new regulations. iDisclose is looking forward to working with Republic.co, the new AngelList spin-off currently making its way through the SEC and FINRA application process; Funding Wonder, a Title III platform candidate with a unique focus on small business loans and SeedInvest, an experienced Title II and Title IV platform now entering the retail crowdfunding space.Former Chief of the Office of Small Business Policy at the SEC, securities regulation consultant and iDisclose advisory board member Gerald Laporte said, "as excited as we are for the launch of investment Crowdfunding and the promise that it holds for entrepreneurs to more efficiently raise capital online, as a securities lawyer, I am mindful of the required securities disclosure that is not only required by the new rules but the practical need to properly advise potential investors both as to the opportunity and all of the risks, that is where iDisclose comes in."Co-founder and CEO Georgia Quinn stated that "at iDisclose, we are empowering entrepreneurs to actually comply with the lengthy and detailed regulations set forth by Regulation Crowdfunding. We, like this new industry, are an example of how technology can overcome traditional challenges faced by small and startup businesses when it comes to raising money. I love what we are doing because we protect both the issuer and the investor -- there are no losers here."Co-founder and CEO of Republic and AngelList alum Kendrick Nguyen said, "few people understand this space better than Georgia. Republic's collaboration with iDisclose has been important to our development of a product that meets regulatory best practices and is also manageable and affordable to issuers."Funding Wonder co-founder and CEO Michael Mildenberger stated, "Title III offers an exciting new way for small businesses to secure debt financing from non-accredited investors but the process must be as frictionless as possible. iDisclose is our secret sauce to easily and efficiently generate required documentation."iDisclose has also partnered with Priori Legal and Legal Hero, two leading on-demand curated legal marketplaces, to allow users to purchase an "attorney upgrade" and work with an experienced attorney to help them through the process and provide a final legal review. The use of these two providers also ensures an ultimately scalable solution as the industry grows. All services are at transparent flat rates, so entrepreneurs know what to expect and can budget accordingly. iDisclose provides an end to end legal solution, including the attorney upgrade, for businesses conducting a Title III crowdfunding for $3,500 or less."There's so much excitement among entrepreneurs about these new regulations," said Legal Hero's co-founder and CEO Annie Webber. "Crowdfunding is a great way to raise funds but it is not foolproof and the legal issues are complicated. iDisclose has created a product that will absolutely be the leader in the market and we're thrilled to be a partner.""We're pleased to partner with another New York-based legal tech company," said Parsa Pezeshki, Priori Legal's Head of Business Development and Market Strategy. "This is an advantageous opportunity for all parties involved: entrepreneurs, crowdfunding portals, iDisclose, and for us, at Priori Legal, where we're excited to be sharing access to our pre-vetted platform attorneys at exceptional price-points."Tom Glocer, former CEO of Thomson Reuters, founder and managing partner of Angelic Ventures, LP and advisory board member of iDisclose explained that, "the introduction of the new crowdfunding rules has created a unique opportunity for early stage growth companies to tap the capital markets. iDisclose allows issuers and their advisors to automate much of this process and I can't think of a better way to balance legal compliance with a cost-effective and streamlined process that will appeal to tech-enabled issuers."Read MoreiDisclose's Form C application is being released contemporaneously with the May 16th effectiveness in the U.S. of the SEC's new Title III Regulation Crowdfunding rules and is available at idisclose.com or through its partner funding portals."Equity crowdfunding has the potential to become the standard way that early-stage startups and small businesses raise capital, but only with the development of scalable tools that continue to bring down the cost and complexity," said SeedInvest CEO Ryan Feit. "At the end of the day, speed and simplicity is what will drive entrepreneurs to utilize equity crowdfunding over slower, more traditional avenues for raising capital."Built by some of the brightest minds in securities law, iDisclose fuses cutting-edge technology with legal know-how to significantly reduce the time, money and effort traditionally exerted on the disclosure process."We join in celebration with the entire new securities-based Crowdfunding industry as the U.S. welcomes the opening to all investors the opportunity to invest in exciting new and established private companies this May 16" said Douglas Ellenoff, Co-Founder and Chairman of iDisclose and founder of New York law firm Ellenoff, Grossman & Schole.In September, iDisclose announced its first application release for the comprehensive use in creating a full private placement memorandum (PPM) for offerings under Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933 and has partnerships with Title II funding platforms such as RealtyXE and Sprowtt.com.In addition to entering into agreements with funding platforms, iDisclose has also released a white label solution for lawyers and law firms to offer both the PPM and the Form C application to their clients.iDisclose puts the job of disclosure back into the hands of the entrepreneur, eliminating the inefficiencies of the traditional method and substantial time to comply with the rules and saving thousands of dollars as well. Rather than provide un-contextualized information about a business to a lawyer, and then relying on the lawyer to prepare the first draft, the entrepreneur responds to an online dialogue to draw out the relevant disclosure issues and the platform organizes the information into a legal document. Throughout the entire process, the entrepreneur is able to collaborate with their own team and attorney as needed, and to send their attorney their document drafts for final review and sign-off.iDisclose also generates a Red Flag report of key issues that must be addressed, which can also be shared with an attorney for further advice and counsel. In addition, the platform creates a list of Risks Factors that are seamlessly organized within the document for easy review by investors. Target groups that benefit from iDisclose include: For Businesses: The platform allows you to create your own legal documents at a reduced time and cost. For Investors: iDisclose provides fulsome disclosure in an easy to evaluate format.  For Fundraising Platforms: iDisclose allows platforms to offer a value-added service to their users and standardizes the disclosure format across the entire platform.  For Lawyers: It eliminates much of the drafting drudgery required with the disclosure process, and allows lawyers to focus on the true aspects of being a lawyer (offering real legal counsel, guidance and reviews).iDisclose was developed by Douglas Ellenoff and Georgia Quinn of Ellenoff, Grossman & Schole, who are both award-winning, NY-based corporate attorneys and globally-recognized figures in the alternative finance space. Having both facilitated hundreds of corporate financings over the course of their careers, the founders harness a deep understanding of the disclosure process, as well as the issues businesses face when raising capital.Image Available: http://www.marketwire.com/library/MwGo/2016/5/13/11G098163/Images/iDisclose_CEO-d185f8748aa49cee8e7f8a2346dd222c.jpgReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read Next200-sq-ft downtown Vancouver apartment listed for $1,450 a monthYahoo Finance Canada3 Must-Own Stocks in 2017Banyan HillSponsoredTim Hortons announces ‘slight’ price increase from August 2Yahoo Finance CanadaFast food chains are coping with their labor cost problemYahoo FinancePearson ground crew workers reject offer, begin strikeThe Canadian PressDiscover it: 4.8 out of 5 avg. by 24K+ customersDiscover CardSponsoredCanada May Walk Away From Trump’s NAFTA Talks Over A Single IssueHuffPost CAIn China, scientists want to turn plastic into fuelCNBCWoman gets surprising email from boss after taking time off for mental healthThis Cabinet Company Is Saving Homeowners $1000'sCliqStudiosSponsoredWhat a $1 million home looks like in Canada this week - Jul. 27 editionSri Lanka, China sign long-delayed $1.5 billion port dealThe Canadian PressU.S. sanctions on Venezuela create short-term gains for Canadian oil producersYahoo Finance CanadaSwitch and save!Progressive InsuranceSponsoredThis is who really loses out when Justin Bieber cancels a showHow our moat ratings have performed

iDisclose Launches a Free “SEC Scrubber” Tool for Crowdfunding Issuers








iDisclose Announces Free Online Tool to Conform Documents to SEC Acceptable Format

NEW YORK, NY–(Marketwired – August 17, 2016) – iDisclose announced today that it is offering a free online service to help issuers and their counsel submit the required crowdfunding documents to the Securities and Exchange Commission.
iDisclose CEO Georgia Quinn explained that “we have noticed a lot of people are having trouble uploading the required documents to the SEC’s online system known as EDGAR. This is due to the finicky nature of the system and somewhat archaic technology it uses. Several issuers’ uploads were getting bounced and the error messages were indecipherable.”
Many times, documents are bounced when people attempt to upload them to the SEC’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system or “EDGAR” system because the actual file does not meet certain technical specifications or contains certain “tags” that EDGAR rejects. iDisclose’s new SEC Scrubber “cleans,” so to speak, the documents of any tags or unacceptable formatting without altering any of the content, so they are able to be filed.
When asked why iDisclose is offering this service for free, Quinn stated, “We are doing this because we believe in the power of crowdfunding and we want to see this industry succeed. This has been a silly stumbling block for hard-working and well prepared issuers, and we want to remove it.”
A beta-version of the SEC Scrubber is being released to the public today and iDisclose is taking comments and feedback to improve the tool in its next release.
iDisclose is an online application that helps entrepreneurs prepare their own legal crowdfunding documents significantly reducing the amount of money paid to attorneys and law firms. iDisclose puts the job of disclosure back into the hands of the entrepreneur, eliminating the inefficiencies of the traditional method, substantially reducing time to comply with the rules and saving thousands of dollars. Rather than provide un-contextualized information about a business to a lawyer, and then relying on the lawyer to prepare the first draft, the entrepreneur responds to an online dialogue to draw out the relevant disclosure issues and the platform organizes the information into a legal document. Throughout the entire process, the entrepreneur is able to collaborate with his or her own team and attorney as needed, and to send their attorney their document drafts for final review and sign-off.
iDisclose also generates a Red Flag report of key issues that must be addressed, which can also be shared with an attorney for further advice and counsel. In addition, the platform creates a list of Risks Factors that are seamlessly organized within the document for easy review by investors.
iDisclose helps:

Businesses: The platform allows you to create your own legal documents at a reduced time and cost.
Investors: iDisclose provides fulsome disclosure in an easy to evaluate format.
Fundraising Platforms: iDisclose allows platforms to offer a value-added service to their users and standardizes the disclosure format across the entire platform.
Lawyers: It eliminates much of the drafting drudgery required with the disclosure process, and allows lawyers to focus on the true aspects of being a lawyer (offering real legal counsel, guidance and reviews).

iDisclose was developed by Douglas Ellenoff and Georgia Quinn of Ellenoff, Grossman & Schole, who are both award-winning, NY-based corporate attorneys and globally-recognized figures in the alternative finance space. Having both facilitated hundreds of corporate financings over the course of their careers, the founders harness a deep understanding of the disclosure process, as well as the issues businesses face when raising capital.
iDisclose Partners With Crowdfund Beat Media on Its Title III Crowdfunding and helps to promote what iDisclose is trying to do, which is assist small businesses, who have historically lacked access, receive the capital they deserve. CrowdFund Beat Media International is an online source of news, information, events and resources for crowdfunding.

iDisclose Teams up With New Regulation Crowdfunding Funding Portals








The Solution Eases the Burden and Helps Entrepreneurs Create and File Their Own Form C Securities Disclosure With the SEC, Which Is Mandated Under the Agency’s New Crowdfunding Rules

 

 
 
 
 
 
 
NEW YORK, NY–(Marketwired – May 13, 2016) – iDisclose, announced today that several of the leading new Title III Crowdfunding funding portals at various stages in the SEC and FINRA approval process will be using iDisclose either on an exclusive basis or as a tool they can offer to assist issuers on their portals. Funding portals committed to compliance are choosing iDisclose as a low cost high quality legal solution. Condensing the 686 pages of SEC rules in Regulation Crowdfunding into one streamlined application was no small feat, but it was essential to iDisclose to assist entrepreneurs through the regulatory process and ensure funding platforms comply with the new regulations. iDisclose is looking forward to working with Republic.co, the new AngelList spin-off currently making its way through the SEC and FINRA application process; Funding Wonder, a Title III platform candidate with a unique focus on small business loans and SeedInvest, an experienced Title II and Title IV platform now entering the retail crowdfunding space.
Former Chief of the Office of Small Business Policy at the SEC, securities regulation consultant and iDisclose advisory board member Gerald Laporte said, “as excited as we are for the launch of investment Crowdfunding and the promise that it holds for entrepreneurs to more efficiently raise capital online, as a securities lawyer, I am mindful of the required securities disclosure that is not only required by the new rules but the practical need to properly advise potential investors both as to the opportunity and all of the risks, that is where iDisclose comes in.”



Co-founder and CEO Georgia Quinn stated that “at iDisclose, we are empowering entrepreneurs to actually comply with the lengthy and detailed regulations set forth by Regulation Crowdfunding. We, like this new industry, are an example of how technology can overcome traditional challenges faced by small and startup businesses when it comes to raising money. I love what we are doing because we protect both the issuer and the investor — there are no losers here.”
Co-founder and CEO of Republic and AngelList alum Kendrick Nguyen said, “few people understand this space better than Georgia. Republic’s collaboration with iDisclose has been important to our development of a product that meets regulatory best practices and is also manageable and affordable to issuers.”
Funding Wonder co-founder and CEO Michael Mildenberger stated, “Title III offers an exciting new way for small businesses to secure debt financing from non-accredited investors but the process must be as frictionless as possible. iDisclose is our secret sauce to easily and efficiently generate required documentation.”
iDisclose has also partnered with Priori Legal and Legal Hero, two leading on-demand curated legal marketplaces, to allow users to purchase an “attorney upgrade” and work with an experienced attorney to help them through the process and provide a final legal review. The use of these two providers also ensures an ultimately scalable solution as the industry grows. All services are at transparent flat rates, so entrepreneurs know what to expect and can budget accordingly. iDisclose provides an end to end legal solution, including the attorney upgrade, for businesses conducting a Title III crowdfunding for $3,500 or less.
“There’s so much excitement among entrepreneurs about these new regulations,” said Legal Hero’s co-founder and CEO Annie Webber. “Crowdfunding is a great way to raise funds but it is not foolproof and the legal issues are complicated. iDisclose has created a product that will absolutely be the leader in the market and we’re thrilled to be a partner.”
“We’re pleased to partner with another New York-based legal tech company,” said Parsa Pezeshki, Priori Legal’s Head of Business Development and Market Strategy. “This is an advantageous opportunity for all parties involved: entrepreneurs, crowdfunding portals, iDisclose, and for us, at Priori Legal, where we’re excited to be sharing access to our pre-vetted platform attorneys at exceptional price-points.”
Tom Glocer, former CEO of Thomson Reuters, founder and managing partner of Angelic Ventures, LP and advisory board member of iDisclose explained that, “the introduction of the new crowdfunding rules has created a unique opportunity for early stage growth companies to tap the capital markets. iDisclose allows issuers and their advisors to automate much of this process and I can’t think of a better way to balance legal compliance with a cost-effective and streamlined process that will appeal to tech-enabled issuers.”
iDisclose’s Form C application is being released contemporaneously with the May 16theffectiveness in the U.S. of the SEC’s new Title III Regulation Crowdfunding rules and is available at idisclose.com or through its partner funding portals.
“Equity crowdfunding has the potential to become the standard way that early-stage startups and small businesses raise capital, but only with the development of scalable tools that continue to bring down the cost and complexity,” said SeedInvest CEO Ryan Feit. “At the end of the day, speed and simplicity is what will drive entrepreneurs to utilize equity crowdfunding over slower, more traditional avenues for raising capital.”
Built by some of the brightest minds in securities law, iDisclose fuses cutting-edge technology with legal know-how to significantly reduce the time, money and effort traditionally exerted on the disclosure process.
“We join in celebration with the entire new securities-based Crowdfunding industry as the U.S. welcomes the opening to all investors the opportunity to invest in exciting new and established private companies this May 16” said Douglas Ellenoff, Co-Founder and Chairman of iDisclose and founder of New York law firm Ellenoff, Grossman & Schole.
In September, iDisclose announced its first application release for the comprehensive use in creating a full private placement memorandum (PPM) for offerings under Regulation D of the Securities Act of 1933 and has partnerships with Title II funding platforms such as RealtyXE and Sprowtt.com.
In addition to entering into agreements with funding platforms, iDisclose has also released a white label solution for lawyers and law firms to offer both the PPM and the Form C application to their clients.
iDisclose puts the job of disclosure back into the hands of the entrepreneur, eliminating the inefficiencies of the traditional method and substantial time to comply with the rules and saving thousands of dollars as well. Rather than provide un-contextualized information about a business to a lawyer, and then relying on the lawyer to prepare the first draft, the entrepreneur responds to an online dialogue to draw out the relevant disclosure issues and the platform organizes the information into a legal document. Throughout the entire process, the entrepreneur is able to collaborate with their own team and attorney as needed, and to send their attorney their document drafts for final review and sign-off.
iDisclose also generates a Red Flag report of key issues that must be addressed, which can also be shared with an attorney for further advice and counsel. In addition, the platform creates a list of Risks Factors that are seamlessly organized within the document for easy review by investors. Target groups that benefit from iDisclose include:

For Businesses: The platform allows you to create your own legal documents at a reduced time and cost.
For Investors: iDisclose provides fulsome disclosure in an easy to evaluate format.
For Fundraising Platforms: iDisclose allows platforms to offer a value-added service to their users and standardizes the disclosure format across the entire platform.
For Lawyers: It eliminates much of the drafting drudgery required with the disclosure process, and allows lawyers to focus on the true aspects of being a lawyer (offering real legal counsel, guidance and reviews).

iDisclose was developed by Douglas Ellenoff and Georgia Quinn of Ellenoff, Grossman & Schole, who are both award-winning, NY-based corporate attorneys and globally-recognized figures in the alternative finance space. Having both facilitated hundreds of corporate financings over the course of their careers, the founders harness a deep understanding of the disclosure process, as well as the issues businesses face when raising capital.
