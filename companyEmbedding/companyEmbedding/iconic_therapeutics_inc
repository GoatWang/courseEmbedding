About OMPhil Percuoco2016-07-10T23:49:14+00:00 
 What is Ocular Melanoma?
Ocular Melanoma (OM), or melanoma of the eye (also called uveal melanoma) is the most common primary eye cancer in adults and the second most common type of melanoma. Like other melanomas, OM begins in melanocytes, the cells that produce the pigment melanin. In the United States, there are approximately 2,000 new cases each year.
OM is a particularly dangerous form of melanoma and accounts for approximately 5–12% of all melanoma cases. Approximately 50% of the ocular melanoma cases will metastasize to other organs. There is currently no known cure for metastatic OM.
Unmet need for treatments
There is an unmet need for OM treatments. Current therapy for OM depends on the size, location and other characteristics of the tumor at the time of diagnosis. Some ocular melanomas require removal of the eye (enucleation); others are treated with radiation. In either case, vision is lost or severely impaired in the affected eye. Evaluation of OM tumors may include genetic testing, which helps physicians predict likelihood of metastasis, but there are no treatment guarantees against OM’s metastatic spread.
Research
Because OM is a rare disease, there has only been a modest amount of research into treatments or cures. One challenge is finding enough OM patients to participate in clinical trials that evaluate new drugs and procedures. The OM community (see links below) provides support to patients with OM and directs them to available resources, including ongoing studies that may lead to new treatments for OM.
For additional information about OM, the following links provide facts and patient and family support services:

 Medical Research into Ocular Melanoma Treatments
Iconic Therapeutics is developing a new investigational drug called ICON-1 aimed at treating patients with OM. The drug is intended to target a specific marker located on the cancer cells and surrounding blood vessels called Tissue Factor (TF) and also potentially activate the body’s immune system to destroy the cancer cells and their blood supply.
Phase 1 Clinical Trial in Patients with Ocular Melanoma
In May 2016, Iconic started a Phase 1 clinical study that will provide important scientific information about how ICON-1 interacts with the affected eye tissues in OM. This study will determine if continued development of ICON-1 as a new OM treatment is warranted. Iconic is now recruiting patients to participate in this study at clinical centers in the United States.
Further information about this trial is available through the US government website
ICONIC OM TRIAL (ID# NCT02771340) where study locations are listed and details of participation are provided. Additional inquiries about the trial may be addressed by contacting 650-437-1000.

Iconic Therapeutics is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to translating scientific insight into breakthrough medicines. Our deep understanding of the role of Tissue Factor (TF) in angiogenesis, inflammation, and metastasis has led us to develop a new approach to retinal disease and cancer. Our lead product candidate, ICON-1, is a novel immune-conjugate fusion protein that works with the body’s immune system to address the root causes of inflammation and angiogenesis together, potentially altering the course of leading causes of blindness.
Iconic has completed a Phase 1 clinical trial in wet AMD and is conducting a Phase 2 study to assess the biologic activity and pharmacodynamic effect in newly diagnosed AMD patients and a Phase 1 study in Ocular Melanoma investigating the ICON family of proteins in cancer and have initiated a research program in solid tumors.
The company’s broad intellectual property portfolio was exclusively licensed from Yale University, one of the first institutions where TF was cloned and characterized.

Laureate Pharma And Iconic Therapeutics Announce Production Of Clinical Material


Laureate Pharma, Inc., a full-service biopharmaceutical development and protein production company specializing in the development and GMP manufacture of monoclonal antibodies, fusion proteins and other therapeutic protein products, and Iconic Therapeutics, a company focused on the development of treatments for wet adult macular degeneration (wet AMD) and other ophthalmic diseases, recently announced the completion of the manufacture of the first GMP lot of hI-con1 recombinant Fc-Factor VII fusion protein.

"We are very excited that Iconic Therapeutics now has material to test this new therapy for patients with macular degeneration and other diseases," said Robert J. Broeze, Ph. D., President & CEO of Laureate Pharma. "This is a testimonial to our strong partnership with Iconic and our expertise in working with fusion proteins." "Due to the unique properties of Iconic's hI-con1 fusion protein product, this project involved very close collaboration between our process-development team at Laureate and Iconic's product-development team," added Michiel E. Ultee, Ph.D., Vice President of Process Sciences.

"With clinical material now in hand, we have moved a giant step forward in our plans for hI-con1. We are excited about its prospects as a novel and powerful approach for the therapy of wet AMD," said Kirk Dornbush, President of Iconic Therapeutics. "We are very pleased with the strong working relationship that we established with Laureate Pharma."
hI-con1 is a recombinant protein intended to specifically attack and destroy pathological blood vessels (PBVs) with no effect on normal blood vessels. Since wet AMD is characterized by the invasion of PBVs into the eye, a drug that destroys these blood vessels could be very useful in treatment of this disease. In addition, hI-con1 is thought to act differently from other wet AMD treatments, which reduce the effects of pathological blood vessel invasion into the eye but do not appear to kill those blood vessels. In studies with mice and pigs, a single injection of hI-con1 into the eye resulted in dramatic reduction of pathological blood vessels.

About Laureate Pharma

Laureate Pharma is a full-service biopharmaceutical contract manufacturing company located in Princeton, NJ. Laureate Pharma offers superior bioprocessing services that accelerate new products from development through production. Laureate provides a wide range of specialized services from process design and development to full-scale cGMP production, purification, aseptic filling, QC testing, validation, analytical services, and regulatory support. Laureate is focused on two active segments of the biopharmaceutical industry: monoclonal antibodies and recombinant protein products. For more information, visit www.laureatepharma.com.
