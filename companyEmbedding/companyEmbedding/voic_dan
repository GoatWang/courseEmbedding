Welcome to the backroom.  Don’t touch anything.

Because despite what you’ve heard, you can keep your current hardware and still get all the advantages of VoIP using software.  Hang on to your legacy routers, gateways, the PBX, even your phones - and let software evolve your telephony to the future of communications.

Our software-based VoIP solution integrates with Active Directory, Microsoft Office, Microsoft Exchange Server, and your PBX.  It gives your company the enterprise instant messaging, VoIP, and conferencing solutions it needs without creating a lot of unnecessary complexity for your IT department.  It's big change, without changing it all.

Take a look around to learn how our software-based VoIP solution can benefit your company.

And if you know Dan Wilson, please stop by and say hello.  Actually, if you don’t know him, visit him anyway -  he’s been sitting on that PBX for a long time.


VoIP SOFTWARE

Software-based VoIP is the next generation of voice communications. And that's a good thing for you and your end users. Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 manages all your real-time communications including: instant messaging (IM), VoIP, audio and video conferencing.  It also powers presence which unites all the contact information in Active Directory with the ways people communicate.  Users will see-at-a-glance if someone is available and contact them with a single click using IM, a phone call or audio/video conference.

Microsoft Office Communicator 2007 integrates with Microsoft Exchange Server and Microsoft Office applications, letting you deliver VoIP, presence, enterprise IM, and web conferencing with your existing PBX.  It provides tools that integrates into whatever applications people are using, at their desks or on the road.  Now users can easily find and connect with one another across different locations and time zones using the communication method that works best for them.

By extending your PBX infrastructure with scalable software-based VoIP, you can enable your platform to adapt to ongoing communications innovations and changing business needs. It's all part of Microsoft’s unified communications solution.

RETURN ON INVESTMENT

Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 delivers new functionality that can improve your business processes and potentially reduce costs.  It’s as simple as the difference between using IM to talk versus a long distance toll call, and that’s just one.

Product Description


Not sure which voice you need? AllPredatorCalls.com has made it easier for you by providing a kit of voices to help you make your choice. Master Voice Sample Reed Kit #002 - 2 each of eight products and 1 reed insertion tool. Includes: 2 LV-002, 2 LV-003, 2 LV-025, 2 MV-025, 2 LVDR-002, 2 LVDR-025, 2 MV-002, 2 Sleeves, 1 Injection Tool.
JC PRODUCT REED INFORMATION:
The JC Product voice systems are made for game calls, used for hunting predatory and non predatory animals. Other applications include noisemakers for professional collage or high school sports teams. Other diverse applications include fail safe air actuated alarms for ICU systems and fire alerts. All of our products are made and assembled in Arizona.
In order to enhance the variations of sound tone and decibels JC Products offers 7 different tapers, 46 styles equaling 322 combinations. Voice units are pre-tuned to exact specifications as indicated below.
Taper ID scaleSV - no added bend or taperMV - .005 increased bend or taperLV - .010 increased bend or taper1V - .020 increased bend or taper2V - .030 increased bend or taper3V - .040 increased bend or taper4V - .050 increased bend or taperReed Thickness .002/.0025/.003/.005/.007/.010Reed materials include stainless, brass and mylar
There are a multitude of factors that will change or manipulate sound.1. Intake air flow across the voice coupled with exhaust or the back pressure are two factors to consider when designing a game call. Measured intake and backpressure cause pitch and tone variation.2. Position or location of the voice within the barrel or mechanism causes differential pressure. Depending on voice location the intake and exhaust pressures are affected.3. Blading a service we offer is a process by which a measured shim is inserted under the reed and then removed causing a permanent lift of the reed and changing the tone.4. A dimpled reed allows for partial separation between reeds on a twin reed voice. It also allows both reeds to play or make sound during actuation.5. Increasing the taper or bend will amplify the range or sound decibel (db) allowing the voice to handle more air movement or pressure.
Mixing the tapers, materials, thickness, blading, intake and backpressure create an unlimited sound range that is only limited to your product development program.
Voice bodies are non-corrosive; the exhaust port O.D. is .200 with a .010 taper for a rigid compression fit.
How to understand or read a complete reed part number: The first group of letters or numbers is the taper ID. The letter DR stands for dimpled reed. The last group or numbers are reed thicknes
