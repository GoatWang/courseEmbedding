About Seafarer Exploration Corp 

 



 
Seafarer Exploration Corporation (“Seafarer”) is a publicly traded (OTCQB: SFRX) underwater salvage and exploration company. The principal business of the company is to engage in the archaeologically-sensitive exploration, documentation, research and recovery of historic shipwrecks with the objective of exploring and discovering Colonial-era shipwrecks for future generations to be able to appreciate and understand. Seafarer currently has two different wreck sites under permit with the State of Florida and one wreck site under contract with a private party and is working closely with the Florida Department of Historical Resources and the Florida Bureau of Archeological Research to research and document these, and additional, wreck sites.

One of the historical shipwreck sites that Seafarer has worked in the past is located off of Juno Beach, Florida. A number of interesting artifacts have been located at this wreck site and based on these finds the Company theorizes and speculates that a Spanish ship from the late 1500s that may have broken up either partially or in its entirety on the site. Exploratory work must still be done to substantiate its country of origin and to determine both the extent of the wreck and whether or not it was carrying valuable cargo. Archaeologists from SFRX are continuing to investigate the archives in Spain, France, and Cuba for further information about this shipwreck.
Seafarer also recently signed an agreement with a private party to explore a purported historic shipwreck site located off of the East Coast of Florida north of the Melbourne area.  This particular wreck site was previously mapped and explored by third parties and the Company believes that there is evidence that there is the possibility that a ship wreck from the late 1600s may be located in this area.
Seafarer is also in the process of researching and vetting additional potential ship wreck sites on the East Coast of Florida that it hopes to potentially explore in the future. Seafarer believes very strongly that the cultural and historical value of these historic shipwrecks is of immense importance historically. The Company is committed to helping future generations to be able to learn about and study these ship wrecks.
It should be noted that the exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks as a business model is speculative and risky, can be physically dangerous, and is expensive and time consuming. Seafarer is attempting to increase the probability of success and to potentially grow shareholder value by increasing the number of quality researched historic shipwreck sites and by recruiting successful proven veterans experienced in the arts of conservation, preservation and research.  Seafarer’s goal is to set the standard in education, conservation, and documentation of historic wreck sites for future generations.

TAMPA, Fla., July 7, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Seafarer Exploration Corp (OTCQB: SFRX), a company focused on archeologically sensitive exploration, research and recovery of historic shipwrecks is pleased to announce that Seafarer's Quest, LLC has successfully been granted a three-year 1A-31 Exploration permit with a Dig and Identify modification for the southernmost area (Area 1) of the Melbourne Beach site from the Florida Bureau of Archeological Research (FBAR).








Kyle Kennedy, CEO of Seafarer, stated, "This permit for Area 1 may be the single most important permit Seafarer has ever received. The extensive exploration we have previously conducted in Area 2, which is on the north side of Area 1, combined with the most recent cesium vapor magnetometer survey we have of Area 1 strongly suggest to us a concentrated amount of hits are in Area 1."
Mr. Kennedy continued, "We will learn valuable insight about the wreck as we work through our prioritized targets over the coming weeks. Based on our combined research, exploration and experience from our archeologists, I feel very optimistic about Area 1, and the primary concentrated area of hits on the survey extends approximately 1,600 feet across. In that target rich area, we have several primary targets of additional concentration which we will explore first."
"I would also like to personally thank Dr. Tim Parsons, State Director, and Dr. Ryan Duggins, Head of Underwater Archeology, for their professional guidance. Without Dr. Parsons' direct involvement over the last six months, our permit for Area 1 might still be in limbo from when we originally made our first application for this site in May of 2014. I feel strongly with Dr. Parsons' integrity and fiduciary commitment to protect the state's assets and strict regulatory compliance, we are in good hands,"  added Mr. Kennedy.
Mr. Kennedy concluded, "Seafarer is continually evolving and growing.  We are continuing to research and pursue opportunities with other sites, both in the U.S. and other countries, and aggressively follow revenue opportunities to help build shareholder value. This permit allows Seafarer to begin excavation immediately in Area 1 of the Melbourne site."
In addition to the new Area 1 permit, the MB514 area is also covered by the following permits.

1A-31 Exploration Permit with a Dig and Identify modification for the MB514 Area 2 that will be renewed in July, 2017. 
Department of the Army Corps of Engineers Permit for the MB514 area, renewed June 29, 2015 for a period of 10 years. 
Florida Department of Environmental Protection Permit for the MB514 area, renewed June 08, 2016 for a period of 2 years.
All work will be conducted under the terms of the 1A-31 Exploration Permit with a Dig and Identify modification issued by the Florida Department of State, Division of Historical Resources, Bureau of Archaeological Research. Seafarer is strongly committed to performing all of the work in an archeologically sensitive matter so as to be respectful of the important historical considerations of the potential shipwreck.
About Seafarer Exploration:

The principal business of the company is to develop the infrastructure necessary to engage in the archaeologically-sensitive research, documentation, exploration and recovery of historic shipwrecks.
