Cardinal Health, Inc. (CAH) Names Michael C. Kaufmann To Lead Medical Segment Of Healthcare Supply Chain Services  











Tweet








2/19/2007 2:12:35 PM



    DUBLIN, Ohio, Feb. 19 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Cardinal Health, the leading provider of products and services supporting the health-care industry, announced today the appointment of Michael C. Kaufmann as group president of its $7-billion Healthcare Supply Chain Services Medical Segment.
    Kaufmann, 45, will be responsible for Cardinal Health's business that distributes medical, surgical and laboratory products from nearly 3,000 manufacturers to hospitals and other care providers in the United States and Canada.  The segment is also a leading manufacturer and distributor of surgical kits used by hospitals and surgery centers worldwide.
    Kaufmann will report to Mark W. Parrish, chief executive officer of the company's Healthcare Supply Chain Services sector.  Kaufmann replaces Thomas M. Slagle, who is leaving Cardinal Health to pursue other interests.
    "At each point in Mike's career with Cardinal Health, he has demonstrated a strong commitment to our customers, while developing the employees on his team and maintaining a disciplined focus on financial results," Parrish said. "Mike's depth of health-care experience and his proven leadership skills will serve us well as we grow this important part of Cardinal Health's business."
    Kaufmann was most recently the chief financial officer (CFO) of Healthcare Supply Chain Services.  He joined the company 16 years ago and has held positions of increasing responsibility in general management and finance, including leading Cardinal Health's pharmaceutical repackaging business, sales and marketing for retail pharmaceutical distribution, and pharmaceutical procurement.  He was instrumental in leading the company's transition to a fee-based model within its pharmaceutical distribution business, leading to improvements in the financial performance of Cardinal Health's largest segment.
    Kaufmann graduated from Ohio Northern University with a degree in accounting and management.  He became a certified public accountant early in his career while employed by Arthur Andersen.  His appointment is effective immediately.
    Linda S. Harty, 46, replaces Kaufmann as executive vice president, Finance and chief financial officer of Healthcare Supply Chain Services.  She has served as treasurer of Cardinal Health since joining the company in January 2005.  Jorge M. Gomez, 39, formerly vice president and assistant treasurer succeeds Harty as the company's senior vice president and treasurer.
