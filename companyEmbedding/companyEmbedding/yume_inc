About Us














The Science Behind Influence™
YuMe is a multi-screen video advertising technology company that is defining the next generation of TV brand advertising. As TV viewing audiences continue to fragment across screens, content types, and different consumer electronic platforms it becomes increasingly hard for a brand to reach their desired audience. YuMe's platform and services simplify the complexity of this fragmentation using embedded software and data sciences. We embed software (our audience-aware YuMe SDK) in applications, video players, and consumer electronics allowing a once video ad creative to run seamlessly across all screens while also collecting data about the audience and context where the ad ran. That data powers our placement quality index (PQI) that finds the best placement to drive attention and campaign performance. We also collect first-party data via our SDKs that enables our data science engine to produce the next generation of digital brand advertising targeting—finding brand receptive audience segments who are most likely to respond to your brand message.
 
We believe that dramatic shifts in consumer viewing behavior are heralding a new era for digital brand advertising—redefining traditional TV brand advertising. By taking the influence and reach of TV and marrying it with the science and accuracy of digital we are building a platform for the next generation of TV brand advertising—The Science Behind Influence™.
 


So Who Are We and How Do We Do That?



Our Background
Jayant Kadambi and Ayyappan Sankaran founded YuMe in 2004 after recognizing that the nascent broadband video sector was going to need a strong ad model and technology platform to generate revenue. Realizing that video is fundamentally different from banners and text, an advertising technology solution that could properly monetize, distribute, traffic and report against digital video was launched in 2007—YuMe. Our first product was a set top box, second a video ad network, and third a platform redefining TV brand advertising.

Our Customers
We sell multi-screen digital video media to TV brand advertisers and their agencies. Our advertising customers also rely on our multi-screen video ad units, analytics and reporting to drive their brand advertising objectives. We sell a video ad management platform to publishers and app developers to help them fully monetize their inventory. They also rely on our multi-screen SDKs to support one TV ad creative across multiple ad unit types and to report valuable audience insights. Finally, we sell a turnkey platform to OEMs and service providers enabling them to build a video advertising media business on their existing hardware infrastructure and services.

Our Products
YuMe is a proven partner for video advertising leadership and innovation. We provide superior brand solutions with data-driven audience insights that increase engagement and sales.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
