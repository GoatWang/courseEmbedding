 Santana IV CD music Product Description

Santana IV album for sale by Santana was released Apr 15, 2016 on the Santana IV label. Two years in the making, Santana IV marks the reunion of almost all members of what was arguably the band's greatest lineup.  Carlos Santana is joined here by Neal Schon, Greg Rolie, Michael Shrieve, Michael Carabello (who all played on Santana III), as well as percussionist Karl Perazza and longtime bassist Benny Rietveld. The first single, "Anywhere You Want to Go," was written by keyboardist/lead vocalist Rolie and displays the band's signature groove-laden Latin blues-rock. Santana IV CD music contains a single disc with 16 songs.   ...See Full Description


 Santana IV buy CD music Product Reviews

Rolling Stone - 3.5 stars out of 5 -- "A standout pleasure is the chance to hear so much of Santana's own tart-treble tone and soloing union of John Coltrane and Mike Bloomfield against this band's blues and salsa, without the distracting crush of celebrity duets."

They haven't skipped a beat!I was looking forward to this CD since I first heard five of the original members were getting back together for this project. Well worth it! From start to finish, it has the classic sound from back in the day. "Yambu," "Anywhere You Want To Go" and "Suenos" are standouts for me. The only thing I didn't get was having Ron Isley on two tracks. I'm still stratching my head on that one!By Gary (AZ, USA)

OK okSomething just seems to be lacking. This a good record, but I wouldn't rank it in the top 10 Santana albums. Good musicianship, fine sound, but it kind of feels formulaic or tired. It's good, not great. Go guitar music, go!By Gregory (Missouri)
