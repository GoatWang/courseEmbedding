To be described after the company issues a press release. Seed stage investment led by General Catalyst. Co-investors alongside Fitz Gate Ventures include Converge Venture Partners and other world class investors.





						Optimal Dynamics					





Founded by Warren Powell ‘77, professor in the Department of Operational Research and Financial Engineering at Princeton University since 1981, Optimal Dynamics' software uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to automate how trucking brokers match loads to carriers and provides carriers with the most accurate load recommendations. With the ability to predict load requirements up to a week in advance with 99% accuracy, Optimal Dynamics is a revolutionary new technology, based on decades of research out of Professor Powell’s Castle Labs at Princeton University. Trucking in the US is a $300B+ industry.
