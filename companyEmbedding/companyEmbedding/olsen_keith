Career[edit]
Olsen was born in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, and went to school in Minneapolis, where he developed an appreciation for classical, pop, and jazz music.[1] He gained production experience working in recording studios in the Minneapolis area, and musical and touring experience playing upright bass in jazz and folk bands.[2] He subsequently played bass as a member of the Music Machine, who had a hit with the single "Talk Talk".[1] During this time he began collaborating with Curt Boettcher,[1] producer of the Association's single "Cherish", and met another early influence, Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys, who taught him "to envision everything about a production as you hear the song the first time."[3]
After moving to Los Angeles he was instrumental in launching the careers of Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks. He helped them to secure a record deal, produced their first album, Buckingham Nicks, and let them live in his house, even employing Nicks as a housekeeper for a while.[3] After introducing them to Mick Fleetwood, he went on to produce Fleetwood Mac's eponymous 1975 album, which reached No. 1 in the US.
Through the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s, Olsen built a legendary reputation as a producer. To date his production work has earned him more than 39 Gold, 24 Platinum, and 14 Multi-Platinum album certifications. Olsen has been front line producer on over 100 complete albums. In addition to Fleetwood Mac, some of the artists he has worked with include the Grateful Dead (he produced and engineered their 1977 album Terrapin Station), Bob Weir, Eddie Money, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Rick Springfield (he produced Springfield's No. 1 hit "Jessie's Girl"), REO Speedwagon, Pat Benatar, Heart, Joe Walsh, Jefferson Starship, Santana, Kim Carnes, Sheila, Jethro Tull, the Babys, Magnum (Goodnight L.A.), Saga, Ozzy Osbourne (No Rest for the Wicked), Scorpions, Bad Company, Europe, 38 Special, Russ Ballard, Sammy Hagar, Whitesnake, Foreigner, Sheena Easton, Steve Perry, Journey, Loverboy, and Lou Gramm. He's also been involved in several movie soundtracks, including Footloose, Vision Quest, Tron, Flashdance and Top Gun.[3]
In 1996, Olsen stepped back a little from artist production to concentrate on developing surround sound music mixes for the Kore Group record label,[1] licensing existing masters, remixing them for surround sound, and re-releasing them. As corporate director of global product development at Mackie Designs, he assembled a team of experts to develop their digital products line.[2][3]
Olsen currently produces several albums per year for Pogologo Productions Group and is a member of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS) Producers and Engineers Wing, the mission of which he strongly believes is necessary in this era of digital revolution.[2] He currently serves on the A&N Committee, the P&E Steering Committee and the P&E Advisory Council.

            Artist Biography
                            by Bruce Eder



Keith Olsen is one of the more prolific and successful music producers of the second half of the 20th century, with over 200 productions to his credit, yielding sales of 110 million copies on single, LP, or CD, 45 Gold (or Platinum) Record Awards, and six Grammy Awards. Born in Sioux Falls, SD, he later moved to Wayzata, MN, when he was 12 years old, and attended school in Minneapolis. He developed a strong interest in music as a boy -- nor was that interest limited to one category or genre; Olsen was as fascinated by classical music as he was by pop and rock music. He took up the bass as an instrument and played with several local bands before he moved to California. He had managed to pick up some experience in recording within the limited facilities available in Minneapolis, but his real introduction to the art of producing came when he met Curt Boettcher, the renowned guitarist/singer-turned-sunshine pop/psychedelic producer. Boettcher was an influence on the younger Olsen, as was his subsequent contact with Brian Wilson. Although Olsen was playing bass in the Music Machine, which enjoyed a huge hit with the single "Talk Talk," he had already set his sights on production as a career goal.                


 
Olsen got a job as an engineer at Sound City Studios in Los Angeles, where his technical and musical knowledge combined to allow him to transcend the typical boundaries of that job. He began recording demos by various L.A.-based bands, including a group called Fritz, that didn't seem to yield much for anyone concerned. Fate took a hand, however, after Fritz broke up, yielding a performing duo consisting of ex-members Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks -- they formed a group called Buckingham Nicks, and recorded a demo with Olsen that the latter helped shop around Los Angeles, getting them a contract with Polydor. Olsen ended up recording their resulting self-titled album, which got buried commercially but received high praise from critics and other musicians -- Buckingham Nicks became a favorite underground phenomenon, and Olsen started to get noticed seriously by other musicians as a young producer worth watching. One who found that advice worth taking was drummer Mick Fleetwood, of Fleetwood Mac, who were generally preparing for the recording of a new album and in the market for a studio and came to Sound City -- while there, he heard the Buckingham Nicks track "Frozen Love" and became interested in the guitarist; in those days, Fleetwood Mac always seemed to be one guitarist short, and he soon discovered that Buckingham and Nicks were a package deal, and, in fact, already preparing to do a second album. Fleetwood began thinking of taking on both of them, along with Olsen as producer for the forthcoming album. And that was precisely what happened. This resulted in the Fleetwood Mac album, a multi-platinum best-seller that moved a career's worth of music and put Olsen on the map as a producer. Over the years that followed, he worked with such top talent as the Grateful Dead, Bob Weir, Eddie Money, Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Rick Springfield, REO Speedwagon, Pat Benatar, Heart, Joe Walsh, Starship, Santana, Kim Carnes, Jethro Tull, The Babys, Ozzy Osbourne, the Scorpions, .38 Special, Bad Company, Sammy Hagar, Russ Ballard, Whitesnake, Foreigner, Sheena Easton, Journey, Loverboy, and Lou Gramm, He also moved into film work during the 1980s, working on the soundtracks to the megahits Footloose and Flashdance, the Disney sci-f/adventure Tron, and the box office smash Top Gun. By the mid-'90s, Olsen had reached the top of his profession as a music producer, and graduated to more of a behind-the-scenes role in the field of audiophile sound engineering, and also going into the field of publishing, including working with the copyrights of Hank Williams, Jr.. He has occasionally worked in television production (most notably in tandem with Stevie Nicks).

Profile Visibility is based on the total number of weekly profile views. It provides a weekly snapshot of
            which profiles users are viewing on martindale.com in the form of a ranking. We do not differentiate in
            the case of a tie, which may mean a number of attorneys in the same city display the same
            ranking. For example, if three lawyers each received 20 profiles views last week in Atlanta, and 20 is the
            highest number of profile views for that week, all three lawyers would receive a #1 ranking.

AV Preeminent®: The highest peer rating standard. This rating signifies that a large number of the lawyer's peers rank him or her at the highest level of professional excellence for their legal knowledge, communication skills and ethical standards.
Distinguished: An excellent rating for a lawyer with some experience. This rating indicates the attorney is widely respected by their peers for high professional achievement and ethical standards.
Notable: This rating indicates that the lawyer has been recognized by a large number of their peers for strong ethical standards.
Lawyers who have received peer reviews after 2009 will display more detailed information, including practice areas, summary ratings, detailed numeric ratings and written feedback (if available). Details for individual reviews received before 2009 are not displayed.
Attorneys that receive reviews from their peers, but not a sufficient number to establish a Martindale-Hubbell Peer Review Rating, will have those reviews display on our websites.

Client Reviews 


About Client Rating
The Martindale-Hubbell® Client Review Ratings™ display reviews submitted by clients of lawyers and law firms.


The Client Review Rating score is determined through aggregation of validated responses. People who submit reviews are clients of law firms who hired a lawyer within the last year, whose matter is not pending and who want to share their experience of that lawyer or law firm with other potential clients. Reviewers can be anyone who hires a lawyer including in-house counsel, corporate executives, small business owners and private individuals.
Martindale-Hubbell validates that the reviewer is a person with a valid email address. As part of the review process, respondents must affirm that they have been a client of the lawyer or law firm identified within the past year, although Martindale-Hubbell cannot confirm the lawyer/client relationship as it is often confidential. The content of the responses are entirely from client reviewers.
Prior results do not guarantee a similar outcome and Martindale-Hubbell accepts no responsibility for the content or accuracy of any review.
For more information on Martindale-Hubbell Client Review Ratings, please visit our Client Review Page.

Omaha, Nebraska Recent Cases Lawyers | Engles, Ketcham, Olson & Keith, P.C. - Your Litigation Solution


































 

	    402-348-0900

Recent Cases

The attorneys at Engles, Ketcham, Olson & Keith have successfully litigated a wide variety of cases for insurance companies, corporations and individuals.One example is the landmark case of Schafersman v. Agland Coop, 631 NW2d 862, (2001), in which our firm prevailed in arguing for Nebraska to adopt the Daubert standard for the admissibility of expert testimony.
In the case of Van Lamb v. Sand Livestock, Dist. Ct. Platte Co. Nebraska, 2003, Dan Ketcham successfully obtained a defense verdict in a product liability suit against the manufacturer of a hog confinement system.
In a recent case in the District Court of Douglas Co. Bert Engles successfully defended a suit brought against the employer of a deliveryman, who had already been convicted of rape. Despite the inflammatory nature of the case the jury returned a low verdict.
In the case of Gombert v. Borders Inc., Dist. Ct. Doug. Co., 2003, Dan Ketcham defended a large retail chain on a premises liability claim. The jury returned a defense verdict.
Steve Olson recently defended a complex 1983 action in federal court. The trial successfully resulted in a defense verdict for Douglas County. Green v. Douglas Co. et al.
Robert Keith recently represented a bridge contractor in a wrongful death trial in York, Nebraska. The decedent died in an automobile accident in a state highway construction zone and suffered over $800,000 in economic damages and $1,000,000 in non-economic damages. The jury returned a defense verdict. Haghighi v. United Contractors.
Robert Keith successfully appealed a Federal District Court for the District of Nebraska’s refusal to grant a government employee qualified immunity against allegations of sexual harassment.  The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the District Court’s decision and found the government employee was entitled to qualified immunity and therefore summary judgment on all claims against him was proper. Crutcher-Sanchez v. County of Dakota, 687 F.3d 979 (8th Cir. 2012).
Robert Keith successfully defended a high speed admitted liability auto negligence case by receiving a favorable verdict on March 6, 2013 after the jury deliberated less than an hour.  Plaintiff’s claimed medical expenses exceeded $21,000 and she asked the jury to return a verdict for $139,000 based on a 10% permanent impairment rating and 41 year life expectancy.  Defendant filed an Offer to Confess Judgment for $20,000.  The jury returned a verdict for $6,002.23, including $5,022.23 in medical expenses the defense asked the jury to award to reimburse Plaintiff for related medical bills.
While most trials are not appealed, the following is a represenative sample of some of the reported cases we have litigated:

Swierczek v. Lynch, 466 NW2d 512 (1991)(medical malpractice)
DeCamp v. Lewis, 435 NW2d 883 (1989) (dental malpractice)
Keuhler v. Galloway et al., 1999 WL 1080640 (1999) (legal malpractice)
American Economy Ins. v. Modern Eyewear,1 994 WL 285086 (1994) (ERISA and theft from pension plan)
