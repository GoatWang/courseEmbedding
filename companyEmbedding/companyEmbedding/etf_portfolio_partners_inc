With the new funding, the firm’s total assets under management (AUM) has reached the $1 Bn mark.This is SAIF Partners’ third India-dedicated fund. In June, it was reported by Inc42 that the firm was looking to close $350 Mn for an India-focussed fund.As per reports, around 15%-20% of the fund will go into backing established public companies. The remaining amount will be invested in early-state and late-stage startups in a variety of domains.The fund is led by General Partner Ravi Adusumalli, along with managing directors Deepak Gaur, Mukul Arora, Vishal Sood, Alok Goel, and CFO Vivek Mathur.Commenting on the development, Deepak Gaur told ET, “It is a conscious choice to cap it at $350 Mn. It allows us the flexibility to do very early stage deals and also larger cheques. The fund will have the same strategy. We will continue to do seed, series-A, growth stage and public-listed. It is flexible. In our last fund, we were not very active in series-B, in terms of cheque sizes above $15 Mn. We are hopeful in this fund we will do much more.”According to MD Alok Goel, the sectors that the India-centric fund will focus on are Internet, healthcare, education, technology, financial services, enterprise SaaS, retail and consumer brands.Goel added, “Earlier, in consumer internet, there were X of Y models, where there was empty space and it was more about grabbing that land. Now we are looking at newer opportunities which are not being done somewhere else. However, the pace will be slower in terms of number of companies.”SAIF Partners: A Narrative In DiversificationWith offices in Bengaluru and Gurugram, SAIF Partners has been investing in the country since 2001. At present, the VC firm specialises in private equity and venture capital in a number of different sectors like IT, information technology enabled services (ITES), industrials, financial services, Internet, consumer product, and mobile. Inc42 Announcement  SAIF Partners’ investment portfolio includes over 60 companies, namely Paytm, Network18, HomeShop18, BookMyShow, etc. In May 2017, online food delivery startup Swiggy raised $80 Mn in a funding round led by SAIF Partners, Naspers and others. In the same month, the VC firm was reportedly looking to make $300 Mn-$400 Mn by partially selling its stake in Paytm to Japanese investment giant SoftBank.  Advertisement  AdvertisementEarlier in February, SAIF Partners exited from its investment in online travel portal MakeMyTrip, taking away a massive 16x return. The firm had previously poured $25 Mn into the startup between 2005 and 2008, in exchange for a 41% stake. During the same period, furniture marketplace Urban Ladder secured $15 Mn in a funding round led by Kalaari Capital, SAIF Partners, and a few other investors.This is the third India-focussed fund that SAIF Partners has raised. In 2011, the firm’s first $350 Mn India-specific fund was launched. Later in March 2015, it raised another $350 Mn from 27 investors.In the last two years, SAIF Partners has witnessed several changes in the upper management. In January 2016, for instance, Mukul Singhal and Rohit Jain, two principals at SAIF Partners, stepped down to set up their own early-stage fund. At the time, it was reported that the fund would be investing about $500K each in 15-20 startups in a year. Before that, in July 2015, former FreeCharge CEO Alok Goel joined the firm as Managing Director.With the newly-raised India-focussed fund, the venture capital firm SAIF Partners looks to further diversify its investment portfolio to include early and late-stage startups in emerging fields such as edtech, healthtech and fintech.(The development was reported by Livemint)Note: We at Inc42 take our ethics very seriously.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

 Our Strategy | ETF Portfolio Partners         


Our Investment StrategyDo you have an investment strategy or just a collection of holdings? The smart way to grow your net worth or provide income during retirement is to find the strategy thats best for you. Our powerful approach can help you stick to your strategy regardless of market conditions.GoalsPersonalized Asset AllocationImplementationSystematic RebalancingGoalsWe all have goals. Whether you want to grow your assets to meet a future goal or you need a portfolio that provides current income, we can help. An appropriate investment goal should be measurable and attainable. Defining your goals clearly and determining how best to achieve them can help protect you from the common mistakes that derail most investors.Personalized Asset AllocationA sound investment strategy starts with a personalized asset allocation designed to meet your unique goals. We use award-winning software to help match your unique goals with the most appropriate portfolio allocation. All of our portfolios are based on Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), a Nobel Prize winning concept, combined with our investment knowledge and experience.ImplementationThe way you implement your asset allocation strategy will be a major determinate of your success. Exchange-traded funds offer investors many advantages when implementing your portfolio. ETFs are designed to track a wide range of asset classes at a very low cost, meaning they will more accurately reflect the true risk and return of your asset allocation plan.Systematic RebalancingEven the most carefully designed portfolios do not run themselves. We continually monitor your portfolio and provide a disciplined rebalancing strategy designed to improve performance while reducing risk. A systematic rebalancing strategy is key because, over time, asset classes move in and out of favor. Todays winning asset class is likely to underperform in the future while todays losers will likely outperform at some point. Systematic rebalancing will capture and correct these imbalances and return your portfolio to its target allocation.Benefits of Our Approach
Cost SavingsFees Matter. The expense ratio of an ETF is only a fraction of the costs associated with most actively managed mutual funds. The average expense ratio of the ETFs we use is 0.15%, compared to the average actively managed mutual fund expense ratio of 1.30%. This means you could save an extra 1.1% per year in operating fees alone.
Index-based PerformanceIndexes are hard to beat. Over the last 5-year period ending in 2015, 84.15% of large-cap managers, 76.69% of mid-cap managers, and 90.13% of small-cap managers lagged their respective benchmarks. We believe in putting the odds in your favor and tracking the indexes, rather than risking it and trying to beat them.
ObjectiveETF Portfolio Partners is a Registered Investment Advisor who is regulated by the SEC and held to a fiduciary standard. As a fiduciary, we are legally required to act in the best interest of our clients at all times. Unlike a brokerage firm who is held to a suitability standard, we do not sell any commission-based products or receive any incentives from any of the products we use.
DisciplineEven the most carefully designed and crafted portfolios do not run themselves. At ETF Portfolio Partners, we follow a disciplined rebalancing methodology designed to capture opportunities during different market cycles.Download Strategic Index Investing BookTo learn more about ETFs, request your complimentary copy of Strategic Index Investing  Unlocking the Power of Exchange-Traded Funds, written by Richard D.
