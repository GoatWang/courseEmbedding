Definition
Accounts Receivable is money owed to a business by customers and shown on its Balance Sheet as an asset.

Explanation
1. Accounts Receivable are created when a customer has received a product but has not yet paid for that product. Days sales outstanding measures of the average number of days that a company takes to collect revenue after a sale has been made. It is a financial ratio that illustrates how well a company's accounts receivables are being managed.
American BriVision Holding Corp's Days Sales Outstanding for the quarter that ended in Mar. 2017 is calculated as:



Days Sales Outstanding


=Account Receivable/Revenue*Days in Period

=0/0*91


=



2. In Ben Grahams calculation of liquidation value, American BriVision Holding Corp's accounts receivable are only considered to be worth 75% of book value:
American BriVision Holding Corp's liquidation value for the quarter that ended in Mar. 2017 is calculated as:



Liquidation value


=Cash and Cash Equivalents-Total Liabilities+(0.75 * Account Receivable)+(0.5 * Inventory)


=0.106-1.029+0.75 * 0+0.5 * 0


=-0.92



* All numbers are in millions except for per share data and ratio. All numbers are in their local exchange's currency.

Be Aware
Net receivables tells us a great deal about the different competitors in the same industry. In competitive industries, some attempt to gain advantage by offering better credit terms, causing increase in sales and receivables.
If company consistently shows lower % Net receivables to gross sales than competitors, then it usually has some kind of competitive advantage which requires further digging.
Average Days Sales Outstanding is a good indicator for measuring a companys sales channel and customers. A company may book great revenue and earnings growth but never receive payment from their customers. This may force a write-off in the future and depress future earnings.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATION  The following discussion provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read along with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Report, and our annual report on Form 10-K for the twelve months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 including the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ significantly from the results, expectations and plans discussed in these forward-looking statements. See "Cautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements."  As used in this Report, the terms "we", "us", "our", and "our Company" and "the Company" refer to American Brivision (Holding) Corporation (formerly known as Metu Brands, Inc.) and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated.  Introduction  Currently, we are a holding company operating through our wholly owned subsidiary, American BriVision Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("BriVision"). BriVision was incorporated in 2015 in the State of Delaware. It is a biotechnology company focused on the development of new drugs and innovative medical devices to fulfill unmet medical needs. Following the Share Exchange (as described herein below), we have abandoned our prior business plan and we are now pursuing BriVision's historical businesses and proposed businesses, which focus on the development of new drugs and innovative medical devices to fulfill unmet medical needs. The business model of the Company is to integrate research achievements from world-famous institutions, conduct clinical trials of translational medicine for Proof of Concept ("POC"), out-license to international pharmaceutical companies, and exploit global markets.  Share Exchange  On February 8, 2016, a Share Exchange Agreement ("Share Exchange Agreement") was entered into by and among American BriVision (Holding) Corporation (the "Company"), BriVision, Euro-Asia Investment & Finance Corp. Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China ("Euro-Asia"), being the owners of record of 52,336,000 shares of common stock of the Company, and the persons listed in Exhibit A thereof (the "BriVision Shareholders"), being the owners of record of all of the issued share capital of BriVision (the "BriVision Stock"). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, upon surrender by the BriVision Shareholders and the cancellation by BriVision of the certificates evidencing the BriVision Stock as registered in the name of each BriVision Shareholder, and pursuant to the registration of the Company in the register of members maintained by BriVision as the new holder of the BriVision Stock and the issuance of the certificates evidencing the aforementioned registration of the BriVision Stock in the name of the Company, the Company issued 52,936,583 shares (the "Acquisition Stock") (subject to adjustment for fractionalized shares as set forth below) of the Company's common stock to the BriVision Shareholders (or their designees), and 51,945,225 shares of the Company's common stock owned by Euro-Asia were cancelled and retired to treasury. The Acquisition Stock collectively represents 79.70% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company immediately after the Closing, in exchange for the BriVision Stock, representing 100% of the issued share capital of BriVision. Because of the exchange of the BriVision Stock for the Acquisition Stock (the "Share Exchange"), BriVision became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and there was a change of control of the Company following the closing. There were no warrants, options or other equity instruments issued in connection with the share exchange agreement.  Because of the consummation of the Share Exchange, BriVision is now our wholly owned subsidiary and its shareholders own approximately 79.70% of our issued and outstanding common stock.  Accounting Treatment of the Merger  For financial reporting purposes, the Share Exchange represents a "reverse merger" rather than a business combination and BriVision is deemed the accounting acquirer in the transaction. The Share Exchange is being accounted for as a reverse-merger and recapitalization. BriVision is the acquirer for financial reporting purposes and the Company is the acquired company. Consequently, the assets and liabilities and the operations that will be reflected in the historical financial statements prior to the Share Exchange will be those of BriVision and will be recorded at the historical cost basis of BriVision, and the consolidated financial statements after completion of the Share Exchange will include the assets and liabilities of the Company and BriVision, and the historical operations of BriVision and operations of the combined entities (American Brivision (Holding) Corporation and its wholly owned subsidiary Brivision) from the closing date of the Share Exchange.  For more information about the Share Exchange, please refer to the current report on Form 8-K we filed on February 12, 2016.  Forward Stock Split  On March 21, 2016, our Board approved an amendment to Articles of Incorporation to effect a forward split at a ratio of 1 to 3:141 and increase the number of our authorized shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, to 360,000,000, which went effective on April 8, 2016. The majority of the shareholders of the Company approved the amendment to Articles of Incorporation.  Collaborative Agreement  On December 29, 2015, American BriVision Corporation entered into a Collaborative Agreement with BioLite Inc., a related party, pursuant to which BioLite granted the Company sole licensing rights for drug and therapeutic use of five products: BLI-1005 CNS-Major Depressive Disorder; BLI-1008 CNS-Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder; BLI-1401-1 Anti-Tumor Combination Therapy-Solid Tumor with Anti-PD-1; BLI-1401-2 Anti-Tumor Combination Therapy-Triple Negative Breast Cancer; and BLI-1501 Hematology-Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia, in USA and Canada. Under the Collaborative Agreement, BriVision should pay a total of $100,000,000 in cash or stock of BriVision with equivalent value, according to the following schedule:  ? upfront payment shall upon the signing of this Collaborative Agreement: 3.5% of total payment. After receiving upfront payment from BriVision, BioLite has to deliver all data to BriVision in one week.  upon the first IND submission, BriVision shall pay, but no later than December 15, 2016: 6.5% of total payment. After receiving second payment from BriVision, BioLite has to deliver IND package to BriVision in one week.  ? at the completion of first phase II clinical trial, BriVision shall pay, but no later than September 15, 2017: 15% of total payment. After receiving third payment from BriVision, BioLite has to deliver phase II clinical study report to BriVision in three months.  ? upon the phase III IND submission, BriVision shall pay, but no later than December 15, 2018: 20% of total payment. After receiving forth payment from BriVision, BioLite has to deliver IND package to BriVision in one week.  ? at the completion of phase III, BriVision shall pay, but no later than September 15, 2019:25% of total payment. After receiving fifth payment from BriVision, BioLite has to deliver phase III clinical study report to BriVision in three months.  ? upon the NDA submission, BriVision shall pay, but no later than December 15, 2020, BriVision shall pay: 30% of total payment. After receiving sixth payment from BriVision, BioLite has to deliver NDA package to BriVision in one week.  Pursuant to the Collaborative Agreement, an upfront payment of $3,500,000 (the "Milestone Payment"), which is 3.5% of total payments due under the Collaborative Agreement, was to be paid by the Company upon signing of that agreement. On May 6, 2016, we and BioLite agreed to amend the Collaborative Agreement, through entry into the Milestone Payment Agreement, whereby we have agreed to pay the Milestone Payment to BioLite $2,600,000 in cash and $900,000 in newly issued shares of our common stock, at the price of $1.60 per share, for an aggregate number of 562,500 shares. The cash payment and shares issuance were completed in June 2016.  Pursuant to the Collaborative Agreement,6.5% of total payment, $6,500,000 shall be made upon the first IND submission which was submitted in March 2016. $6,500,000 was wholly recorded as accounts payable as of December 31, 2016.  This Collaborative Agreement shall, once signed by both Parties, remain in effect for fifteen years as of the first commercial sales of the Product in the Territory and automatically renew for five more years unless either party gives the other party six month written notice of termination prior to the expiration date of the term.  The Company determined to fully expense the entire amount of $3,500,000 since currently the related licensing rights do not have alternative future uses. . According to ASC 730-10-25-1, absent alternative future uses the acquisition of product rights to be used in research and development activities must be charged to research and development expenses immediately. Hence the entire amount is fully expensed as research and there was no commercial sales during the period ended December 31, 2016.  Plan of Operations  BriVision will select potential drug candidates (including but not limited to botanical drugs) from different research institutes, start to develop it from pre-clinical stage (including all CMC process and animal study) to clinical study stage. When the phase II clinical trial is finished and the efficacy is approved, we will have reached the "proof of concept" stage. We plan to out license our drugs to big pharmaceutical companies, coordinate with them to develop and enhance the drugs and exploit global markets.  Revenue Generation  Most of our licensed products are still under development and trial stage.  During the first three months for the period ended December 31, 2016, we have generated $70,000 revenue related to a one-time consulting service.  Research and Development  During the first three months for the period ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we have spent approximately $25,198 and $3,500,000, respectively on research and development.  Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates  We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating this "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation."  Basis of Presentation  The accompanying audited financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). This basis of accounting involves the application of accrual accounting and consequently, revenues and gains are recognized when earned, and expenses and losses are recognized when incurred. The Company's financial statements are expressed in U.S. dollars.  Forward Stock split  On March 21, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an amendment to Articles of Incorporation to affect a forward split at a ratio of 1 to 3:141 and increase the number of our authorized shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, to 360,000,000, which was effective on April 8, 2016. The majority of the shareholders of the Company approved the amendment to Articles of Incorporation. See Note 4 for more details.  Use of Estimates  The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ materially from those results.  Fair Value Measurements  The Company applies the provisions of ASC Subtopic 820-10, "Fair Value Measurements", for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements. ASC 820 also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements.  Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.  ASC 820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:  ? Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.  ? Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments.  ? Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value.  There were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis subject to the disclosure requirements of ASC 820 as of June 30, 2016.  Cash and Cash Equivalents  The Company considers highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2016, the Company's cash and cash equivalents amounted $18,6454 and $173,537, respectively. All of the Company's cash deposit is held in a financial institution located in PRC where there is currently regulation mandated on obligatory insurance of bank accounts. The Company believes this financial institution is of high credit quality.  Income Taxes  The Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach which allows the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets to be based upon the likelihood of realization of tax benefits in future years. Under the asset and liability approach, deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more-likely-than-not that these items will expire before the Company is able to realize their benefits, or that future deductibility is uncertain.  Under ASC 740, a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is "more likely than not" that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The evaluation of a tax position is a two-step process. The first step is to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigations based on the technical merits of that position. The second step is to measure a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not threshold to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. A tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent period in which the threshold is satisfied. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not criteria should be de-recognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which the threshold is no longer satisfied. Penalties and interest incurred related to underpayment of income tax are classified as income tax expense in the year incurred. No significant penalty or interest relating to income taxes has been incurred during the period from July 21, 2015 (inception) to December 31, 2016. GAAP also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods, disclosures and transition.  As of December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2016, the Company's income tax expense amounted $0 and $0, respectively.  Recent Accounting Pronouncements  From time to time, new accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the Company believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations upon adoption. The recent accounting standards are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors.  Limited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital  There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. As of the date of this filing, we have not generated any revenues from operations. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources, possible delays in the launching of our games and market or wider economic downturns. We do not believe we have sufficient funds to operate our business for the next 12 months.  We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders.  If we are unable to raise additional capital to maintain our operations in the future, we may be unable to carry out our full business plan or we may be forced to cease operations.  The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements of BriVision for the period ended September 30, 2016 and accompanying notes that appear in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 12, 2017 and the financial statements included in this Report.  Results of Operation  Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities, but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to achieve the same.  Results of Operations - Three Months Ended December 31, 2016 as Compared to December 31, 2015  Revenues. We generated $70,000 and zero in revenues and zero and zero in cost of sales for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and three months ended December 31, 2015. The revenue generated in current period was from a one-time consulting service,  Operating Expenses. Our Selling, general and administrative expenses were $185,188 in the three months ended December 31, 2016 as compared to $1,605 in the three months ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $183,583 in the current period is the result of increased professional fees and salary and welfare.  Net Loss. The net loss was $140,337 for the three months ended December 31,2016 compared to income of $3,501,413 for the three months ended December 31,2015. The result of decrease of net loss in current period was due to the decreased research and development fees during the three months ended December 31, 2016.  Liquidity and Capital Resources Working Capital As of As of December 31, September 30, 2016 2016 ($) ($) Current Assets 18,645 173,537 Current Liabilities 38,100 56,470 Working Capital (deficit) (19,455 ) 117,067  Cash Flows  Cash Flow from Operating Activities  During the three months ended December 31, 2016 and the three months ended December 31, 2015, the net cash used in and generated from operating activities were $154,892 and $874,279 respectively. There was increase in continuing operations during the three months ended December 31, 2016.  Cash Flow from Investing Activities  During the three months ended December 31, 2016 and the three months ended December 31, 2015, there were no net cash used in or generated from investing activities.  Cash Flow from Financing Activities  During the three months ended December 31, 2016 and the three months ended December 31, 2015, there were nil and $303,414 net cash used in or generated from financing activities.  Critical Accounting Policy and Estimates  We believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating this "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation."  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital resources that is material to investors.

	Item
	1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

	Company

	”, “

	we

	” or “

	us

	”)

	Addendum

	”) to the Collaborative Agreement (the “

	”)
	which was previously entered into with BioLite Inc. (“

	BioLite

	”)on December 29, 2015

	as
	amended

	May 6, 2016. Pursuant to the Collaborative Agreement, BioLite granted us sole licensing rights for drug and therapeutic
	use of five products: BLI-1005 CNS-Major Depressive Disorder; BLI-1008 CNS-Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder; BLI-1401-1
	Anti-Tumor Combination Therapy-Solid Tumor with Anti-PD-1; BLI-1401-2 Anti-Tumor Combination Therapy-Triple Negative Breast Cancer;

	1)




	Include
	one more product, namely, “Maitake Combination Therapy” as one of the Products

	);










	2)




	Define
	the Territoryof the Sixth Product to be worldwide and restate the Territory of the Five

	associated with all clinical trial charges and shall have the right to sublicense Five
	Products in the USA and Canada and the Sixth Product worldwide;










	4)




	Confirm
	there is no additional Milestone Payments as defined in paragraph 3 of the Collaborative

	5)




	In
	the case that BioLite is obligated to pay its licensor in excess of 3% of the net sales,
	BioLite and we shall renegotiate and increase the Royalty Charge to a percentage to be
	later agreed from its original amount of 5% of the net sales as defined in paragraph
	4 of the Collaborative Agreement.






	 




	The
	foregoing descriptions of the Addendum are summaries and are qualified in their entirety by reference to such document, which
	is filed herewith as Exhibits 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.






	 









	Item
	3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.





	 




	Pursuant
	to the Collaborative Agreement,

	Second Payment

	”),
	which is 6.5% of total payments due under the Collaborative Agreement, upon the first IND submission by BioLite.




	 



	On
	February 22, 2017, we agreed to pay the Second Payment to BioLite with $650,000 in cash and$5,850,000 in the form of newly issued
	shares of our common stock, at the price of $2.0 per share, for an aggregate number of 2,925,000 shares (the “

	Shares

	”).
	The Shares were issued pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the 1933 Securities Act, as amended.







	 










	Item 4.02




	Non-Reliance on Previously Issued Financial Statements or a Related Audit Report or Completed Interim Review.





	 




	On
	February 21, 2017, our management, after consultation with the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm,
	Centurion ZD CPA Limited, (“

	Centurion

	”) concluded, that the following previously filed financial statements
	of the Company should not be relied upon:




	 





	 



	(i)




	The
	Company’s unaudited financial statements for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 contained in the Company’s Quarterly
	Report on Form 10-Q, originally filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“

	SEC

	”) on May 16, 2016;






	 





	 



	(ii)




	The
	Company’s unaudited financial statements for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 contained in the Company’s Quarterly
	Report on Form 10-Q, originally filed with the SEC on August 15, 2016;






	 





	 



	(iii)




	The
	Company’s audited financial statements for Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016,
	originally filed on January 12, 2017.





	 








	 



	2



	 







	 





	 




	The
	conclusion relates to the correction of the errors principally related to accrual of $6,500,000 of payable and related expense
	as set forth in the Collaborative Agreement in the consolidated financial statements, and revises the disclosure of related parties
	transactions and commitments and contingencies.




	 




	We
	noted that there was a delay of accrual for the two payments in total of $10,000,000 as set forth in the Collaborative Agreement
	: 1) 3.5% of total payment related to the upfront payment shall be made upon the execution of the Collaborative Agreement;
	and 2) 6.5% of the total payment shall be made upon the first IND submission (which was submitted in March 2016). We restated
	the consolidated financial statements in order to record the related liability and expense in the correct period, as well as providing
	necessary revision for the footnotes of related parties transactions and commitments and contingencies to reflect a more accurate
	disclosure.




	 




	Our
	board of directors discussed the restatement with Centurion.




	 




	The
	following tables present the effect of the correction discussed above and other adjustments on selected line items of our previously
	reported consolidated financial statements as of and for the period ended March 31, 2016, June 30, 2016 and September 30, 2016,
	respectively.

	CAUTIONARY
	NOTE ON FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS





	 




	This
	Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this “Report”) contains “forward-looking statements” which discuss matters
	that are not historical facts. Because they discuss future events or conditions, forward-looking statements may include words
	such as “anticipate,” “believe,” “estimate,” “intend,” “could,” “should,”
	“would,” “may,” “seek,” “plan,” “might,” “will,” “expect,”
	“predict,” “project,” “forecast,” “potential,” “continue” and negatives
	thereof or similar expressions. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, are based on various underlying
	assumptions and current expectations about the future and are not guarantees. Such statements involve known and unknown risks,
	uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, level of activity, performance or achievement to be materially
	different from the results of operations or plans expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. We cannot predict all
	of the risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, such information should not be regarded as representations that the results or conditions
	described in such statements or that our objectives and plans will be achieved and we do not assume any responsibility for the
	accuracy or completeness of any of these forward-looking statements.




	 




	These
	forward-looking statements represent our intentions, plans, expectations, assumptions and beliefs about future events and are
	subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors. Many of those factors are outside of our control and could cause actual results
	to differ materially from the results expressed or implied by those forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute
	to such differences in results and outcomes include, without limitation, those specifically addressed under the headings “Risks
	Factors” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in
	our annual report on Form 10-K and its amendment filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”); in
	“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Report, and
	information contained in other reports that we file with the SEC. In light of these risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the
	events described in the forward-looking statements might not occur or might occur to a different extent or at a different time
	than we have described. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as
	of the date of this Report. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements concerning other matters addressed in this
	Report and attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements
	contained or referred to in this Report.




	 




	There
	are important factors that could cause actual results to vary materially from those described in this report as anticipated, estimated
	or expected, including, but not limited to: competition in the industry in which we operate and the impact of such competition
	on pricing, revenues and margins, volatility in the securities market due to the general economic downturn; SEC regulations which
	affect trading in the securities of “penny stocks,” and other risks and uncertainties. Except as required by law,
	we assume no obligation to update any forward-looking statements publicly, or to update the reasons actual results could differ
	materially from those anticipated in any forward- looking statements, even if new information becomes available in the future.
	Depending on the market for our stock and other conditional tests, a specific safe harbor under the Private Securities Litigation
	Reform Act of 1995 may be available. Notwithstanding the above, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities
	Act”) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) expressly state
	that the safe harbor for forward-looking statements does not apply to companies that issue penny stock. Because we may from time
	to time be considered to be an issuer of penny stock, the safe harbor for forward-looking statements may not apply to us at certain
	times.

	NOTES
	TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS






	AS
	OF December 31, 2016 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2016






	(Unaudited)





	 





	1.
	ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS





	 




	American
	BriVision (Holding) Corporation (the “Company” or “Holding entity”), a Nevada corporation, thru the Company’s
	operating entity, American BriVision Corporation (“BriVision”), which was incorporated in July 2015 in the State of
	Delaware, engages in biotechnology and focuses on the development of new drugs and innovative medical devices to fulfill unmet
	medical needs. The business model of the Company is to integrate research achievements from world-famous institutions (such as
	Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (“MSKCC”) and MD Anderson Cancer Center), conduct clinical trials of translational
	medicine for Proof of Concept (“POC”), out-license to international pharmaceutical companies, and exploit global markets.




	 




	REVERSE
	MERGER




	 




	On
	February 8, 2016, a Share Exchange Agreement (“Share Exchange Agreement”) was entered into by and among American BriVision
	(Holding) Corporation (the “Company”), American BriVision Corporation (“BriVision”), Euro-Asia Investment
	& Finance Corp. Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of Taiwan (“Euro-Asia”),
	being the owners of record of 52,336,000 shares of common stock of the Company, and the owners of record of all of the issued
	share capital of BriVision (the “BriVision Stock”). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, upon surrender by the
	BriVision Shareholders and the cancellation by BriVision of the certificates evidencing the BriVision Stock as registered in the
	name of each BriVision Shareholder, and pursuant to the registration of the Company in the register of members maintained by BriVision
	as the new holder of the BriVision Stock and the issuance of the certificates evidencing the aforementioned registration of the
	BriVision Stock in the name of the Company, the Company should issue 52,936,583 shares (the “Acquisition Stock”) (subject
	to adjustment for fractionalized shares as set forth below) of the Company’s common stock to the BriVision Shareholders
	(or their designees), and 51,945,225 shares of the Company’s common stock owned by Euro-Asia should be cancelled and retired
	to treasury. The Acquisition Stock collectively should represent 79.70% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company
	immediately after the Closing, in exchange for the BriVision Stock, representing 100% of the issued share capital of BriVision.
	Because of the exchange of the BriVision Stock for the Acquisition Stock (the “Share Exchange”), BriVision became
	a wholly owned subsidiary (the “Subsidiary”) of the Company and there was a change of control of the Company following
	the closing. There were no warrants, options or other equity instruments issued in connection with the share exchange agreement.




	 




	Because
	of the consummation of the Share Exchange, BriVision is now our wholly owned subsidiary and its shareholders own approximately
	79.70% of our issued and outstanding common stock.




	 




	Following
	the Share Exchange, we have abandoned our prior business plan and we are now pursuing BriVision’s historical businesses
	and proposed businesses, which focus on the development of new drugs and innovative medical devices to fulfill unmet medical needs.
	The business model of the Company is to integrate research achievements from world-famous institutions, conduct clinical trials
	of translational medicine for Proof of Concept (“POC”), out-license to international pharmaceutical companies, and
	exploit global markets.




	 




	Accounting
	Treatment of the Reverse Merger




	 




	For
	financial reporting purposes, the Share Exchange represents a “reverse merger” rather than a business combination
	and BriVision is deemed the accounting acquirer in the transaction. The Share Exchange is being accounted for as a reverse-merger
	and recapitalization. BriVision is the acquirer for financial reporting purposes and the Company is the acquired company. Consequently,
	the assets and liabilities and the operations reflected in the historical financial statements prior to the Share Exchange will
	be those of BriVision and recorded at the historical cost basis of BriVision. In addition, the consolidated financial statements
	after completion of the Share Exchange will include the assets and liabilities of the Company and BriVision, and the historical
	operations of BriVision and operations of the Combined Company from the closing date of the Share Exchange.

	2.
	SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES





	 





	Basis
	of Presentation





	 




	The
	accompanying audited financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
	principles in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). This basis of accounting involves the application of accrual accounting.
	Consequently, revenues and gains are recognized when earned, and expenses and losses are recognized when incurred. The Company’s
	financial statements are expressed in U.S. dollars. The condensed financial statements include all adjustments that, in the opinion
	of management, are necessary in order not to make the financial statements misleading.




	 




	Certain
	information and footnote disclosure normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with US GAAP have been
	condensed or omitted. The results of operations for the periods ended December 31, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the
	operating results for the full year.




	 





	Use
	of Estimates





	 




	The
	preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
	that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
	the consolidated financial statements and the amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could
	differ materially from those results.




	 





	Forward
	Stock split





	 




	On
	March 21, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an amendment to Articles of Incorporation to effect a forward split
	at a ratio of 1 to 3:141 and increase the number of our authorized shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, to 360,000,000,
	which was effective on April 8, 2016. The majority of the shareholders of the Company approved the amendment to Articles of Incorporation.
	See Note 4 for more details.




	 





	Fair
	Value Measurements





	 




	The
	Company applies the provisions of ASC Subtopic 820-10, “Fair Value Measurements”, for fair value measurements of financial
	assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair
	value in the financial statements. ASC 820 also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about
	fair value measurements.




	 




	Fair
	value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
	between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities,
	the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers assumptions that market
	participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.




	 











	 



	5



	 






	 




	 




	ASC
	820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
	unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs to measure fair value. The hierarchy
	gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements)
	and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of
	the fair value hierarchy are as follows:






	 





	 



	●




	Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted)
	for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.





	 


	 


	 




	 



	●




	Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for
	similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly
	or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments.





	 


	 


	 




	 



	●




	Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant
	to the fair value.






	 




	There
	were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis subject to the disclosure requirements of ASC 820 as
	of December 31, 2016.




	 





	Cash
	and Cash Equivalents





	 




	The
	Company considers highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents.
	As of December 31, 2016, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents amounted $18,645. As of September 31, 2016, the
	Company’s cash and cash equivalents amounted $173,537. All of the Company’s cash deposits are held in a financial
	institution located in PRC where there is currently regulation mandated on obligatory insurance of bank accounts. The Company
	believes this financial institution is of high credit quality.




	 





	Income
	Taxes





	 




	The
	Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach which allows the recognition and measurement of deferred
	tax assets to be based upon the likelihood of realization of tax benefits in future years. Under the asset and liability approach,
	deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
	for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred
	tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will expire before the Company is able to realize their benefits, or future
	deductibility is uncertain.




	 




	Under
	ASC 740, a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position
	would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The evaluation of a tax position is
	a two-step process. The first step is to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained
	upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigations based on the technical merits of that
	position. The second step is to measure a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not threshold to determine the amount
	of benefits recognized in the financial statements. A tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is
	greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the
	more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent period in which the threshold is met.
	Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not criteria should be de-recognized in the
	first subsequent financial reporting period in which the threshold is no longer satisfied. Penalties and interest incurred
	related to underpayment of income tax are classified as income tax expense in the year incurred. No significant penalty or
	interest relating to income taxes has been incurred during the period from July 21, 2015 (inception) to December 31, 2016.
	GAAP also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods,
	disclosures and transition.




	 




	As
	of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company’s income tax expense amounted $0 and $0,
	respectively.




	 





	Recent
	Accounting Pronouncements





	 




	From
	time to time, new accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) or other standard
	setting bodies are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the Company believes
	that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on its financial position
	or results of operations upon adoption. The recent accounting standards are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated
	financial statements upon adoption.

	3.
	GOING CONCERN





	 




	The
	accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the Company will continue as a going concern. The Company has incurred
	losses since its inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of $11,463,678 as of December 31, 2016. The Company also incurred
	net losses of $140,337 and negative cash flow of $154,892 during the year ended December 31, 2016. The ability to continue as
	a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing
	to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due. These combined
	financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification
	of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company upon signing of that agreement. On May 6, 2016, we and BioLite agreed
	to amend the Collaborative Agreement, through entry into the Milestone Payment Agreement, whereby we have agreed to pay the Milestone
	Payment to BioLite $2,600,000 in cash and $900,000 in newly issued shares of our common stock, at the price of $1.60 per share,
	for an aggregate number of 562,500 shares. The cash payment and shares issuance were completed in June 2016. Pursuant to the Collaborative
	Agreement, 6.5% of total payment, $6,500,000 shall be made upon the first IND submission which was submitted in March 2016. $6,500,000
	was wholly recorded as accounts payable as of December 31, 2016




	 




	This
	Collaborative Agreement shall, once signed by both Parties, remain in effect for fifteen years as of the first commercial sales
	of the Product in the Territory and automatically renew for five more years unless either party gives the other party six month
	written notice of termination prior to the expiration date of the term.




	 




	The
	Company determined to fully expense the entire amount of $3,500,000 since currently the related licensing rights do not have alternative
	future uses. According to ASC 730-10-25-1, absent alternative future uses the acquisition of product rights to be used in research
	and development activities must be charged to research and development expenses immediately. Hence the entire amount is fully
	expensed as research and development expense.

	4.
	COLLABORATIVE AGREEMENT





	 




	On
	December 29, 2015, American BriVision Corporation entered into a Collaborative Agreement with BioLite Inc., a related party, pursuant

	Disorder; BLI-1008 CNS-Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder; BLI-1401-1 Anti-Tumor Combination Therapy-Solid Tumor with Anti-PD-1;
	BLI-1401-2 Anti-Tumor Combination Therapy-Triple Negative Breast Cancer; and BLI-1501 Hematology-Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,
	in USA and Canada. Under the Collaborative Agreement, BriVision should pay a total of $100,000,000 in cash or stock of BriVision
	with equivalent value, according to the following schedule:

	Pursuant
	to the Collaborative Agreement, an upfront payment of $3,500,000 (the “Milestone Payment”), which is 3.5% of total
	payments due under the Collaborative Agreement, was to be paid by the Company upon signing of that agreement. On May 6, 2016,
	we and BioLite agreed to amend the Collaborative Agreement, through entry into the Milestone Payment Agreement, whereby we have
	agreed to pay the Milestone Payment to BioLite $2,600,000 in cash and $900,000 in newly issued shares of our common stock, at
	the price of $1.60 per share, for an aggregate number of 562,500 shares. The cash payment and shares issuance were completed in
	June 2016.




	 




	Pursuant
	to the Collaborative Agreement,6.5% of total payment, $6,500,000 shall be made upon the first IND submission which was submitted
	in March 2016. $6,500,000 was wholly recorded as accounts payable as of December 31, 2016.




	 




	This
	Collaborative Agreement shall, once signed by both Parties, remain in effect for fifteen years as of the first commercial sales
	of the Product in the Territory and automatically renew for five more years unless either party gives the other party six month
	written notice of termination prior to the expiration date of the term.




	 




	The
	Company determined to fully expense the entire amount of $10,000,000 since currently the related licensing rights do not have
	alternative future uses. According to ASC 730-10-25-1, absent alternative future uses the acquisition of product rights to be
	used in research and development activities must be charged to research and development expenses immediately. Hence the entire
	amount is fully expensed as research and

	On
	February 8, 2016, a Share Exchange Agreement (“Share Exchange Agreement”) was entered into by and among American
	BriVision (Holding) Corporation (the “Company”), American BriVision Corporation (“BriVision”),
	Euro-Asia Investment & Finance Corp. Limited, a company incorporated under the laws of Hong Kong Special Administrative
	Region of People's Republic of China (“Euro-Asia”), being the owners of record of 164,387,376 (52,336,000
	pre-stock split) shares of common stock of the Company, and the owners of record of all of the issued share capital of
	BriVision (the “BriVision Stock”). Pursuant to the Share Exchange Agreement, upon surrender by the BriVision
	Shareholders and the cancellation by BriVision of the certificates evidencing the BriVision Stock as registered in the name
	of each BriVision Shareholder, and pursuant to the registration of the Company in the register of members maintained by
	BriVision as the new holder of the BriVision Stock and the issuance of the certificates evidencing the aforementioned
	registration of the BriVision Stock in the name of the Company, the Company should issue 166,273,921 (52,936,583 pre-stock
	split) shares (the “Acquisition Stock”) (subject to adjustment for fractionalized shares as set forth below) of
	the Company’s common stock to the BriVision Shareholders (or their designees), and 163,159,952 (51,945,225 pre-stock
	split) shares of the Company’s common stock owned by Euro-Asia should be cancelled and retired to treasury. The
	Acquisition Stock collectively should represent 79.70% of the issued and outstanding common stock of the Company immediately
	after the Closing, in exchange for the BriVision Stock, representing 100% of the issued share capital of BriVision in a
	reverse merger, or the Merger. Pursuant to the Merger, all of the issued and outstanding shares of BriVision’s
	common stock were converted, at an exchange ratio of 0.2536-for-1, into an aggregate of 166,273,921(52,936,583 pre-stock
	split) shares of Company’s common stock and BriVision became a wholly owned subsidiary, of the Company. The holders of
	Company’s common stock as of immediately prior to the Merger held an aggregate of 205,519,223 (65,431,144 pre-stock
	split) shares of Company’s common stock, Because of the exchange of the BriVision Stock for the Acquisition Stock (the
	“Share Exchange”), BriVision became a wholly owned subsidiary (the “Subsidiary”) of the Company and
	there was a change of control of the Company following the closing. There were no warrants, options or other equity
	instruments issued in connection with the share exchange agreement.




	 




	On
	February 17, 2016, pursuant to the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2016 Plan”), 157,050 (50,000 pre-stock split)
	shares were granted to the employees.




	 




	On
	March 21, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an amendment to Articles of Incorporation to affect a forward split
	at a ratio of 1 to 3:141 (the “Forward Stock Split”) and increase the number of our authorized shares of common stock,
	par value $0.001 per share, to 360,000,000, which was effective on April 8, 2016.




	 




	The
	majority of the shareholders of the Company approved the amendment to Articles of Incorporation.




	 




	On
	May 6, 2016, we and BioLite agreed to amend the Collaborative Agreement, through entry into the Milestone Payment Agreement, whereby
	we have agreed to issue shares of our common stock, at the price of $1.60 per share, for an aggregate number of 562,500 shares,
	as part of our first installation of payment pursuant to the Milestone Payment. The shares issuance was completed in June 2016.




	 




	On
	August 26, 2016, the Company issued 1,468,750 shares (“Shares”) of the Company’s common stock, par value $0.001
	(the “Offering”) to BioLite, Inc., a non-U.S. accredited investor (the “Purchaser”) pursuant to a certain
	Stock Purchase Agreement dated August 26, 2016 (the “SPA”). The Shares are exempt from the registration requirements
	of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”), pursuant to Regulation S of the Securities Act promulgated
	thereunder. Our sole director, Eugene Jiang, is a director of BioLite and it is therefore considered a related party.




	 




	The
	purchase price per share of the Offering is $1.60. The net proceeds to the Company from the Offering are approximately $2,350,000.
	The proceeds may be used for general corporate purposes.

	MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS
	OF OPERATION







	 





	The
	following discussion provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our
	results of operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read along with our unaudited condensed consolidated
	financial statements for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this
	Report

	,

	and our annual report on Form 10-K for the twelve months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014 including the
	consolidated financial statements and notes thereto. The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking
	statements, which involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ significantly from the results, expectations
	and plans discussed in these forward-looking statements. See “Cautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking
	Statements.”





	 




	As
	used in this Report, the terms “we”, “us”, “our”, and “our Company” and “the
	Company” refer to American Brivision (Holding) Corporation (formerly known as Metu Brands, Inc.) and its subsidiaries, unless
	otherwise indicated.




	 





	Introduction





	 




	Currently,
	we are a holding company operating through our wholly owned subsidiary, American BriVision Corporation, a Delaware corporation
	(“BriVision”). BriVision was incorporated in 2015 in the State of Delaware. It is a biotechnology company focused
	on the development of new drugs and innovative medical devices to fulfill unmet medical needs. Following the Share Exchange (as
	described herein below), we have abandoned our prior business plan and we are now pursuing BriVision’s historical businesses
	and proposed businesses, which focus on the development of new drugs and innovative medical devices to fulfill unmet medical needs.
	The business model of the Company is to integrate research achievements from world-famous institutions, conduct clinical trials
	of translational medicine for Proof of Concept (“POC”), out-license to international pharmaceutical companies, and
	exploit global markets.




	 






	Share
	Exchange






	 




	On
	February 8, 2016, a Share Exchange Agreement (“Share Exchange Agreement”) was entered into by and among American BriVision
	(Holding) Corporation (the “Company”), BriVision, Euro-Asia Investment & Finance Corp. Limited, a company incorporated
	under the laws of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China (“Euro-Asia”), being the owners of record of 52,336,000
	shares of common stock of the Company, and the persons listed in Exhibit A thereof (the “BriVision Shareholders”),
	being the owners of record of all of the issued share capital of BriVision (the “BriVision Stock”). Pursuant to the
	Share Exchange Agreement, upon surrender by the BriVision Shareholders and the cancellation by BriVision of the certificates evidencing
	the BriVision Stock as registered in the name of each BriVision Shareholder, and pursuant to the registration of the Company in
	the register of members maintained by BriVision as the new holder of the BriVision Stock and the issuance of the certificates
	evidencing the aforementioned registration of the BriVision Stock in the name of the Company, the Company issued 52,936,583 shares
	(the “Acquisition Stock”) (subject to adjustment for fractionalized shares as set forth below) of the Company’s
	common stock to the BriVision Shareholders (or their designees), and 51,945,225 shares of the Company’s common stock owned
	by Euro-Asia were cancelled and retired to treasury. The Acquisition Stock collectively represents 79.70% of the issued and outstanding
	common stock of the Company immediately after the Closing, in exchange for the BriVision Stock, representing 100% of the issued
	share capital of BriVision. Because of the exchange of the BriVision Stock for the Acquisition Stock (the “Share Exchange”),
	BriVision became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and there was a change of control of the Company following the closing.
	There were no warrants, options or other equity instruments issued in connection with the share exchange agreement.




	 




	Because
	of the consummation of the Share Exchange, BriVision is now our wholly owned subsidiary and its shareholders own approximately
	79.70% of our issued and outstanding common stock.




	 





	Accounting
	Treatment of the Merger





	 




	For
	financial reporting purposes, the Share Exchange represents a “reverse merger” rather than a business combination
	and BriVision is deemed the accounting acquirer in the transaction. The Share Exchange is being accounted for as a reverse-merger
	and recapitalization. BriVision is the acquirer for financial reporting purposes and the Company is the acquired company. Consequently,
	the assets and liabilities and the operations that will be reflected in the historical financial statements prior to the Share
	Exchange will be those of BriVision and will be recorded at the historical cost basis of BriVision, and the consolidated financial
	statements after completion of the Share Exchange will include the assets and liabilities of the Company and BriVision, and the
	historical operations of BriVision and operations of the combined entities (American Brivision (Holding) Corporation and its wholly
	owned subsidiary Brivision) from the closing date of the Share Exchange.




	 




	For
	more information about the Share Exchange, please refer to the current report on Form 8-K we filed on February 12, 2016.

	Forward
	Stock Split






	 




	On
	March 21, 2016, our Board approved an amendment to Articles of Incorporation to effect a forward split at a ratio of 1 to 3:141
	and increase the number of our authorized shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, to 360,000,000, which went effective
	on April 8, 2016. The majority of the shareholders of the Company approved the amendment to Articles of Incorporation.




	 






	Collaborative
	Agreement






	 




	On
	December 29, 2015, American BriVision Corporation entered into a Collaborative Agreement with BioLite Inc., a related party, pursuant
	to which BioLite granted the Company sole licensing rights for drug and therapeutic use of five products: BLI-1005 CNS-Major Depressive
	Disorder; BLI-1008 CNS-Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder; BLI-1401-1 Anti-Tumor Combination Therapy-Solid Tumor with Anti-PD-1;
	BLI-1401-2 Anti-Tumor Combination Therapy-Triple Negative Breast Cancer; and BLI-1501 Hematology-Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia,
	in USA and Canada. Under the Collaborative Agreement, BriVision should pay a total of $100,000,000 in cash or stock of BriVision
	with equivalent value, according to the following schedule:

	BriVision, BioLite has to deliver all data to BriVision in one week.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	 




	upon
	the first IND submission, BriVision shall pay, but no later than December 15, 2016: 6.5% of total payment. After receiving
	second payment from BriVision, BioLite has to deliver IND package to BriVision in one week.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	at
	the completion of first phase II clinical trial, BriVision shall pay, but no later than September 15, 2017: 15% of total payment.
	After receiving third payment from BriVision, BioLite has to deliver phase II clinical study report to BriVision in three
	months.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	upon
	the phase III IND submission, BriVision shall pay, but no later than December 15, 2018: 20% of total payment. After receiving
	forth payment from BriVision, BioLite has to deliver IND package to BriVision in one week.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	at
	the completion of phase III, BriVision shall pay, but no later than September 15, 2019:25% of total payment. After receiving
	fifth payment from BriVision, BioLite has to deliver phase III clinical study report to BriVision in three months.






	 




	 




	 






	 




	●




	upon

	receiving sixth payment from BriVision, BioLite has to deliver NDA package to BriVision in one week.






	 




	Pursuant
	to the Collaborative Agreement, an upfront payment of $3,500,000 (the “Milestone Payment”), which is 3.5% of total
	payments due under the Collaborative Agreement, was to be paid by the Company upon signing of that agreement. On May 6, 2016,
	we and BioLite agreed to amend the Collaborative Agreement, through entry into the Milestone Payment Agreement, whereby we have
	agreed to pay the Milestone Payment to BioLite $2,600,000 in cash and $900,000 in newly issued shares of our common stock, at
	the price of $1.60 per share, for an aggregate number of 562,500 shares. The cash payment and shares issuance were completed in
	June 2016.




	 




	Pursuant
	to the Collaborative Agreement,6.5% of total payment, $6,500,000 shall be made upon the first IND submission which was submitted
	in March 2016. $6,500,000 was wholly recorded as accounts payable as of December 31, 2016.




	 




	This
	Collaborative Agreement shall, once signed by both Parties, remain in effect for fifteen years as of the first commercial sales
	of the Product in the Territory and automatically renew for five more years unless either party gives the other party six month
	written notice of termination prior to the expiration date of the term.




	 




	The
	Company determined to fully expense the entire amount of $3,500,000 since currently the related licensing rights do not have alternative
	future uses. . According to ASC 730-10-25-1, absent alternative future uses the acquisition of product rights to be used in research
	and development activities must be charged to research and development expenses immediately. Hence the entire amount is fully
	expensed as research and there was no commercial sales during the period ended December 31, 2016.




	 






	Plan
	of Operations






	 




	BriVision
	will select potential drug candidates (including but not limited to botanical drugs) from different research institutes, start
	to develop it from pre-clinical stage (including all CMC process and animal study) to clinical study stage. When the phase II
	clinical trial is finished and the efficacy is approved, we will have reached the “proof of concept” stage. We plan
	to out license our drugs to big pharmaceutical companies, coordinate with them to develop and enhance the drugs and exploit global
	markets.




	 






	Revenue
	Generation






	 




	Most
	of our licensed products are still under development and trial stage.




	 




	During
	the first three months for the period ended December 31, 2016, we have generated $70,000 revenue related to a one-time consulting
	service.

	Research
	and Development






	 




	During
	the first three months for the period ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we have spent approximately $25,198 and $3,500,000,
	respectively on research and development.




	 






	Critical
	Accounting Policies and Estimates






	 




	We
	believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating this “Management’s
	Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation.”




	 





	Basis
	of Presentation





	 




	The
	accompanying audited financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
	principles in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP). This basis of accounting involves the application of accrual accounting
	and consequently, revenues and gains are recognized when earned, and expenses and losses are recognized when incurred. The Company’s
	financial statements are expressed in U.S. dollars.




	 





	Forward
	Stock split





	 




	On
	March 21, 2016, the Board of Directors of the Company approved an amendment to Articles of Incorporation to affect a forward split
	at a ratio of 1 to 3:141 and increase the number of our authorized shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, to 360,000,000,
	which was effective on April 8, 2016. The majority of the shareholders of the Company approved the amendment to Articles of Incorporation.
	See Note 4 for more details.




	 





	Use
	of Estimates





	 




	The
	preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions
	that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of
	the consolidated financial statements and the amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could
	differ materially from those results.




	 





	Fair
	Value Measurements





	 




	The
	Company applies the provisions of ASC Subtopic 820-10, “Fair Value Measurements”, for fair value measurements of financial
	assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair
	value in the financial statements. ASC 820 also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about
	fair value measurements.




	 




	Fair
	value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
	between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required
	or permitted to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact
	and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability.




	 




	ASC
	820 establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of
	unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. ASC 820 establishes three levels of inputs to measure fair value. The hierarchy
	gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements)
	and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements). The three levels of
	the fair value hierarchy are as follows:




	 





	 



	●




	Level 1 inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices (unadjusted)
	for identical assets or liabilities in active markets.





	 


	 


	 




	 



	●




	Level 2 inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for
	similar assets and liabilities in active markets, and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability, either directly
	or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the financial instruments.





	 


	 


	 




	 



	●




	Level 3 inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant
	to the fair value.






	 




	There
	were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis subject to the disclosure requirements of ASC 820 as
	of June 30, 2016.




	 





	Cash
	and Cash Equivalents





	 




	The
	Company considers highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents.
	As of December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2016, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents amounted $18,6454 and $173,537,
	respectively. All of the Company’s cash deposit is held in a financial institution located in PRC where there is
	currently regulation mandated on obligatory insurance of bank accounts. The Company believes this financial institution is of
	high credit quality.

	Income
	Taxes





	 




	The
	Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach which allows the recognition and measurement of deferred
	tax assets to be based upon the likelihood of realization of tax benefits in future years. Under the asset and liability approach,
	deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities
	for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred
	tax assets if it is more-likely-than-not that these items will expire before the Company is able to realize their benefits, or
	that future deductibility is uncertain.




	 




	Under
	ASC 740, a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position
	would be sustained in a tax examination, with a tax examination being presumed to occur. The evaluation of a tax position is
	a two-step process. The first step is to determine whether it is more-likely-than-not that a tax position will be sustained
	upon examination, including the resolution of any related appeals or litigations based on the technical merits of that
	position. The second step is to measure a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not threshold to determine the amount
	of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements. A tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is
	greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Tax positions that previously failed to meet the
	more-likely-than-not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent period in which the threshold is
	satisfied. Previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more-likely-than-not criteria should be de-recognized
	in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which the threshold is no longer satisfied. Penalties and interest
	incurred related to underpayment of income tax are classified as income tax expense in the year incurred. No significant
	penalty or interest relating to income taxes has been incurred during the period from July 21, 2015 (inception) to December
	31, 2016. GAAP also provides guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim
	periods, disclosures and transition.




	 




	As
	of December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2016, the Company’s income tax expense amounted $0 and $0,
	respectively.




	 





	Recent
	Accounting Pronouncements





	 




	From
	time to time, new accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) or other standard
	setting bodies that are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective date. Unless otherwise discussed, the Company believes
	that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on its financial position
	or results of operations upon adoption. The recent accounting standards are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated
	financial statements upon adoption.




	 





	Off-Balance
	Sheet Arrangements





	 




	We
	do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial
	condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures, or capital
	resources that is material to investors.




	 





	Limited
	Operating History; Need for Additional Capital





	 




	There
	is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. As of the date of this filing,
	we have not generated any revenues from operations. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our
	business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources,
	possible delays in the launching of our games and market or wider economic downturns. We do not believe we have sufficient funds
	to operate our business for the next 12 months.




	 




	We
	have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If financing is not available
	on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional
	dilution to existing shareholders.




	 




	If
	we are unable to raise additional capital to maintain our operations in the future, we may be unable to carry out our full business
	plan or we may be forced to cease operations.




	 




	The
	following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements of BriVision for the period
	ended September 30, 2016 and accompanying notes that appear in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, as filed with the Securities and
	Exchange Commission on January 12, 2017 and the financial statements included in this Report.




	 





	Results
	of Operation





	 




	Our
	financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and, accordingly, do not include adjustments
	relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be
	unable to continue in operation. We expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements. We
	expect to raise additional capital through, among other things, the sale of equity or debt securities, but we cannot guarantee
	that we will be able to achieve the same.

	Expenses.


	Our Selling, general and administrative expenses were $185,188 in the three months ended December 31, 2016
	as compared to $1,605 in the three months ended December 31, 2015. The increase of $183,583 in the current period is the
	result of increased professional fees and salary and welfare.




	 






	Net
	Loss.


	The net loss was $140,337 for the three months ended December 31,2016 compared to income of $3,501,413 for the
	three months ended December 31,2015. The result of decrease of net loss in current period was due to the decreased research
	and development fees during the three months ended December 31, 2016.

	CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES.







	 





	Disclosure
	Controls and Procedures





	 




	We
	maintain disclosure controls and procedures designed to provide reasonable assurance that material information required to be
	disclosed by us in the reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized
	and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that the information is accumulated and
	communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely
	decisions regarding required disclosure. We performed an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our management,
	including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure
	controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this report. Based on their evaluation, our management, including
	our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective
	as of December 31, 2016.




	 




	We
	do not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all instances of fraud. Disclosure controls
	and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives
	of the disclosure controls and procedures are met. Further, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the
	fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent
	limitations in all disclosure controls and procedures, no evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures can provide absolute
	assurance that we have detected all our control deficiencies and instances of fraud, if any. The design of disclosure controls
	and procedures is also based partly on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance
	that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.




	 





	Changes
	in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting





	 




	There
	have been no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that occurred during our last fiscal quarter to which this
	Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q relates that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal
	controls over financial reporting.

	1.        
	 I have reviewed this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q (this “Report”) of the Company;


	 


	2.          Based

	respects the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the registrant as of, and for, the periods presented
	in this Report;


	 


	4.         
	The registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I are responsible for establishing and maintaining disclosure controls and procedures

	(c)




	Evaluated the effectiveness of the registrant's disclosure controls and procedures and presented in this Report our conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures, as of the end of the period covered by this Report based on such evaluation; and





	 




	 



	(d)




	Disclosed in this Report any change in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the registrant's most recent fiscal quarter (the registrant's fourth fiscal quarter in the case of an annual report) that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the registrant's internal control over financial reporting; and





	 


	5.          The
	registrant's other certifying officer(s) and I have disclosed, based on our most recent evaluation of internal control over financial

	Any fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have a significant role in the registrant's internal control over financial reporting.
