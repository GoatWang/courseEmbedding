Payment Options
Choose the payment option that's right for you.




Checking and Savings Account Payments

To schedule a payment using your checking or savings account, log in to My Account 
		or call our automated payment line at 800-432-4524. You can schedule a single online payment for today or a future date. 
		There is no fee, and you control when the payment is made.
If you'd like to pay from the same checking or savings account each month, you can establish recurring payments via 
		My Account or by mail via a completed authorization form.
If you're enrolled in paperless billing you can pay your bill right from your email each month. Just enter your four-digit PIN – or create one if you haven't done so – then enter your bank account
	information and you're ready to go!  
		

Credit or Debit Card Payments

Speedpay®, a Western Union&reg company, is a utility bill payment center that processes payments on behalf of MidAmerican Energy, accepts online or phone payments made with MasterCard, Visa, Discover and American Express debit and credit cards; and ATM or debit cards using the STAR, PULSE, NYCE and ACCEL networks. Western Union Speedpay charges a processing fee; however, MidAmerican Energy Company does not receive any portion of the fee. To make a credit or debit card payment by phone or to verify the Western Union Speedpay processing fee, call 866-579-1409.
All payments, including pending disconnect and reconnect payments, are accepted. If your payment is for a pending disconnection or reconnection of service, you must call MidAmerican Energy at 888-427-5632 with the Western Union Speedpay transaction number, which confirms the payment.



Customer Offices

Payments can be made at any of MidAmerican Energy Company's customer offices. Customer offices accept cash, checks or money orders for full and partial payments.

Mail

When mailing payments, include the pay stub from your bill, or write your MidAmerican Energy account number or service address on your check. Mail payments to:
                MidAmerican Energy Company
                P.O. Box 8020
                Davenport, IA 52808-8020
            

Walk-In Payment Locations

Western Union is MidAmerican Energy’s authorized walk-in payment provider. You can make a cash payment at any Western Union location that accepts payments. Western Union charges a convenience fee of $1 for this service. MidAmerican Energy cautions you about making a payment at locations other than Western Union. Payments made at other locations may result in delayed posting of the payment to your account and the inability to confirm the payment.

About Your Bill





Sample Bill - Front


Sample Bill - Back


Sample Bill - Terms












Definition of Terms
The following are definitions of terms found on your bill:
Basic Service Charge: The monthly basic service charge partially covers fixed costs incurred to serve each customer, regardless of use.
CCF: Natural gas is measured by volume. One CCF represents 100 cubic feet of natural gas.
Delivery Charge: This charge covers the costs associated with distributing gas through our system to you.
Demand Charge: The demand charge reflects a portion of the cost of generating, transmitting and distributing electrical energy to you and is based on peak usage.
Due Date: Your bill is due and payable on or before the date shown on your bill. A late payment charge will be applied to amounts not paid by the due date.
Energy Adjustment Clause: MidAmerican Energy continually experiences increases and decreases in the cost of fuel and purchased power used to supply electricity to its customers. This clause allows MidAmerican Energy to make monthly adjustments to reflect fuel and power costs as they occur.
Energy Charge: The energy charge reflects the cost of generating, transmitting and distributing electrical energy to you and is applied to energy measured during the month.
Energy Charge Adjustment: This adjustment reflects the cost of power plant fuel or purchased power.
Energy Efficiency Charge: A charge that allows MidAmerican Energy to recover the costs of energy efficiency programs.
Estimated Reading: If we are unable to obtain an actual meter reading, the amount of the bill will be estimated based on past usage. Any necessary adjustments for an estimated bill will be made the next time your meter is read and will appear on the following bill.
Fuel Adjustment Clause: A charge to recover the costs of fuel used in company-owned generating stations and purchased power.
Gas Supply Charge: This charge reflects the cost of purchased natural gas.
kWh: A kWh is a unit of electric usage. One kilowatt-hour is the amount of electric energy used to keep one 100-watt light bulb burning for 10 hours.
Meter Class Charge: The meter costs incurred to serve each customer’s natural gas needs.
Meter Service Charge: A charge for the performance of functions related to the installation, testing, maintenance, repair and reading of electric meters used for billing of customers and management of meter information.
Pipeline Transport Charge: This reflects the cost incurred to reserve capacity on the interstate pipeline system in order to deliver gas to you. If the pipeline transport charge is not a line item on your bill, it is included in the gas supply charge.
Pressure: The pressure factor adjusts the metered gas usage to compensate for variations in metering and local atmospheric pressure.
Prorate: The prorate factor adjusts for a billing period shorter or longer than normal.
Rate: This designates your gas or electric billing rate at MidAmerican Energy. Tariff and rate schedule information is available upon request.
Rate Equalization Factor: Equalization adjustment factors are applied to electric service rates for the purpose of ensuring all Iowa MidAmerican Energy customers will pay the same electric base rate within each rate class – residential, commercial and industrial. Rates will be adjusted in equal annual increments over 10 years.
Supply Charge: A charge for the costs of generating electricity.
Therms and Btu Factor: We bill you on the number of therms of natural gas used because the heating value of a cubic foot of gas varies. The therm is a unit of constant heating value, and the therm factor converts volumes of gas used from cubic feet to therms. One therm equals 100,000 Btu (British Thermal Units).
Transmission Cost Adjustment: MidAmerican Energy supports continual improvements to the national electric grid to benefit regional and local reliability. This cost adjustment allows MidAmerican Energy to make annual adjustments to recover the forecasted transmission improvement costs, subject to an annual reconciliation to actual expenditures.









Budget Billing





About Budget Billing
Budget Billing is not a discount program; it offers no savings or lower rates. The total annual cost for electricity and/or gas remains the same, but customers have the convenience of a more predictable bill each month. Participation in the program is free and offered to all customers.
How Budget Billing is Calculated
If customers have an established MidAmerican Energy usage history, the cost of energy used for the previous 24 months is divided by 24. An average monthly cost is determined by multiplying that amount by a factor that takes into account projected electricity and gas prices.
A budget amount for customers who move into a home previously occupied by someone else is calculated based on the energy used by the previous occupant.
Review of Budget Billing Amounts
Once enrolled, the Budget Billing Plan will be reviewed every three or six months. Eligible residential customers also can choose a 12-month review. Depending on the selected review option, a budget bill amount may change up to four times a year.
During the review process, we recalculate your average monthly cost, take projected energy costs into consideration and factor in your budget balance – the difference between the amount billed and the cost of energy used.
Customers receive a message on their bill when the Budget Billing Plan is reviewed. If the budget bill amount is adjusted, the message indicates the new budget amount that will start with the next bill. You also can sign up to receive an email or text alert when your budget amount is going to change.


How to Enroll
Access My Account and select Budget Billing from the left menu. Follow the prompts to enroll online. A minimum of three months’ usage is needed to enroll online. To enroll by phone, to determine 12-month review eligibility, to have the difference at the end of a budget year applied to your bill, or to receive a proposed budget bill amount for a potential location, call MidAmerican Energy at 888-427-5632.
If you Cancel Budget Billing or Close your Account
Your budget balance is the difference in the amount you were billed and your actual usage. When you cancel your Budget Billing Plan or close your MidAmerican Energy account, the budget balance is applied to your next or final bill. If you were billed more than you used, the budget balance is a credit and will reduce the amount due. If you were billed less than you used, the budget balance is a debit and will be added to the amount due.








Paperless Billing



What to Expect
When you choose paperless billing, you'll receive an email each month when your bill is available. You can view and pay your current bill directly from your email – 
			all you need to do is create a four-digit PIN. In addition to your current bill, you also can view up to 12 previous bills.
Ready to Get Started?
Call us to enroll in paperless billing, or log in to My Account for this and additional self-service options. 






Establish Third-Party Access to Your Account



Customer Authorization Form
If you’d like to delegate certain rights to authorized parties concerning your MidAmerican Energy account(s)/ services(s), MidAmerican Energy's customer authorization form
			offers this ability. Once completed and on file with MidAmerican Energy, the customer-authorized third party can receive account information or transact business with 
			MidAmerican Energy on your behalf.
Billing and Usage History Authorization Form
To authorize third-party access to billing and usage history information associated with your MidAmerican Energy account(s), complete the billing and usage history 
			authorization form. Once it’s on file with MidAmerican Energy, the designated third party can receive billing and usage history information on your behalf. 






Summary Billing



Any MidAmerican Energy customer with three or more accounts, excluding gas transportation accounts, is eligible for Summary Billing unless any of the following exists on an account:

A past due balance
An active landlord agreement

Benefits of Summary Billing

Receive one bill that summarizes individual account activity
Individual bills included to provide detailed information about each account
One due date
All bills are mailed together to a designated address
Submit one payment
Designate facilities or locations on the summary bill with a 15-character account identifier







Electronic Data Interchange





Guidelines
MidAmerican Energy’s EDI guidelines are developed from the Utility Industry Group subset of the American National Standards Institute Version 4010 X12 of the standards for the 810 invoice, 820 remittance advice and 997 functional acknowledgement documents.
The customer is responsible for costs associated with establishing the technology needed to successfully execute the billing and payment processing functions via EDI.
Communications Protocol
EDI communication between the customer and MidAmerican Energy will take place via File Transfer Protocol. MidAmerican Energy will create a folder, secured by a unique user ID and password for each customer, in which data files may be placed by the customer. For security purposes, customers using EDI must also provide the IP addresses of their sending server(s) to MidAmerican Energy. MidAmerican Energy will post documents to the customer’s server(s) the same way.
Data Encryption Method
Data must be encrypted using PGP version 2.6.2 or higher. The appropriate public keys will be exchanged between MidAmerican Energy and the customer in a separate email or by other methods agreed upon between MidAmerican Energy and the customer. Public keys can be updated at the request of either party no more than once a year. Additional updates to public keys are allowed if unpredictable circumstances warrant.


Payment Processing
Payments will be processed via ACH through the bank of the customer’s choice. A valid remittance to MidAmerican Energy is required of all ACH transactions on the same business day. Data exchange and payment processing tests are required of all customers prior to EDI certification.
Enrollment Information
For additional information about EDI or to determine if your business account(s) qualify, call business advantage at 800-329-6261, Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 6 p.m., excluding holidays, and a specialist will assist you.
Limitation of Liability
MidAmerican Energy Company is not liable for any direct, indirect, punitive, incidental, special or consequential damages, whether based on contract, tort, strict liability or otherwise, that may result from the use of this EDI. The user assumes all responsibility for any risks associated with use of this EDI or related services. Because some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of consequential or incidental damages, the above limitation may not apply.
If you prefer, provide your contact information using MidAmerican Energy's EDI Interest Form, and a specialist will contact you.

    Natural Gas Products


    Natural Gas for your Business
With MidAmerican Energy Services, you work with an experienced, professional team that has actively
served retail markets since 1986 (previously as MidAmerican Energy Company). We deliver
more than 32 billion cubic feet of natural gas to customers via six major interstate
pipelines.

Fixed Pricing
Eliminate your exposure to market price swings for all or portions of your load
with MidAmerican’s Fixed Price product. Fixed pricing allows you to set pricing
targets based on budgets or other economic considerations and then lock the price
of your gas supply when market conditions reflect those goals. The fixed-pricing
option combines two main components that also may be evaluated separately:

NYMEX Pricing:
    Natural gas futures are publicly traded and easily tracked on the New York Mercantile
    Exchange (NYMEX). The NYMEX component is based on physical delivery at Henry Hub
    in Louisiana. Through a supplier relationship, customers may fix pricing in this
    market for a variety of terms. The NYMEX pricing product is available to customers
    with basis pricing already in place.
    

 Basis Pricing:
    The basis component of your overall natural gas costs reflects the difference between
    the NYMEX futures price and the price for physical delivery in your location. This
    product option allows customers to lock in basis while allowing supply costs to
    float with the NYMEX index.

History[edit]
MidAmerican Energy was formed in 1995 by the merger of the Iowa-Illinois Gas and Electric Company with Midwest Resources.[2] Midwest Resources in turn, was formed in 1990 by the merger of Midwest Energy and Iowa Resources. Midwest Energy was the holding company for Iowa Public Service company (IPS), the main power provider for northwestern Iowa, while Iowa Resources was the holding company for Iowa Power and Light Company, the main power provider for central and southwestern Iowa.[3]
Walter Scott, Jr. Energy Center[edit]
MidAmerican Energy is the developer and operator of the Walter Scott, Jr. Energy Center, a four-unit coal-fired power plant based in Council Bluffs. It produces more than 1,600 megawatts of electricity.[4]
Renewable energy[edit]
In addition to traditional power plants, MidAmerican Energy began investing in green energy generation in 2004. As of March 2014, approximately 2,285 megawatts, or nearly 30 percent, of MidAmerican Energy’s total owned generation capacity came from energy generated by the company’s 1,267 wind turbines. In May 2013, MidAmerican Energy announced plans to invest up to $1.9 billion to expand its wind generation fleet and add up to 1,050 megawatts of wind generation in Iowa by year-end 2015. Siemens Wind Power, the manufacturer of the turbines, states that at the time (December 2013) this was the largest single order of onshore wind power turbines that any company had ever received.[5] Components for the turbines are manufactured at two different sites in Iowa and Kansas, and all turbines are to be sited in Iowa.[6] Once the expansion is complete, approximately 3,335 megawatts, or approximately 39 percent, of MidAmerican Energy’s total owned generation capacity will come from wind-powered generation from 1,715 wind turbines.[7] MidAmerican Energy projects that wind power will supply one third of its energy generation by 2020.[8] As of 2016, MAE operates 2 GW of SWP turbines and 1 GW GE Wind. In June 2016 MAE signed up for 2 GW in Iowa (Wind XI) supplied by Vestas in Colorado, estimated at $2.2 billion. On July 26, 2016, MAE agreed to supply power to Facebook, Microsoft and Google datacenters in Iowa from Wind XI.[9]

History[edit]
MidAmerican Energy was formed in 1995 by the merger of the Iowa-Illinois Gas and Electric Company with Midwest Resources.[2] Midwest Resources in turn, was formed in 1990 by the merger of Midwest Energy and Iowa Resources. Midwest Energy was the holding company for Iowa Public Service company (IPS), the main power provider for northwestern Iowa, while Iowa Resources was the holding company for Iowa Power and Light Company, the main power provider for central and southwestern Iowa.[3]
Walter Scott, Jr. Energy Center[edit]
MidAmerican Energy is the developer and operator of the Walter Scott, Jr. Energy Center, a four-unit coal-fired power plant based in Council Bluffs. It produces more than 1,600 megawatts of electricity.[4]
Renewable energy[edit]
In addition to traditional power plants, MidAmerican Energy began investing in green energy generation in 2004. As of March 2014, approximately 2,285 megawatts, or nearly 30 percent, of MidAmerican Energy’s total owned generation capacity came from energy generated by the company’s 1,267 wind turbines. In May 2013, MidAmerican Energy announced plans to invest up to $1.9 billion to expand its wind generation fleet and add up to 1,050 megawatts of wind generation in Iowa by year-end 2015. Siemens Wind Power, the manufacturer of the turbines, states that at the time (December 2013) this was the largest single order of onshore wind power turbines that any company had ever received.[5] Components for the turbines are manufactured at two different sites in Iowa and Kansas, and all turbines are to be sited in Iowa.[6] Once the expansion is complete, approximately 3,335 megawatts, or approximately 39 percent, of MidAmerican Energy’s total owned generation capacity will come from wind-powered generation from 1,715 wind turbines.[7] MidAmerican Energy projects that wind power will supply one third of its energy generation by 2020.[8] As of 2016, MAE operates 2 GW of SWP turbines and 1 GW GE Wind. In June 2016 MAE signed up for 2 GW in Iowa (Wind XI) supplied by Vestas in Colorado, estimated at $2.2 billion. On July 26, 2016, MAE agreed to supply power to Facebook, Microsoft and Google datacenters in Iowa from Wind XI.[9]

Our story




Gu-ru / ‘goroō /
Noun:
1. A mentor, a teacher, one who helps you move forward.
2. A source of inspiration and good energy.


GURU
A Story of Organic Growth
Ever since the early days, GURU has always been driven by this idea of crafting the best natural energy drink out there. Founded in Montreal during the summer of 1999 by four college friends, the company marketed the world's first all-natural energy drink.
More than 15 years later, this vision is not only fulfilled but is also thriving and expanding worldwide. GURU has become the #1 Organic Energy Drink in Canada and the US in the Health Channel thanks to a strong network of distribution partnerships and a passionate sales team. 
With research & development at the forefront of our expansion, GURU now tackles a new market and adventure with the recent introduction of our Energy Waters. This new line of product arrives just in time to satisfy a growing demand for organic sugar and calorie-free energy beverages.
In short, GURU has and will always believe that energy should not come at the expense of health. That is what has brought our company a steady and organic growth.
Our Philosophy
Through its corporate philosophy and its beverages, GURU gives good energy for people to make great things, reminding that, with the right dose of will, inspiration and energy, achieving great results is within everyone's reach. 
People today define themselves less by what they have and more by what they do and contribute to the world. Resourcefulness, imagination, inventiveness is today’s new currency. Whether using technology, natural ingredients or just plain common sense, people who Make it Good are the ones who seek to make everything better. We call them Makers.
They are pioneers that never settle. Makers, not followers. Crafters not manufacturers. Some may call them obsessed, exceptional or extraordinary people. But these are men and women who are true innovators, thought leaders and doers in their respective communities. They make the impossible possible.

Luc Martin-Privat
Our Brew Master
Meet Luc our Brew Master. He is the brains behind GURU.  In fact, while he could have become your friendly neighborhood pharmacist, Luc had other dreams…
From the functional herbs he started playing with in his dad’s lab to his PhD in Pharmacology, Luc has mastered the art of blending botanicals, an art he is now applying to our beloved GURU.
Always on the lookout for smart organics from around the world, Luc is looking into the GURU recipe “Organically” to make it perfect everytime! And when he is not looking at new ways to craft our GURU, Luc is dreaming about new products!
