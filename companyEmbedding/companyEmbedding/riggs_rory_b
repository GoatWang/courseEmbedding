Publication number:  20170169093
                                            

Abstract:  This application relates generally to defining a domain-specific syntax characterizing a functional information system and performing operations on data entities represented by the domain-specific syntax, including defining a domain-specific syntax, receiving and storing a domain-specific data entity, assigning a syntactic tag to the domain-specific data entity, and electronically storing the tag assigned to the data entity in the electronic data store so that the tag is logically linked to the stored data entity.
                        

Type: 
                                                    Application

Patent number:  9646075
                                            

Abstract:  A stratified or segmented composite data structure can be formed by selecting a group of data entities, stratifying or segmenting them according to attributes, and assigning relative weights to the components based on their stratified or segmented positions. The attributes are selected from a universe of possible values. Further positive and negative biases can be applied at any arbitrary point or position, including to individual data entities, groups of arbitrarily selected data entities, or arbitrary positions.

SEGMENTATION AND STRATIFICATION OF DATA ENTITIES IN A DATABASE SYSTEM



Publication number:  20160140211
                                            

Abstract:  A stratified or segmented composite data structure can be formed by selecting a group of data entities, stratifying or segmenting them according to attributes, and assigning relative weights to the components based on their stratified or segmented positions. The attributes are selected from a universe of possible values. Further positive and negative biases can be applied at any arbitrary point or position, including to individual data entities, groups of arbitrarily selected data entities, or arbitrary positions.

STRATIFIED COMPOSITE PORTFOLIOS OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES



Publication number:  20150134568
                                            

Abstract:  A stratified composite portfolio can be formed by selecting a group of investment securities, stratifying them according to attributes that correlate to a specific asset risk, and assigning relative portfolio weights to the components based on their stratified positions. The attributes are selected from a universe of possible values. Further positive and negative biases can be applied at any arbitrary point or stratified position, including to individual assets, groups of arbitrarily selected assets, or arbitrary stratification positions.
