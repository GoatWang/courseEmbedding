 FREMONT, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--

      Lam Research Corporation (NASDAQ: LRCX) today announced that Christine

      Heckart has joined the company's board of directors. Currently serving

      as chief marketing officer (CMO) at NetApp, Inc., a leading provider of

      data storage and management solutions, Heckart has developed innovative

      business strategies and driven growth in this capacity—as well as in her

      previous executive leadership positions at Microsoft Corp. and Juniper

      Networks, Inc.



      "I am pleased to welcome Christine as the newest member of the Lam

      background, Christine has executive experience in management, business

      development and product planning. She will be an excellent addition to

      our board."

    


      Heckart's accomplishments while in her current role as CMO at NetApp

      include introducing a new global integrated marketing model to increase

      the organization's impact to the business while also overseeing one of

      the company's largest product launches. Prior to her position at NetApp,

      Heckart served as general manager in Microsoft's TV, video and music

      business. Before that, she led global marketing at Juniper Networks, a

      networking technology leader, and was president at TeleChoice Inc., a

      global marketing consulting firm. She has received the 2009 Woman at

      Microsoft Women's Leadership Award and the prestigious 2004 American

      Business Stevie Award for best marketing team while at Juniper. Heckart

      is also the author of The Guide to Frame Relay Networking and

      co-author of ATM for Dummies. She holds a degree in economics

      from the University of Colorado at Boulder.
