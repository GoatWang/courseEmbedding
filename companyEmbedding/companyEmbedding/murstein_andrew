Early life and career[edit]
Andrew Mead Murstein was born in Roslyn, New York to Alvin and Aileen Murstein.[9] His grandfather of German descent, Leon Murstein, came to the United States from Argentina,[10] became a New York cabdriver and purchased one of the first New York taxi medallions, issued in 1937, for $10.[11][12][13] The family went on to purchase several hundred medallions for prices as little as $10 each—medallions peaked at over $1,300,000 each and currently sell for around $500,000 each.[14][15][16][17] [18]Murstein reportedly sold the majority of his medallions in 2012 and 2013 before Uber and Lyft affected the taxi medallion values, a claim that has not been independently verified. A subsidiary of Medallion Financial currently owns 159 Chicago medallions it values at $60,000 each, or approximately $9.54 million, but owes more than $22 million on them. The subsidiary is currently being sued in a New York court for failing to repay a loan on the Chicago medallions.[19]
Murstein’s introduction to the taxicab industry came early. His father, employed by his grandfather in his Queens-based taxi business, used to take young Andrew along to the taxi garage, where he was assigned to collect rentals for using the medallion from taxi drivers at the ends of their shifts. Murstein soon learned not to believe the excuses – such as a baby being born in the back of the cab – drivers often used for returning their taxis late.[20][21] Today, Murstein does not travel by taxi, instead relying on a private driver paid for by Medallion Financial since 2005.[22]
Andrew’s father and grandfather eventually owned more than 500 medallions. When they decided to sell some in the 1970s, no banks would provide the financing so that is when they got into the lending business. Banks would not lend to immigrants because they considered them too risky. They did not understand the character of the immigrant and were not aware of the value and security of a taxi medallion.[8][9][12] Medallion has since lent over $3 billion to the taxi industry, but has charged-off at least $27.6 million in medallion loans in 2016 alone.[23][11]According to regulatory filings, regulators required Medallion Bank to "take additional loan loss reserves for the quarter ended September 30, 2016" after a recent examination.[24] After increasing reserves, Medallion Bank was undercapitalized.[25]
In 1979, the Mursteins founded a family-owned company called Medallion Funding Corp. to build a taxi medallion lending business. Medallion Funding earned returns on investment over 20 percent per year.[21] More recently, Medallion Funding Corp. and its subsidiaries were sued in a New York court for failure to repay $8.8 million borrowed to finance Chicago medallions that are currently underwater.[19] As recently as March 2017, senior notes issued by Medallion Financial traded for just 70% of par value, a level that is indicative of severe financial distress.[26]
Later life and career[edit]
Andrew Murstein, after completing his studies at Tufts University and New York University, spent several years on Wall Street, including a stop at Salomon Brothers, where he learned the power of equity in funding a business. He joined Medallion Funding full-time in 1990 and eventually took the company public.[27]
In 1996, Murstein successfully launched Medallion Financial Corp., established to be the parent company of Medallion Funding, as a public company trading on the Nasdaq under the symbol MFIN.[11][28] The company has financed the purchase of thousands more in Newark, Cambridge, Philadelphia, Chicago, Boston and New York City, is an established industry leader.[9][29] But taxi loans are only a part of the story. The company also established or bought successful businesses that lend to a variety of small businesses such as dry cleaners, convenience stores, manufacturers, distributors, and later public companies.[11][12][16]
In 1994, Murstein invested $1-million to create a subsidiary which sold advertising on the tops of taxis. The subsidiary, eventually named Medallion Taxi Media, was enhanced in 1996 with the acquisition of See Level Advertising. Murstein sold Medallion Taxi Media to Clear Channel yielding $35 million in 2004.[27][28][29][30] About this time Medallion Financial Corp. set up its own bank, Medallion Bank, to fund many of the company’s endeavors.[31] Due to aggressive lending and outsize losses, the bank accepted TARP money in 2009. The bank's loan losses in 2008 were worse than 93% of banks in its peer group, according to the FFIEC.[32] In 2011, it accepted an investment from the U.S. Treasury, a security it has yet to repay. The bank currently pays a 9% after-tax dividend on this preferred security.[19]
In 2008, Murstein with former baseball star Hank Aaron and former New York Governor Mario Cuomo, both Medallion Financial board members, and former football star and Congressman Jack Kemp, now deceased, formed a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) which raised $230-million to buy a professional sports team. The SPAC reportedly bid for the Chicago Cubs and other sports properties but ended up not making a purchase because none of the properties the company evaluated had the right mix of profit potential and risk avoidance.[15][33] Later that same year Murstein organized and filed publicly a SPAC focused on the security industry and assembled a board of directors that included, former FBI director Louis Freeh, and initial head of Homeland Security and former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge.
On November 8, 2010, Medallion Financial Corp., as part of an investment group which includes Richard Petty and Douglas G. Bergeron, signed and closed sale on racing assets of one of NASCAR's great names, Richard Petty Motorsports.[34] Medallion is the largest owner of the team. In 2012, along with partners Richard Mack, and NFL legend, Jim Brown, Murstein acquired the Long Island Lizards of Major League Lacrosse, and renamed the team the New York Lizards. The team plays at Hofstra University on Long Island, and won the MLL championship for the third time in 2015.[33]The financial success of Richard Petty Motorsports is unknown; the company does not pay cash interest to Medallion Financial, opting to roll interest into the balance due.[19] Murstein publicly stated that Medallion may sell part of its motorsports stake in October 2016, but by December 2016 Richard Petty Motorsports made the decision to downsize to one car from two for the next racing season.[35][36]
Under Murstein’s leadership, Medallion today manages over $1.5 billion of investments.[34] The company has paid out over $250,000,000 in dividends to its shareholders since going public, but suspended dividends in 2017 due to losses from declining taxi medallion values.[3][14] In 2015, Murstein told Barron's that the chances of such a dividend cut were "slim to none."[37] Since the article was published, dividends have been cut twice, the latest cut from $0.05 to per share to zero.
Personal[edit]
Murstein is married to Barbara Lynn Rudnick;[21] they have two children, Kimberly and Matthew, and live in New York City.[38] Murstein, an avid sports fan, can frequently be seen at his table at the very exclusive Rao's Restaurant, where he frequently dines with Academy Award winner Leonardo DiCaprio and Hank Aaron, or in the front row at Madison Square Garden and Yankee Stadium, often with other bold faced names[39][40] Murstein also reportedly threw his son an epic bar mitzvah reception in 2015 with guests that included Governor Andrew Cuomo, Hank Aaron, and a special hour-long performance by Nicki Minaj.[41][42]

Early life and career[edit]
Andrew Mead Murstein was born in Roslyn, New York to Alvin and Aileen Murstein.[9] His grandfather of German descent, Leon Murstein, came to the United States from Argentina,[10] became a New York cabdriver and purchased one of the first New York taxi medallions, issued in 1937, for $10.[11][12][13] The family went on to purchase several hundred medallions for prices as little as $10 each—medallions peaked at over $1,300,000 each and currently sell for around $500,000 each.[14][15][16][17] [18]Murstein reportedly sold the majority of his medallions in 2012 and 2013 before Uber and Lyft affected the taxi medallion values, a claim that has not been independently verified. A subsidiary of Medallion Financial currently owns 159 Chicago medallions it values at $60,000 each, or approximately $9.54 million, but owes more than $22 million on them. The subsidiary is currently being sued in a New York court for failing to repay a loan on the Chicago medallions.[19]
Murstein’s introduction to the taxicab industry came early. His father, employed by his grandfather in his Queens-based taxi business, used to take young Andrew along to the taxi garage, where he was assigned to collect rentals for using the medallion from taxi drivers at the ends of their shifts. Murstein soon learned not to believe the excuses – such as a baby being born in the back of the cab – drivers often used for returning their taxis late.[20][21] Today, Murstein does not travel by taxi, instead relying on a private driver paid for by Medallion Financial since 2005.[22]
Andrew’s father and grandfather eventually owned more than 500 medallions. When they decided to sell some in the 1970s, no banks would provide the financing so that is when they got into the lending business. Banks would not lend to immigrants because they considered them too risky. They did not understand the character of the immigrant and were not aware of the value and security of a taxi medallion.[8][9][12] Medallion has since lent over $3 billion to the taxi industry, but has charged-off at least $27.6 million in medallion loans in 2016 alone.[23][11]According to regulatory filings, regulators required Medallion Bank to "take additional loan loss reserves for the quarter ended September 30, 2016" after a recent examination.[24] After increasing reserves, Medallion Bank was undercapitalized.[25]
In 1979, the Mursteins founded a family-owned company called Medallion Funding Corp. to build a taxi medallion lending business. Medallion Funding earned returns on investment over 20 percent per year.[21] More recently, Medallion Funding Corp. and its subsidiaries were sued in a New York court for failure to repay $8.8 million borrowed to finance Chicago medallions that are currently underwater.[19] As recently as March 2017, senior notes issued by Medallion Financial traded for just 70% of par value, a level that is indicative of severe financial distress.[26]
Later life and career[edit]
Andrew Murstein, after completing his studies at Tufts University and New York University, spent several years on Wall Street, including a stop at Salomon Brothers, where he learned the power of equity in funding a business. He joined Medallion Funding full-time in 1990 and eventually took the company public.[27]
In 1996, Murstein successfully launched Medallion Financial Corp., established to be the parent company of Medallion Funding, as a public company trading on the Nasdaq under the symbol MFIN.[11][28] The company has financed the purchase of thousands more in Newark, Cambridge, Philadelphia, Chicago, Boston and New York City, is an established industry leader.[9][29] But taxi loans are only a part of the story. The company also established or bought successful businesses that lend to a variety of small businesses such as dry cleaners, convenience stores, manufacturers, distributors, and later public companies.[11][12][16]
In 1994, Murstein invested $1-million to create a subsidiary which sold advertising on the tops of taxis. The subsidiary, eventually named Medallion Taxi Media, was enhanced in 1996 with the acquisition of See Level Advertising. Murstein sold Medallion Taxi Media to Clear Channel yielding $35 million in 2004.[27][28][29][30] About this time Medallion Financial Corp. set up its own bank, Medallion Bank, to fund many of the company’s endeavors.[31] Due to aggressive lending and outsize losses, the bank accepted TARP money in 2009. The bank's loan losses in 2008 were worse than 93% of banks in its peer group, according to the FFIEC.[32] In 2011, it accepted an investment from the U.S. Treasury, a security it has yet to repay. The bank currently pays a 9% after-tax dividend on this preferred security.[19]
In 2008, Murstein with former baseball star Hank Aaron and former New York Governor Mario Cuomo, both Medallion Financial board members, and former football star and Congressman Jack Kemp, now deceased, formed a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) which raised $230-million to buy a professional sports team. The SPAC reportedly bid for the Chicago Cubs and other sports properties but ended up not making a purchase because none of the properties the company evaluated had the right mix of profit potential and risk avoidance.[15][33] Later that same year Murstein organized and filed publicly a SPAC focused on the security industry and assembled a board of directors that included, former FBI director Louis Freeh, and initial head of Homeland Security and former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge.
On November 8, 2010, Medallion Financial Corp., as part of an investment group which includes Richard Petty and Douglas G. Bergeron, signed and closed sale on racing assets of one of NASCAR's great names, Richard Petty Motorsports.[34] Medallion is the largest owner of the team. In 2012, along with partners Richard Mack, and NFL legend, Jim Brown, Murstein acquired the Long Island Lizards of Major League Lacrosse, and renamed the team the New York Lizards. The team plays at Hofstra University on Long Island, and won the MLL championship for the third time in 2015.[33]The financial success of Richard Petty Motorsports is unknown; the company does not pay cash interest to Medallion Financial, opting to roll interest into the balance due.[19] Murstein publicly stated that Medallion may sell part of its motorsports stake in October 2016, but by December 2016 Richard Petty Motorsports made the decision to downsize to one car from two for the next racing season.[35][36]
Under Murstein’s leadership, Medallion today manages over $1.5 billion of investments.[34] The company has paid out over $250,000,000 in dividends to its shareholders since going public, but suspended dividends in 2017 due to losses from declining taxi medallion values.[3][14] In 2015, Murstein told Barron's that the chances of such a dividend cut were "slim to none."[37] Since the article was published, dividends have been cut twice, the latest cut from $0.05 to per share to zero.
Personal[edit]
Murstein is married to Barbara Lynn Rudnick;[21] they have two children, Kimberly and Matthew, and live in New York City.[38] Murstein, an avid sports fan, can frequently be seen at his table at the very exclusive Rao's Restaurant, where he frequently dines with Academy Award winner Leonardo DiCaprio and Hank Aaron, or in the front row at Madison Square Garden and Yankee Stadium, often with other bold faced names[39][40] Murstein also reportedly threw his son an epic bar mitzvah reception in 2015 with guests that included Governor Andrew Cuomo, Hank Aaron, and a special hour-long performance by Nicki Minaj.[41][42]

Andrew Mead Murstein was born in Roslyn, New York to Alvin and Aileen Murstein.[9] His grandfather of German descent, Leon Murstein, came to the United States from Argentina,[10] became a New York cabdriver and purchased one of the first New York taxi medallions, issued in 1937, for $10.[11][12][13] The family went on to purchase several hundred medallions for prices as little as $10 each—medallions peaked at over $1,300,000 each and currently sell for around $500,000 each.[14][15][16][17] [18]Murstein reportedly sold the majority of his medallions in 2012 and 2013 before Uber and Lyft affected the taxi medallion values, a claim that has not been independently verified. A subsidiary of Medallion Financial currently owns 159 Chicago medallions it values at $60,000 each, or approximately $9.54 million, but owes more than $22 million on them. The subsidiary is currently being sued in a New York court for failing to repay a loan on the Chicago medallions.[19]
Murstein’s introduction to the taxicab industry came early. His father, employed by his grandfather in his Queens-based taxi business, used to take young Andrew along to the taxi garage, where he was assigned to collect rentals for using the medallion from taxi drivers at the ends of their shifts. Murstein soon learned not to believe the excuses – such as a baby being born in the back of the cab – drivers often used for returning their taxis late.[20][21] Today, Murstein does not travel by taxi, instead relying on a private driver paid for by Medallion Financial since 2005.[22]
Andrew’s father and grandfather eventually owned more than 500 medallions. When they decided to sell some in the 1970s, no banks would provide the financing so that is when they got into the lending business. Banks would not lend to immigrants because they considered them too risky. They did not understand the character of the immigrant and were not aware of the value and security of a taxi medallion.[8][9][12] Medallion has since lent over $3 billion to the taxi industry, but has charged-off at least $27.6 million in medallion loans in 2016 alone.[23][11]According to regulatory filings, regulators required Medallion Bank to "take additional loan loss reserves for the quarter ended September 30, 2016" after a recent examination.[24] After increasing reserves, Medallion Bank was undercapitalized.[25]
In 1979, the Mursteins founded a family-owned company called Medallion Funding Corp. to build a taxi medallion lending business. Medallion Funding earned returns on investment over 20 percent per year.[21] More recently, Medallion Funding Corp. and its subsidiaries were sued in a New York court for failure to repay $8.8 million borrowed to finance Chicago medallions that are currently underwater.[19] As recently as March 2017, senior notes issued by Medallion Financial traded for just 70% of par value, a level that is indicative of severe financial distress.[26]
Later life and career[edit]
Andrew Murstein, after completing his studies at Tufts University and New York University, spent several years on Wall Street, including a stop at Salomon Brothers, where he learned the power of equity in funding a business. He joined Medallion Funding full-time in 1990 and eventually took the company public.[27]
In 1996, Murstein successfully launched Medallion Financial Corp., established to be the parent company of Medallion Funding, as a public company trading on the Nasdaq under the symbol MFIN.[11][28] The company has financed the purchase of thousands more in Newark, Cambridge, Philadelphia, Chicago, Boston and New York City, is an established industry leader.[9][29] But taxi loans are only a part of the story. The company also established or bought successful businesses that lend to a variety of small businesses such as dry cleaners, convenience stores, manufacturers, distributors, and later public companies.[11][12][16]
In 1994, Murstein invested $1-million to create a subsidiary which sold advertising on the tops of taxis. The subsidiary, eventually named Medallion Taxi Media, was enhanced in 1996 with the acquisition of See Level Advertising. Murstein sold Medallion Taxi Media to Clear Channel yielding $35 million in 2004.[27][28][29][30] About this time Medallion Financial Corp. set up its own bank, Medallion Bank, to fund many of the company’s endeavors.[31] Due to aggressive lending and outsize losses, the bank accepted TARP money in 2009. The bank's loan losses in 2008 were worse than 93% of banks in its peer group, according to the FFIEC.[32] In 2011, it accepted an investment from the U.S. Treasury, a security it has yet to repay. The bank currently pays a 9% after-tax dividend on this preferred security.[19]
In 2008, Murstein with former baseball star Hank Aaron and former New York Governor Mario Cuomo, both Medallion Financial board members, and former football star and Congressman Jack Kemp, now deceased, formed a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) which raised $230-million to buy a professional sports team. The SPAC reportedly bid for the Chicago Cubs and other sports properties but ended up not making a purchase because none of the properties the company evaluated had the right mix of profit potential and risk avoidance.[15][33] Later that same year Murstein organized and filed publicly a SPAC focused on the security industry and assembled a board of directors that included, former FBI director Louis Freeh, and initial head of Homeland Security and former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge.
On November 8, 2010, Medallion Financial Corp., as part of an investment group which includes Richard Petty and Douglas G. Bergeron, signed and closed sale on racing assets of one of NASCAR's great names, Richard Petty Motorsports.[34] Medallion is the largest owner of the team. In 2012, along with partners Richard Mack, and NFL legend, Jim Brown, Murstein acquired the Long Island Lizards of Major League Lacrosse, and renamed the team the New York Lizards. The team plays at Hofstra University on Long Island, and won the MLL championship for the third time in 2015.[33]The financial success of Richard Petty Motorsports is unknown; the company does not pay cash interest to Medallion Financial, opting to roll interest into the balance due.[19] Murstein publicly stated that Medallion may sell part of its motorsports stake in October 2016, but by December 2016 Richard Petty Motorsports made the decision to downsize to one car from two for the next racing season.[35][36]
Under Murstein’s leadership, Medallion today manages over $1.5 billion of investments.[34] The company has paid out over $250,000,000 in dividends to its shareholders since going public, but suspended dividends in 2017 due to losses from declining taxi medallion values.[3][14] In 2015, Murstein told Barron's that the chances of such a dividend cut were "slim to none."[37] Since the article was published, dividends have been cut twice, the latest cut from $0.05 to per share to zero.
Personal[edit]
Murstein is married to Barbara Lynn Rudnick;[21] they have two children, Kimberly and Matthew, and live in New York City.[38] Murstein, an avid sports fan, can frequently be seen at his table at the very exclusive Rao's Restaurant, where he frequently dines with Academy Award winner Leonardo DiCaprio and Hank Aaron, or in the front row at Madison Square Garden and Yankee Stadium, often with other bold faced names[39][40] Murstein also reportedly threw his son an epic bar mitzvah reception in 2015 with guests that included Governor Andrew Cuomo, Hank Aaron, and a special hour-long performance by Nicki Minaj.[41][42]

A subsidiary of Medallion Financial currently owns 159 Chicago medallions it values at $60,000 each, or approximately $9.54 million, but owes more than $22 million on them. The subsidiary is currently being sued in a New York court for failing to repay a loan on the Chicago medallions.[19]Murstein’s introduction to the taxicab industry came early. His father, employed by his grandfather in his Queens-based taxi business, used to take young Andrew along to the taxi garage, where he was assigned to collect rentals for using the medallion from taxi drivers at the ends of their shifts. Murstein soon learned not to believe the excuses – such as a baby being born in the back of the cab – drivers often used for returning their taxis late.[20][21] Today, Murstein does not travel by taxi, instead relying on a private driver paid for by Medallion Financial since 2005.[22]Andrew’s father and grandfather eventually owned more than 500 medallions. When they decided to sell some in the 1970s, no banks would provide the financing so that is when they got into the lending business. Banks would not lend to immigrants because they considered them too risky. They did not understand the character of the immigrant and were not aware of the value and security of a taxi medallion.[8][9][12] Medallion has since lent over $3 billion to the taxi industry, but has charged-off at least $27.6 million in medallion loans in 2016 alone.[23][11]According to regulatory filings, regulators required Medallion Bank to "take additional loan loss reserves for the quarter ended September 30, 2016" after a recent examination.[24] After increasing reserves, Medallion Bank was undercapitalized.[25]In 1979, the Mursteins founded a family-owned company called Medallion Funding Corp. to build a taxi medallion lending business. Medallion Funding earned returns on investment over 20 percent per year.[21] More recently, Medallion Funding Corp. and its subsidiaries were sued in a New York court for failure to repay $8.8 million borrowed to finance Chicago medallions that are currently underwater.[19] As recently as March 2017, senior notes issued by Medallion Financial traded for just 70% of par value, a level that is indicative of severe financial distress.[26]Later life and careerAndrew Murstein, after completing his studies at Tufts University and New York University, spent several years on Wall Street, including a stop at Salomon Brothers, where he learned the power of equity in funding a business.

The company also established or bought successful businesses that lend to a variety of small businesses such as dry cleaners, convenience stores, manufacturers, distributors, and later public companies.[11][12][16]In 1994, Murstein invested $1-million to create a subsidiary which sold advertising on the tops of taxis. The subsidiary, eventually named Medallion Taxi Media, was enhanced in 1996 with the acquisition of See Level Advertising. Murstein sold Medallion Taxi Media to Clear Channel yielding $35 million in 2004.[27][28][29][30] About this time Medallion Financial Corp. set up its own bank, Medallion Bank, to fund many of the company’s endeavors.[31] Due to aggressive lending and outsize losses, the bank accepted TARP money in 2009. The bank's loan losses in 2008 were worse than 93% of banks in its peer group, according to the FFIEC.[32] In 2011, it accepted an investment from the U.S. Treasury, a security it has yet to repay. The bank currently pays a 9% after-tax dividend on this preferred security.[19]In 2008, Murstein with former baseball star Hank Aaron and former New York Governor Mario Cuomo, both Medallion Financial board members, and former football star and Congressman Jack Kemp, now deceased, formed a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) which raised $230-million to buy a professional sports team. The SPAC reportedly bid for the Chicago Cubs and other sports properties but ended up not making a purchase because none of the properties the company evaluated had the right mix of profit potential and risk avoidance.[15][33] Later that same year Murstein organized and filed publicly a SPAC focused on the security industry and assembled a board of directors that included, former FBI director Louis Freeh, and initial head of Homeland Security and former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge.On November 8, 2010, Medallion Financial Corp., as part of an investment group which includes Richard Petty and Douglas G. Bergeron, signed and closed sale on racing assets of one of NASCAR's great names, Richard Petty Motorsports.[34] Medallion is the largest owner of the team. In 2012, along with partners Richard Mack, and NFL legend, Jim Brown, Murstein acquired the Long Island Lizards of Major League Lacrosse, and renamed the team the New York Lizards. The team plays at Hofstra University on Long Island, and won the MLL championship for the third time in 2015.[33]The financial success of Richard Petty Motorsports is unknown; the company does not pay cash interest to Medallion Financial, opting to roll interest into the balance due.[19] Murstein publicly stated that Medallion may sell part of its motorsports stake in October 2016, but by December 2016 Richard Petty Motorsports made the decision to downsize to one car from two for the next racing season.[35][36]Under Murstein’s leadership, Medallion today manages over $1.5 billion of investments.[34] The company has paid out over $250,000,000 in dividends to its shareholders since going public, but suspended dividends in 2017 due to losses from declining taxi medallion values.[3][14] In 2015, Murstein told Barron's that the chances of such a dividend cut were "slim to none."[37] Since the article was published, dividends have been cut twice, the latest cut from $0.05 to per share to zero.PersonalMurstein is married to Barbara Lynn Rudnick;[21] they have two children, Kimberly and Matthew, and live in New York City.[38] Murstein, an avid sports fan, can frequently be seen at his table at the very exclusive Rao's Restaurant, where he frequently dines with Academy Award winner Leonardo DiCaprio and Hank Aaron, or in the front row at Madison Square Garden and Yankee Stadium, often with other bold faced names[39][40] Murstein also reportedly threw his son an epic bar mitzvah reception in 2015 with guests that included Governor Andrew Cuomo, Hank Aaron, and a special hour-long performance by Nicki Minaj.[41][42]References^ a b https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/04/style/andrew-murstein-weds-miss-rudnick.html^ a b Forbes magazine online profile posted online 2008, retrieved Feb. 24, 2010 (http://people.forbes.com/profile/andrew-m-murstein/52215)^ a b Medallion Financial Corp.

Richard Petty Motorsports









Andrew Murstein Co-Owner








Andrew Murstein is the founder, president and largest shareholder of the Medallion Financial Corporation. Under Murstein’s leadership, today Medallion manages over $1 Billion in investments. Murstein has been named among Crain’s New York Business’ “40 Under 40”. In late 2010, Medallion Financial was one of several parties involved in the purchase of Richard Petty Motorsports. Murstein lives in New York City with his wife Barbara Rudnick. They have two children, Kimberly and Matthew.
Murstein was born in Roslyn, N.Y. His grandfather, Leon Murstein, became a New York cab driver and purchased one of the first New York taxi medallions, issued in 1937. Andrew’s introduction into the taxicab industry came early. His father, employed by his grandfather in his Queens-based taxi business, took a young Andrew to the taxi garage, where he was assigned the task of collecting rentals for the use of the medallions from the drivers at the end of their shifts.
Andrew’s family eventually owned more than 500 medallions and made the decision to sell some of them in the 1970s. Unfortunately, they were unable to find a bank willing to provide the financing. This was the trigger that provoked them to get involved in the lending business. In 1979, the Mursteins founded a family-owned company called Medallion Funding Corp. Medallion has since lent over $3 billion to the taxi industry.
In 1994, Murstein created a subsidiary, eventually named Medallion Taxi Media, which sold advertising on the top of taxis. Murstein sold that portion of the business to Clear Channel in 2004 for $35 million.
In 1996, Murstein successfully launched Medallion Financial Corporation, which was established to be the parent company of Medallion Funding, as a public company trading on the NASDAQ under the symbol TAXI. The company owns and leases several hundred medallions and has financed the purchase of thousands more in Newark, NJ, Cambridge, MA, Philadelphia, Chicago, Boston and New York City. The company is also involved in a variety of small businesses, including dry cleaners, convenience stores, manufacturers and distributors.

Andrew Murstein was a big sports fan growing up on Long Island, but he wanted to be more than just a cheering spectator. While many sports fans wonder what it would be like to own a professional sports franchise, it was more than just a dream for Murstein. It was one of his missions in life.
“I had three business goals growing up,” said Murstein. “One was to own a sports team, one was to own a bank, and the third was to get involved in politics. So we’ve accomplished two of the three.”
The only thing that Murstein has left on his to-do list is politics.

In 1979, Murstein’s family founded Medallion Funding Corporation, a company that has lent over $3 billion to the taxi industry. Then, in 1996, Murstein launched Medallion Financial Corporation, a company that owns and leases several hundred taxi medallions while financing the purchase of thousands more.
Murstein entered the sports business in 2010 when he joined the NASCAR world spearheading a group that purchased Richard Petty Motorsports. The group currently has two cars in the Sprint Cup Series and one in the Nationwide Series.
Then, in 2012, Murstein and a group of investors including Pro Football Hall of Famer Jim Brown bought the Long Island Lizards of Major League Lacrosse.
Murstein started looking at sports ownership about 10 years ago. While taxi medallions are very profitable, he came to realize that sports franchises are not.
He had a chance to buy some teams, but didn’t pull the trigger because the numbers didn’t add up. He was always determined to buy a team, but it had to make sense.
Long before he purchased the Lizards, Murstein was in negotiations to buy the Arena Football League’s New York Dragons. But after taking a good look at the economics, Murstein and company decided not to buy the team.
“In the sports world, if an owner wants to sell, there’s usually a reason behind it,” said Murstein. “In the Dragons’ case, the more we looked at it, the worse the economics looked, so we did not go forward.”
Murstein made a great decision. Not long after that, the Dragons and the Arena Football League went out of business.
In 2008, Murstein and his group raised $220 million for a sports fund. They looked at several clubs that were up for sale and submitted offers to buy the Montreal Canadiens and Chicago Cubs. His quest for a sports franchise came to fruition when he acquired the Lizards.
Murstein is banking, no pun intended, on the potential of one of the fastest-growing sports in the United States.

“It’s a great family sport,” said Murstein. “They’re really good guys. In other sports you have issues with guys carrying guns into clubs, and drugs, and here these are Princeton, Yale, Johns Hopkins …really bright guys. They do it for the love of the sport.”
They are clearly not doing it for the money, because the average salary for a Lizards player is $10,000. They work another job during the week and then they play for the Lizards on the weekends. From a business standpoint, lacrosse bears a strong resemblance to minor -league baseball.
“It’s an inexpensive sport to attend,” said Murstein. “It’s something that has a lot of upside because a lot of the media stations are looking for additional programming. We figured that over time, this will be attractive to them.”
Murstein’s investment in the Lizards could see another big payoff a year from now. With the Islanders departing Nassau County for Barclays Center in Brooklyn, the Lizards could reap the benefits in terms of sponsorships from Long Island-based companies.
“From a business standpoint, it’s great for us,” said Murstein. “We’re going after a lot of their fan base now for season tickets, and we’re going after a lot of their sponsors once they leave.”
For Murstein, owning a team has been on-the-job training. At the World Series 10 years ago, Murstein picked the brain of MLB Commissioner Bud Selig in the event that he would one day own a team.
“His advice was, ‘Once you own a team, do nothing for the first year or two until you learn it and then start making decisions,'” said Murstein.
Shortly after buying the Lizards, who play their home games at Shuart Stadium at Hofstra University on Long Island, he didn’t listen to Selig’s advice. In an attempt to expand the team’s fan base, Murstein decided to move some of the home games to Icahn Stadium on Randall’s Island for the 2013 season.
The name of the team was also changed from the Long Island Lizards to the New York Lizards.
“It backfired,” said Murstein of his decision to move games west. “New York City has a lot more people but they have way too many options. Long Island’s fan base for lacrosse is really east of Nassau County, not west.”
So this year, the Lizards will play exclusively on Long Island. Hofstra will host six of the seven home games, including their April 27 home opener against the Rochester Rattlers. The team will also head east for one home game on July 27 at Lavalle Stadium on the campus of Stony Brook University.
When attending a Lizards home game, don’t be surprised if you see the owner walking around. Murstein wants to make sure that the fans have a quality experience, so he takes a look at things like the lines at will call and for food. If they’re too long, he’ll call people on his staff to correct the problem.
“I try to make sure everything clicks right for the consumer,” said Murstein.
It should be an enjoyable season for Lizards fans. The squad includes multiple winners of the Tewaaraton Trophy, which is the college-lacrosse equivalent of the Heisman. Among their top players are Long Islanders Max Seibald and Rob Pannell, who is the all-time leading scorer in the history of college lacrosse. The Lizards also traded for Ned Crotty. who was an All-American at Duke where he won a national championship.
“I think we’ve got a great team this year,” said Murstein, who sounds like he has a little George Steinbrenner in him. “The goal, as a Yankees fan growing up, was to emulate the star power of the Yankees here. Immediately I said to the coach (Joe Spallina) that he could spend as much as you want and get us the best talent possible. We want the superstars to play here. It’s good for us. It’s good for the league.”
So what kind of owner is Murstein? While he appreciates the passion that “The Boss” had, he’s not about to tell his lacrosse people what to do.
“I will never make a recommendation to them to make a trade or to go after somebody,” said Murstein. “All the decisions really get left to the people that know what they’re doing, and that’s not me.”
Now there’s a good business decision made by a good businessman. With decisions like that, it wouldn’t be surprising to see Murstein standing on a podium in Atlanta on August 23, accepting a trophy after the Lizards just won the MLL Championship Game.
It also won’t be shocking if Murstein winds up owning a team from the four major sports. I can think of a few teams that can certainly benefit from his passion and decision-making!

Early life and career[edit]
Andrew Mead Murstein was born in Roslyn, New York to Alvin and Aileen Murstein.[9] His grandfather of German descent, Leon Murstein, came to the United States from Argentina,[10] became a New York cabdriver and purchased one of the first New York taxi medallions, issued in 1937, for $10.[11][12][13] The family went on to purchase several hundred medallions for prices as little as $10 each—medallions peaked at over $1,300,000 each and currently sell for around $500,000 each.[14][15][16][17] [18]Murstein reportedly sold the majority of his medallions in 2012 and 2013 before Uber and Lyft affected the taxi medallion values, a claim that has not been independently verified. A subsidiary of Medallion Financial currently owns 159 Chicago medallions it values at $60,000 each, or approximately $9.54 million, but owes more than $22 million on them. The subsidiary is currently being sued in a New York court for failing to repay a loan on the Chicago medallions.[19]
Murstein’s introduction to the taxicab industry came early. His father, employed by his grandfather in his Queens-based taxi business, used to take young Andrew along to the taxi garage, where he was assigned to collect rentals for using the medallion from taxi drivers at the ends of their shifts. Murstein soon learned not to believe the excuses – such as a baby being born in the back of the cab – drivers often used for returning their taxis late.[20][21] Today, Murstein does not travel by taxi, instead relying on a private driver paid for by Medallion Financial since 2005.[22]
Andrew’s father and grandfather eventually owned more than 500 medallions. When they decided to sell some in the 1970s, no banks would provide the financing so that is when they got into the lending business. Banks would not lend to immigrants because they considered them too risky. They did not understand the character of the immigrant and were not aware of the value and security of a taxi medallion.[8][9][12] Medallion has since lent over $3 billion to the taxi industry, but has charged-off at least $27.6 million in medallion loans in 2016 alone.[23][11]According to regulatory filings, regulators required Medallion Bank to "take additional loan loss reserves for the quarter ended September 30, 2016" after a recent examination.[24] After increasing reserves, Medallion Bank was undercapitalized.[25]
In 1979, the Mursteins founded a family-owned company called Medallion Funding Corp. to build a taxi medallion lending business. Medallion Funding earned returns on investment over 20 percent per year.[21] More recently, Medallion Funding Corp. and its subsidiaries were sued in a New York court for failure to repay $8.8 million borrowed to finance Chicago medallions that are currently underwater.[19] As recently as March 2017, senior notes issued by Medallion Financial traded for just 70% of par value, a level that is indicative of severe financial distress.[26]
Later life and career[edit]
Andrew Murstein, after completing his studies at Tufts University and New York University, spent several years on Wall Street, including a stop at Salomon Brothers, where he learned the power of equity in funding a business. He joined Medallion Funding full-time in 1990 and eventually took the company public.[27]
In 1996, Murstein successfully launched Medallion Financial Corp., established to be the parent company of Medallion Funding, as a public company trading on the Nasdaq under the symbol MFIN.[11][28] The company has financed the purchase of thousands more in Newark, Cambridge, Philadelphia, Chicago, Boston and New York City, is an established industry leader.[9][29] But taxi loans are only a part of the story. The company also established or bought successful businesses that lend to a variety of small businesses such as dry cleaners, convenience stores, manufacturers, distributors, and later public companies.[11][12][16]
In 1994, Murstein invested $1-million to create a subsidiary which sold advertising on the tops of taxis. The subsidiary, eventually named Medallion Taxi Media, was enhanced in 1996 with the acquisition of See Level Advertising. Murstein sold Medallion Taxi Media to Clear Channel yielding $35 million in 2004.[27][28][29][30] About this time Medallion Financial Corp. set up its own bank, Medallion Bank, to fund many of the company’s endeavors.[31] Due to aggressive lending and outsize losses, the bank accepted TARP money in 2009. The bank's loan losses in 2008 were worse than 93% of banks in its peer group, according to the FFIEC.[32] In 2011, it accepted an investment from the U.S. Treasury, a security it has yet to repay. The bank currently pays a 9% after-tax dividend on this preferred security.[19]
In 2008, Murstein with former baseball star Hank Aaron and former New York Governor Mario Cuomo, both Medallion Financial board members, and former football star and Congressman Jack Kemp, now deceased, formed a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) which raised $230-million to buy a professional sports team. The SPAC reportedly bid for the Chicago Cubs and other sports properties but ended up not making a purchase because none of the properties the company evaluated had the right mix of profit potential and risk avoidance.[15][33] Later that same year Murstein organized and filed publicly a SPAC focused on the security industry and assembled a board of directors that included, former FBI director Louis Freeh, and initial head of Homeland Security and former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge.
On November 8, 2010, Medallion Financial Corp., as part of an investment group which includes Richard Petty and Douglas G. Bergeron, signed and closed sale on racing assets of one of NASCAR's great names, Richard Petty Motorsports.[34] Medallion is the largest owner of the team. In 2012, along with partners Richard Mack, and NFL legend, Jim Brown, Murstein acquired the Long Island Lizards of Major League Lacrosse, and renamed the team the New York Lizards. The team plays at Hofstra University on Long Island, and won the MLL championship for the third time in 2015.[33]The financial success of Richard Petty Motorsports is unknown; the company does not pay cash interest to Medallion Financial, opting to roll interest into the balance due.[19] Murstein publicly stated that Medallion may sell part of its motorsports stake in October 2016, but by December 2016 Richard Petty Motorsports made the decision to downsize to one car from two for the next racing season.[35][36]
Under Murstein’s leadership, Medallion today manages over $1.5 billion of investments.[34] The company has paid out over $250,000,000 in dividends to its shareholders since going public, but suspended dividends in 2017 due to losses from declining taxi medallion values.[3][14] In 2015, Murstein told Barron's that the chances of such a dividend cut were "slim to none."[37] Since the article was published, dividends have been cut twice, the latest cut from $0.05 to per share to zero.
Personal[edit]
Murstein is married to Barbara Lynn Rudnick;[21] they have two children, Kimberly and Matthew, and live in New York City.[38] Murstein, an avid sports fan, can frequently be seen at his table at the very exclusive Rao's Restaurant, where he frequently dines with Academy Award winner Leonardo DiCaprio and Hank Aaron, or in the front row at Madison Square Garden and Yankee Stadium, often with other bold faced names[39][40] Murstein also reportedly threw his son an epic bar mitzvah reception in 2015 with guests that included Governor Andrew Cuomo, Hank Aaron, and a special hour-long performance by Nicki Minaj.[41][42]

Early life and career[edit]
Andrew Mead Murstein was born in Roslyn, New York to Alvin and Aileen Murstein.[9] His grandfather of German descent, Leon Murstein, came to the United States from Argentina,[10] became a New York cabdriver and purchased one of the first New York taxi medallions, issued in 1937, for $10.[11][12][13] The family went on to purchase several hundred medallions for prices as little as $10 each—medallions peaked at over $1,300,000 each and currently sell for around $500,000 each.[14][15][16][17] [18]Murstein reportedly sold the majority of his medallions in 2012 and 2013 before Uber and Lyft affected the taxi medallion values, a claim that has not been independently verified. A subsidiary of Medallion Financial currently owns 159 Chicago medallions it values at $60,000 each, or approximately $9.54 million, but owes more than $22 million on them. The subsidiary is currently being sued in a New York court for failing to repay a loan on the Chicago medallions.[19]
Murstein’s introduction to the taxicab industry came early. His father, employed by his grandfather in his Queens-based taxi business, used to take young Andrew along to the taxi garage, where he was assigned to collect rentals for using the medallion from taxi drivers at the ends of their shifts. Murstein soon learned not to believe the excuses – such as a baby being born in the back of the cab – drivers often used for returning their taxis late.[20][21] Today, Murstein does not travel by taxi, instead relying on a private driver paid for by Medallion Financial since 2005.[22]
Andrew’s father and grandfather eventually owned more than 500 medallions. When they decided to sell some in the 1970s, no banks would provide the financing so that is when they got into the lending business. Banks would not lend to immigrants because they considered them too risky. They did not understand the character of the immigrant and were not aware of the value and security of a taxi medallion.[8][9][12] Medallion has since lent over $3 billion to the taxi industry, but has charged-off at least $27.6 million in medallion loans in 2016 alone.[23][11]According to regulatory filings, regulators required Medallion Bank to "take additional loan loss reserves for the quarter ended September 30, 2016" after a recent examination.[24] After increasing reserves, Medallion Bank was undercapitalized.[25]
In 1979, the Mursteins founded a family-owned company called Medallion Funding Corp. to build a taxi medallion lending business. Medallion Funding earned returns on investment over 20 percent per year.[21] More recently, Medallion Funding Corp. and its subsidiaries were sued in a New York court for failure to repay $8.8 million borrowed to finance Chicago medallions that are currently underwater.[19] As recently as March 2017, senior notes issued by Medallion Financial traded for just 70% of par value, a level that is indicative of severe financial distress.[26]
Later life and career[edit]
Andrew Murstein, after completing his studies at Tufts University and New York University, spent several years on Wall Street, including a stop at Salomon Brothers, where he learned the power of equity in funding a business. He joined Medallion Funding full-time in 1990 and eventually took the company public.[27]
In 1996, Murstein successfully launched Medallion Financial Corp., established to be the parent company of Medallion Funding, as a public company trading on the Nasdaq under the symbol MFIN.[11][28] The company has financed the purchase of thousands more in Newark, Cambridge, Philadelphia, Chicago, Boston and New York City, is an established industry leader.[9][29] But taxi loans are only a part of the story. The company also established or bought successful businesses that lend to a variety of small businesses such as dry cleaners, convenience stores, manufacturers, distributors, and later public companies.[11][12][16]
In 1994, Murstein invested $1-million to create a subsidiary which sold advertising on the tops of taxis. The subsidiary, eventually named Medallion Taxi Media, was enhanced in 1996 with the acquisition of See Level Advertising. Murstein sold Medallion Taxi Media to Clear Channel yielding $35 million in 2004.[27][28][29][30] About this time Medallion Financial Corp. set up its own bank, Medallion Bank, to fund many of the company’s endeavors.[31] Due to aggressive lending and outsize losses, the bank accepted TARP money in 2009. The bank's loan losses in 2008 were worse than 93% of banks in its peer group, according to the FFIEC.[32] In 2011, it accepted an investment from the U.S. Treasury, a security it has yet to repay. The bank currently pays a 9% after-tax dividend on this preferred security.[19]
In 2008, Murstein with former baseball star Hank Aaron and former New York Governor Mario Cuomo, both Medallion Financial board members, and former football star and Congressman Jack Kemp, now deceased, formed a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) which raised $230-million to buy a professional sports team. The SPAC reportedly bid for the Chicago Cubs and other sports properties but ended up not making a purchase because none of the properties the company evaluated had the right mix of profit potential and risk avoidance.[15][33] Later that same year Murstein organized and filed publicly a SPAC focused on the security industry and assembled a board of directors that included, former FBI director Louis Freeh, and initial head of Homeland Security and former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge.
On November 8, 2010, Medallion Financial Corp., as part of an investment group which includes Richard Petty and Douglas G. Bergeron, signed and closed sale on racing assets of one of NASCAR's great names, Richard Petty Motorsports.[34] Medallion is the largest owner of the team. In 2012, along with partners Richard Mack, and NFL legend, Jim Brown, Murstein acquired the Long Island Lizards of Major League Lacrosse, and renamed the team the New York Lizards. The team plays at Hofstra University on Long Island, and won the MLL championship for the third time in 2015.[33]The financial success of Richard Petty Motorsports is unknown; the company does not pay cash interest to Medallion Financial, opting to roll interest into the balance due.[19] Murstein publicly stated that Medallion may sell part of its motorsports stake in October 2016, but by December 2016 Richard Petty Motorsports made the decision to downsize to one car from two for the next racing season.[35][36]
Under Murstein’s leadership, Medallion today manages over $1.5 billion of investments.[34] The company has paid out over $250,000,000 in dividends to its shareholders since going public, but suspended dividends in 2017 due to losses from declining taxi medallion values.[3][14] In 2015, Murstein told Barron's that the chances of such a dividend cut were "slim to none."[37] Since the article was published, dividends have been cut twice, the latest cut from $0.05 to per share to zero.
Personal[edit]
Murstein is married to Barbara Lynn Rudnick;[21] they have two children, Kimberly and Matthew, and live in New York City.[38] Murstein, an avid sports fan, can frequently be seen at his table at the very exclusive Rao's Restaurant, where he frequently dines with Academy Award winner Leonardo DiCaprio and Hank Aaron, or in the front row at Madison Square Garden and Yankee Stadium, often with other bold faced names[39][40] Murstein also reportedly threw his son an epic bar mitzvah reception in 2015 with guests that included Governor Andrew Cuomo, Hank Aaron, and a special hour-long performance by Nicki Minaj.[41][42]

His father, employed by his grandfather in his Queens-based taxi business, used to take young Andrew along to the taxi garage, where he was assigned to collect rentals for using the medallion from taxi drivers at the ends of their shifts. Murstein soon learned not to believe the excuses – such as a baby being born in the back of the cab – drivers often used for returning their taxis late.[20][21] Today, Murstein does not travel by taxi, instead relying on a private driver paid for by Medallion Financial since 2005.[22]
Andrew’s father and grandfather eventually owned more than 500 medallions. When they decided to sell some in the 1970s, no banks would provide the financing so that is when they got into the lending business. Banks would not lend to immigrants because they considered them too risky. They did not understand the character of the immigrant and were not aware of the value and security of a taxi medallion.[8][9][12] Medallion has since lent over $3 billion to the taxi industry, but has charged-off at least $27.6 million in medallion loans in 2016 alone.[23][11]According to regulatory filings, regulators required Medallion Bank to "take additional loan loss reserves for the quarter ended September 30, 2016" after a recent examination.[24] After increasing reserves, Medallion Bank was undercapitalized.[25]
In 1979, the Mursteins founded a family-owned company called Medallion Funding Corp. to build a taxi medallion lending business. Medallion Funding earned returns on investment over 20 percent per year.[21] More recently, Medallion Funding Corp. and its subsidiaries were sued in a New York court for failure to repay $8.8 million borrowed to finance Chicago medallions that are currently underwater.[19] As recently as March 2017, senior notes issued by Medallion Financial traded for just 70% of par value, a level that is indicative of severe financial distress.[26]
Later life and career[edit]
Andrew Murstein, after completing his studies at Tufts University and New York University, spent several years on Wall Street, including a stop at Salomon Brothers, where he learned the power of equity in funding a business. He joined Medallion Funding full-time in 1990 and eventually took the company public.[27]
In 1996, Murstein successfully launched Medallion Financial Corp., established to be the parent company of Medallion Funding, as a public company trading on the Nasdaq under the symbol MFIN.[11][28] The company has financed the purchase of thousands more in Newark, Cambridge, Philadelphia, Chicago, Boston and New York City, is an established industry leader.[9][29] But taxi loans are only a part of the story. The company also established or bought successful businesses that lend to a variety of small businesses such as dry cleaners, convenience stores, manufacturers, distributors, and later public companies.[11][12][16]
In 1994, Murstein invested $1-million to create a subsidiary which sold advertising on the tops of taxis. The subsidiary, eventually named Medallion Taxi Media, was enhanced in 1996 with the acquisition of See Level Advertising. Murstein sold Medallion Taxi Media to Clear Channel yielding $35 million in 2004.[27][28][29][30] About this time Medallion Financial Corp. set up its own bank, Medallion Bank, to fund many of the company’s endeavors.[31] Due to aggressive lending and outsize losses, the bank accepted TARP money in 2009. The bank's loan losses in 2008 were worse than 93% of banks in its peer group, according to the FFIEC.[32] In 2011, it accepted an investment from the U.S. Treasury, a security it has yet to repay. The bank currently pays a 9% after-tax dividend on this preferred security.[19]
In 2008, Murstein with former baseball star Hank Aaron and former New York Governor Mario Cuomo, both Medallion Financial board members, and former football star and Congressman Jack Kemp, now deceased, formed a special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) which raised $230-million to buy a professional sports team. The SPAC reportedly bid for the Chicago Cubs and other sports properties but ended up not making a purchase because none of the properties the company evaluated had the right mix of profit potential and risk avoidance.[15][33] Later that same year Murstein organized and filed publicly a SPAC focused on the security industry and assembled a board of directors that included, former FBI director Louis Freeh, and initial head of Homeland Security and former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge.
On November 8, 2010, Medallion Financial Corp., as part of an investment group which includes Richard Petty and Douglas G. Bergeron, signed and closed sale on racing assets of one of NASCAR's great names, Richard Petty Motorsports.[34] Medallion is the largest owner of the team. In 2012, along with partners Richard Mack, and NFL legend, Jim Brown, Murstein acquired the Long Island Lizards of Major League Lacrosse, and renamed the team the New York Lizards. The team plays at Hofstra University on Long Island, and won the MLL championship for the third time in 2015.[33]The financial success of Richard Petty Motorsports is unknown; the company does not pay cash interest to Medallion Financial, opting to roll interest into the balance due.[19] Murstein publicly stated that Medallion may sell part of its motorsports stake in October 2016, but by December 2016 Richard Petty Motorsports made the decision to downsize to one car from two for the next racing season.[35][36]
Under Murstein’s leadership, Medallion today manages over $1.5 billion of investments.[34] The company has paid out over $250,000,000 in dividends to its shareholders since going public, but suspended dividends in 2017 due to losses from declining taxi medallion values.[3][14] In 2015, Murstein told Barron's that the chances of such a dividend cut were "slim to none."[37] Since the article was published, dividends have been cut twice, the latest cut from $0.05 to per share to zero.
Personal[edit]
Murstein is married to Barbara Lynn Rudnick;[21] they have two children, Kimberly and Matthew, and live in New York City.[38] Murstein, an avid sports fan, can frequently be seen at his table at the very exclusive Rao's Restaurant, where he frequently dines with Academy Award winner Leonardo DiCaprio and Hank Aaron, or in the front row at Madison Square Garden and Yankee Stadium, often with other bold faced names[39][40] Murstein also reportedly threw his son an epic bar mitzvah reception in 2015 with guests that included Governor Andrew Cuomo, Hank Aaron, and a special hour-long performance by Nicki Minaj.[41][42]

Early life and career[edit]
Andrew Mead Murstein was born in Roslyn, New York to Alvin and Aileen Murstein.[9] His grandfather of German descent, Leon Murstein, came to the United States from Argentina,[10] became a New York cabdriver and purchased one of the first New York taxi medallions, issued in 1937, for $10.[11][12][13] The family went on to purchase several hundred medallions for prices as little as $10 each—medallions peaked at over $1,300,000 each and currently sell for around $500,000 each.[14][15][16][17] [18]Murstein reportedly sold the majority of his medallions in 2012 and 2013 before Uber and Lyft affected the taxi medallion values, a claim that has not been independently verified. A subsidiary of Medallion Financial currently owns 159 Chicago medallions it values at $60,000 each, or approximately $9.54 million, but owes more than $22 million on them. The subsidiary is currently being sued in a New York court for failing to repay a loan on the Chicago medallions.[19]
Murstein’s introduction to the taxicab industry came early. His father, employed by his grandfather in his Queens-based taxi business, used to take young Andrew along to the taxi garage, where he was assigned to collect rentals for using the medallion from taxi drivers at the ends of their shifts.

The Medallion Financial Story



			by Christopher Moraff		

May/June 2008

Seventy years ago, a Polish immigrant named Leon Murstein bought a single taxicab and started the company that would become Medallion Financial. Today, with nearly $1 billion worth of loans under its belt, this family business is still about making dreams come true one taxicab at a time.













 
 
 
 Andrew Murstein President, Medallion Financial
Andrew Murstein knows a thing or two about the American Dream. When his grandfather Leon came to this country from Poland in the 1930s, he brought little with him beyond a drive to make a better life for himself. To this end, he started his own company with a single taxi license in 1937. It cost him $10 and he drove the cab himself.
By the 1970s, that single cab had turned into a fleet of nearly 500. At 42, Murstein, together with his father Alvin, runs the company his grandfather founded; and as president of the New York’s Medallion Financial, has taken one man’s dream, and turned it into a vehicle for hundreds more.
It was in 1979, Murstein explains, that the successful taxi business made its initial transition into commercial lending. “When my father got involved in the business, he wanted to sell some [taxis] to take some chips off the table and no banks would provide financing for the buyers of those medallions so he had to take back the paper himself,” he says. “That’s how our finance company started.”
Today, the company’s motto, “In Niches There Are Riches,” could not be more relevant. Since his father’s foray into commercial finance, Medallion has launched two new units and an industrial bank. The company went public in 1996, and trades on the Nasdaq under the ticker symbol TAXI.
But the company makes its bread-and-butter in an industry few outside the transit world are aware exists. Most of us have seen the little metallic plaque on the front of taxicabs, but few understand exactly what it represents.
For a taxi owner, a medallion is like a ticket to the big time. Drivers save for years to get one, and having one means no longer paying a flat rate to drive someone else’s cab for 12 hours a day. Medallion Funding, the company’s taxi lending arm, offers financing to both fleet operators and single cab owners.
The medallion system was created in 1937 when New York’s Board of Aldermen adopted the Haas Act, which placed a moratorium on the issuance of new taxicab licenses. According to Bruce Schaller, a former industry consultant who now serves as New York’s Deputy Commissioner for Planning and Sustainability, the system was crafted to address an overabundance of taxis that had depressed driver earnings and congested city streets.
Beyond placing a cap on medallions, the Hass Act provided for the automatic renewal of vehicle licenses and allowed for the transfer of licenses between owners. “This transferability provision was vital to the subsequent establishment of license values,” Schaller writes in his article, “Villain or Bogeyman, New York’s Taxi Medallion System.”
A provision that would have allowed the city to issue additional medallions was repealed in 1971; as a result the value of the licenses has continued to grow exponentially.
“Taxi medallions have been maybe the best investment to own in the United States over the past 70 years —  they’ve outperformed the Dow Jones, the Nasdaq, real estate, gold, almost every major index you can think of,” says Murstein.
While the Dow has gone up 8% per year over the last 50 years, taxi medallions have gone up almost double that at 14% per year.
Since the company began lending in 1979, Medallion has facilitated more than $900 million in loans to this specific segment and, what’s more, boasts that it has never had a loss.
In 2007, the company reported net earnings of  $15.4 million, an 18% increase over 2006. Medallion’s on-balance sheet taxicab medallion loan portfolio increased 16% to $498 million last year, from $428 million in 2006, and $375 million at year-end 2005. “People assume that it’s not a growth business but our track record obviously shows the opposite,” says Murstein.
In fact, despite dealing with a finite asset base — a number that hasn’t changed in 70 years — Medallion Financial has managed to grow more than 20% a year for the past five years. Murstein says Medallion employs several strategies.
“For one there is the ever expanding value of the medallion,” he explains. “Just like home equity loans, when somebody’s home equity increases over time you’re going to take out a loan against it, here guys tap into the equity of their medallions.”
And like real estate, the value of taxi medallions has grown considerably; 30 years ago the roughly 12,000 medallions circulating in New York had a collective value of $800 million, today those same medallions are worth $7 billion, Murstein says. In May 2007, the price of a single corporate medallion hit an all-time record high of $600,000. Owner/operator medallions, which are issued to people who drive their own cabs, are a little cheaper —  currently trading at around $425,000.
“So as that balloon gets bigger and bigger we can grow our company just by lending more against the current owners that are customers of ours and their current medallions,” Murstein explains.
At the same time, he says the company, which spent the past three decades focused on New York City, has recently been expanding into new markets. Today, in addition to New York, Medallion offers loans in Miami, Boston, Chicago, Newark, Baltimore and Philadelphia.
Finally, Medallion works aggressively to usurp market share from its competitors. “We’ve been very effective at that, we set up our own bank several years ago to lower our cost of funds and were able to take away market share from other lenders in the business.”
Not that there’s much competition to worry about, though. “Banks have never really financed this industry for several reasons. For one, they don’t understand lending on an intangible asset like a taxi medallion — you know they want to kick the tires on something like real estate or equipment,” Murstein says.
In New York, Medallion’s competition is limited to North Fork Bank — which prior to its 2006 acquisition by Capital One, held a small number of taxi medallion loans on its balance sheet — and one or two credit unions that also lend in the sector. In other cities, like Philadelphia for instance, Medallion is the only game in town.
Murstein says the nature of the taxi business means many lenders choose to avoid it. “These companies typically don’t have financial statements and bank regulators who want to see how they’re going to service the loan; they want to see strong financial statements,” Murstein says. “What’s more, a lot of these customers don’t even speak English and banks are not accustomed to dealing with minority entrepreneurs like we are. We’re very open to working with people who come to this country with no money in their pocket and just the dream to own their own business, and we provide that opportunity for them.”
After more than 60 years in the taxi niche, in the 1990s, Murstein began considering a push into other niches and started expanding into other forms of lending. Among his pursuits was to begin investigating opportunities in asset-based lending.
At first, he considered acquiring an established firm. “We didn’t want to make the mistake that banks often make, which is pay two- or three-times book value for something and then have the management and ownership walk away and we’re left holding the bag. So we hired Gerry [Grossman] and his whole management team away from another bank.”
In 1998, Medallion Business Credit was founded to provide asset-based loans to commercial businesses. The company serves a diverse customer base that includes manufacturers, distributors, food processors and finance companies. Murstein says Medallion Business Credit specializes in funding “under the radar” deals, ranging in size from $500,000 to $7.5 million, secured by the borrower’s accounts receivable and inventory. Since its founding, the unit has expanded from a staff of two, to comprise 19 employees at two separate facilities in New York and New Jersey.
Grossman, who serves as president of Medallion Business Credit, says he started in asset-based lending when it was known simply as “commercial finance.”
After the business he ran with his father and brother was sold in 1973, Grossman stuck around for a while before deciding to try his hand in the legal profession. But his days as an attorney would be limited. In 1990, Grossman was approached by New York’s Sterling Financial with an offer to join the company’s ABL unit. He eagerly rejoined the field and spent four years at Sterling before jumping ship to help a friend, at Long Island’s Continental Bank, establish an ABL unit.
In less than two years time Grossman says he built Continental Business Credit’s portfolio to $20 million, attracting the attention of Reliance Federal Savings Bank, which bought out Continental Bank in 1997. After a short stint with Israel Discount Bank, Grossman and his partner, Connie Mitchko, moved to Medallion.
Grossman says a key to the unit’s success is he and Mitchko’s approach to customer service. “We thrive on relationships — Connie and I know every account, we visit with them, we field examine — we’re very hands on with the people we deal with,” he says.
Beyond ABL, Medallion operates Medallion Capital, which was set up in the 1990s to make subordinated loans to small- and medium-sized manufacturers, retailers, food service providers and other companies. The company secures its loans with liens on the borrower’s assets and receives warrants or other types of equity participation in order to offset the additional risk assumed by the loan structure.
The company also operates Medallion Bank, an FDIC-insured industrial bank located in Salt Lake City, UT, which has helped the company address increasingly stringent cost of funds issues.
The strategy seems to be working. In a time when the entire financial services industry is lamenting a dearth of liquidity, Murstein says he’s looking to expand. “We have a lot of excess capital these days. We’re always on the lookout for new lines of business to either buy existing companies or find good people to hire and go into new niche businesses,” Murstein says. “We’re always trying to find new lines of businesses. The reason we’ve been so successful is we’ve been good partners.”

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.
