Smithfield Foods Inc., announces it is in the process of phasing out individual gestation stalls at all of its company-owned sow farms and replacing them with pens. 

In making the decision to convert from gestation stalls to group housing, C. Larry Pope, Smithfield Foods CEO says, "our decision acknowledges that extensive research into sow housing has concluded both gestation stalls and group pens provide for the well-being of pregnant sows and work equally well from a production standpoint. There is no scientific consensus on which system is superior, and we do not endorse one management system over the other."

The Farm Credit Administration (FCA) Board approves the dissolution of the Farm Credit System Financial Assistance Corporation (FAC).

Farmetrics introduces the first prediction market tailored for U.S. agribusiness that enables participants to learn more about their local, state and national crop conditions. 

Participants submit predictions, which are posted weekly, for local planted acreage, yield and harvested acreage at www.farmetrics.com. 

"Gaining real-time, more accurate information about local crop conditions is vital to U.S. agribusiness," says Bill Towles, who manages farmer focus programs for the Web site's sponsor, Bunge Global Markets, Inc.

Quality Technology International, Inc. (QTI) appoints Steven C. Johnson as Mktg Mgr, Animal Health. In his new position, Johnson will be responsible for the sales and marketing of Calsporin direct fed microbial feed additive.

USAgNet reports net farm income is forecast to be $58.9 billion in 2006, down from 2005 by $14.9 billion, but above its 10-year average of $57.2 billion. Major factors behind the projected decline in farm income from recent record levels are declines in milk prices, government payments, and an increase in production expenses. 

In 2006 the average farm household income is projected to be $80,703, down 0.9% from 2005. On family farms, increases in crop cash receipts and other farm income, are projected to be more than offset by declines in livestock cash receipts and government payments. 

Eli Lilly and Company launches a business group focused on companion animal health. The group, evolving at Lilly for more than seven years, will produce innovative medicines for dogs and cats under the Lilly brand name.

Losonoco Ltd., a Fort Lauderdale-based energy company, plans to build four plants in Florida to produce 300 million gallons of ethanol annually from agricultural and yard waste. 

Alan Banks, CEO Losonoco Ltd., says he thinks it makes more sense to use existing castoff material for ethanol production instead of food crops. Banks says using yard waste as a source for cellulosic ethanol also solves a disposal problem, citing the Palm Beach County's Solid Waste Authority collection of 250,000 tons of yard waste a year.

Deere & Co. hires Jack Buzzard as VP of Mkt Development. He will be responsible for developing and implementing business strategies for Deere's Roberts Irrigation Products, a company specifically chosen as a vanguard member of a developing global water platform for Deere.

Kinze's new, indoor 250-foot traveling seed bed will extend its research and development capabilities with year-round, in-the-dirt testing of planter row units, attachments and seed meters, including the ability to study soil flow characteristics. 

Cargill and MMI Genomics, Inc., Davis, CA, announces the launch of two new breeding tools for the cattle industry: Tru-Marbling and Tru-Tenderness. 

Based on MetaMorphix's Genius- Whole Genome System, the tools are DNA based selection products that allow livestock breeders to accurately determine the genetic potential of beef cattle to express these desirable traits.
