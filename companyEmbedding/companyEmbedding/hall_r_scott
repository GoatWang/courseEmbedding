Produktbeschreibung




					THE BLOG AHEAD One of the Internet pioneers takes a look at the impact-and future-of the Blog Revolution. Ideas are flashing around the world at light speed, and R. SCOTT HALL, an Internet pioneer from the early days at CompuServe and online entrepreneur, explores and brilliantly illuminates the way blogs are transforming the way human beings connect minds. Bloggers, Hall maintains, are at the forefront of the greatest change in the life of the mind since the Gutenberg press. Individuals with no establishment connections or entrée can connect with millions worldwide, relying solely on the power of their ideas and their prose to get-and influence-an audience that print journalists and authors could only dream of. Communities of interest, unlimited by time and space, are springing into existence: now they are even exerting force on the traditional levers of power. Hall gives a trenchant, often humorous, analysis of this revolution in the human Zeitgeist, ranging from politics, to media, to the arts. Here's some of the fascinating terrain he covers in his analysis of how blogging is reshaping the world of ideas, affecting global public opinion and mass media:  This new form of horizontal communication is examined and compared to its (feeble) predecessors  Blogging runs smack-dab into the Rear Guard, and both sides end up blinking  The remunerated wordsmiths test the new blogging waters for unmined gold  Businesses from the Drucker Era bow down to the great god Gates  The next generation of leaders master the tools they will use  The dank world of geekery meets the high-wattage expectations of aesthetics  The blogosphere auto-assembles-and becomes a powerful force for change Finally, Hall assembles a list of "Axioms of Blogosophy": principles for the first true citizens of the world. This survey of the world of blogs is only a sampling of the wonderful, surprising, and occasionally repulsive experiences that await the undaunted armchair explorer of the blogosphere. -R. Scott Hall

Scott Introduction









SCOTT FAMILY HISTORY





HISTORY IIof the family ofBALIOLLE SCOT
THE SCOTT'S OF KENT, AND SCOT'S HALL




The "ancient and knightly" family of Scott resided in the county of Kent from the early fourteenth century to the late eighteenth century. They lived in the vicinity of Smeeth, Brabourne and Chilham, were lineal descendants and representatives of the ancient, but now, in name, extinct Norman family of Balliol, and through them of the Kings of Scotland of Malcolm's line.  3. 

CHILHAM CASTLE

These Scotts who claim direct lineal descent from William de Balliol le Scot, lived mostly in Scot's Hall, in Smeeth. They served their King and country over many centuries with loyalty and distinction, and contributed in large amount to the Kings and nobles of the time, and in many cases achieved high office, although surprisingly, none were ever enobled.  3.

SCOT'S HALL

The Scot's Hall scrolls,  2,  which consist of beautifully illustrated vellums and scrolls complete with coats of arms impaled with the arms of the families of their various spouses, are a measure of the pride of this illustrious family. They certainly were able to marry well, their many connections to the Royal families of the time, and wealthy landowners in that part of England are well recorded in the scrolls and J.R. Scott's "Memorials.."  2, 3,  and are graphically displayed in the coats of arms in these documents. According to J R Scott, "There was a time when one could ride from Scot's Hall to London without leaving Scott Property". Some statement !

The following extract from "The Scotts of Scots Hall" gives some idea of the achievements and services to the State by members of this family during the Kentish era., and many of them are  immortalised in the magnificent Memorials, Altar, and Stained Glass Windows of Brabourne Church.  3,16 

Sir John Scotte
Sir William Scottof Brabourne, Lord Chief Justice and Knight Marshall of England in the reigns of Edward II, and Edward III. Buried in Brabourne 1350
Sir William Scotof Scot's Hall, Knight of the shire of Kent, and Sword-bearer to Henry V at Agincourt. d 1433.

Sir Robert Scot
Lieutenant of the Tower of London 1424
Sir John Scotte
Of Scot's Hall, Knight of the Shire, Comptroller of the Household of Edward IV. High Sheriff of Kent, Privy Councillor, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports 
and Governor of Dover Castle, Chamberlain to Edward, 
Prince of Wales (Edward V., murdered in the Tower), and 
Ambassador to the Dukes of Burgundy and Bretagne in 1473. d. 1485 He is depicted above in a detail from the Scot's Hall scrolls.
Thomas Scott(alias Rotherham), b 1423 Cardinal Archbishop of York and Lord Chancellor of England. d 1500
Sir William Scotteof Scot's Hall, Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, High Sheriff of Kent 1491 to 1517, and Governor of Dover Castle temp. Henry VIII.
Sir John Scotteof Scott's Hall, Knight of the King's Body Guard, Henry VIII. Sheriff of Kent 1528
Sir John Scott A Judge of the Exchequer, 1530.
Sir Reginald Scottof Scot's Hall, Captain of Calais Castle, temp. Henry VIII. High Sheriff of Kent 1541-2
Sir Thomas Scottof Scot's Hall, Knight of the Shire, Commander in Chief of the Kentish Forces at the approach of the Spanish Armada. Commissioner of Dover Harbour 1581, and the draining of Romney March.
Sir John Scottof Scot's Hall and Nettlestead, Knight of the Shire, implicated in Essex's plot, and confined to the Tower of London temp. Queen Elizabeth
Sir William ScottAmbassador to Florence, Venice, and Turkey in the reign of James I. d. 1612
Sir Edward Scottof Scot's Hall, K.B., Knight of the Shire, and a member of the Committee of Safety for the county of Kent during the troubles of King and Parliament. 1649-50


as well as others of distinguished note, who witnessed the decay of their family and fortune in more recent but less troubled times, and thus apparently paid the penalty suggested in the ancient Kentish Proverb, that :

		Scot's Hall shall have a fall;Ostenhangre was built in angre (pride),
		Somerfield will have to yielde;
		And Mersham Hatch shall win the Match."

All were large estates in Kent at that time.

Scot's Hall eventually fell into decay along with the decaying family fortunes, and was demolished in 1808.  3 

The Church of ST MARY THE VIRGIN, Brabourne

One of the owners of Scot's Hall in the days when it 'rivaled the most splendid houses in Kent' in Elizabethan times, was Sir Thomas Scott, Lawyer, Superintendent of the improvement of Dover harbour, and commissioner of the draining of Romney Marsh, and improving the breeds of horses in England. He seemed quite an affable fellow judging by the poem, probably written by his famous cousin Reginald, and depicted in the "Sir Thomas" page.  3,10  Sir Thomas had four wives and seventeen children.

In the same period Thomas Scott's cousin, Reginald Scot, whose  "Discoverie of Witchcraft"
is a famous book which gives an eye-opening exposure of the beliefs and superstitions of that time. He, with an insight far in advance of his age sought to stay the hideous persecution which, especially in rural districts, made any lonely aged person (and many others) liable to a charge of witchcraft with but the rarest opportunity of escape from consequent barbarities. It is said that this book was used as a reference by Shakespeare.  10 

At that time it was a common belief that :

"They sacrifice their owne children to the divell before baptisme, holding them up in the aire unto him, and then thrust a needle into their braines . . .They use incestuous adulterie with spirits . . . They eate the flesh and drinke the bloud of men and children openlie . . . They kill mens cattel . . . They bewitch mens corne . . . They ride and flie in the aire, bring stormes, make tempests . . . They use venerie with a divell called Incubus and have children by them, which become the best witches."   11 

Many of this Reginald's contemporaries hailed his reasonable exposure of unreasonable superstition with joy, for, as one of them put it, he "dismasketh sundry egregious impostures, and in certaine principall chapters, and speciall passages hitteth the nayle on the head with a witnesse".

 James the VI of Scotland described the work as "damnable," and on becoming James I. of England the same bigoted and pedantical monarch ordered all copies of the "Discoverie" to be burnt.  10 In spite of this there seems little doubt that this book was largely instrumental in changing the thinking which eventually ended wichcraft in England and Scotland. Happily it has been reprinted several times since, and is available on the Internet in paperback from www.Amazon.com.

The same Reginald (sometimes spelled Reynold) published his first book; "A Perfect Platforme of a Hoppe-Garden" in 1574, which led to the establishment of hop-harvesting in Kent. To this day, hops are still one of Kent's major agricultural products.

* The line of descent from the Scot's Hall Scotts to the Norfolk Scotts is still being researched for confirmation of the information I have assembled.

I'll now turn the call over to Scott.
Scott Hall
Thanks Martie and good morning. Thanks for joining us today as we discussed our results for the 2017 second quarter. On the last call I'd only been at Mueller for about a week. It has been a busy period since then. I have enjoyed meeting many of you at conferences in meetings and by phone. It is also been an important time to meet the many talented people across Mueller.
I’ll begin our discussion this morning of the quarter with a brief overview followed by Evan’s more detailed financial report. I’ll then provide additional color on the quarter results and developments in our end markets, as well as our outlook for the 2017 third quarter and full year.
Overall, consolidated second quarter net sales increased slightly due to strong growth at Mueller Technologies. We were pleased to see that the Mueller Technologies’ team grew net sales 20.7% in the quarter.

However, net sales performance at Mueller Company was disappointing as net sales declined 600,000 this quarter year-over-year. This net sales decline was largely the result of lower international sales, as sales outside of North America were down about $3 million.
Taking a closer look at our domestic water sales at Mueller Company we also note that the adverse weather conditions in the Western United States impacted sales in the quarter as well.
Western region water sales were down about 13%, however all other domestic water sales were up about 4%. Despite slightly lower net sales at Mueller Company, adjusted operating margins improved 40 basis points to 19.8%, the 19th consecutive quarter of margin expansion.
The improvements in both adjusted operating margin and adjusted operating income from continuing operations were due to productivity improvement. The team at Mueller Technologies again delivered improved adjusted operating performance this quarter. This improvement was $1.1 million versus prior year, largely the result of the net sales growth.
We recently became aware that in certain environments some of our radios produced between 2011 and 2014 were feeling prematurely. During the quarter we took a discrete $9.8 million charge to meet current and future warranty obligations associated with these products.
Evan will speak more detail about the accounting and handling of the charge. I will speak a little bit about the steps we took to ensure this isn’t repeated in the future. In particular we have approved the manufacturing process, so this particular failure mode won't repeat itself and we instituted accelerated lifecycle testing on all of our radios.
I believe we have correctly scoped and address this problem and implemented the corrective steps to ensure that our products meet industry and Mueller standards for reliability.
As a reminder, we completed a number of strategic initiatives in the second quarter. We acquired Singer Valve in February which added automatic control valves to our product portfolio. We initiated the repurchase of $50 million of shares under the accelerated share repurchase program.
We increased our quarterly dividend 33% to $0.04 per share. We amended our term loan which lowers our interest rates spread and we completed the divestiture of Anvil in early January.
We believe these initiatives demonstrate our ongoing commitment to create long-term value for shareholders. We will discuss our outlook in more detail later, but we continue to expect year-over-year growth in 2017 from demand for our products in our address to water markets. We believe that Mueller Water Products remains well-positioned to deliver long-term value for shareholders.
And with that, I’ll turn the call over to Evan.
Evan Hart
Thanks, Scott and good morning everyone. I’ll first review our second quarter consolidated financial results and then discuss segment performance. As a reminder, I will only be discussing our results from continuing operations.
Mueller Technologies drove the 1.3% increase in consolidated net sales in the 2017 second quarter. Consolidated net sales increased $2.5 million to $199.7 million as compared with $197.2 million for the 2016 second quarter. Adjusted gross profit improved both Mueller Company and Mueller Technologies and was $62.2 million for the 2017 second quarter compared with $59.3 million last year.
Adjusted gross margin increased 100 basis points to 31.1% in 2017 second quarter from 30.1% in the 2016 second quarter. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $39 million in the 2017 second quarter compared with $37.4 million last year.
The $1.6 million increase was due primary to personnel related expenses including our planned increase investment in product development. G&A expenses as a percent of net sales were 19.5%, slightly higher compared with 19% of net sales in the prior year.

Both Mueller Company and Mueller Technologies contributed to the $1.3 million increase in adjusted operating income from continuing operations for the 2017 second quarter, which was $23.2 million as compared with $21.9 million for the 2016 second quarter.
Adjusted EBITDA for the 2017 second quarter increased to $33.8 million compared with $31.8 million for the 2016 second quarter. For the trailing 12 months adjusted EBITDA was $161.9 million or 20.1% of net sales.
We amended our term loan credit agreement on February 21, 2017. Through this amendment we reduce the applicable interest rate spread by 75 basis points. Interest expense net for the 2017 second quarter decreased to $5.5 million as compared with $5.9 million for the 2016 second quarter.
For the 2017 second quarter, income tax expense of $700,000 was 13% of income before income taxes. We recognize net discrete tax benefits of $1.2 million in the quarter primarily excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation. We grew adjusted earnings per diluted share year-over-year to $0.09 from $0.07.
I’ll now move on to segment performance beginning with Mueller Company. Net sales for the 2017 second quarter decreased 600,000 to $181.6 million as compared with $182.2 million for the 2016 second quarter.
Mueller Company increased adjusted operating income and adjusted operating margin in the second quarter due to productivity improvements. Adjusted operating income for the 2017 second quarter grew 1.7% to $35.9 million as compared with just $35.3 million for the 2016 second quarter and adjusted operating margin grew 40 basis points despite slightly lower net sales.
Adjusted EBITDA for the 2017 second quarter increased to $45 million compared with $43.9 million for the 2016 second quarter and adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter increased 70 basis points to 24.8% from 24.1% last year.
And now, Mueller Technologies, net sales in the 2017 second quarter increased 20.7% to $18.1 million as compared with $15 million for the 2016 second quarter. As Scott mentioned we recently became aware that in certain environments some radio products produced between 2011 and 2014 were failing at a higher than expected rate.
Consequently, we refined our estimates and increase the warranty reserve. We've taken a discrete warranty charge of $9.8 million in the quarter to meet current and future obligations of which $8.4 million is now reserved for future obligations.
Turning to discussion of Mueller Water Products liquidity, free cash flow which is cash flows from operating activities of continuing operations less capital expenditures with negative $6.3 million for the 2017 second quarter compared with negative $4 million for the 2016 second quarter.
At March 31, 2017 total debt was comprised of a $480.5 million senior secured term loan due November 2021 and $1.3 million of other. The term loan accrues interest at a floating rate equal to LIBOR plus a spread of 250 basis points. At March, 31 net debt leverage was .9 times in our excess availability under the ABL credit agreement was about $125 million.
I’ll now turn the call back to Scott.
Scott Hall
Thanks Evan. As we analyzed Mueller Technologies’ second quarter, the overall 21% net sales growth was primarily driven by a 40% increase in AMI shipments at Mueller systems. This was the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year double-digit growth in our AMI product line.
At the end of the second quarter Mueller systems AMI backlog was up about 12% from the prior year and Echologics added $2.5 million of projects under contract. Mueller Technologies adjusted operating loss of $3.8 million for the second quarter was an improvement of $1.1 million from the prior year due to higher shipment volumes.
This is the fourth consecutive quarter where Mueller Technologies has improved its adjusted operating performance year-over-year. Turning to Mueller Company we again delivered solid adjusted operating performance in the quarter with the 19th consecutive quarter of adjusted operating margin expansion.

Productivity improvements exceeded the 40 basis point increase in adjusted operating margin compared to last year offset by higher raw material costs and price. Looking at our latest 12 months Mueller Company's adjusted EBITDA margin was 28% or a 140 basis point improvement from the prior trailing 12 month period.
Looking ahead to the third quarter and staying with Mueller Company, this year bookings in advance of the effective date of the price increase were lower year-over-year and shipments were comparable between the quarters.
We believe that overall distributor inventory levels at the end of the second quarter were about flat year-over-year. Therefore we have entered the third visibility than we typically have at this time of year.
While we remain cautiously optimistic about end market demand growth from residential construction and municipal markets, uncertainty from less for demand visibility remains for this business.
Mueller Technologies had a strong first half of the year with nearly 17% sales growth. We expect that growth rate to moderate in the second half of the year largely due to year-over-year comparisons.
You’ll remember that last year our third and fourth quarters were our strongest quarters for Mueller Technologies. Second-half growth is expected to come from increased shipment volumes of AMI system and growth of fixed leak detection projects.
For example, we announced yesterday that San Jose water Company has selected Echologics leak detection technology. This project will be the largest deployment of Echologics fixed leak detection technology to-date with more than 10,000 notes deployed throughout San Jose's service area. And we expect that bookings in the third quarter for distribution fixed leak detection products will exceed all bookings for these products to-date.
Looking at the third quarter on a consolidated basis, with the tougher comp in AMI products and the lower pre-buying advance of the effective date of the price increase of Mueller Company we believe third quarter consolidated net sales percentage growth will be in the low to mid single-digit.
From an operating perspective the combination of continued productivity improvements offset by the rising raw material costs environment and the dilution from the Singer acquisition, our expected results in adjusted operating margins for the third quarter comparable with previous year Q3 margins.
We believe that the demand environment for our municipal and residential end markets remained strong over the long-term. But for the full year 2017 we expect consolidated net sales percentage growth to be in the low to mid single-digits much of that is expected to be in the third quarter.
Evan will wrap up now with some other items. Evan?
Evan Hart
Based on our current expectations for the full year corporate expenses will be $33 million to $36 million, depreciation and amortization will be $42 million to $44 million and interest expense will be $22 million to $23 million.
We expect our adjusted effective income tax rate to be 32% to 34% clearly higher in the second half of the year and capital expenditures to be between $33 million and $37 million.
Finally, we expect 2017 free cash flow to be driven by improved operating results and an improvement in working capital. Our target is for free cash flow to exceed adjusted income from continuing operations.
Operator, would you please open the call for questions.
Question-and-Answer Session
Operator
Thank you. We will now start question and answer session of today’s conference. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mike. Your line is open. Mike Wood, your line is open.
Scott Hall
I’m not hearing anything operator if Mike is asking the question.
Operator
Okay. Let’s move on to the second question. It’s coming from the line of Seth Weber. Your line is open.

Seth Weber
Hey, good morning everybody.
Scott Hall
Good morning.
Seth Weber
I guess first just a clarification Scott, are you looking for organic revenue growth for Mueller Co, here in the third quarter of every-over-year, excluding the Singer acquisition.
Scott Hall
Yes, [very slight] I think it’s where I would put itself. I mean, there is going to be some organic growth. I think there were some pent-up demand as we referenced from the west where we have that slowdown and bookings will grow there. So, to answer the question directly, yes, we expect the small amount of organic growth from Mueller Co. in Q3.
Seth Weber
Okay and I guess kind of taking that to the next level; bigger picture, I mean this is going to be your fourth quarter on a row with kind of plus or minus zero growth in the Mueller Co. business. I mean, what do you really think is going on there and what you think is the real kind of sustainable top line growth level for that business. I am trying to reconcile. You have been pushing through price increases pretty consistently, but it’s not showing up on the revenue line. So, I am trying to understand what they kind of inherent volume growth for that business where it is?
Scott Hall
I think the inherent volume growth should be around something like 100 basis points or better greater than GDP. I mean, that’s kind of how I think about the business, many years of neglect in the water infrastructure, so as for a long-term growth that exceeds normal growth for lack of better words. I referenced it my comments one of the things I want to make sure we do as we talk about these things as speak plainly. So, that there is no questions price we have gotten in the past. We have not got it in Q2. In fact, price was about $1 million, unfavorable in the quarter.
So, we had good price for a long time. Certainly, while the raw material was dropping, we were able to get a little bit of price and the spread would open. That certainly reversed itself in Q2. I suspect that’s a lag. They don’t see. I expect we’ll start get support for price now as we start to see. The increase in raw material cost, but we will have to wait and see, but I think the answer to question directly that we should see better than GDP growth in water spending for some time. I think inherently there has to be.
Seth Weber
Okay, that’s helpful. And I guess my follow up question, how are you thinking – obviously you’ve already been there for short time, but if you change your thoughts around capital allocation, you do have the accelerated share program that you announced previously but are you thinking anymore? Are you closer to any M&A or you are thinking about boosting share buyback at all or maybe just you kind of updated thoughts on capital allocation?
Scott Hall
So, let me reiterated that we are on path with when I laid out in our last quarter call where we were examining our strategic options as far as we are to take the business outside of just pure play water infrastructure as we look at this swim lane, but I think I described in detail in the past we have all of that still that work ongoing. We have our board meeting in July still speed up to have that work presented and then something to communicate to you in the after that kind of in the first quarter of next year kind of timeframe when we lay out what our strategic direction is going to be.
We are filling our M&A pipeline. We continue to look at many options, but I think that we are not going to have a knee-jerk reaction here. The bulldogs certainly will continue with what if there is going to be a new leg of the stool so to speak. It’s not going to come, because somebody put an offering memorandum out or something like that.
Seth Weber
Very helpful, thanks a lot guys.
Scott Hall

Thank you Seth.
Operator
Our next question comes from the line of Mr. Brian Lee. Your line is open.
Brian Lee
Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just to follow up on the guidance point on the low to mid-single-digit guide for the year, it’s some change from the mid-single-digit number from your prior outlook. Is that all from Mueller Co. or can you maybe provide some context on the mid-single-digit in 15% growth targets you had laid out from Mueller Co. and Technologies on the last call?
Scott Hall
Yes. Thanks for the question to clarify. I think overall, we are moderating our view to how much growth we will get in the Mueller Co. business in 2017. I have been here a quarter now and I have seen the bookings and the trends that I think that there is really mixed kind of messages from the market as far as where the growth is going to come and how sustainable that is in the new term.
I do believe the team has had a difficult environment. I can’t point to a single municipality that said, “Oh! I am not going to do what I said I was going to do, but I do think that the pent-up demand has been muted by people waiting for this infrastructure spending, and so I think that uncertainty doesn’t look like it’s going to be fixed anytime soon. So, I think it’s proven to kind of – so I think that number is going to be in the three or lower kind of range for Mueller Co., but the AMI trends remain strong. So I think that our success rate with AMI and where our growth is coming from. I still expect that business to deliver 15% and I expect that business to give us better conversion on the [growth life]. Frankly, I expect it to give us better conversion on the growth than they gave us in Q2. We’ve got some work to do there and we are working on it.
Brian Lee
Okay. Thanks that’s super helpful. Maybe Scott just staying on Mueller Co. for a second, year, you mentioned the weakness in the international [segway]. Can you remind us how much international exposure you have there? I am assuming it’s mostly north of the border here and then how much of that is playing into your sort of slightly downgraded view of Mueller Co. outlook? Was that the biggest surprise outside of maybe the California whether on the quarter?
Scott Hall
Yes. So to be clear, I said outside North America, Canada remains okay. Not great, but okay. Really it’s [maybe] Latin American problem in the quarter and part of it is complex. It’s about 5% of the business, but I think the outlook for it could be difficult in Q3 at the end as well.
So, I think Middle East mostly though I think is where we are experiencing the softness and I don’t know the outlook right now, we’ve got a couple of things in hopper that could get them back to kind of breakeven, but right now our forecast is breakeven for that non North American piece of the market, but through [summer script].
Brian Lee
Okay, great. Last one from me. I will pass it on – just on the – you had eluded to the rising raw material cost and the guidance here for fiscal Q3 as for operating margins to be relatively flat year-on-year. How should we think about the trend in and margins here in that context of may be a tougher year-on-year environment from the raw materials cost perspective. Just curious to hear your take on what we should be thinking there. Thanks.
Scott Hall
Okay, no problem. Thanks for the question, because I kind of want to spend a little time on this. So, in my prepared comments I said, we had about 40 basis points improvement in Mueller Company and if you really dig into where the productivity came from, there was some material usage productivity. There were some machine utilization productivity and then there were some – mostly some in-sourcing absorption productivity that were really strong in the quarter that I want to make sure everybody realizes, and if you think about the difficulty they had from the volume point of view then you go ahead and layer in the ballpark $1 million of inflationary pressures they felt in their raw material buying and $1 million or so of price pressure we felt year-over-year price declines.

Manufacturing team basically delivered the 40 basis points, plus 2 million and incumbent such their spending, so that there is a little of lower volume, also didn’t hurt margin. So, I am very pleased with the situation and awareness and the execution at Mueller Company around that. With that said, I have no reason to expect they can’t deliver similar performance in Q3 from an execution point of view, but I have cautioned you to when you think upon the margin in Q3, the reason I am calling it flat is because I haven’t said we are going to get that price back and I haven’t said we are not going to be able to feel those same inflationary pressures.
If we are able to move the price in the market as we are certainly trying to recover those increase raw material costs then I think we could have some margin expansion, but I was [very clan] in the discussion that, that’s not in what’s right now, because I haven’t got a long history of being successful and say, oh, I am going to raise price and put it on [the talk] there’s always some dynamics there that we forget or it’s difficult in the industrial market. So, I have got it flat, but yes price in sustentation of the inflationary pressures would be upside in the quarter.
Brian Lee
Okay, thanks guys.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Mr. Michael Gaugler. Your line is open.
Michael Gaugler
Good morning everyone.
Scott Hall
Good morning.
Michael Gaugler
Scott on the last call you mentioned you were anxious to get out on the road and visit the plants. Perhaps you could provide us with some color on what you found, particularly in the area of opportunities to improve margins.
Scott Hall
I think – well, thanks Michael. I think the tour has been first of all fantastic and I think the team that I have been happy to hear is they’re very talented than and I think our employees are really motivated.
With that said I think that as you think about self-directed workforce you think about [solid] manufacturing, you think about single piece flow. There was opportunity at all the plants I have been to, to improve. Somehow quite large opportunity set and others are near world-class. I would really like to applause the team in Alabama. It’s the best probably I have ever been in and great visual system. Exactly where they are, your production schedule every day, every way where they are and your assembly schedule, the flow on the plant is all things that you can see what operation is going to happen next in impressive facility.
On the other end, things are some that I think other investment in certain places. So, I think between summer machine jobs and some other foundries there was opportunity as it relates in the brass business and in the gauge valve for margin expansion, both through combination of investments and relaying out some of the plants and thinking more about flow.
Now, the thing I normally would do here is try and quantify it for you and give you 100 basis points here or 200 basis points there. I think there is enough of an opportunity set that we conceptually at a high level should be thinking about margin expansion of somewhere around 50 to 75 basis points a year and then I think we’re under invested in our engineering resources as it relates to new product development and some piece of that being reinvested back into the engineering and product development piece of the business.
Michael Gaugler
Okay. That’s good color. Then as a follow-up regarding the San Jose water announcement, should we expect to see other announcements like that from large well-known water utilities in the near future.
Scott Hall
We have a couple of things in the [hopper] that we know that we’re optimistic of. So, yes, and as I said in my comments, we expect the distribution, leak detection product, that DS product actually in Q3 take more orders in for each of the next foreseeable quarters then all previous years’ sales. So, it’s finally catching on I think the success we’ve seen in the trials we’ve run. The leak locates have the efficacy of this product is starting to catch on. We really think we may have. We are hoping with top lighting and above here, but it’s too soon to call it, but early indications are really exciting.

Michael Gaugler
All right. That’s all I had. Thank you.
Scott Hall
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of [Jose]. Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst
Good morning guys.
Evan Hart
Good morning.
Scott Hall
Good morning Jose.
Unidentified Analyst
Hey Scott! You gave some good color on Mueller Tech. business. I’m just wondering if your expectations are still for kind of the profitability improvement in that business over the course of the year that maybe you guys had at the beginning of the year.
Scott Hall
So, I realized when I am talking on this, there are employees listening too. My expectation is just we can made it to $10 million of operating improvement when we developed our plant and if we are going to have a culture of execution we do what we say we are going to do.
With that said I think I will look at the conversion we’ve got in the quarter. We increased sales 3 million and we’re only doing $1.1 million of operating improvement that I would have expected there to be in the 1.5 to 1.7 range kind of number. So, I realize we have some risk and there’s probably on that $10 million of year-over-year improvements there is risk, but if you are going to have a culture of execution then you find ways to develop your countermeasures. You take other actions that meet your commitment levels and so we have to review those plans for technologies and it can’t just be always sell your way out of trouble. Sometimes you have to look at the cost structures, you have to look at your inputs and so to answer the question directly, I still expected, but I recognized have seen Q2 performance that there is a little bit of risk.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay, that’s very helpful. And maybe Evan you can help on this one. What’s kind of the expectation for the warranty expense kind of going forward and it kind of [cadence] to that you got?
Evan Hart
Well, Jose with this particular issue as we mentioned we did record about $9.8 million in the quarter and we were left with about $8.4 million warranty reserve for this particular item and I will note that back in Q1 we saw about $800,000 of expense for this particular problem and that really was the catalyst for us to take a more detailed look, do a in-depth study and we’d find our estimates to come up with the particular charge in the second quarter.
We think that the charge is adequate and sufficient to cover these issues with the [radius] produce between 2011 and 2014. I think going forward we will just have a normal warranty charge provision that we’ve always had and so there is nothing expected from a large magnitude like this in the future.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay.
Scott Hall
And I would like to go and say that we did the advance lifecycle testing Jose on the things made after 14. We have been running those environmental tests and the failure rate has been better than industry averages by a lot, like 0.04%.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. That’s helpful.
Scott Hall
So, I feel like the team – I wasn’t here, but whatever the change is when they realize they were having some of these issues and basically for everybody’s benefit it’s when they are underwater in a pit environment in warm climate that’s when they really start to have a problem.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. And just any changes in terms of the raw material that you saw throughout the quarter that you kind of extrapolating into the rest of the year or is it roughly the same across both businesses?
Evan Hart
I would say this. When you take a look at our two largest inputs, scrap sale, where I think in the second quarter, they were up about 5% and as a reminder that accounts for about 15% of cost of goods sold related Mueller Company and that was roughly around $1 million impact in the quarter for us. I think as we go forward I think the data to forecast that are calling for mid to say 9% increase in those raw material input. So, I wouldn’t say anything a significant at this point on the rising, but I think it will be faced with a little higher input cost in the third quarter as well.

Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Very helpful. Thanks guys.
Scott Hall
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ryan. Your line is open.
Ryan Connors
Thank you. Yes, Ryan Connors with Boenning & Scattergood. I wanted to just kind of drill down on this pricing issue a little bit Scott and I am little surprised about the pricing. I want to understand some of the dynamics behind that you mentioned in your comment earlier that there always these dynamics that crop up the impact price, but my understanding of Mueller Co. has always been that even though it might not have the sex appeal of Mueller Tech. it’s oligopoly market, that even maybe duopoly with some of the products and issues and pricing has always been very rationale. So, in this kind of environment where we’ve got raw material price cost up and the demand environment is at least okay if not phenomenal or at least certainly serviceable. I mean, what are those dynamics that are preventing you from getting price. Is it some kind of bad actor in the market that’s suddenly acting a irrationally or is it some channel issues. I mean, anything you can give us in terms of why that’s happening?
Scott Hall
Yes. I can give you my theory. And I’m happy to do that, but it is just that. I mean, here’s what’s happened. I think that last year we announced the price increase just as did this year. And in anticipation that price increase, distribution took a whole lot of orders in a pre-buy. Certainly, $15million, $20 million more than you would anticipate, a normal February being. They bought that, they pre-bought in Q3 and then raw materials ran away, they ran down. And so, competitive forces being what they were in the first quarter basically our first fiscal quarter basically the pre-buy that did in our Q2 for their shipments in Q3 didn’t actually result in higher gross margins for them.
Why does the distributor pre-buy? They pre-buy for their gross margins they belong. They get the benefit of the lower cost, but they get to sell into the higher price market. Raw materials ran down and pricing was basically flat. Price to price was flat. So this year you come along and everybody announces a price increase. Distribution doesn’t pre-buy. And so now, inventories are getting heavy in the distributor lanes, and so they now come out with their buys and people being hungry and not having the visibility. All of a sudden now might be willing to discount the level. Is there are a bad actor in the market? Yes. There’s a bad actor in the market might be in somebody’s not got the discipline to keep where there need to be.
And I’ll say it’s not so much around hydrants as it is around valves and brass. So, when you look at where the price came out, that’s part of it. The other thing I want to make sure everybody understands is when you think about our products think about the deeper they go in the ground the more valuable they are. So a fire hydrants with a 10-foot stuff for Canada sales for more money than our fire hydrants been has a white barrel and basically it just got the L going under the surface of the ground.
And if you think about what we lost at west as an average, weighted average price on a fire hydrants, but you think about what we loss at west as a result to the rain, that also play kind of almost like a regional mix impact on our price. So I think those were the two big drivers of why we’ve had the difficult price environment in Q2 than we traditionally have Ryan.
Ryan Connors
Got it. Well, that’s maybe only theory, but that’s very helpful one. Now, my second question is actually related in that bigger picture, but as you look at capital deployment there been a number of companies, some of them in the metering side, some of them for were in the pump side and elsewhere that has started to kind forward integrate into their channel and distribution, started to go into more of a corporate channel as opposed to the traditional third-party channel.

So, obviously you’re going to tip your hand in terms of whether that something that’s being tactically contemplated. But what's your view of that as a concept? Is that something that at any point you think would make sense or do you feel that the traditional channel is the way to go?
Scott Hall
I think the whole channel question is a fascinating discussion and I think this intermediation and more direct sales as you see more municipalities try to entering the [MWBE] space and disable that trend and I think there a just a ton of dynamics going on in the channel right now. You see potentially the HB supply could be after waterworks for sale, could go P/E, go strategic buyer. So there’s a lot of moving pieces there.
That said, I am not sure on our core competency is ever going to be round putting together the portfolio if you need to be a successful distributor. I had distribution business previously in my career and I can tell you to make them successful and add value to people that use them generally a lot of what you have to be good at manufacturing are not necessarily things you're going to be good at to be distributor. And therefore, while it remains the possibility it’s something that I would give a very very low probabilities, it’s a [top class].
And the other thing I would say is, when you’re number one in well established channel, very, very difficult to go into competition with your customers. And so, it’s always a play of the distinct player to try to take that role to disrupt the distribution channels because they're really not getting their fair share of the distribution channel, so probably not something that we see Mueller do.
Ryan Connors
Got it. Well, it’s [very excited] and thanks for your time.
Scott Hall
Thank you.
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from Jim. You line is open Jim. 
Jim Giannakouros 
Hi, Jim Giannakouros from Oppenheimer. Thanks for taking my questions. I understand you’re pleased with acquisition and plans, appreciate that you’re doing good things in there’s, is there investment and plan that we should be cognizant of when thinking about incremental margin progression as capacity utilization clears 70% and heads up from here?
Scott Hall
Well, I don’t think there’s anything massive, so I think that we’re not contemplating Jim, a big new foundry. At this point I think that there's enough available capacity. I think there’s enough fine-tuning. I think there’s enough square footage and other things that we – if we needed a well furnish at some point we could buy both.
So, I don’t think there’s any massive depression load coming in the next two or three years. With that said, I think that there is a modernization that needs to happen. Indicator, there is modernization it needs to happen in [Indiscernible] so that there’s some modernization that needs to happen, Cleveland, North Carolina. So I think that there will perhaps, as I said in the last call $4 million, $5 million, $6 million kind of incremental CapEx for some period of time as we fixed the machine tool, utilization part of the business and improve our assembly capabilities those kinds of things but not anything major.
Jim Giannakouros 
Got it. Okay. And apologize, I did hop on a little late here. Quite a few comments on the muni side, of course a head of clarity on stimulus et cetera that you're seeing. Any comments on how residential, I guess either housing starts or more specifically new community development is tracking versus your expectation? Curious to the outlook view through your lens, our checks and read certainly suggest strength but your results certainly don't stack up? Thanks.
Scott Hall
Yes. I think that’s one of the things we’re trying to connect the dots on. We feel good about what we’ve seen in housing starts and land development. I think single-family units were strong in January and February, and I think we were tracking pretty at January and February. We’ve single-family dwelling. And then, March was a bit of cliff that fell off. I think part of that was weather-related as I think when you look at the housing starts date, I think March actually on an annualized basis seasonally adjustments was down from the January, February, try to muting what is good fundamentals going forward for strengthen in land development. If you think about brass, it’s predominantly residential and that's an area that we've got to start getting some growth from here in Q3 that we’re going to be our and your expectations.

Jim Giannakouros 
Okay. Thanks. And a clarification point, I think it was one that asked on pricing. I surprised as well, you did say that there is “bad actor” but where's the pressure coming from? Are you feeling the pressure is from distributors that may have inflated inventories or can you just provide a little more color there because I kind of miss point on where exactly the pressure is coming from?
Scott Hall
Okay. So let me try and give you some clarity. If you look at the average price that I sold a distributor in Q2 versus the average price I sold a distributor the exact same product Q2 year ago. That is down ever so slightly, like less than $100,000. If you look at how much [Indiscernible] valve is going forward that’s getting buried in Las Vegas versus one that’s getting very in North Florida. You will see that same valve has a different price and I’m making those up, and now we should take away and say, the actually regional pricing difference is such that losing a lot of the west volume as a weighted average cost us about $0.5 million and then about 400,000 kind of comes from the mix of different deals between customers.
So, you might get a rebate or you might take the answer, you might get that and somebody else doesn’t, free terms and things like that are also part of our price. So, it’s a complex subject and I want to give too much away on in terms of the competitive dynamic, but at the same time it's something that I can tell you we have [our rung] around and we’re watching very very carefully. There should have been better support regardless of fall sides of the price increase in valves and hydrants. There’s been another increase for brass that’s recently been announced and we haven’t baked any of it in to our forecast because we got to wait and see how everybody behaves and hope we’ll be watching it carefully. 
So to summarize part of it is the regional difference in pricing, part of it is the mix of large distributors versus small distributors and then part of it is just some small amount of year-over-year price degradation.
Jim Giannakouros 
Thank you. That’s helpful. 
Operator
Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Joe. Joe, you’re line is open.
Unidentified Analyst
Hey, guys. This is actually [Indiscernible] from Joseph Giordano at a Cowen today. Thanks for taking the question. I believe that Singer Valve has a much more global – is much more global than other businesses that you have. Have you already identified some opportunities where you might be able to like go back to these global customers and introduce your full range of products?
Scott Hall
Yes. That part of integration is, what we think about the synergies. We are looking where they can take us and their channels are established and we are looking where we can actually grow their presence in our existing channel. And so, whether we do some Mueller branded private control valves or Singer’s channel can actually [take key] valves and butterfly valves and the [white] into their market, certainly those are the things that we’re working on and that we’ve identified.
What I think to be fair to the development team out there, I think the channel development work is more than in immediate quarter kind of time line, so when we think about where that growth is going to come from, we think about those developing infrastructures around the world, we think that the sale cycle on those is measured in quarters not in days.
Unidentified Analyst
Okay. Thanks. And then I think one of your competitor has mentioned that they have remote disconnect capabilities which I think you were probably one of the few companies to open now. Could you remind us some the spec that separates you from your competition? Thank you.
Scott Hall
Yes. I think that’s a biggest difference is A, for everybody benefit we are partnering with our radio technology. And B, our actuation technology is such that we’re not going to denigrate anybody’s but we’re confident that we have more than 50% advantage in battery life usage when you actually have to use the RDM, ours is the most efficient from a not having to back out and replace the battery and get – I don’t want to be incorrect there, so somebody clean me up if I’m wrong, but I think twice as many actuations where you can actually turn off and turn back on the meter without actually having to service the battery. So very few are tough roles if you use our solution than anybody else’s. And basically it’s because we partnered the valve and the actuation methodology that is the most power efficient.

Operator
Our next question comes from the line of [Indiscernible] your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst
Good morning.
Scott Hall
So, last quarter AMI backlog was up 70% from the last year this quarter around 12% so what’s the average time expect to turn that backlog into revenue?
Scott Hall
Great question that I’m not trying to doc here, but I am trying to get some clarity on for ourselves. I think the behavior here is that you get your award and contract from your municipality or from your PUC, and you get a target date when they're going to start their install. And then you get another target data, when they're going to start their install. And then as you get closer you get refinements, so all stuff that’s been awarded and contracted is on book.
What is really, really difficult to estimate the time and until we get within the 90 day window when they’re actually going to use the resources to put across in the field to start the changes. And the part that’s really I think we’ve got a fair deal of clarity around is the part where its new construction, new homes are going up and they are being sold, that’s got some clarity around it, it’s the swap programs that the estimates are very wildly on in. So, I know it's a very satisfying answer, but the answer is we miss on the contracted pieces by 90 or 180 days quite often.
Unidentified Analyst
That helps. And then looking at I guess acquisition scenarios for the Mueller Technologies segment, is there an area that you would consider to complement what you have and also for Mueller Co can you find adjacent business operating at the market profile you do in that business?
Scott Hall
I think the margin is difficult. I understand the margin dilution discussion, but very much we have to create opportunities if we can make investments that exceed our weighted average cost of capital and then we’re creating value. And sometimes the margins – EBITDA margins would be dilutive and sometimes hopefully there’ll be accretive, but this is a very, very good business, we have with Mueller Company from an EBITDA margin point of view.
But I also think that there are adjacencies out there that we can absolutely get into lever and be successful. As per Mueller Technologies, I'm less inclined right now to do acquisitions. I think there's a lot of operational heavy lifting to do in front of that business. I think, I said it earlier also I think that conversion had been strong on the 3 million of volume and you’d say okay, they are executing and every things running exactly the way you want it to run. And then you would consider that they have the capacity for integration, but I don't think where they are right now, and so I would expect to see a little more execution if you will in systems business.
I think in the Echologics business, it’s a different challenge. I think that their order book has swollen I think the challenge of the San Jose water thing, we have to be mindful if there could be pieces there that we would need to bolt-on to increase their capabilities, increase their assembly capacity, and that I would certainly do, because I think the future is bright there and I think we have enough operational excellence in Mueller Co and in other parts of the business that we can make sure that business grows with full potential by levering what’s internal.
So, more volume to do adjacencies willing to bolt-on [Indiscernible] and Echologics want to see some execution on technologies first – I’m sorry, systems first.
Operator
Thank you. I show no question at the moment.
Scott Hall
Well, let me thanks everybody and that will wrap this up for today. And Martie if you have anything, you want to say to wrap up, we’ll go from there.
Martie Zakas

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
