Thomas Joseph Ridge (born August 26, 1945) is an American politician who served as the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security from 2001 to 2003, and the first United States Secretary of Homeland Security from 2003 to 2005. Prior to this, Ridge was a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1983 to 1995 and the 43rd Governor of Pennsylvania from 1995 to 2001. He is a member of the Republican Party.
Ridge was born in Munhall, Pennsylvania and raised in veterans' public housing in Erie, Pennsylvania. After graduating from Harvard University with honors, Ridge served in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War where he was awarded the Bronze Star. He then returned to Pennsylvania and completed his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree at the Dickinson School of Law, graduating in 1972, and entered private practice.
As Assistant District Attorney in Erie, Ridge ran for Congress in his district, where he served six terms. He then ran for Governor in 1994, despite being little-known outside of northwest Pennsylvania. He won the election, and was reelected in 1998 with the most votes for a Republican governor in Pennsylvania (where Democrats outnumber Republicans by almost 500,000) in more than half a century.[1] As Governor of Pennsylvania, Ridge is credited for statewide advances in economic development, education, health care and the environment.
Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, U.S. President George W. Bush named Ridge the first Director of the newly created Office of Homeland Security. In January 2003, the Office of Homeland Security became an official Cabinet-level Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and Ridge became the first Secretary of Homeland Security. He served in these roles for Bush's first term as President, then retired and returned to the private sector.
Since re-entering the private sector, Ridge has served on the boards of The Home Depot, The Hershey Company and Exelon Corporation and as a senior advisor to Deloitte & Touche, and TechRadium. Ridge is also the founder and CEO of Ridge Global, LLC, a Washington, D.C.-based security consulting firm. Ridge spent time campaigning with Senator John McCain during his 2008 bid for the presidency and was believed by some to have been on the short list of potential running mates.[2][3]

Early life and education[edit]
Ridge was born in Munhall, Pennsylvania, in Pittsburgh's Steel Valley, the oldest of three children. His parents were Laura (née Sudimack) and Thomas Regis Ridge, who was a traveling salesman and Navy veteran. Ridge's maternal grandparents were Carpatho-Rusyn immigrants[4] from the former Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia), and his paternal great-grandparents emigrated from Great Britain.[5] Ridge was raised in veterans' public housing in Erie, Pennsylvania. He was educated at St. Andrews Elementary School and Cathedral Preparatory School and did well both academically and in sports. He earned a scholarship to Harvard College, where he paid his way through with construction work, played intramural baseball and football,[5] and graduated with honors in 1967. In 1968, after his first year at the Dickinson School of Law, he was drafted into the United States Army.
Military service[edit]

In November 1969, Ridge arrived as a sergeant in South Vietnam where he would serve for six months as a staff sergeant with Bravo Company, 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry, 11th Infantry Brigade, 23rd Infantry Division (Americal Division).[6] during the Vietnam War.
In May 1970, a ruptured appendix cut short his tour of duty in Vietnam and he was sent home; his service also aggravated a childhood ear infection which caused him afterwards to have a hearing aid in his left ear.[citation needed]
For his service in Vietnam, Ridge received the Bronze Star with "V" Device, National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal, Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with palm, Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation with Palm, Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal, and the Combat Infantryman Badge. He was later offered a commission as an officer but turned it down.[citation needed]
After returning to Pennsylvania, he completed his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree at the Dickinson School of Law, graduating in 1972, and entered private practice.[citation needed]
Public service in Pennsylvania[edit]
He became Assistant District Attorney in Erie County, Pennsylvania in 1980 and prosecuted 86 cases in two years. In 1982 he successfully ran for a seat in Congress from northwestern Pennsylvania, and was re-elected six times. Ridge was notable as the first enlisted Vietnam combat veteran elected to the U.S. House. Ridge never lost an election for public office.[citation needed]




Congressman Ridge during the 104th Congress


In 1994, despite being little-known outside of northwest Pennsylvania, Ridge ran for Governor. He won the election as a pro-choice Republican. He was reelected in 1998 with 57 percent of the vote in a four-way race. His share of the vote in that election was the highest for a Republican governor in Pennsylvania (where Democrats outnumber Republicans by almost 500,000) in more than half a century.[1] Ridge served as Governor until his resignation to become the Director of Homeland Security in 2001.[citation needed]
One of Ridge's more controversial actions as governor was his nomination of Peter J. Jannetta to be the State Secretary of Health. Jannetta had previously been accused of committing perjury, with the State's Superior Court stating, "We have little difficulty in concluding that Dr. Jannetta's testimony at deposition was different than, or inconsistent with, the testimony at trial." Jannetta was not, however, ever convicted of perjury.[7]
Jannetta served as Health Secretary for 6 months. Another health department related action by Ridge has generated controversy since he left office. He stopped the annual inspections of abortion clinics, which may have contributed to Kermit Gosnell being able to run a sub-standard clinic that the grand jury insisted met the definition of a racketeering operation.[8]
During his time as governor, Ridge promoted "law and order" policies, supporting a three-strikes law and a faster death penalty process. A death penalty supporter,[9] Ridge signed more than 224 execution warrants[10] – five times the number signed over a 25-year period by the two previous governors – but only three voluntary executions were carried out. On social issues, he opposed gay marriage but is pro-choice on abortion issues.[citation needed]
Over Ridge's tenure, the Commonwealth's budget grew by two to three percent per fiscal year and combined tax reductions totaled over $2 billion. Ridge created and grew a "Rainy Day" Fund balance to over $1 billion to be utilized during an economic downturn or recession.[citation needed]
Ridge pushed for legislation permitting competition among electric utilities and enhanced federal and state support for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). He also separated the Commonwealth's environmental regulatory and conservation programs into two new agencies; the Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.[citation needed]
Ridge proposed the creation of public charter schools in Pennsylvania and in establishing alternate schools for disruptive students. He launched new academic standards that established academic expectations for what students were expected to know in different grades. Ridge also proposed a school choice demonstration program.[citation needed]
Ridge oversaw a number of e-government projects including renewing drivers' licenses and vehicle registrations to viewing historical documents and library catalogs. The Commonwealth's portal won several national awards. One of the nation's first electronic grant systems was put into place at the Pennsylvania Department of Education. He created the Link-to-Learn initiative to increase the effective use of technology in public schools and universities.[citation needed]
In 2001, he was named runner up "Politician of the Year" by PoliticsPA.[11]
In a 2002 PoliticsPA Feature story designating politicians with yearbook superlatives, he was named the "Most Popular."[12]
2000 Presidential election[edit]
Ridge was a potential running mate for Bob Dole in 1996, and served as a close advisor to GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush, a close friend from their simultaneous tenures as governors, during the 2000 presidential campaign. In return, Bush named Ridge to his short list for possible running mates, along with New York Governor George Pataki, Michigan Governor John Engler, Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating, former Missouri Senator John Danforth, and former American Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole.[13]
Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, U.S. President George W. Bush created the Office of Homeland Security within the White House, and named Ridge to head it. The charge to the nation's new director of homeland security was to develop and coordinate a comprehensive national strategy to strengthen the United States against terrorist threats or attacks. Ridge formally resigned as Pennsylvania's governor on October 5, 2001.[citation needed]
In January 2003 and after the passage of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the Office of Homeland Security split into a Cabinet-level Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and the White House Homeland Security Advisory Council. Ridge left the White House and became the first Secretary of Homeland Security. The Department's Mission "is to (A) prevent terrorist attacks within the United States; (B) reduce the vulnerability of the United States to terrorism; and (C) minimize the damage, and assist in the recovery, from terrorist attacks that do occur within the United States" (From H.R. 5005-8 the Homeland Security Act of 2002). The newly created Department was the most comprehensive reorganization of the Federal government since the National Security Act of 1947.
The Department of Homeland Security consolidates 22 agencies and 180,000 employees, unifying once-fragmented Federal functions in a single agency dedicated to protecting America from terrorism. Ridge worked with the employees from combined agencies to strengthen borders, provide for intelligence analysis and infrastructure protection, improve the use of science and technology to counter weapons of mass destruction, and to create a comprehensive response and recovery division.[14][15][16][17][18]
In January 2004, Ridge was named among others in a lawsuit filed by a Syrian-born Canadian Maher Arar who said he was tortured in Syria after being deported by American authorities.[19]
On November 30, 2004, Ridge submitted his resignation to the President, saying, "After more than 22 consecutive years of public service, it is time to give personal and family matters a higher priority."[20]
In his book The Test of Our Times: America Under Siege...and How We Can Be Safe Again, Ridge says his resignation was due to an effort by senior Bush administration officials to raise the nation's terror alert level in the days before the 2004 presidential vote.[21][22]
Work in the private sector[edit]
Ridge is the founder and CEO of Ridge Global, an advisory firm in Washington, D.C.[23]
Ridge served on a state-appointed incident review panel which investigated the Virginia Tech massacre of April 2007.[24]
RIDGE-LANE Limited Partners[edit]
Ridge is a co-founder, along with investment banker R. Brad Lane,[25] of RIDGE-LANE Limited and RIDGE-LANE Capital, a merchant-bank that sponsors urban development projects, public–private partnerships (P3) and economic development programs, as well as corporate development services for private technology companies.[26]
Ridge Policy Group[edit]
In 2010, Ridge’s two former Chiefs of Staff Mark Campbell and Mark Holman opened a lobbying firm after Ridge lent the firm his name.[27] The full-service government affairs firm has offices in Harrisburg, PA, and Washington, D.C.
In July 2010, companies seeking to use hydraulic fracturing to extract natural gas from the Marcellus Shale formation engaged Ridge and Ridge Policy Group at $75,000 a month to help them gain support.[28]
Home Depot[edit]
In February 2005, Tom Ridge was named to the board of Home Depot.[29] Ridge's compensation was expected to be about $100,000 per annum for this position.[30] Since April 2005, Ridge served on the board of Savi Technology,[31] the primary technology provider for the wireless cargo-monitoring network for the United States Department of Defense.[32]
Exelon Corporation[edit]
In April, 2005, Ridge's appointment to the board of the Illinois/Pennsylvania/New Jersey electric utility was announced, with starting director compensation of $35,000 annual retainer plus a $1,500 meeting fee or per diem fee. Directors were also granted $60,000 in deferred stock units each year at that time.[33]
In 2010, it was reported that Ridge had appeared on MSNBC Hardball With Chris Matthews promoting nuclear energy as part of a "green agenda [to] ... create jobs, create exports," without any revelation by him or the cable channel of his Exelon position. In the report, his cumulative Exelon-derived compensation was put at $530,659; and it was said that, as of March 2009, he held an estimated $248,299 in Exelon stock, according to SEC filings. Exelon was described as "the nation's largest nuclear power company."[34][35]
Deloitte LLP[edit]
In November 2006, Tom Ridge was announced as a Senior Advisor for Deloitte & Touche USA LLP.[36]
The Hershey Company[edit]
In November 2007, Ridge was named to serve on The Hershey Company's Executive Board. The Hershey Trust, the primary shareholder of Hershey, asked for a change in board composition after several years of poor stock performance. The board named Ridge to the board for his knowledge of economics.[37]
TechRadium Inc[edit]
Announced in January 2008, Tom Ridge will serve as a senior advisor to TechRadium, Inc., a Texas-based security technology company that provides its patented alert and notification system, IRIS (Immediate Response Information System), to a wide range of users including municipalities, public schools and universities, utilities, and military programs.[38]
PURE Bioscience[edit]
In September 2009, PURE Bioscience, creator of a patented antimicrobial, announced Ridge would serve on its Advisory Board along with former Wisconsin governor Tommy Thompson.[39]
Political activity[edit]
2008 Presidential election[edit]
Tom Ridge served as a senior aide to Republican Presidential candidate Senator John McCain of Arizona,[40] and was considered by some as a possible running mate for McCain.[2][3]

Possible 2010 Senate candidacy[edit]
According to Fox News, many Republicans hoped Ridge would run for the United States Senate against the newly turned Democrat Arlen Specter, who stated he would seek re-election in 2010 in the Democratic primary. Already seeking the Republican nomination was former Representative Pat Toomey, who narrowly lost to Specter in the Republican primary in 2004. Some Republicans thought Ridge would have a better chance against Specter than would Toomey.[41] A Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll conducted between April 30, 2009 and May 3, 2009 placed Ridge within three points of Specter in a hypothetical matchup between the two men.[42]
Some Toomey supporters criticized the idea of a Ridge candidacy because, although Ridge was still registered to vote in Pennsylvania, he was actually living in Chevy Chase, Maryland.[43] On May 7, 2009, Ridge announced that he would not be a candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2010.[44]
2012 Presidential election[edit]
Ridge originally endorsed former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman for president, in September 2011.[45] Mitt Romney announced an endorsement from Ridge on March 14, 2012.[46]
Supreme Court brief[edit]
In 2013, Ridge was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the Hollingsworth v. Perry case.[47]
Support for the People's Mujahedin of Iran[edit]
Ridge spoke at a conference in support of the removal of the People's Mujahedin of Iran (MEK, also PMOI, MKO) from the United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations.[48] The group was listed on the State Department list from 1997 until September 2012. They were placed on the list for killing six Americans in Iran during the 1970s and attempting to attack the Iranian mission to the United Nations in 1992.[49][50] Ridge, along with other former government officials and politicians Ed Rendell, R. James Woolsey, Porter Goss, Louis Freeh, Michael Mukasey, James L. Jones, Rudy Giuliani, and Howard Dean, were criticized for their involvement with the group. Some were subpoenaed during an inquiry about who was paying the prominent individuals' speaking fees.[51] Ridge and others wrote an article for the conservative publication National Review stating their position that the group should not be classified as a terrorist organization, raising the point that, at the time, only the United States and Iran still listed it as a terrorist group.[52]
2015 Blue Ribbon Commission[edit]




Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense (Ridge 2nd from left)


In 2015, Ridge served as Co-chair of the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, a commission that recommended changes to U.S. policy regarding biodefense.[53] In order to address biological threats facing the nation, the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense created a 33-step initiative for the U.S. Government to implement. Tom Ridge headed the organization with former Senator Joe Lieberman, and the Study Panel assembled in Washington D.C. for four meetings concerning current biodefense programs. The Study Panel concluded that the federal government had little to no defense mechanisms in case of a biological event. The Study Panel's final report, The National Blueprint for Biodefense, proposes a string of solutions and recommendations for the U.S. Government to take, including items such as giving the Vice President authority over biodefense responsibilities and merging the entire biodefense budget. These solutions represent the Panel's call to action in order to increase awareness and activity for pandemic related issues. 
2016 Presidential election[edit]
In 2016, Ridge endorsed Jeb Bush and subsequently John Kasich after Bush's withdrawal from the 2016 Republican presidential primaries. Ridge stated he would not endorse Donald Trump, following Trump's becoming presumptive nominee, or Hillary Clinton in the general election.[54]
Memoir[edit]
Tom Ridge's book The Test of Our Times was published in September 2009.[55] Written with Larry Bloom, it concerns Ridge's time as the head of the Department of Homeland Security. He explains the challenges and decision making processes of the newly formed department, and gives his own views as to the future of the security of the United States of America. The book further discusses

"the infighting he saw that frustrated his attempts to build a smooth-running department. Among the headlines promoted by publisher Thomas Dunne Books: Ridge was never invited to sit in on National Security Council meetings; was 'blindsided' by the FBI in morning Oval Office meetings because the agency withheld critical information from him; found his urgings to block Michael Brown from being named head of the emergency agency blamed for the Hurricane Katrina disaster ignored; and was pushed to raise the security alert on the eve of President Bush's re-election, something he saw as politically motivated and worth resigning over."[22]

Ridge wrote in his memoir that then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and then-Attorney General John Ashcroft pressured him to raise the terror alert level, running up to the 2004 elections, because of a pre-election message critical of President Bush from Osama Bin Laden.[21]

Thomas Joseph Ridge (born August 26, 1945) is an American politician who served as the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security from 2001 to 2003, and the first United States Secretary of Homeland Security from 2003 to 2005. Prior to this, Ridge was a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1983 to 1995 and the 43rd Governor of Pennsylvania from 1995 to 2001. He is a member of the Republican Party.
Ridge was born in Munhall, Pennsylvania and raised in veterans' public housing in Erie, Pennsylvania. After graduating from Harvard University with honors, Ridge served in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War where he was awarded the Bronze Star. He then returned to Pennsylvania and completed his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree at the Dickinson School of Law, graduating in 1972, and entered private practice.
As Assistant District Attorney in Erie, Ridge ran for Congress in his district, where he served six terms. He then ran for Governor in 1994, despite being little-known outside of northwest Pennsylvania. He won the election, and was reelected in 1998 with the most votes for a Republican governor in Pennsylvania (where Democrats outnumber Republicans by almost 500,000) in more than half a century.[1] As Governor of Pennsylvania, Ridge is credited for statewide advances in economic development, education, health care and the environment.
Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, U.S. President George W. Bush named Ridge the first Director of the newly created Office of Homeland Security. In January 2003, the Office of Homeland Security became an official Cabinet-level Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and Ridge became the first Secretary of Homeland Security. He served in these roles for Bush's first term as President, then retired and returned to the private sector.
Since re-entering the private sector, Ridge has served on the boards of The Home Depot, The Hershey Company and Exelon Corporation and as a senior advisor to Deloitte & Touche, and TechRadium. Ridge is also the founder and CEO of Ridge Global, LLC, a Washington, D.C.-based security consulting firm. Ridge spent time campaigning with Senator John McCain during his 2008 bid for the presidency and was believed by some to have been on the short list of potential running mates.[2][3]

Early life and education[edit]
Ridge was born in Munhall, Pennsylvania, in Pittsburgh's Steel Valley, the oldest of three children. His parents were Laura (née Sudimack) and Thomas Regis Ridge, who was a traveling salesman and Navy veteran. Ridge's maternal grandparents were Carpatho-Rusyn immigrants[4] from the former Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia), and his paternal great-grandparents emigrated from Great Britain.[5] Ridge was raised in veterans' public housing in Erie, Pennsylvania. He was educated at St. Andrews Elementary School and Cathedral Preparatory School and did well both academically and in sports. He earned a scholarship to Harvard College, where he paid his way through with construction work, played intramural baseball and football,[5] and graduated with honors in 1967. In 1968, after his first year at the Dickinson School of Law, he was drafted into the United States Army.
Military service[edit]

In November 1969, Ridge arrived as a sergeant in South Vietnam where he would serve for six months as a staff sergeant with Bravo Company, 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry, 11th Infantry Brigade, 23rd Infantry Division (Americal Division).[6] during the Vietnam War.
In May 1970, a ruptured appendix cut short his tour of duty in Vietnam and he was sent home; his service also aggravated a childhood ear infection which caused him afterwards to have a hearing aid in his left ear.[citation needed]
For his service in Vietnam, Ridge received the Bronze Star with "V" Device, National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal, Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with palm, Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation with Palm, Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal, and the Combat Infantryman Badge. He was later offered a commission as an officer but turned it down.[citation needed]
After returning to Pennsylvania, he completed his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree at the Dickinson School of Law, graduating in 1972, and entered private practice.[citation needed]
Public service in Pennsylvania[edit]
He became Assistant District Attorney in Erie County, Pennsylvania in 1980 and prosecuted 86 cases in two years. In 1982 he successfully ran for a seat in Congress from northwestern Pennsylvania, and was re-elected six times. Ridge was notable as the first enlisted Vietnam combat veteran elected to the U.S. House. Ridge never lost an election for public office.[citation needed]




Congressman Ridge during the 104th Congress


In 1994, despite being little-known outside of northwest Pennsylvania, Ridge ran for Governor. He won the election as a pro-choice Republican. He was reelected in 1998 with 57 percent of the vote in a four-way race. His share of the vote in that election was the highest for a Republican governor in Pennsylvania (where Democrats outnumber Republicans by almost 500,000) in more than half a century.[1] Ridge served as Governor until his resignation to become the Director of Homeland Security in 2001.[citation needed]
One of Ridge's more controversial actions as governor was his nomination of Peter J. Jannetta to be the State Secretary of Health. Jannetta had previously been accused of committing perjury, with the State's Superior Court stating, "We have little difficulty in concluding that Dr. Jannetta's testimony at deposition was different than, or inconsistent with, the testimony at trial." Jannetta was not, however, ever convicted of perjury.[7]
Jannetta served as Health Secretary for 6 months. Another health department related action by Ridge has generated controversy since he left office. He stopped the annual inspections of abortion clinics, which may have contributed to Kermit Gosnell being able to run a sub-standard clinic that the grand jury insisted met the definition of a racketeering operation.[8]
During his time as governor, Ridge promoted "law and order" policies, supporting a three-strikes law and a faster death penalty process. A death penalty supporter,[9] Ridge signed more than 224 execution warrants[10] – five times the number signed over a 25-year period by the two previous governors – but only three voluntary executions were carried out. On social issues, he opposed gay marriage but is pro-choice on abortion issues.[citation needed]
Over Ridge's tenure, the Commonwealth's budget grew by two to three percent per fiscal year and combined tax reductions totaled over $2 billion. Ridge created and grew a "Rainy Day" Fund balance to over $1 billion to be utilized during an economic downturn or recession.[citation needed]
Ridge pushed for legislation permitting competition among electric utilities and enhanced federal and state support for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). He also separated the Commonwealth's environmental regulatory and conservation programs into two new agencies; the Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.[citation needed]
Ridge proposed the creation of public charter schools in Pennsylvania and in establishing alternate schools for disruptive students. He launched new academic standards that established academic expectations for what students were expected to know in different grades. Ridge also proposed a school choice demonstration program.[citation needed]
Ridge oversaw a number of e-government projects including renewing drivers' licenses and vehicle registrations to viewing historical documents and library catalogs. The Commonwealth's portal won several national awards. One of the nation's first electronic grant systems was put into place at the Pennsylvania Department of Education. He created the Link-to-Learn initiative to increase the effective use of technology in public schools and universities.[citation needed]
In 2001, he was named runner up "Politician of the Year" by PoliticsPA.[11]
In a 2002 PoliticsPA Feature story designating politicians with yearbook superlatives, he was named the "Most Popular."[12]
2000 Presidential election[edit]
Ridge was a potential running mate for Bob Dole in 1996, and served as a close advisor to GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush, a close friend from their simultaneous tenures as governors, during the 2000 presidential campaign. In return, Bush named Ridge to his short list for possible running mates, along with New York Governor George Pataki, Michigan Governor John Engler, Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating, former Missouri Senator John Danforth, and former American Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole.[13]
Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, U.S. President George W. Bush created the Office of Homeland Security within the White House, and named Ridge to head it. The charge to the nation's new director of homeland security was to develop and coordinate a comprehensive national strategy to strengthen the United States against terrorist threats or attacks. Ridge formally resigned as Pennsylvania's governor on October 5, 2001.[citation needed]
In January 2003 and after the passage of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the Office of Homeland Security split into a Cabinet-level Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and the White House Homeland Security Advisory Council. Ridge left the White House and became the first Secretary of Homeland Security. The Department's Mission "is to (A) prevent terrorist attacks within the United States; (B) reduce the vulnerability of the United States to terrorism; and (C) minimize the damage, and assist in the recovery, from terrorist attacks that do occur within the United States" (From H.R. 5005-8 the Homeland Security Act of 2002). The newly created Department was the most comprehensive reorganization of the Federal government since the National Security Act of 1947.
The Department of Homeland Security consolidates 22 agencies and 180,000 employees, unifying once-fragmented Federal functions in a single agency dedicated to protecting America from terrorism. Ridge worked with the employees from combined agencies to strengthen borders, provide for intelligence analysis and infrastructure protection, improve the use of science and technology to counter weapons of mass destruction, and to create a comprehensive response and recovery division.[14][15][16][17][18]
In January 2004, Ridge was named among others in a lawsuit filed by a Syrian-born Canadian Maher Arar who said he was tortured in Syria after being deported by American authorities.[19]
On November 30, 2004, Ridge submitted his resignation to the President, saying, "After more than 22 consecutive years of public service, it is time to give personal and family matters a higher priority."[20]
In his book The Test of Our Times: America Under Siege...and How We Can Be Safe Again, Ridge says his resignation was due to an effort by senior Bush administration officials to raise the nation's terror alert level in the days before the 2004 presidential vote.[21][22]
Work in the private sector[edit]
Ridge is the founder and CEO of Ridge Global, an advisory firm in Washington, D.C.[23]
Ridge served on a state-appointed incident review panel which investigated the Virginia Tech massacre of April 2007.[24]
RIDGE-LANE Limited Partners[edit]
Ridge is a co-founder, along with investment banker R. Brad Lane,[25] of RIDGE-LANE Limited and RIDGE-LANE Capital, a merchant-bank that sponsors urban development projects, public–private partnerships (P3) and economic development programs, as well as corporate development services for private technology companies.[26]
Ridge Policy Group[edit]
In 2010, Ridge’s two former Chiefs of Staff Mark Campbell and Mark Holman opened a lobbying firm after Ridge lent the firm his name.[27] The full-service government affairs firm has offices in Harrisburg, PA, and Washington, D.C.
In July 2010, companies seeking to use hydraulic fracturing to extract natural gas from the Marcellus Shale formation engaged Ridge and Ridge Policy Group at $75,000 a month to help them gain support.[28]
Home Depot[edit]
In February 2005, Tom Ridge was named to the board of Home Depot.[29] Ridge's compensation was expected to be about $100,000 per annum for this position.[30] Since April 2005, Ridge served on the board of Savi Technology,[31] the primary technology provider for the wireless cargo-monitoring network for the United States Department of Defense.[32]
Exelon Corporation[edit]
In April, 2005, Ridge's appointment to the board of the Illinois/Pennsylvania/New Jersey electric utility was announced, with starting director compensation of $35,000 annual retainer plus a $1,500 meeting fee or per diem fee. Directors were also granted $60,000 in deferred stock units each year at that time.[33]
In 2010, it was reported that Ridge had appeared on MSNBC Hardball With Chris Matthews promoting nuclear energy as part of a "green agenda [to] ... create jobs, create exports," without any revelation by him or the cable channel of his Exelon position. In the report, his cumulative Exelon-derived compensation was put at $530,659; and it was said that, as of March 2009, he held an estimated $248,299 in Exelon stock, according to SEC filings. Exelon was described as "the nation's largest nuclear power company."[34][35]
Deloitte LLP[edit]
In November 2006, Tom Ridge was announced as a Senior Advisor for Deloitte & Touche USA LLP.[36]
The Hershey Company[edit]
In November 2007, Ridge was named to serve on The Hershey Company's Executive Board. The Hershey Trust, the primary shareholder of Hershey, asked for a change in board composition after several years of poor stock performance. The board named Ridge to the board for his knowledge of economics.[37]
TechRadium Inc[edit]
Announced in January 2008, Tom Ridge will serve as a senior advisor to TechRadium, Inc., a Texas-based security technology company that provides its patented alert and notification system, IRIS (Immediate Response Information System), to a wide range of users including municipalities, public schools and universities, utilities, and military programs.[38]
PURE Bioscience[edit]
In September 2009, PURE Bioscience, creator of a patented antimicrobial, announced Ridge would serve on its Advisory Board along with former Wisconsin governor Tommy Thompson.[39]
Political activity[edit]
2008 Presidential election[edit]
Tom Ridge served as a senior aide to Republican Presidential candidate Senator John McCain of Arizona,[40] and was considered by some as a possible running mate for McCain.[2][3]

Possible 2010 Senate candidacy[edit]
According to Fox News, many Republicans hoped Ridge would run for the United States Senate against the newly turned Democrat Arlen Specter, who stated he would seek re-election in 2010 in the Democratic primary. Already seeking the Republican nomination was former Representative Pat Toomey, who narrowly lost to Specter in the Republican primary in 2004. Some Republicans thought Ridge would have a better chance against Specter than would Toomey.[41] A Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll conducted between April 30, 2009 and May 3, 2009 placed Ridge within three points of Specter in a hypothetical matchup between the two men.[42]
Some Toomey supporters criticized the idea of a Ridge candidacy because, although Ridge was still registered to vote in Pennsylvania, he was actually living in Chevy Chase, Maryland.[43] On May 7, 2009, Ridge announced that he would not be a candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2010.[44]
2012 Presidential election[edit]
Ridge originally endorsed former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman for president, in September 2011.[45] Mitt Romney announced an endorsement from Ridge on March 14, 2012.[46]
Supreme Court brief[edit]
In 2013, Ridge was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the Hollingsworth v. Perry case.[47]
Support for the People's Mujahedin of Iran[edit]
Ridge spoke at a conference in support of the removal of the People's Mujahedin of Iran (MEK, also PMOI, MKO) from the United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations.[48] The group was listed on the State Department list from 1997 until September 2012. They were placed on the list for killing six Americans in Iran during the 1970s and attempting to attack the Iranian mission to the United Nations in 1992.[49][50] Ridge, along with other former government officials and politicians Ed Rendell, R. James Woolsey, Porter Goss, Louis Freeh, Michael Mukasey, James L. Jones, Rudy Giuliani, and Howard Dean, were criticized for their involvement with the group. Some were subpoenaed during an inquiry about who was paying the prominent individuals' speaking fees.[51] Ridge and others wrote an article for the conservative publication National Review stating their position that the group should not be classified as a terrorist organization, raising the point that, at the time, only the United States and Iran still listed it as a terrorist group.[52]
2015 Blue Ribbon Commission[edit]




Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense (Ridge 2nd from left)


In 2015, Ridge served as Co-chair of the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, a commission that recommended changes to U.S. policy regarding biodefense.[53] In order to address biological threats facing the nation, the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense created a 33-step initiative for the U.S. Government to implement. Tom Ridge headed the organization with former Senator Joe Lieberman, and the Study Panel assembled in Washington D.C. for four meetings concerning current biodefense programs. The Study Panel concluded that the federal government had little to no defense mechanisms in case of a biological event. The Study Panel's final report, The National Blueprint for Biodefense, proposes a string of solutions and recommendations for the U.S. Government to take, including items such as giving the Vice President authority over biodefense responsibilities and merging the entire biodefense budget. These solutions represent the Panel's call to action in order to increase awareness and activity for pandemic related issues. 
2016 Presidential election[edit]
In 2016, Ridge endorsed Jeb Bush and subsequently John Kasich after Bush's withdrawal from the 2016 Republican presidential primaries. Ridge stated he would not endorse Donald Trump, following Trump's becoming presumptive nominee, or Hillary Clinton in the general election.[54]
Memoir[edit]
Tom Ridge's book The Test of Our Times was published in September 2009.[55] Written with Larry Bloom, it concerns Ridge's time as the head of the Department of Homeland Security. He explains the challenges and decision making processes of the newly formed department, and gives his own views as to the future of the security of the United States of America. The book further discusses

"the infighting he saw that frustrated his attempts to build a smooth-running department. Among the headlines promoted by publisher Thomas Dunne Books: Ridge was never invited to sit in on National Security Council meetings; was 'blindsided' by the FBI in morning Oval Office meetings because the agency withheld critical information from him; found his urgings to block Michael Brown from being named head of the emergency agency blamed for the Hurricane Katrina disaster ignored; and was pushed to raise the security alert on the eve of President Bush's re-election, something he saw as politically motivated and worth resigning over."[22]

Ridge wrote in his memoir that then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and then-Attorney General John Ashcroft pressured him to raise the terror alert level, running up to the 2004 elections, because of a pre-election message critical of President Bush from Osama Bin Laden.[21]

Thomas Joseph Ridge (born August 26, 1945) is an American politician who served as the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security from 2001 to 2003, and the first United States Secretary of Homeland Security from 2003 to 2005. Prior to this, Ridge was a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1983 to 1995 and the 43rd Governor of Pennsylvania from 1995 to 2001. He is a member of the Republican Party.
Ridge was born in Munhall, Pennsylvania and raised in veterans' public housing in Erie, Pennsylvania. After graduating from Harvard University with honors, Ridge served in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War where he was awarded the Bronze Star. He then returned to Pennsylvania and completed his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree at the Dickinson School of Law, graduating in 1972, and entered private practice.
As Assistant District Attorney in Erie, Ridge ran for Congress in his district, where he served six terms. He then ran for Governor in 1994, despite being little-known outside of northwest Pennsylvania. He won the election, and was reelected in 1998 with the most votes for a Republican governor in Pennsylvania (where Democrats outnumber Republicans by almost 500,000) in more than half a century.[1] As Governor of Pennsylvania, Ridge is credited for statewide advances in economic development, education, health care and the environment.
Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, U.S. President George W. Bush named Ridge the first Director of the newly created Office of Homeland Security. In January 2003, the Office of Homeland Security became an official Cabinet-level Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and Ridge became the first Secretary of Homeland Security. He served in these roles for Bush's first term as President, then retired and returned to the private sector.
Since re-entering the private sector, Ridge has served on the boards of The Home Depot, The Hershey Company and Exelon Corporation and as a senior advisor to Deloitte & Touche, and TechRadium. Ridge is also the founder and CEO of Ridge Global, LLC, a Washington, D.C.-based security consulting firm. Ridge spent time campaigning with Senator John McCain during his 2008 bid for the presidency and was believed by some to have been on the short list of potential running mates.[2][3]

Early life and education[edit]
Ridge was born in Munhall, Pennsylvania, in Pittsburgh's Steel Valley, the oldest of three children. His parents were Laura (née Sudimack) and Thomas Regis Ridge, who was a traveling salesman and Navy veteran. Ridge's maternal grandparents were Carpatho-Rusyn immigrants[4] from the former Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia), and his paternal great-grandparents emigrated from Great Britain.[5] Ridge was raised in veterans' public housing in Erie, Pennsylvania. He was educated at St. Andrews Elementary School and Cathedral Preparatory School and did well both academically and in sports. He earned a scholarship to Harvard College, where he paid his way through with construction work, played intramural baseball and football,[5] and graduated with honors in 1967. In 1968, after his first year at the Dickinson School of Law, he was drafted into the United States Army.
Military service[edit]

In November 1969, Ridge arrived as a sergeant in South Vietnam where he would serve for six months as a staff sergeant with Bravo Company, 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry, 11th Infantry Brigade, 23rd Infantry Division (Americal Division).[6] during the Vietnam War.
In May 1970, a ruptured appendix cut short his tour of duty in Vietnam and he was sent home; his service also aggravated a childhood ear infection which caused him afterwards to have a hearing aid in his left ear.[citation needed]
For his service in Vietnam, Ridge received the Bronze Star with "V" Device, National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal, Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with palm, Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation with Palm, Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal, and the Combat Infantryman Badge. He was later offered a commission as an officer but turned it down.[citation needed]
After returning to Pennsylvania, he completed his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree at the Dickinson School of Law, graduating in 1972, and entered private practice.[citation needed]
Public service in Pennsylvania[edit]
He became Assistant District Attorney in Erie County, Pennsylvania in 1980 and prosecuted 86 cases in two years. In 1982 he successfully ran for a seat in Congress from northwestern Pennsylvania, and was re-elected six times. Ridge was notable as the first enlisted Vietnam combat veteran elected to the U.S. House. Ridge never lost an election for public office.[citation needed]




Congressman Ridge during the 104th Congress


In 1994, despite being little-known outside of northwest Pennsylvania, Ridge ran for Governor. He won the election as a pro-choice Republican. He was reelected in 1998 with 57 percent of the vote in a four-way race. His share of the vote in that election was the highest for a Republican governor in Pennsylvania (where Democrats outnumber Republicans by almost 500,000) in more than half a century.[1] Ridge served as Governor until his resignation to become the Director of Homeland Security in 2001.[citation needed]
One of Ridge's more controversial actions as governor was his nomination of Peter J. Jannetta to be the State Secretary of Health. Jannetta had previously been accused of committing perjury, with the State's Superior Court stating, "We have little difficulty in concluding that Dr. Jannetta's testimony at deposition was different than, or inconsistent with, the testimony at trial." Jannetta was not, however, ever convicted of perjury.[7]
Jannetta served as Health Secretary for 6 months. Another health department related action by Ridge has generated controversy since he left office. He stopped the annual inspections of abortion clinics, which may have contributed to Kermit Gosnell being able to run a sub-standard clinic that the grand jury insisted met the definition of a racketeering operation.[8]
During his time as governor, Ridge promoted "law and order" policies, supporting a three-strikes law and a faster death penalty process. A death penalty supporter,[9] Ridge signed more than 224 execution warrants[10] – five times the number signed over a 25-year period by the two previous governors – but only three voluntary executions were carried out. On social issues, he opposed gay marriage but is pro-choice on abortion issues.[citation needed]
Over Ridge's tenure, the Commonwealth's budget grew by two to three percent per fiscal year and combined tax reductions totaled over $2 billion. Ridge created and grew a "Rainy Day" Fund balance to over $1 billion to be utilized during an economic downturn or recession.[citation needed]
Ridge pushed for legislation permitting competition among electric utilities and enhanced federal and state support for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). He also separated the Commonwealth's environmental regulatory and conservation programs into two new agencies; the Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.[citation needed]
Ridge proposed the creation of public charter schools in Pennsylvania and in establishing alternate schools for disruptive students. He launched new academic standards that established academic expectations for what students were expected to know in different grades. Ridge also proposed a school choice demonstration program.[citation needed]
Ridge oversaw a number of e-government projects including renewing drivers' licenses and vehicle registrations to viewing historical documents and library catalogs. The Commonwealth's portal won several national awards. One of the nation's first electronic grant systems was put into place at the Pennsylvania Department of Education. He created the Link-to-Learn initiative to increase the effective use of technology in public schools and universities.[citation needed]
In 2001, he was named runner up "Politician of the Year" by PoliticsPA.[11]
In a 2002 PoliticsPA Feature story designating politicians with yearbook superlatives, he was named the "Most Popular."[12]
2000 Presidential election[edit]
Ridge was a potential running mate for Bob Dole in 1996, and served as a close advisor to GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush, a close friend from their simultaneous tenures as governors, during the 2000 presidential campaign. In return, Bush named Ridge to his short list for possible running mates, along with New York Governor George Pataki, Michigan Governor John Engler, Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating, former Missouri Senator John Danforth, and former American Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole.[13]
Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, U.S. President George W. Bush created the Office of Homeland Security within the White House, and named Ridge to head it. The charge to the nation's new director of homeland security was to develop and coordinate a comprehensive national strategy to strengthen the United States against terrorist threats or attacks. Ridge formally resigned as Pennsylvania's governor on October 5, 2001.[citation needed]
In January 2003 and after the passage of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the Office of Homeland Security split into a Cabinet-level Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and the White House Homeland Security Advisory Council. Ridge left the White House and became the first Secretary of Homeland Security. The Department's Mission "is to (A) prevent terrorist attacks within the United States; (B) reduce the vulnerability of the United States to terrorism; and (C) minimize the damage, and assist in the recovery, from terrorist attacks that do occur within the United States" (From H.R. 5005-8 the Homeland Security Act of 2002). The newly created Department was the most comprehensive reorganization of the Federal government since the National Security Act of 1947.
The Department of Homeland Security consolidates 22 agencies and 180,000 employees, unifying once-fragmented Federal functions in a single agency dedicated to protecting America from terrorism. Ridge worked with the employees from combined agencies to strengthen borders, provide for intelligence analysis and infrastructure protection, improve the use of science and technology to counter weapons of mass destruction, and to create a comprehensive response and recovery division.[14][15][16][17][18]
In January 2004, Ridge was named among others in a lawsuit filed by a Syrian-born Canadian Maher Arar who said he was tortured in Syria after being deported by American authorities.[19]
On November 30, 2004, Ridge submitted his resignation to the President, saying, "After more than 22 consecutive years of public service, it is time to give personal and family matters a higher priority."[20]
In his book The Test of Our Times: America Under Siege...and How We Can Be Safe Again, Ridge says his resignation was due to an effort by senior Bush administration officials to raise the nation's terror alert level in the days before the 2004 presidential vote.[21][22]
Work in the private sector[edit]
Ridge is the founder and CEO of Ridge Global, an advisory firm in Washington, D.C.[23]
Ridge served on a state-appointed incident review panel which investigated the Virginia Tech massacre of April 2007.[24]
RIDGE-LANE Limited Partners[edit]
Ridge is a co-founder, along with investment banker R. Brad Lane,[25] of RIDGE-LANE Limited and RIDGE-LANE Capital, a merchant-bank that sponsors urban development projects, public–private partnerships (P3) and economic development programs, as well as corporate development services for private technology companies.[26]
Ridge Policy Group[edit]
In 2010, Ridge’s two former Chiefs of Staff Mark Campbell and Mark Holman opened a lobbying firm after Ridge lent the firm his name.[27] The full-service government affairs firm has offices in Harrisburg, PA, and Washington, D.C.
In July 2010, companies seeking to use hydraulic fracturing to extract natural gas from the Marcellus Shale formation engaged Ridge and Ridge Policy Group at $75,000 a month to help them gain support.[28]
Home Depot[edit]
In February 2005, Tom Ridge was named to the board of Home Depot.[29] Ridge's compensation was expected to be about $100,000 per annum for this position.[30] Since April 2005, Ridge served on the board of Savi Technology,[31] the primary technology provider for the wireless cargo-monitoring network for the United States Department of Defense.[32]
Exelon Corporation[edit]
In April, 2005, Ridge's appointment to the board of the Illinois/Pennsylvania/New Jersey electric utility was announced, with starting director compensation of $35,000 annual retainer plus a $1,500 meeting fee or per diem fee. Directors were also granted $60,000 in deferred stock units each year at that time.[33]
In 2010, it was reported that Ridge had appeared on MSNBC Hardball With Chris Matthews promoting nuclear energy as part of a "green agenda [to] ... create jobs, create exports," without any revelation by him or the cable channel of his Exelon position. In the report, his cumulative Exelon-derived compensation was put at $530,659; and it was said that, as of March 2009, he held an estimated $248,299 in Exelon stock, according to SEC filings. Exelon was described as "the nation's largest nuclear power company."[34][35]
Deloitte LLP[edit]
In November 2006, Tom Ridge was announced as a Senior Advisor for Deloitte & Touche USA LLP.[36]
The Hershey Company[edit]
In November 2007, Ridge was named to serve on The Hershey Company's Executive Board. The Hershey Trust, the primary shareholder of Hershey, asked for a change in board composition after several years of poor stock performance. The board named Ridge to the board for his knowledge of economics.[37]
TechRadium Inc[edit]
Announced in January 2008, Tom Ridge will serve as a senior advisor to TechRadium, Inc., a Texas-based security technology company that provides its patented alert and notification system, IRIS (Immediate Response Information System), to a wide range of users including municipalities, public schools and universities, utilities, and military programs.[38]
PURE Bioscience[edit]
In September 2009, PURE Bioscience, creator of a patented antimicrobial, announced Ridge would serve on its Advisory Board along with former Wisconsin governor Tommy Thompson.[39]
Political activity[edit]
2008 Presidential election[edit]
Tom Ridge served as a senior aide to Republican Presidential candidate Senator John McCain of Arizona,[40] and was considered by some as a possible running mate for McCain.[2][3]

Possible 2010 Senate candidacy[edit]
According to Fox News, many Republicans hoped Ridge would run for the United States Senate against the newly turned Democrat Arlen Specter, who stated he would seek re-election in 2010 in the Democratic primary. Already seeking the Republican nomination was former Representative Pat Toomey, who narrowly lost to Specter in the Republican primary in 2004. Some Republicans thought Ridge would have a better chance against Specter than would Toomey.[41] A Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll conducted between April 30, 2009 and May 3, 2009 placed Ridge within three points of Specter in a hypothetical matchup between the two men.[42]
Some Toomey supporters criticized the idea of a Ridge candidacy because, although Ridge was still registered to vote in Pennsylvania, he was actually living in Chevy Chase, Maryland.[43] On May 7, 2009, Ridge announced that he would not be a candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2010.[44]
2012 Presidential election[edit]
Ridge originally endorsed former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman for president, in September 2011.[45] Mitt Romney announced an endorsement from Ridge on March 14, 2012.[46]
Supreme Court brief[edit]
In 2013, Ridge was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the Hollingsworth v. Perry case.[47]
Support for the People's Mujahedin of Iran[edit]
Ridge spoke at a conference in support of the removal of the People's Mujahedin of Iran (MEK, also PMOI, MKO) from the United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations.[48] The group was listed on the State Department list from 1997 until September 2012. They were placed on the list for killing six Americans in Iran during the 1970s and attempting to attack the Iranian mission to the United Nations in 1992.[49][50] Ridge, along with other former government officials and politicians Ed Rendell, R. James Woolsey, Porter Goss, Louis Freeh, Michael Mukasey, James L. Jones, Rudy Giuliani, and Howard Dean, were criticized for their involvement with the group. Some were subpoenaed during an inquiry about who was paying the prominent individuals' speaking fees.[51] Ridge and others wrote an article for the conservative publication National Review stating their position that the group should not be classified as a terrorist organization, raising the point that, at the time, only the United States and Iran still listed it as a terrorist group.[52]
2015 Blue Ribbon Commission[edit]




Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense (Ridge 2nd from left)


In 2015, Ridge served as Co-chair of the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, a commission that recommended changes to U.S. policy regarding biodefense.[53] In order to address biological threats facing the nation, the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense created a 33-step initiative for the U.S. Government to implement. Tom Ridge headed the organization with former Senator Joe Lieberman, and the Study Panel assembled in Washington D.C. for four meetings concerning current biodefense programs. The Study Panel concluded that the federal government had little to no defense mechanisms in case of a biological event. The Study Panel's final report, The National Blueprint for Biodefense, proposes a string of solutions and recommendations for the U.S. Government to take, including items such as giving the Vice President authority over biodefense responsibilities and merging the entire biodefense budget. These solutions represent the Panel's call to action in order to increase awareness and activity for pandemic related issues. 
2016 Presidential election[edit]
In 2016, Ridge endorsed Jeb Bush and subsequently John Kasich after Bush's withdrawal from the 2016 Republican presidential primaries. Ridge stated he would not endorse Donald Trump, following Trump's becoming presumptive nominee, or Hillary Clinton in the general election.[54]
Memoir[edit]
Tom Ridge's book The Test of Our Times was published in September 2009.[55] Written with Larry Bloom, it concerns Ridge's time as the head of the Department of Homeland Security. He explains the challenges and decision making processes of the newly formed department, and gives his own views as to the future of the security of the United States of America. The book further discusses

"the infighting he saw that frustrated his attempts to build a smooth-running department. Among the headlines promoted by publisher Thomas Dunne Books: Ridge was never invited to sit in on National Security Council meetings; was 'blindsided' by the FBI in morning Oval Office meetings because the agency withheld critical information from him; found his urgings to block Michael Brown from being named head of the emergency agency blamed for the Hurricane Katrina disaster ignored; and was pushed to raise the security alert on the eve of President Bush's re-election, something he saw as politically motivated and worth resigning over."[22]

Ridge wrote in his memoir that then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and then-Attorney General John Ashcroft pressured him to raise the terror alert level, running up to the 2004 elections, because of a pre-election message critical of President Bush from Osama Bin Laden.[21]

Thomas Joseph Ridge (born August 26, 1945) is an American politician who served as the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security from 2001 to 2003, and the first United States Secretary of Homeland Security from 2003 to 2005. Prior to this, Ridge was a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1983 to 1995 and the 43rd Governor of Pennsylvania from 1995 to 2001. He is a member of the Republican Party.
Ridge was born in Munhall, Pennsylvania and raised in veterans' public housing in Erie, Pennsylvania. After graduating from Harvard University with honors, Ridge served in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War where he was awarded the Bronze Star. He then returned to Pennsylvania and completed his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree at the Dickinson School of Law, graduating in 1972, and entered private practice.
As Assistant District Attorney in Erie, Ridge ran for Congress in his district, where he served six terms. He then ran for Governor in 1994, despite being little-known outside of northwest Pennsylvania. He won the election, and was reelected in 1998 with the most votes for a Republican governor in Pennsylvania (where Democrats outnumber Republicans by almost 500,000) in more than half a century.[1] As Governor of Pennsylvania, Ridge is credited for statewide advances in economic development, education, health care and the environment.
Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, U.S. President George W. Bush named Ridge the first Director of the newly created Office of Homeland Security. In January 2003, the Office of Homeland Security became an official Cabinet-level Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and Ridge became the first Secretary of Homeland Security. He served in these roles for Bush's first term as President, then retired and returned to the private sector.
Since re-entering the private sector, Ridge has served on the boards of The Home Depot, The Hershey Company and Exelon Corporation and as a senior advisor to Deloitte & Touche, and TechRadium. Ridge is also the founder and CEO of Ridge Global, LLC, a Washington, D.C.-based security consulting firm. Ridge spent time campaigning with Senator John McCain during his 2008 bid for the presidency and was believed by some to have been on the short list of potential running mates.[2][3]

Early life and education[edit]
Ridge was born in Munhall, Pennsylvania, in Pittsburgh's Steel Valley, the oldest of three children. His parents were Laura (née Sudimack) and Thomas Regis Ridge, who was a traveling salesman and Navy veteran. Ridge's maternal grandparents were Carpatho-Rusyn immigrants[4] from the former Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia), and his paternal great-grandparents emigrated from Great Britain.[5] Ridge was raised in veterans' public housing in Erie, Pennsylvania. He was educated at St. Andrews Elementary School and Cathedral Preparatory School and did well both academically and in sports. He earned a scholarship to Harvard College, where he paid his way through with construction work, played intramural baseball and football,[5] and graduated with honors in 1967. In 1968, after his first year at the Dickinson School of Law, he was drafted into the United States Army.
Military service[edit]

In November 1969, Ridge arrived as a sergeant in South Vietnam where he would serve for six months as a staff sergeant with Bravo Company, 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry, 11th Infantry Brigade, 23rd Infantry Division (Americal Division).[6] during the Vietnam War.
In May 1970, a ruptured appendix cut short his tour of duty in Vietnam and he was sent home; his service also aggravated a childhood ear infection which caused him afterwards to have a hearing aid in his left ear.[citation needed]
For his service in Vietnam, Ridge received the Bronze Star with "V" Device, National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal, Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with palm, Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation with Palm, Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal, and the Combat Infantryman Badge. He was later offered a commission as an officer but turned it down.[citation needed]
After returning to Pennsylvania, he completed his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree at the Dickinson School of Law, graduating in 1972, and entered private practice.[citation needed]
Public service in Pennsylvania[edit]
He became Assistant District Attorney in Erie County, Pennsylvania in 1980 and prosecuted 86 cases in two years. In 1982 he successfully ran for a seat in Congress from northwestern Pennsylvania, and was re-elected six times. Ridge was notable as the first enlisted Vietnam combat veteran elected to the U.S. House. Ridge never lost an election for public office.[citation needed]




Congressman Ridge during the 104th Congress


In 1994, despite being little-known outside of northwest Pennsylvania, Ridge ran for Governor. He won the election as a pro-choice Republican. He was reelected in 1998 with 57 percent of the vote in a four-way race. His share of the vote in that election was the highest for a Republican governor in Pennsylvania (where Democrats outnumber Republicans by almost 500,000) in more than half a century.[1] Ridge served as Governor until his resignation to become the Director of Homeland Security in 2001.[citation needed]
One of Ridge's more controversial actions as governor was his nomination of Peter J. Jannetta to be the State Secretary of Health. Jannetta had previously been accused of committing perjury, with the State's Superior Court stating, "We have little difficulty in concluding that Dr. Jannetta's testimony at deposition was different than, or inconsistent with, the testimony at trial." Jannetta was not, however, ever convicted of perjury.[7]
Jannetta served as Health Secretary for 6 months. Another health department related action by Ridge has generated controversy since he left office. He stopped the annual inspections of abortion clinics, which may have contributed to Kermit Gosnell being able to run a sub-standard clinic that the grand jury insisted met the definition of a racketeering operation.[8]
During his time as governor, Ridge promoted "law and order" policies, supporting a three-strikes law and a faster death penalty process. A death penalty supporter,[9] Ridge signed more than 224 execution warrants[10] – five times the number signed over a 25-year period by the two previous governors – but only three voluntary executions were carried out. On social issues, he opposed gay marriage but is pro-choice on abortion issues.[citation needed]
Over Ridge's tenure, the Commonwealth's budget grew by two to three percent per fiscal year and combined tax reductions totaled over $2 billion. Ridge created and grew a "Rainy Day" Fund balance to over $1 billion to be utilized during an economic downturn or recession.[citation needed]
Ridge pushed for legislation permitting competition among electric utilities and enhanced federal and state support for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). He also separated the Commonwealth's environmental regulatory and conservation programs into two new agencies; the Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.[citation needed]
Ridge proposed the creation of public charter schools in Pennsylvania and in establishing alternate schools for disruptive students. He launched new academic standards that established academic expectations for what students were expected to know in different grades. Ridge also proposed a school choice demonstration program.[citation needed]
Ridge oversaw a number of e-government projects including renewing drivers' licenses and vehicle registrations to viewing historical documents and library catalogs. The Commonwealth's portal won several national awards. One of the nation's first electronic grant systems was put into place at the Pennsylvania Department of Education. He created the Link-to-Learn initiative to increase the effective use of technology in public schools and universities.[citation needed]
In 2001, he was named runner up "Politician of the Year" by PoliticsPA.[11]
In a 2002 PoliticsPA Feature story designating politicians with yearbook superlatives, he was named the "Most Popular."[12]
2000 Presidential election[edit]
Ridge was a potential running mate for Bob Dole in 1996, and served as a close advisor to GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush, a close friend from their simultaneous tenures as governors, during the 2000 presidential campaign. In return, Bush named Ridge to his short list for possible running mates, along with New York Governor George Pataki, Michigan Governor John Engler, Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating, former Missouri Senator John Danforth, and former American Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole.[13]
Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, U.S. President George W. Bush created the Office of Homeland Security within the White House, and named Ridge to head it. The charge to the nation's new director of homeland security was to develop and coordinate a comprehensive national strategy to strengthen the United States against terrorist threats or attacks. Ridge formally resigned as Pennsylvania's governor on October 5, 2001.[citation needed]
In January 2003 and after the passage of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the Office of Homeland Security split into a Cabinet-level Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and the White House Homeland Security Advisory Council. Ridge left the White House and became the first Secretary of Homeland Security. The Department's Mission "is to (A) prevent terrorist attacks within the United States; (B) reduce the vulnerability of the United States to terrorism; and (C) minimize the damage, and assist in the recovery, from terrorist attacks that do occur within the United States" (From H.R. 5005-8 the Homeland Security Act of 2002). The newly created Department was the most comprehensive reorganization of the Federal government since the National Security Act of 1947.
The Department of Homeland Security consolidates 22 agencies and 180,000 employees, unifying once-fragmented Federal functions in a single agency dedicated to protecting America from terrorism. Ridge worked with the employees from combined agencies to strengthen borders, provide for intelligence analysis and infrastructure protection, improve the use of science and technology to counter weapons of mass destruction, and to create a comprehensive response and recovery division.[14][15][16][17][18]
In January 2004, Ridge was named among others in a lawsuit filed by a Syrian-born Canadian Maher Arar who said he was tortured in Syria after being deported by American authorities.[19]
On November 30, 2004, Ridge submitted his resignation to the President, saying, "After more than 22 consecutive years of public service, it is time to give personal and family matters a higher priority."[20]
In his book The Test of Our Times: America Under Siege...and How We Can Be Safe Again, Ridge says his resignation was due to an effort by senior Bush administration officials to raise the nation's terror alert level in the days before the 2004 presidential vote.[21][22]
Work in the private sector[edit]
Ridge is the founder and CEO of Ridge Global, an advisory firm in Washington, D.C.[23]
Ridge served on a state-appointed incident review panel which investigated the Virginia Tech massacre of April 2007.[24]
RIDGE-LANE Limited Partners[edit]
Ridge is a co-founder, along with investment banker R. Brad Lane,[25] of RIDGE-LANE Limited and RIDGE-LANE Capital, a merchant-bank that sponsors urban development projects, public–private partnerships (P3) and economic development programs, as well as corporate development services for private technology companies.[26]
Ridge Policy Group[edit]
In 2010, Ridge’s two former Chiefs of Staff Mark Campbell and Mark Holman opened a lobbying firm after Ridge lent the firm his name.[27] The full-service government affairs firm has offices in Harrisburg, PA, and Washington, D.C.
In July 2010, companies seeking to use hydraulic fracturing to extract natural gas from the Marcellus Shale formation engaged Ridge and Ridge Policy Group at $75,000 a month to help them gain support.[28]
Home Depot[edit]
In February 2005, Tom Ridge was named to the board of Home Depot.[29] Ridge's compensation was expected to be about $100,000 per annum for this position.[30] Since April 2005, Ridge served on the board of Savi Technology,[31] the primary technology provider for the wireless cargo-monitoring network for the United States Department of Defense.[32]
Exelon Corporation[edit]
In April, 2005, Ridge's appointment to the board of the Illinois/Pennsylvania/New Jersey electric utility was announced, with starting director compensation of $35,000 annual retainer plus a $1,500 meeting fee or per diem fee. Directors were also granted $60,000 in deferred stock units each year at that time.[33]
In 2010, it was reported that Ridge had appeared on MSNBC Hardball With Chris Matthews promoting nuclear energy as part of a "green agenda [to] ... create jobs, create exports," without any revelation by him or the cable channel of his Exelon position. In the report, his cumulative Exelon-derived compensation was put at $530,659; and it was said that, as of March 2009, he held an estimated $248,299 in Exelon stock, according to SEC filings. Exelon was described as "the nation's largest nuclear power company."[34][35]
Deloitte LLP[edit]
In November 2006, Tom Ridge was announced as a Senior Advisor for Deloitte & Touche USA LLP.[36]
The Hershey Company[edit]
In November 2007, Ridge was named to serve on The Hershey Company's Executive Board. The Hershey Trust, the primary shareholder of Hershey, asked for a change in board composition after several years of poor stock performance. The board named Ridge to the board for his knowledge of economics.[37]
TechRadium Inc[edit]
Announced in January 2008, Tom Ridge will serve as a senior advisor to TechRadium, Inc., a Texas-based security technology company that provides its patented alert and notification system, IRIS (Immediate Response Information System), to a wide range of users including municipalities, public schools and universities, utilities, and military programs.[38]
PURE Bioscience[edit]
In September 2009, PURE Bioscience, creator of a patented antimicrobial, announced Ridge would serve on its Advisory Board along with former Wisconsin governor Tommy Thompson.[39]
Political activity[edit]
2008 Presidential election[edit]
Tom Ridge served as a senior aide to Republican Presidential candidate Senator John McCain of Arizona,[40] and was considered by some as a possible running mate for McCain.[2][3]

Possible 2010 Senate candidacy[edit]
According to Fox News, many Republicans hoped Ridge would run for the United States Senate against the newly turned Democrat Arlen Specter, who stated he would seek re-election in 2010 in the Democratic primary. Already seeking the Republican nomination was former Representative Pat Toomey, who narrowly lost to Specter in the Republican primary in 2004. Some Republicans thought Ridge would have a better chance against Specter than would Toomey.[41] A Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll conducted between April 30, 2009 and May 3, 2009 placed Ridge within three points of Specter in a hypothetical matchup between the two men.[42]
Some Toomey supporters criticized the idea of a Ridge candidacy because, although Ridge was still registered to vote in Pennsylvania, he was actually living in Chevy Chase, Maryland.[43] On May 7, 2009, Ridge announced that he would not be a candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2010.[44]
2012 Presidential election[edit]
Ridge originally endorsed former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman for president, in September 2011.[45] Mitt Romney announced an endorsement from Ridge on March 14, 2012.[46]
Supreme Court brief[edit]
In 2013, Ridge was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the Hollingsworth v. Perry case.[47]
Support for the People's Mujahedin of Iran[edit]
Ridge spoke at a conference in support of the removal of the People's Mujahedin of Iran (MEK, also PMOI, MKO) from the United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations.[48] The group was listed on the State Department list from 1997 until September 2012. They were placed on the list for killing six Americans in Iran during the 1970s and attempting to attack the Iranian mission to the United Nations in 1992.[49][50] Ridge, along with other former government officials and politicians Ed Rendell, R. James Woolsey, Porter Goss, Louis Freeh, Michael Mukasey, James L. Jones, Rudy Giuliani, and Howard Dean, were criticized for their involvement with the group. Some were subpoenaed during an inquiry about who was paying the prominent individuals' speaking fees.[51] Ridge and others wrote an article for the conservative publication National Review stating their position that the group should not be classified as a terrorist organization, raising the point that, at the time, only the United States and Iran still listed it as a terrorist group.[52]
2015 Blue Ribbon Commission[edit]




Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense (Ridge 2nd from left)


In 2015, Ridge served as Co-chair of the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, a commission that recommended changes to U.S. policy regarding biodefense.[53] In order to address biological threats facing the nation, the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense created a 33-step initiative for the U.S. Government to implement. Tom Ridge headed the organization with former Senator Joe Lieberman, and the Study Panel assembled in Washington D.C. for four meetings concerning current biodefense programs. The Study Panel concluded that the federal government had little to no defense mechanisms in case of a biological event. The Study Panel's final report, The National Blueprint for Biodefense, proposes a string of solutions and recommendations for the U.S. Government to take, including items such as giving the Vice President authority over biodefense responsibilities and merging the entire biodefense budget. These solutions represent the Panel's call to action in order to increase awareness and activity for pandemic related issues. 
2016 Presidential election[edit]
In 2016, Ridge endorsed Jeb Bush and subsequently John Kasich after Bush's withdrawal from the 2016 Republican presidential primaries. Ridge stated he would not endorse Donald Trump, following Trump's becoming presumptive nominee, or Hillary Clinton in the general election.[54]
Memoir[edit]
Tom Ridge's book The Test of Our Times was published in September 2009.[55] Written with Larry Bloom, it concerns Ridge's time as the head of the Department of Homeland Security. He explains the challenges and decision making processes of the newly formed department, and gives his own views as to the future of the security of the United States of America. The book further discusses

"the infighting he saw that frustrated his attempts to build a smooth-running department. Among the headlines promoted by publisher Thomas Dunne Books: Ridge was never invited to sit in on National Security Council meetings; was 'blindsided' by the FBI in morning Oval Office meetings because the agency withheld critical information from him; found his urgings to block Michael Brown from being named head of the emergency agency blamed for the Hurricane Katrina disaster ignored; and was pushed to raise the security alert on the eve of President Bush's re-election, something he saw as politically motivated and worth resigning over."[22]

Ridge wrote in his memoir that then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and then-Attorney General John Ashcroft pressured him to raise the terror alert level, running up to the 2004 elections, because of a pre-election message critical of President Bush from Osama Bin Laden.[21]

Thomas Joseph Ridge (born August 26, 1945) is an American politician who served as the Assistant to the President for Homeland Security from 2001 to 2003, and the first United States Secretary of Homeland Security from 2003 to 2005. Prior to this, Ridge was a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1983 to 1995 and the 43rd Governor of Pennsylvania from 1995 to 2001. He is a member of the Republican Party.
Ridge was born in Munhall, Pennsylvania and raised in veterans' public housing in Erie, Pennsylvania. After graduating from Harvard University with honors, Ridge served in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War where he was awarded the Bronze Star. He then returned to Pennsylvania and completed his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree at the Dickinson School of Law, graduating in 1972, and entered private practice.
As Assistant District Attorney in Erie, Ridge ran for Congress in his district, where he served six terms. He then ran for Governor in 1994, despite being little-known outside of northwest Pennsylvania. He won the election, and was reelected in 1998 with the most votes for a Republican governor in Pennsylvania (where Democrats outnumber Republicans by almost 500,000) in more than half a century.[1] As Governor of Pennsylvania, Ridge is credited for statewide advances in economic development, education, health care and the environment.
Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, U.S. President George W. Bush named Ridge the first Director of the newly created Office of Homeland Security. In January 2003, the Office of Homeland Security became an official Cabinet-level Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and Ridge became the first Secretary of Homeland Security. He served in these roles for Bush's first term as President, then retired and returned to the private sector.
Since re-entering the private sector, Ridge has served on the boards of The Home Depot, The Hershey Company and Exelon Corporation and as a senior advisor to Deloitte & Touche, and TechRadium. Ridge is also the founder and CEO of Ridge Global, LLC, a Washington, D.C.-based security consulting firm. Ridge spent time campaigning with Senator John McCain during his 2008 bid for the presidency and was believed by some to have been on the short list of potential running mates.[2][3]

Early life and education[edit]
Ridge was born in Munhall, Pennsylvania, in Pittsburgh's Steel Valley, the oldest of three children. His parents were Laura (née Sudimack) and Thomas Regis Ridge, who was a traveling salesman and Navy veteran. Ridge's maternal grandparents were Carpatho-Rusyn immigrants[4] from the former Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia), and his paternal great-grandparents emigrated from Great Britain.[5] Ridge was raised in veterans' public housing in Erie, Pennsylvania. He was educated at St. Andrews Elementary School and Cathedral Preparatory School and did well both academically and in sports. He earned a scholarship to Harvard College, where he paid his way through with construction work, played intramural baseball and football,[5] and graduated with honors in 1967. In 1968, after his first year at the Dickinson School of Law, he was drafted into the United States Army.
Military service[edit]

In November 1969, Ridge arrived as a sergeant in South Vietnam where he would serve for six months as a staff sergeant with Bravo Company, 1st Battalion, 20th Infantry, 11th Infantry Brigade, 23rd Infantry Division (Americal Division).[6] during the Vietnam War.
In May 1970, a ruptured appendix cut short his tour of duty in Vietnam and he was sent home; his service also aggravated a childhood ear infection which caused him afterwards to have a hearing aid in his left ear.[citation needed]
For his service in Vietnam, Ridge received the Bronze Star with "V" Device, National Defense Service Medal, Vietnam Service Medal, Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross with palm, Republic of Vietnam Gallantry Cross Unit Citation with Palm, Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal, and the Combat Infantryman Badge. He was later offered a commission as an officer but turned it down.[citation needed]
After returning to Pennsylvania, he completed his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree at the Dickinson School of Law, graduating in 1972, and entered private practice.[citation needed]
Public service in Pennsylvania[edit]
He became Assistant District Attorney in Erie County, Pennsylvania in 1980 and prosecuted 86 cases in two years. In 1982 he successfully ran for a seat in Congress from northwestern Pennsylvania, and was re-elected six times. Ridge was notable as the first enlisted Vietnam combat veteran elected to the U.S. House. Ridge never lost an election for public office.[citation needed]




Congressman Ridge during the 104th Congress


In 1994, despite being little-known outside of northwest Pennsylvania, Ridge ran for Governor. He won the election as a pro-choice Republican. He was reelected in 1998 with 57 percent of the vote in a four-way race. His share of the vote in that election was the highest for a Republican governor in Pennsylvania (where Democrats outnumber Republicans by almost 500,000) in more than half a century.[1] Ridge served as Governor until his resignation to become the Director of Homeland Security in 2001.[citation needed]
One of Ridge's more controversial actions as governor was his nomination of Peter J. Jannetta to be the State Secretary of Health. Jannetta had previously been accused of committing perjury, with the State's Superior Court stating, "We have little difficulty in concluding that Dr. Jannetta's testimony at deposition was different than, or inconsistent with, the testimony at trial." Jannetta was not, however, ever convicted of perjury.[7]
Jannetta served as Health Secretary for 6 months. Another health department related action by Ridge has generated controversy since he left office. He stopped the annual inspections of abortion clinics, which may have contributed to Kermit Gosnell being able to run a sub-standard clinic that the grand jury insisted met the definition of a racketeering operation.[8]
During his time as governor, Ridge promoted "law and order" policies, supporting a three-strikes law and a faster death penalty process. A death penalty supporter,[9] Ridge signed more than 224 execution warrants[10] – five times the number signed over a 25-year period by the two previous governors – but only three voluntary executions were carried out. On social issues, he opposed gay marriage but is pro-choice on abortion issues.[citation needed]
Over Ridge's tenure, the Commonwealth's budget grew by two to three percent per fiscal year and combined tax reductions totaled over $2 billion. Ridge created and grew a "Rainy Day" Fund balance to over $1 billion to be utilized during an economic downturn or recession.[citation needed]
Ridge pushed for legislation permitting competition among electric utilities and enhanced federal and state support for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). He also separated the Commonwealth's environmental regulatory and conservation programs into two new agencies; the Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources.[citation needed]
Ridge proposed the creation of public charter schools in Pennsylvania and in establishing alternate schools for disruptive students. He launched new academic standards that established academic expectations for what students were expected to know in different grades. Ridge also proposed a school choice demonstration program.[citation needed]
Ridge oversaw a number of e-government projects including renewing drivers' licenses and vehicle registrations to viewing historical documents and library catalogs. The Commonwealth's portal won several national awards. One of the nation's first electronic grant systems was put into place at the Pennsylvania Department of Education. He created the Link-to-Learn initiative to increase the effective use of technology in public schools and universities.[citation needed]
In 2001, he was named runner up "Politician of the Year" by PoliticsPA.[11]
In a 2002 PoliticsPA Feature story designating politicians with yearbook superlatives, he was named the "Most Popular."[12]
2000 Presidential election[edit]
Ridge was a potential running mate for Bob Dole in 1996, and served as a close advisor to GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush, a close friend from their simultaneous tenures as governors, during the 2000 presidential campaign. In return, Bush named Ridge to his short list for possible running mates, along with New York Governor George Pataki, Michigan Governor John Engler, Oklahoma Governor Frank Keating, former Missouri Senator John Danforth, and former American Red Cross President Elizabeth Dole.[13]
Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, U.S. President George W. Bush created the Office of Homeland Security within the White House, and named Ridge to head it. The charge to the nation's new director of homeland security was to develop and coordinate a comprehensive national strategy to strengthen the United States against terrorist threats or attacks. Ridge formally resigned as Pennsylvania's governor on October 5, 2001.[citation needed]
In January 2003 and after the passage of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, the Office of Homeland Security split into a Cabinet-level Department, the Department of Homeland Security, and the White House Homeland Security Advisory Council. Ridge left the White House and became the first Secretary of Homeland Security. The Department's Mission "is to (A) prevent terrorist attacks within the United States; (B) reduce the vulnerability of the United States to terrorism; and (C) minimize the damage, and assist in the recovery, from terrorist attacks that do occur within the United States" (From H.R. 5005-8 the Homeland Security Act of 2002). The newly created Department was the most comprehensive reorganization of the Federal government since the National Security Act of 1947.
The Department of Homeland Security consolidates 22 agencies and 180,000 employees, unifying once-fragmented Federal functions in a single agency dedicated to protecting America from terrorism. Ridge worked with the employees from combined agencies to strengthen borders, provide for intelligence analysis and infrastructure protection, improve the use of science and technology to counter weapons of mass destruction, and to create a comprehensive response and recovery division.[14][15][16][17][18]
In January 2004, Ridge was named among others in a lawsuit filed by a Syrian-born Canadian Maher Arar who said he was tortured in Syria after being deported by American authorities.[19]
On November 30, 2004, Ridge submitted his resignation to the President, saying, "After more than 22 consecutive years of public service, it is time to give personal and family matters a higher priority."[20]
In his book The Test of Our Times: America Under Siege...and How We Can Be Safe Again, Ridge says his resignation was due to an effort by senior Bush administration officials to raise the nation's terror alert level in the days before the 2004 presidential vote.[21][22]
Work in the private sector[edit]
Ridge is the founder and CEO of Ridge Global, an advisory firm in Washington, D.C.[23]
Ridge served on a state-appointed incident review panel which investigated the Virginia Tech massacre of April 2007.[24]
RIDGE-LANE Limited Partners[edit]
Ridge is a co-founder, along with investment banker R. Brad Lane,[25] of RIDGE-LANE Limited and RIDGE-LANE Capital, a merchant-bank that sponsors urban development projects, public–private partnerships (P3) and economic development programs, as well as corporate development services for private technology companies.[26]
Ridge Policy Group[edit]
In 2010, Ridge’s two former Chiefs of Staff Mark Campbell and Mark Holman opened a lobbying firm after Ridge lent the firm his name.[27] The full-service government affairs firm has offices in Harrisburg, PA, and Washington, D.C.
In July 2010, companies seeking to use hydraulic fracturing to extract natural gas from the Marcellus Shale formation engaged Ridge and Ridge Policy Group at $75,000 a month to help them gain support.[28]
Home Depot[edit]
In February 2005, Tom Ridge was named to the board of Home Depot.[29] Ridge's compensation was expected to be about $100,000 per annum for this position.[30] Since April 2005, Ridge served on the board of Savi Technology,[31] the primary technology provider for the wireless cargo-monitoring network for the United States Department of Defense.[32]
Exelon Corporation[edit]
In April, 2005, Ridge's appointment to the board of the Illinois/Pennsylvania/New Jersey electric utility was announced, with starting director compensation of $35,000 annual retainer plus a $1,500 meeting fee or per diem fee. Directors were also granted $60,000 in deferred stock units each year at that time.[33]
In 2010, it was reported that Ridge had appeared on MSNBC Hardball With Chris Matthews promoting nuclear energy as part of a "green agenda [to] ... create jobs, create exports," without any revelation by him or the cable channel of his Exelon position. In the report, his cumulative Exelon-derived compensation was put at $530,659; and it was said that, as of March 2009, he held an estimated $248,299 in Exelon stock, according to SEC filings. Exelon was described as "the nation's largest nuclear power company."[34][35]
Deloitte LLP[edit]
In November 2006, Tom Ridge was announced as a Senior Advisor for Deloitte & Touche USA LLP.[36]
The Hershey Company[edit]
In November 2007, Ridge was named to serve on The Hershey Company's Executive Board. The Hershey Trust, the primary shareholder of Hershey, asked for a change in board composition after several years of poor stock performance. The board named Ridge to the board for his knowledge of economics.[37]
TechRadium Inc[edit]
Announced in January 2008, Tom Ridge will serve as a senior advisor to TechRadium, Inc., a Texas-based security technology company that provides its patented alert and notification system, IRIS (Immediate Response Information System), to a wide range of users including municipalities, public schools and universities, utilities, and military programs.[38]
PURE Bioscience[edit]
In September 2009, PURE Bioscience, creator of a patented antimicrobial, announced Ridge would serve on its Advisory Board along with former Wisconsin governor Tommy Thompson.[39]
Political activity[edit]
2008 Presidential election[edit]
Tom Ridge served as a senior aide to Republican Presidential candidate Senator John McCain of Arizona,[40] and was considered by some as a possible running mate for McCain.[2][3]

Possible 2010 Senate candidacy[edit]
According to Fox News, many Republicans hoped Ridge would run for the United States Senate against the newly turned Democrat Arlen Specter, who stated he would seek re-election in 2010 in the Democratic primary. Already seeking the Republican nomination was former Representative Pat Toomey, who narrowly lost to Specter in the Republican primary in 2004. Some Republicans thought Ridge would have a better chance against Specter than would Toomey.[41] A Quinnipiac University Polling Institute poll conducted between April 30, 2009 and May 3, 2009 placed Ridge within three points of Specter in a hypothetical matchup between the two men.[42]
Some Toomey supporters criticized the idea of a Ridge candidacy because, although Ridge was still registered to vote in Pennsylvania, he was actually living in Chevy Chase, Maryland.[43] On May 7, 2009, Ridge announced that he would not be a candidate for the U.S. Senate in 2010.[44]
2012 Presidential election[edit]
Ridge originally endorsed former Utah Governor Jon Huntsman for president, in September 2011.[45] Mitt Romney announced an endorsement from Ridge on March 14, 2012.[46]
Supreme Court brief[edit]
In 2013, Ridge was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court in support of same-sex marriage during the Hollingsworth v. Perry case.[47]
Support for the People's Mujahedin of Iran[edit]
Ridge spoke at a conference in support of the removal of the People's Mujahedin of Iran (MEK, also PMOI, MKO) from the United States State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations.[48] The group was listed on the State Department list from 1997 until September 2012. They were placed on the list for killing six Americans in Iran during the 1970s and attempting to attack the Iranian mission to the United Nations in 1992.[49][50] Ridge, along with other former government officials and politicians Ed Rendell, R. James Woolsey, Porter Goss, Louis Freeh, Michael Mukasey, James L. Jones, Rudy Giuliani, and Howard Dean, were criticized for their involvement with the group. Some were subpoenaed during an inquiry about who was paying the prominent individuals' speaking fees.[51] Ridge and others wrote an article for the conservative publication National Review stating their position that the group should not be classified as a terrorist organization, raising the point that, at the time, only the United States and Iran still listed it as a terrorist group.[52]
2015 Blue Ribbon Commission[edit]




Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense (Ridge 2nd from left)


In 2015, Ridge served as Co-chair of the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense, a commission that recommended changes to U.S. policy regarding biodefense.[53] In order to address biological threats facing the nation, the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense created a 33-step initiative for the U.S. Government to implement. Tom Ridge headed the organization with former Senator Joe Lieberman, and the Study Panel assembled in Washington D.C. for four meetings concerning current biodefense programs. The Study Panel concluded that the federal government had little to no defense mechanisms in case of a biological event. The Study Panel's final report, The National Blueprint for Biodefense, proposes a string of solutions and recommendations for the U.S. Government to take, including items such as giving the Vice President authority over biodefense responsibilities and merging the entire biodefense budget. These solutions represent the Panel's call to action in order to increase awareness and activity for pandemic related issues. 
2016 Presidential election[edit]
In 2016, Ridge endorsed Jeb Bush and subsequently John Kasich after Bush's withdrawal from the 2016 Republican presidential primaries. Ridge stated he would not endorse Donald Trump, following Trump's becoming presumptive nominee, or Hillary Clinton in the general election.[54]
Memoir[edit]
Tom Ridge's book The Test of Our Times was published in September 2009.[55] Written with Larry Bloom, it concerns Ridge's time as the head of the Department of Homeland Security. He explains the challenges and decision making processes of the newly formed department, and gives his own views as to the future of the security of the United States of America. The book further discusses

"the infighting he saw that frustrated his attempts to build a smooth-running department. Among the headlines promoted by publisher Thomas Dunne Books: Ridge was never invited to sit in on National Security Council meetings; was 'blindsided' by the FBI in morning Oval Office meetings because the agency withheld critical information from him; found his urgings to block Michael Brown from being named head of the emergency agency blamed for the Hurricane Katrina disaster ignored; and was pushed to raise the security alert on the eve of President Bush's re-election, something he saw as politically motivated and worth resigning over."[22]

Ridge wrote in his memoir that then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and then-Attorney General John Ashcroft pressured him to raise the terror alert level, running up to the 2004 elections, because of a pre-election message critical of President Bush from Osama Bin Laden.[21]

Ridge, Thomas J. (H.E.)







Ridge, Thomas J. (H.E.)
First Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Former Governor of Pennsylvania, United States of America
The Honorable Tom Ridge is the CEO of Ridge Global. As the company's chief executive, Ridge leads a team of international experts that help businesses and governments address a range of needs throughout their organizations, including risk management, global trade security, emergency preparedness and response, strategic growth, infrastructure protection, technology integration, crisis management and other issues that encompass a diverse portfolio. He also serves as a partner at Ridge Schmidt Cyber, a cybersecurity firm, founded with former White House Cybersecurity Advisor Howard A. Schmidt.
Following the tragic events of September 11th, 2001, Tom Ridge became the first Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and, on January 24, 2003, became the first Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The creation of the country’s 15th Cabinet Department marked the largest reorganization of government since the Truman administration and another call to service for the former soldier, congressman and governor of Pennsylvania.
During his tenure, Secretary Ridge worked with more than 180,000-plus employees from a combined 22 agencies to create an agency that facilitated the flow of people and goods, instituted layered security at air, land and seaports, developed a unified national response and recovery plan, protected critical infrastructure, integrated new technology and improved information sharing worldwide. Tom Ridge served as Secretary of this historic and critical endeavor until February 1, 2005.
Before the events of September 11th, Tom Ridge was twice elected Governor of Pennsylvania. He served as the state’s 43rd governor from 1995 to 2001. Known for his commitment to high standards and results, Governor Ridge delivered on his promise to make Pennsylvania "a leader among states and a competitor among nations." Governor Ridge's aggressive technology strategy helped fuel the state's advances in economic development, education, health care and the environment.
Born August 26, 1945, in Pittsburgh's Steel Valley, Ridge was raised in a working-class family in veterans' public housing in Erie. He earned a scholarship to Harvard, graduating with honors in 1967.
After his first year at Penn State University's Dickinson School of Law, he was drafted into the U.S. Army, where he served as an infantry staff sergeant in Vietnam, earning the Bronze Star for Valor, the Combat Infantry Badge and the Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry. After returning to Pennsylvania and to Dickinson, he earned his law degree and was in private practice before becoming assistant district attorney in Erie County.
Tom Ridge was elected to Congress in 1982. He was one of the first Vietnam combat veterans elected to the U.S. House of Representatives and was overwhelmingly re-elected by Pennsylvania voters five times.
An engaging and dynamic speaker, Secretary Ridge regularly addresses audiences throughout the world on issues, such as security, terrorism, global engagement, leadership, technology and more. Additionally, the first U.S. secretary of Homeland Security serves on the boards of the Institute for Defense Analyses, the Center for the Study of the Presidency and Congress and other private and public entities, and since 2005, has served as chairman of the National Organization on Disability. Secretary Ridge continues to contribute to matters concerning our nation’s veterans and, along with Gen. Tommy Franks (Ret.), serves as national co-chairman of the Flight 93 Memorial Fundraising Campaign.
Throughout his public and private sector career, Tom Ridge has received numerous honors, including the Woodrow Wilson Award, the Veterans of Foreign Wars’ Dwight D. Eisenhower Award, the John F. Kennedy National Award, the Ellis Island Medal of Honor, the American Bar Association’s John Marshall Award, the National Guard’s Harry S. Truman Award, the Pennsylvania Wildlife Federation’s Conservationist of the Year Award, U.S.-Mexico Chamber of Commerce’s Good Neighbor Award, the American Cancer Society’s prestigious National Medal of Honor, the Mister Rogers Award, the Champion of Public Television Award, the Intrepid Freedom Award and the Esperanza Leadership Award. Secretary Ridge has also been awarded honorary degrees and awards from many national and international academic institutions.
Tom Ridge and his wife, Michele, have two children.

View all

Jessica Brito2 years ago
TenPoint has recalled more than 120,000 crossbows due to concerns that they crossbows can fire even when the safety is engaged.
About the CrossBow Recall
According to the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), about 127,000 TenPoint and Wicked Ridge crossbows have been recalled due to the hazard they have recently been found to place.
The crossbows can fire under certain circumstances in the consumer pulls the trigger, regardless of the safety being re-engaged.
TenPoint has received 19 reports indicating that arrows were released from the crossbows when the consumer pulled the trigger under certain circumstances, even after the safety had been re-engaged.
Description of the Recall Product

The recall on the products involves nine models of two different brands of crossbows, TenPoint and Wicked Ridge.
Recall Models can be identified by their serial numbers, located on the left side of the barrel of the crossbow, directly under the trigger box.
The brand name (TenPoint or Wicked Ridge) is printed on both sides of the crossbow barrel on all models, except the GT Flex. The model name appears on both sides.
The GT Flex cross bows are black. The other affected models are camouflage patterns. One TenPoint Titan Extreme Model, and one Wicked Ridge Warrior HL model, were produced black instead of the camouflage color standard for those models.
The nine models affected are: TenPoint Shadow Ultra-Lite, TenPoint Turbo XLT ll, TenPoint Titan Extreme, TenPoint Maverick HP, TenPoint GT Flex, TenPoint Phantom CLS-S, Wicked Ridge Raider CLS, Wicked Ridge Invader HP, and the Wicked Ridge warrior HL.
The recalled TenPoint and Wicked Ridge crossbows have been sold at many different hunting and sporting goods stores including Bass Pro Shops, Dick’s Sporting Goods, Dunham’s Sports, Gander Mountain, MC Sports, and online retailers such as Amazon.Com

Do I Need an Auto Accident Attorney?
Jarod Cassidy3 days ago

There are several factors to consider when deciding whether or not you need legal representation following an auto accident. While every auto accident is unique, there are several situations in which you should definitely consider contacting an experienced auto accident attorney.

When a serious injury or death occurred. If you or a loved one was seriously injured or killed in an accident, contact an attorney immediately. Hiring an attorney in a timely manner can help protect your rights and ensure that essential evidence is preserved. Serious injuries include broken bones, soft tissue damage, head and face injuries, neck and back injuries, or any other injury requiring hospitalization.
When a loss of wages occurs. If an accident has cost you time away from work and resulted in lost income, you may be able to recover those lost wages from the responsible party.
When a commercial vehicle is involved. If you were involved in an accident that involved a commercial vehicle, such as a delivery truck or an 18-wheeler, it is better to err on the side of caution. Accidents involving company vehicles can become complicated very quickly as company vehicles are subject to additional laws and regulations. You need an attorney who has the experience and resources to navigate these complex cases.
When there is contested liability. If there is any dispute about who caused the accident, an attorney can help you make sure that any fault determinations are correct. In Texas, civil litigation is decided on preponderance of evidence. This means that a party found to be 51% liable or more is unable to recover damages. Additionally, insurance companies will often dispute liability and assert their policyholder was not entirely responsible for a crash to mitigate payouts.
When an insurance company fails to offer a fair settlement. If an insurance company is not offering a fair settlement, it is time to contact an attorney. Insurance companies are in the business of making money – as such, they will attempt to payout as little as possible. If you believe you deserve more than what an insurance company is offering, do not be afraid to seek legal representation.
When an insurance company ignores you. Some insurance companies will drag their feet and ignore your phone calls as a tactic. The hope is that you will be so fed up with the process by the time they make an offer that you will accept a settlement that is less than what you deserve. If you feel that an insurance company is ignoring you or attempting to delay the closure of your claim, contact an attorney to apply pressure.
Your claim was denied. Occasionally, and insurer will attempt to deny a justified claim outright. If you feel that your claim should be covered under a policy, contact an attorney.
When you have questions. If you are ever unsure about your rights following an accident or have questions about how you should proceed, contact Thomas J. Henry for a free consultation. One of our experienced personal injury attorneys will review your case and help you determine if legal representation is right for you. Our attorneys are available to assist you 24/7, nights and weekends.



Ford Expands F-Series Pickup Door Latch Recall
Jarod Cassidy3 days ago

Ford has expanded a recall for Ford F-series pickups that suffer from a door latch defect which can result in doors unlatching during a crash.
Details of the Ford F-Series Recall Expansion
According to the Car Connection, the recall was expanded from covering 551 vehicles, 247 of which were sold in the U.S., to covering 14,410 pickups in the U.S.
The root problem is described as aftermarket door handle covers manufactured by Putco in Des Moines, Iowa and sold by Ford dealerships. According to the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the covers can result in doors unlatching during a side-impact collision.
For obvious reasons, this defect can significantly increase the risk of injury to the truck’s occupants should such a collision occur.
Vehicles Now Covered by the Recall
With the expansion, the recall now includes the following models:

2014-2017 Ford F-150
2017 Ford F-250
2017 Ford F-350
2017 Ford F-450
2017 Ford F-550

Owners of recalled vehicles can expet to be notified July 21, 2017.

Around 100 million Takata brand replacement airbags that are set to be installed in vehicles may have to have to be replaced. This was discovered after tests showed that 2.7 million of the replacement airbags were defective.
About the Defective Airbags
NBC News reports that the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration announced that the new replacement airbags from Takata were found to be defective.
The 2.7 million defective airbags that were tested and found to be defective contained a drying agent called calcium sulfate, and the others contained zeolite.
The issue is that moisture has been getting into Takata airbag inflators, and this causes a potentially lethal ammonium nitrate compound to be released.
Takata tried to remedy this problem by using a drying compound in the airbag inflators so it would lessen the possibility of the airbags exploding. However, experts are skeptical that this will solve this massive issue for the auto industry.
More Details on the Recall
Around 20 automakers have been affected by this recall including Honda, Toyota, and Nissan, who have stated that they will no longer be using Takata inflators.
According to Keiichi Hori, who oversees automotive safety components at the Japan Explosives Society, the compounds in the airbag replacements can reduce the chances of explosions, but it can’t eliminate the possibility of it occurring.
While the original Takata airbags killed at least 17 people and injured 180 others, the replacement airbags with the new drying agents haven’t been linked with any deaths or injuries.


Bike Safety Tips for Kids
Jane Eklund3 days ago

Summer is a great time to go biking with your children around the neighborhood. However, it can also be a dangerous activity if you aren’t smart about how you’re biking. Here are some tips from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on how to stay safe while biking with your family.


Double-Check Your Equipment


It’s important to make sure that all of your bike equipment is in working order before you go for a ride. Check to see if your bike tires are filled with air and there aren’t any issues with your tire chain. Also, test your brakes while riding at a slow speed before you ride at high speeds or on hills to ensure that they work. Most importantly, make sure that everyone in your family is wearing a helmet so there’s no risk for brain injuries.


Stay Visible


Depending on what you’re wearing, you may not be visible to drivers when you’re biking near a road. Cyclists should wear vests with reflective tape on it so that they’re more noticeable to drivers if you’re biking when there isn’t a lot of sunlight.


Watch The Roads


If you decide to ride your bike on the road, you must be very aware of your surroundings. You need to look around for broken glass, potholes, and vehicles that are driving too close. If you’re turning while riding in the road, put out either your left arm or your right arm to signal to the vehicles behind you that you’re turning. Make sure that you don’t make any sudden movements, and that drivers will be able to anticipate your next move.


Don’t Ride at Night


If you’re with your kids, it’s best to make sure that they can always see and be seen while they’re riding their bikes. Parents should avoid biking with their kids at night, and they should also set a curfew for their children if they go out with friends around sunset.


Stick to Riding On Sidewalks


Some experienced adult bicyclists are fine riding bikes on the road. However, kids should stay away from riding on the road. Children are more likely to fall or not pay attention to what’s going on around them while they’re riding bikes. It’s best if they stay on the sidewalks where they can fall and not be at risk for being hit by a vehicle.
 


Police Not Waiting for Recall, Begin Pulling Ford Explorers for Carbon Monoxide Leaks
Jarod Cassidy4 days ago

As the public waits for Ford to issue a recall on its 5th-generation Explorers, the Austin police department has decided to take action, pulling dozens of Ford Explorer patrol vehicles from its fleet due to reports from officers that their vehicle interiors are filling with dangerous carbon monoxide gas.
Carbon Monoxide Leaks a Known Issue in Ford Explorer Vehicles
So far, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has received more than 150 complaints concerning carbon monoxide leaks in 5th-generation (2011-2017) Ford Explorers.
Additionally, Ford has faced at least one class action lawsuit, which began after a 5-year-old girl suffered from carbon monoxide. The lawsuit resulted in a settlement that included any owner or lessee of a 2011-2015 Explorer from Florida dealerships.
Despite all this, Ford has refused to issue a recall on the defective vehicles, instead opting for the issuance of technical safety bulletins; however, that may all change amid national news coverage that Ford Explorer-related carbon monoxide leaks are becoming a growing problem for our nation’s law enforcement.
Austin PD Becomes Hotbed of Ford Explorer-Related Carbon Monoxide Illness
The Austin Police Department says the first incident of carbon monoxide exposure in a Ford Explorer patrol vehicle occurred back in March. In that instance, an officer, Zachary LaHood, began to feel nauseated before striking a curb and calling for help.
Officer LaHood has since made a full recovery and has filed a lawsuit against the Ford.
Since the incident, APD has placed paper carbon and hardwired monoxide detectors in all Ford utility vehicles. Things seemed to quite down for APD until last week when six officers reported carbon monoxide leaks over a six week period.
These reports were followed by the hospitalization of two more APD officers who fell ill Wednesday evening due to carbon monoxide poisoning. The conditions of the officers have not been released.
Police Department Pulls Ford Explorer Vehicles from Fleet as Lawsuits Mount
In reaction to the string of carbon monoxide incidents, the Austin Police Department has begun pulling their modified Ford Explorers from their fleet. So far, the department has pulled 37 interceptors from service, and the city is considering whether to replace all of its 400 Ford Explorer patrol vehicles (about 60 percent of its fleet).
In addition to LaHood’s lawsuit, CNN reports that at least three officers from other states are considering bringing their own lawsuits. Among those is a 30-year-old officer from Northern California who suffered a stroke after suspected carbon monoxide poisoning.
Officials with NHTSA say they are investigating the patrol vehicles as well as civilian Ford Explorers.
The Dangers of Carbon Monoxide Poisoning
Every year, 400 Americans die from unintentional carbon monoxide poisoning not linked to fires. Additionally, more than 20,000 visit emergency departments, and more than 4,000 are hospitalized.
Even when not fatal, carbon monoxide poisoning can have long lasting effects including irreversible brain damage, loss of memory, and other mental impairment.
Common symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning include:

Dull headache
Weakness
Dizziness
Nausea or vomiting
Shortness of breath
Confusion
Blurred vision
Loss of consciousness

If you think you or someone you are with may have carbon monoxide, seek emergency medical care immediately.

Children Are Still Getting Injured Riding ATVs Despite Warnings
Jarod Cassidy4 days ago

A new study has found that young children are still getting injured and killed in ATV crashes, despite warnings from pediatricians warning parents to not let children under 16 ride all-terrain vehicles.
Details of the ATV Accident Study
Beginning in 2000, the American Academy of Pediatrics has recommended that children under the age of 16 be restricted from ATV use. Additionally, riders have been urged to wear helmets, refrain from taking passengers, and to avoid roads.
In the face of these warnings, the mortality rate from ATV crashes involving children under 18 has remained consistent over the past few years.
In their study, researchers examined data on 1,912 patients under age of 18 who were injured while riding an ATV. All patients were treated in trauma centers in Pennsylvania from 2008 to 2014.
The analysis included, 28 children who were killed in ATV accidents. This averages to about one death for every 100,000 kids in the population.
While the study did find a slight decrease in the injury rate, from 6.7 kids per 100,000 children over the first five years to 5.8 kids per 100,000 over the second five years, the decline was not large enough to rule out the possibility the drop was simply the product of chance.
ATV Safety Tips
The following information was provided by the ATV Safety Institute:

Always wear a Department of Transportation-compliant helmet, goggles, long sleeves, pants, over-the-ankle boots, and gloves when riding an ATV.
Avoid riding on paved roads except to cross when done in a manner that is safe and permitted by law.
Never operate or ride an ATV while under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
Do not carry a passenger on a single-rider ATV or more than one passenger on a two-person ATV.
Only ride on designated trails and at safe speeds.

 


How To Stay Safe While Driving in Work Zones
Jane Eklund4 days ago

Driving in work zones can prove to be extremely hazardous to drivers. The U.S. Department of Transportation reports that, over the past 5 years, 4,400 people have died and around 200,000 more were injured in work zone crashes. They also reported that drivers are most frequently killed in work zone crashes.
In order to be prepared for avoiding accidents in work zones, here are some quick tips to keep you safe on the road.


Be Alert While Driving


It’s easy to lose focus when you’re on a long road trip and you slowly become less aware of what’s going on around you. You may enter a work zone quickly and all of a sudden the speed limit and traffic patterns have changed completely.
When you’re driving, make sure that you’re always paying close attention to the road and the other cars around you in case you quickly approach a work zone.


Don’t Drive While Distracted


People make small movements to change the radio station or look for something in their car while driving. While this may not seem like a big deal, just a second or two of being distracted by something in your car can lead you to having an accident.
Don’t look away from the road while changing radio stations while you’re driving, and avoid trying to find various objects in your car. Also, most importantly, never text and drive. A two-word text message isn’t worth the grief that will be felt by your loved ones after a distracted driving accident.


Obey the Speed Limit


It’s common for people to want to go a little faster than the speed limit while driving since it’s fairly common on highways. However, you should always drive at the speed limit because they have been put in place to show the safest speed at which you should drive. On top of that, if you speed in a work zone, you may be fined heavily.
When you drive by a speed limit sign on the highway, just take a quick glance at your speedometer to make sure that you’re driving at a safe speed.


Be Careful When Merging


There can be a lot of close calls with other vehicles when you’re merging into another lane. Blind spots in your rearview mirrors can put you in a dangerous situation if you don’t double-check if there are cars around you while you merge.
To avoid any accidents, be very aware of the cars around you when you’re merging. Traffic patterns can change daily, and sometimes merge signs come up sooner than you think, so always check the signs around you while you’re driving. Also make sure that you’re that you’re merging when the paving markings show that you’re allowed to do so.


Expect Anything 


Workers and vehicles might move around unexpectedly in a work zone, and you need to always be on the lookout for any possible hazards. Vehicles might block off lanes on the highway, or they may start putting cones in a lane that will force you to merge into another lane. This is common in work zones, so you should always expect something about traffic to be different when you’re entering one.


When Can a School Be Held Liable for a Child’s Injuries?
Jarod Cassidy4 days ago

Our children spend nearly a quarter of their waking hours on school property. Therefore, it is not necessarily surprising that roughly 25 percent of all unintentional child injuries occur on or around school grounds.
As parents, we have an innate desire to protect our children from harm and, and we do everything in our power to shield our children from danger – but, who is responsible for your child’s safety when he or she is at school? And if a serious accident occurs, who should be held accountable?
The answers to these questions are not necessarily as simple as they should be.
A Question of Negligence
Generally, schools are expected to take reasonable measure to provide a safe environment for their students.  This includes:

Preventing harm caused by other students, teachers, or staff.
Ensuring that there are no known structural problems with the school building or ground.
Not allowing any person to enter the building without permission.

This does not mean, however, that schools are insurers of a student’s safety. If, for example, a child should fall while running down a flight of stairs, the school would not likely be liable as the incident was caused by the child’s actions.
Instead, whether a school is held accountable for a child’s injury normally comes down to a question of negligence. Did the school or a school official breach their duty of care to a student by creating an unsafe environment or by failing to address a known, unsafe situation or condition?
Common Examples of Negligence by a School
If a child is injured while at school or on school grounds, the school may be held accountable if:

School officials were aware of bullying incidents, but did nothing to stop or prevent them.
Necessary medication was not given to a student, or medication was not administered properly.
Cafeteria personnel failed to properly cook lunch items or served food that was not fit for human consumption.
A school was aware of damaged walls, stairs, or playground equipment, but did not make the necessary repairs.
A school failed to enact adequate evacuation plans or ensure that fire alarms were working properly.
School personnel ignored security policies, or did not notice a stranger entering the school without permission.
A child suffered injury could have been prevented had the child been under proper supervision.

Who Is Accountable for My Child’s Injury?
Most often, we see a school as a single entity, a building all under singular supervision. In truth, however, it takes multiple parties to build and run a school.
There are outside contractors responsible for the building and maintenance of the building, contractors responsible for barriers like fences, third parties who provide janitorial services and food.
This means that if you child was injured on playground equipment while at recess, the manufacturer of the equipment may be liable, not the school. If your child slips on a recently mopped floor that was not properly marked by janitor, your claim may need to be filed against an outside contractor instead of the school district.
It is because issues like these that injuries suffered children in school settings are so complex. Such instances should not be taken lightly and should be addressed immediately.
 
 
 
 


What is a Duty of Care?
Jarod Cassidy5 days ago

Establishing a duty of care is essential in proving negligence in a personal injury case. Beyond that, an attorney must demonstrate that an individual or business breached their duty by performing an action that resulted in reasonably forseeable harm to others. Below are common questions clients may have concerning how duty of care relates to their case.
How Does the Law Define a Duty of Care?
A duty of care requires that an individual adheres to a standard of reasonable care while performing any acts that could forseeably harm others. This includes practicing the same watchfulness, attention, caution, and prudence that a reasonable person would practice in similar circumstances.
When an individual’s actions do not meet this standard of care, then the acts are considered negligent and the individual may be liable for any damages resulting from said actions.
A common example in which a duty of care is owed is when an individual is operating a motor vehicle. As a motorist, an individual owes a duty of care not only to other drivers, but to all other road users. This requirement can be traced back as far as 1832 when Boss v Litton determined that “all persons, paralytic as well as others, have a right to walk on the road and are entitled to the reasonable care on the part of persons driving carriages upon it.”
When Does a Business Owe a Duty of Care?
Individuals are not the only ones who can owe a duty of care. The law requires that the same standard be applied to business and organizations when certain relationships are established. Some examples of this are:

Property Owners – Business owners have a duty to care to those who come onto their property; however, the length at which a property owner must go to protect visitors generally depends on the visitor’s status. For example, a trespasser will receive little or no care while customers are generally provided a high level of care.
Manufacturers – A company that makes a product generally has a duty of care to the consumers who buy and use it. This includes ensuring that the product is reasonably safe and properly warning consumers about and dangers the product may pose.
Commercial Trucking Companies – Commercial vehicle companies have a duty of care to their drivers and to all other persons on the road. Included in this duty of care is the duty maintain their vehicles’ vital parts in proper working order, including brakes, tires, steering mechanisms, and emergency equipment.

What Constitutes a Breach of Duty?
When considering whether a defendant has breached his or her duty of care toward a plaintiff, courts will often ask the following:

Did the defendant owe a duty of care to the plaintiff? If so, was it a general duty of care or was the duty of care based on a special relationship such as professional liability, medical liability, or premises liability?
Did the defendant fail to provide the same amount of care that a reasonable person would have provided in a similar position.
Did the defendant foresee the risk of harm to the plaintiff? If not, should the defendant reasonably have foreseen the risk of harm?
Were there alternatives available that may have prevented the harm of the plaintiff?
Was the burden of using a safer alternative significantly higher than the risk involved in not using it?

While no single question can prove a breach of duty happened, courts can consider all of these questions together to determine if, when applied to the specific facts of a case, they suggest a breach of duty occurred.
 
 
 
 
 


What to Consider When Buying a Crib
Jarod Cassidy5 days ago

A crib is one of the largest and most important purchases you will make when preparing for your child’s birth. Solidifying the fact that your baby is well on its way, many soon-to-be mothers and fathers spend hours reviewing potential cribs for the perfect match to their child’s nursery.
However, while you are stressing over the right size, right style, and right color don’t forget to consider your child’s safety.


Proper Spacing Between Slats


Wide slats can pose an entrapment hazard to your little one. The Consumer Product Safety Commission says cribs should have no more than 2 3/8 inches between slats and corer posts. Don’t be afraid to bring a ruler with you when crib shopping.


Corner Posts Should Not Be Higher than End Panels


Corner posts should be no more than 1/16 of an inch higher than end panels. Raised corner posts can catch on your babies clothing, possibly posing a choking or entrapment hazard.


Check for Splits and Cracks


Upon unboxing your baby’s crib, check thoroughly for splits, cracks, chips, and splinter. Stray pieces of wood can result in scratches, punctures, spinsters, eye injuries, and even choking hazards when detached from the rest of the crib.


Make Sure the Mattress Fits Snugly in the Crib


When checking how a mattress fits, use the two finger test. If you can fit more than two fingers between the mattress and the crib, the mattress is not a good fit and can pose an entrapment hazard.


Bare is Best


Do not put plush toys, soft bedding, or blankets in the crib. Medical professionals and organizations agree that a mattress with a tight, fitted sheet is all that needed. Anything else can pose a suffocation hazard.


Avoid Bumper Pads


While bumper pads may seem like a reasonable safety product, the American Academy of Pediatrics have determined that they increase the risk of SIDS and crib-related death.


Check for Sharp Edges or Hardware


Thoroughly examine your crib for any sharp corners or protruding nuts and bolts. A safe crib with have hardware that fits flush against the wood, at least in areas that are within the child’s vicinity.
