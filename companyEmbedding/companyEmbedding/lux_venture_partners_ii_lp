Counter-conventional ideas are our specialty
About Lux


We are living in the sci-fi future of our imaginations.
Technology has given humanity superpowers. We can see through walls. We can turn bits into atoms and atoms into bits. We have self-driving cars and flying robots. We can also sense, build and control things we didn’t think were possible 10 years ago. Yet there is so much more to come.






Of Rebels & Scientists

We make long-term bets on contrarians and outsiders. We believe the next generation of industrialist titans will be scientists, technologists and inventors who are doing more than challenging the status quo—they’re literally challenging the laws of physics.
We partner with mission-driven entrepreneurs who possess an exceedingly rare intellect, a creative imagination and a radical vision. They are driven by the notion that science is the great equalizer.
They thrive in chaos. They are extraordinarily resilient. They work and play with knife-wielding robots, deadly lasers and contagious bacteria.
Our goal is to accelerate the widespread adoption of their most promising creations.
We take big risks on scientific and technological breakthroughs that have the potential for truly radical change.




How We Serve


INTERDISCIPLINARY THINKING
Our team and networks hail from different cultures, disciplines and experiences. We are chemists, computational biologists, data scientists, economists, electrical engineers, machine-learning hackers and neuroscientists, as well as philosophers, photographers, school-starters, scuba divers and street-art enthusiasts.


ALIGNMENT WITH YOUR VISION
We take a first-principles, scientific approach to analyzing new investments. We listen with an open mind and believe before others understand.


UNDIVIDED ATTENTION
When you need us, we are available and focused on finding uncommon approaches and solutions to serve your needs.


LONG-TERM THINKING AND SUPPORT
Our limited and general partners have long-term investment horizons and want to take an active role in designing the future.


CONTINUED FINANCING
We fund companies throughout their lifecycle, and we partner with the world’s most respected investors, providing access, capital and fund-raising guidance along the way.


CONNECTIONS AND COMMUNITY
Our investors and venture partners have built new industries and/or multi-generational empires. They serve as partners, direct investors and early customers for our companies.
Through our ƒ(Lux) events, we connect our founders to a diverse network of scientists, technologists and business leaders who are building ambitious, mold-breaking companies.
