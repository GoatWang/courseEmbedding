COOKING IT OLD SCHOOL



Authentic BBQ starts in a live-wood smoker stoked with genuine hickory logs. Our pitmasters hand-rub the meats with a custom blend of spices and cook for hours to extract the natural flavors.  





BOLD TO THE BONE






           Before we serve our ribs, we pull them out of the smoker and toss them on the grill to caramelize the sauces, creating a chargrilled sweetness on the outside locking in the deep-down smoky flavor.
          





PITMASTER RULES: RESPECT THE CUT





We source the highest quality meats and trim them up like we’re in a competition. We hand-rub them with the freshest seasonings available.





AWARD-WINNING SAUCE




          From Rich & Sassy® to Sweet & Zesty® to Pineapple Rage®, our original sauces let you create your own legendary BBQ experience.What’s your favorite sauce?





700 AWARDS & COUNTING



We’re passionate about BBQ—and honored that BBQ lovers from coast to coast continue to select us as America’s best. Check out our extensive list of awards.





THERE REALLY IS A FAMOUS DAVE!

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.
                

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards. This may include, but is not limited to business name, address and contact information; names and background of principles; business and banking references; licensing and/or professional accreditation; and a complete description of the nature of the business.
                

                    2. Clearly disclose to customers:

                    
1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract
3. any guarantees or warranties accompanying a product

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Composite Score:





                        Famous Daves of America Inc has received 0 out of 5 stars based on 0 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

The department primarily concerns itself with retail IT, including eCommerce, and business intelligence. Research indicates a portion of IT infrastructure activities are outsourced. A Project Manager oversees the enterprise architecture and integration platform, eLearning, and various other projects. Another manager handles the company's HRIS systems, including payroll.

As far as its IT Priorities, the company relies on solutions from a trio of vendors: MICROS, Decision Logic, and Revenue Management Solutions. MICROS POS manages the electronic and online ordering technologies and reflects an effort to expand the company's website and mobile ordering systems.

In Q1 2013, the company rolled out Tabbedout, a solution that allows customers to pay using iPhone or Android devices. Decision-Logic handles Web-based, back-office restaurant data management and reporting solutions. And analytics from Revenue Management Solutions determines custom pricing for all products across the country.

Famous Dave's utilizes services from Agosto to migrate from legacy systems to more new-age technologies.

S.S.April 27, 2011Try the Bread Pudding - This was so friggin' delicious! Split between 4 adults, after beasting on a Feast. I would order this dessert every time someone drags me to a FD's BBQ joint. (via @FoodspottinSander A.September 16, 2013I'm not a great tip writer, but I tried Texas beef something and it was amazingly delicious! Don't miss a chance to drop by if you're around!Derek KonigsbergJune 24, 2013Been here 10+ timesAsk for some of the sauces that are on the menu, but not already on the table. Pineapple Rage is good, and if you dare, so is Wilbur's Revenge!Gerald LeeSeptember 19, 2015Generally, pretty good BBQ but the chicken and brisket has been dry from time to time. I like the different types of sauces, ribs, and corn bread.Chris HansonApril 17, 2011Be sure to come with an appetite - a BBQ plate comes with corn on the cob and a cornbread muffin, and ALSO a choice of two sides.Janet FoutsJune 10, 2016Been here 5+ timesBest grilled chicken wings ever! Yes it's slow and service is meh. What do you expect for high volume bbq? The ribs are tender and smoky.Lexi LovedayApril 5, 2011If you do go for the meat make sure to drown it in 'Devil's Spit', just a tad sweet with a kick. Beans are also yum.James VejvodaSeptember 16, 2014The ribs were decent, the Texas brisket was the star here, server was delinquent but the Mngr cleaned up her squalid effortsNadiecilla AcevesJanuary 20, 2013They were better before! They took off the corn on the cobb, now u have to order it as a side, the brought me dr ppr instead of diet pepsi, the service was kinda meh..Michael MartinezNovember 28, 2010Be prepared, it's shock top no blue moon.

The famous fries are really good and oh ...feast feast feast!Shikamaru NaraSeptember 17, 2014They don't communicate with the customers. They ran out of ribs and changed our order without telling us. They basically put the food down and told us they changed it.
