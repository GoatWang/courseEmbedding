Background[edit]
Leslie Gelb was born in New Rochelle, New York in 1937. He received a B.A. from Tufts University in 1959, and an M.A. in 1961 and Ph.D. in 1964 from Harvard University. From 1964–1967 he was Assistant Professor of Government at Wesleyan University.[2] He married Judith Cohen on 2 August 1959 and lives in New York City. They have three children. He received the Father of the Year award in 1993.[3]
Career[edit]
Dr. Gelb was Executive Assistant for Senator Jacob Javits from 1966 to 1967.[1] He was director of Policy Planning and Arms Control for International Security Affairs at the Department of Defense from 1967 to 1969, winning the Pentagon's highest award, the Distinguished Service Medal. Robert McNamara appointed Dr. Gelb as director of the project that produced the controversial Pentagon Papers on the Vietnam War. From 1969–1973, Dr. Gelb was a Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution.
He was diplomatic correspondent at The New York Times from 1973 to 1977.
He served as an Assistant Secretary of State in the Carter Administration from 1977 to 1979, serving as director of the Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs and winning the Distinguished Honor Award, the highest award of the US State Department. In 1980 he co-authored The Irony of Vietnam which won the Woodrow Wilson Foundation Book Award in 1981.[4] From 1980–1981, he was also a Senior Associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
He returned to the Times in 1981; from then until 1993, he was in turn its national security correspondent, deputy editorial page editor, editor of the op-ed page, and columnist. This period included his leading role on the Times team that won a Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Journalism in 1986 for a six-part comprehensive series on the Star Wars Strategic Defense Initiative. In 1983, he also worked as a producer on the ABC documentary The Crisis Game, which received an Emmy award in 1984.[5]
Dr. Gelb became President of the Council on Foreign Relations in 1993 and as of 2003[update] is its President Emeritus.[6] From 2003-2015, he also served as Board Senior Fellow there. In addition to his work at Council on Foreign Relations, Dr. Gelb is also a member of the International Institute for Strategic Studies and is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
He served as the chairman of the advisory board for the National Security Network, which identifies itself as a "progressive" think tank,[7] and served on the boards of directors of several non-profit organizations including Carnegie Endowment, the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University, the James Baker Institute at Rice University, the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University, and the John F. Kennedy School of Government Center on Press, Politics and Public Policy. He currently serves on the board of directors of the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America and is a member of the board of advisors of the Truman Project and America Abroad Media.[8] Dr. Gelb also serves on the board of directors of the Center for the National Interest[9] and of the Diplomacy Center Foundation.[10] He also sits on the editorial advisory committee of Democracy magazine,[11] on the advisory council of The National Interest magazine,[12] and on the advisory board of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation. Dr. Gelb also serves on several commercial boards including Legg Mason closed end funds (since 2003), Aberdeen India and Asia Tigers funds (since 2003), and Centre Partners (since 2005). He is Trustee Emeritus of Tufts University.
Dr. Gelb is a contributor to The Daily Beast, a news aggregation site.
Position on the Iraq War[edit]
Dr. Gelb initially supported the Iraq War, but later said[13][14] his "initial support for the war was symptomatic of unfortunate tendencies within the foreign policy community, namely the disposition and incentives to support wars to retain political and professional credibility."

                           worldwide
                           Leading foreign policy expert Gelb offers guidelines on how American power actually works and should be wielded in today's
                              tumultuous world. He argues that Washington risks losing the essential lifeblood of its national security--its power--unless
                              American leaders relearn the lessons of how to use that power. The United States remains far and away the most powerful country
                              in a world where power remains sharply pyramidal. But the U.S. is not the dominant power, and it can't dictate to others.
                              Gelb persuasively shows that America's future power must be based on the principle of mutual indispensability: Washington
                              is the indispensable leader because it alone can galvanize coalitions to solve major international problems (and all nations
                              know this), while other key nations are indispensable partners in getting the job done. The reality is this: succeed together
                              or fail apart.--From publisher description

                           Leslie Gelb served in the Defense Department in the late 1960s and later worked as a correspondent for the New York Times.
                              He describes tensions within the Defense Department and recalls Robert McNamara's 1967 testimony that the bombing of North
                              Vietnam was not working as a turning point. He discusses how America's lack of knowledge about Vietnam and its people shaped
                              diplomacy. Finally, he describes inaccurate calculations on the part of General Westmoreland and how the Pentagon measured
                              military success

                           Leading foreign policy expert Gelb offers guidelines on how American power actually works and should be wielded in today's
                              tumultuous world. He argues that Washington risks losing the essential lifeblood of its national security--its power--unless
                              American leaders relearn the lessons of how to use that power. The United States remains far and away the most powerful country
                              in a world where power remains sharply pyramidal. But the U.S. is not the dominant power, and it can't dictate to others.
                              Gelb persuasively shows that America's future power must be based on the principle of mutual indispensability: Washington
                              is the indispensable leader because it alone can galvanize coalitions to solve major international problems (and all nations
                              know this), while other key nations are indispensable partners in getting the job done. The reality is this: succeed together
                              or fail apart.--From publisher description

                           Leslie Gelb served in the Defense Department in the late 1960s and later worked as a correspondent for the New York Times.
                              He describes tensions within the Defense Department and recalls Robert McNamara's 1967 testimony that the bombing of North
                              Vietnam was not working as a turning point. He discusses how America's lack of knowledge about Vietnam and its people shaped
                              diplomacy. Finally, he describes inaccurate calculations on the part of General Westmoreland and how the Pentagon measured
                              military success

Background[edit]
Leslie Gelb was born in New Rochelle, New York in 1937. He received a B.A. from Tufts University in 1959, and an M.A. in 1961 and Ph.D. in 1964 from Harvard University. From 1964–1967 he was Assistant Professor of Government at Wesleyan University.[2] He married Judith Cohen on 2 August 1959 and lives in New York City. They have three children. He received the Father of the Year award in 1993.[3]
Career[edit]
Dr. Gelb was Executive Assistant for Senator Jacob Javits from 1966 to 1967.[1] He was director of Policy Planning and Arms Control for International Security Affairs at the Department of Defense from 1967 to 1969, winning the Pentagon's highest award, the Distinguished Service Medal. Robert McNamara appointed Dr. Gelb as director of the project that produced the controversial Pentagon Papers on the Vietnam War. From 1969–1973, Dr. Gelb was a Senior Fellow at the Brookings Institution.
He was diplomatic correspondent at The New York Times from 1973 to 1977.
He served as an Assistant Secretary of State in the Carter Administration from 1977 to 1979, serving as director of the Bureau of Politico-Military Affairs and winning the Distinguished Honor Award, the highest award of the US State Department. In 1980 he co-authored The Irony of Vietnam which won the Woodrow Wilson Foundation Book Award in 1981.[4] From 1980–1981, he was also a Senior Associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.
He returned to the Times in 1981; from then until 1993, he was in turn its national security correspondent, deputy editorial page editor, editor of the op-ed page, and columnist. This period included his leading role on the Times team that won a Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Journalism in 1986 for a six-part comprehensive series on the Star Wars Strategic Defense Initiative. In 1983, he also worked as a producer on the ABC documentary The Crisis Game, which received an Emmy award in 1984.[5]
Dr. Gelb became President of the Council on Foreign Relations in 1993 and as of 2003[update] is its President Emeritus.[6] From 2003-2015, he also served as Board Senior Fellow there. In addition to his work at Council on Foreign Relations, Dr. Gelb is also a member of the International Institute for Strategic Studies and is a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
He served as the chairman of the advisory board for the National Security Network, which identifies itself as a "progressive" think tank,[7] and served on the boards of directors of several non-profit organizations including Carnegie Endowment, the School of International and Public Affairs, Columbia University, the James Baker Institute at Rice University, the Watson Institute for International Studies at Brown University, and the John F. Kennedy School of Government Center on Press, Politics and Public Policy. He currently serves on the board of directors of the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America and is a member of the board of advisors of the Truman Project and America Abroad Media.[8] Dr. Gelb also serves on the board of directors of the Center for the National Interest[9] and of the Diplomacy Center Foundation.[10] He also sits on the editorial advisory committee of Democracy magazine,[11] on the advisory council of The National Interest magazine,[12] and on the advisory board of the Peter G. Peterson Foundation. Dr. Gelb also serves on several commercial boards including Legg Mason closed end funds (since 2003), Aberdeen India and Asia Tigers funds (since 2003), and Centre Partners (since 2005). He is Trustee Emeritus of Tufts University.
Dr. Gelb is a contributor to The Daily Beast, a news aggregation site.
Position on the Iraq War[edit]
Dr. Gelb initially supported the Iraq War, but later said[13][14] his "initial support for the war was symptomatic of unfortunate tendencies within the foreign policy community, namely the disposition and incentives to support wars to retain political and professional credibility."

Position on the Iraq War[edit]
Dr. Gelb initially supported the Iraq War, but later said[13][14] his "initial support for the war was symptomatic of unfortunate tendencies within the foreign policy community, namely the disposition and incentives to support wars to retain political and professional credibility."

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
