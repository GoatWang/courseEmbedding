FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: May 12, 2017

NEW PEOPLES BANKSHARES ANNOUNCES 2017 FIRST QUARTER RESULTS
Honaker, Virginia ‐‐ New Peoples Bankshares (the “Company”) (OTCBB: NWPP) and its wholly-owned subsidiary New Peoples Bank (the “Bank”) today announced net income of $115,000, or $0.005 earnings per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017.  This compares to net income of $698,000, or $0.03 per share, for the same period ended March 31, 2016, representing a decline of $583,000, or 83.52%. 
"During the first quarter of 2017, we continued our focus on balance sheet growth and problem asset clean-up with positive results" commented Todd Asbury, President and CEO.  "Annualized loan growth checked in at about 7% which is what our aim was at the onset of the year.  Also, not reflected in the March numbers was the sale of one of our largest OREO properties, which reduced OREO by $1.3 million in April, while another $2.2 million of OREO is under contract as of early May 2017.  We expect capital levels to remain strong, our earning assets to grow, and asset quality to continue to improve during the remaining part of 2017.  However, as we work through this growth/cleanup phase, we also expect a continued lag in earnings growth." 
First Quarter Highlights
A $7.9 million, or 1.68%, increase in loans, during the quarter;
No provision for loan losses taken in the first quarter;
•	An increase of $18.3 million, or 3.30%, in total deposits;
•	A decrease of $1.7 million, or 9.57%, in substandard loans during the quarter;
•	A decrease of $4.2 million, or 26.20%, in total past due loans during the quarter;
•	The Bank is considered well-capitalized under regulatory standards; and,
•	Book value per share of $2.02 as of March 31, 2017.

Map Details

It looks like we don't have a specific address for New Peoples Bank, which makes giving directions tricky. This business might not have an official storefront, or it might move to multiple locations throughout the day.
Give me directions anyway...
