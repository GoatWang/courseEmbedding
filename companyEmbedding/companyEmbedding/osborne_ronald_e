Welcome to Osborne Wood Products, Inc. Since 1979 we have been providing the professional and non-professional woodworker alike with beautifully crafted table legs, island legs, corbels, bun feet, and mouldings. We would like to welcome you to our site, where you will find every product we offer. Feel free to browse our paper catalog here, or view our current specials here.




										Decorative Corbels
Also known as wood brackets,  wood corbels have been a staple of interior and exterior architecture since the Victorian Era. 

Incorporating a host of designs, unfinished wood corbels are available in Mission-Style or Contemporary Style, Basket Weave or Classic, or even with Acanthus Leaf or Grape carvings. Be assured that our industry leading designs will be suitable for a home of elegance. Custom carved corbels are also available upon request. Our selection of corbels also covers a variety of sizes so that a perfect fit is possible for any application whether it is under a countertop or a cabinet. 

										Kitchen Island Legs
Just as the theme or decor of a given home could have endless possibilities, so we also have myriad options in our kitchen island leg line to meet those varying needs. 

Kitchen Island Legs or Cabinet Legs can give kitchens a look of sophistication and elegance along with be function components. Island Legs are used many times as countertop supports or can be split in half and applied to the face of a cabinet. We are confident that our selection of island legs will fit any kitchen. Styles including traditional, reeded, twisted, contemporary, and mission are all hand crafted, emphasizing the detail of design. With most of our posts available at 34 ½ and 35 ½ inches tall, several posts are also available at the 40 ½ inch height to accommodate bar height cabinets and eating areas. 

										Unfinished Wooden Table Legs
If you are a hobbyist looking to make a table you have come to the right place! Osborne Wood Products has a huge selection of dining table legs, coffee table legs, and end table legs. 

Whether your table is mission-style, Old English, or just a simple farm table we have many legs to compliment your design. We also provide our table legs in over 10 different kinds of wood including Red Oak, Pine, Cherry, Maple, and others. Most products in most wood species are available to ship the same day, or next business day. Also it is important to note that all products in all wood speicies come unfinished.


										Custom Wood Turnings
Although we carry an extensive line of table legs, kitchen island legs, corbels, and  sofa legs we know that sometimes a job will come along that requires something different. 

Whether it be dimensions that vary from the standard on a stock piece, or something completely custom; we are happy to do custom turnings for you! We believe that needing custom turnings should not be synonymous with a long lead time; we provide same day quoting with a quick turn-around of the items. Whether it is an Island Legs, Table Leg, or any type of wood turning, simply fill out our quote request page and we will follow up within one business day. 

										Table Base Kits
Easy to assemble and fully custom, table base kits can incorporate any table legs and make table building an easy reality.

Osborne Wood Products' table base kits provide you the opportunity to create customized tables easily. You provide the tabletop and select from our broad inventory of table legs and wood types. If you don't find the leg you need among our end table, coffee table, dining table or island height legs you can create your own legs through our custom ordering service. Our table base kits are the place to start when you design your one-of-a-kind table.

										Quality Craftsmanship
As one of the leading suppliers of custom wood turnings,  table legs, kitchen island legs,  corbels, and
									 legs; Osborne Wood Products provides the highest quality and service to professional woodworkers and hobbyists alike. 

It all began back in 1979 when our first quality handcrafted furniture pieces were painstakingly produced. We continue to instill that same pride of careful craftsmanship that goes into each and every piece. This means that you can rest assured that every one of our products is designed, turned, carved and sanded using the industry's latest technology. At the same time, our craftsmen embrace the quality of authentic handcrafted furniture manufacturing and ensure that same quality is passed along to you, our valued customer.
