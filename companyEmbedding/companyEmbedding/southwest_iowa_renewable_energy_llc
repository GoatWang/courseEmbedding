Air Products, Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy sign agreement 
By Air Products    | December 19, 2013

Air Products, one of the leading suppliers of liquid carbon dioxide in the United States, has announced the signing of a long-term agreement for the production of liquid CO2 with Southwest Iowa Renewable Energy LLC. Air Products will build a facility to produce 400 tons per day (tpd) of liquid CO2 at SIRE's established ethanol production facility in Council Bluffs, Iowa. Air Products will market food and beverage-grade liquid CO2 from the new plant that is expected to begin production in early 2014.
"Following the EPCO acquisition last summer, we have been focusing our attention on expanding our presence in the Midwest and this project helps us in achieving that objective," said Nelson Squires, vice president and general manager of North American Merchant Gases at Air Products. "This additional supply source will further strengthen our liquid CO2 network and provide enhanced supply reliability to our food and beverage, as well as our industrial bulk gas customers in the Midwest." When onstream, the facility will increase the number of Air Products' liquid CO2 production plants in the U.S. to 13.
"We are excited to expand the portfolio of co-products produced from our 125 million gallon per year ethanol plant through this new agreement," said Brian Cahill, president and general manager, SIRE. "Ethanol plants are an important source of liquid CO2 in the Midwest, and we look forward to Air Products beginning production at our plant in Council Bluffs and providing the liquid CO2 co-product that will help serve the needs of the many large users in the region."
In June, Air Products expanded its portfolio of industrial gases offerings in North America by acquiring EPCO Carbon Dioxide Products, Inc. of Monroe, Louisiana. The acquisition immediately vaulted Air Products to a position amongst the leaders in the North American liquid CO(2) market and also made Air Products a more fully-integrated supplier of bulk industrial gases by increasing its competitive offering.
Liquid CO2 , which Air Products already offers in its other geographic regions around the world, is an important product in markets Air Products currently serves with other merchant industrial gases including for food, beverage, chemical, pharmaceutical, oilfield services, and metals fabrication applications.

Brian Cahill, SIRE's President and CEO stated, "in the second quarter of Fiscal 2017, we saw a 5% increase in our cost of corn as compared to the first quarter of Fiscal 2017.  Seasonal influences have increased corn inventories and work-in-process during the current quarter.  Demand for ethanol  has been strong, both in the U.S. and abroad.  The industry has continued to adjust, and we expect margins to remain positive, but are becoming more dependent on continued good export demand ."
During the second quarter of Fiscal 2017, SIRE produced 31.1 million million gallons of ethanol, compared to 31.2 million gallons during the second quarter of Fiscal 2016. Cahill commented - "we continue to evaluate and implement new production technology. We will continue to focus on running the plant efficiently, with a balance of optimizing the yield and profit."

Modified EBITDA
Management uses Modified EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure, to measure the Company's financial performance and to internally manage its business. Management believes that Modified EBITDA provides useful information to investors as a measure of comparison with peer and other companies. Modified EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Modified EBITDA calculations may vary from company to company. Accordingly, our computation of Modified EBITDA may not be comparable with a similarly-titled measure of another company. Modified EBITDA, is defined as earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortization, and unrealized hedging gains and losses. The following sets forth the reconciliation of Net Income (Loss) to Modified EBITDA for the periods indicated:
