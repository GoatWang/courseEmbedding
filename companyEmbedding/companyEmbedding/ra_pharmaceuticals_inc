Ra Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Announces Publication of Positive Preclinical Data with RA101295 for the Treatment of Escherichia Coli Sepsis
Jul 19 17
Ra Pharmaceuticals, Inc. announced the publication of in vitro and in vivo data demonstrating that treatment of Escherichia coli sepsis with RA101295 was associated with significant organ protection and markedly reduced mortality. Researchers evaluated the effect of RA101295, a macrocyclic peptide inhibitor of complement component 5 (C5), in baboons receiving lethal doses of E. coli. As compared with placebo, treatment with RA101295 blocked sepsis-induced inflammation, preserved endothelial cell function, decreased leukocyte activation, and reduced overall mortality, while exhibiting no detrimental effects on the clearance of bacteria. Inhibition of C5 is a clinically-validated approach for the treatment of complement-mediated disorders. Ra Pharma’s portfolio includes drug candidates for several such disorders, including PNH, myasthenia gravis (MG) and lupus nephritis (LN).


Ra Pharmaceuticals Inc. Announces Encouraging Data from Phase II Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria Study
Jun 27 17
Ra Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has announced encouraging initial data from the company's global Phase II clinical program evaluating RA101495 for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Ra Pharma is developing RA101495 as a novel, subcutaneously-administered (SC) inhibitor of complement component 5 (C5). The dose-finding Phase II clinical program is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, preliminary efficacy, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of RA101495 in patients with PNH. Currently, the study has three eculizumab-naive patients enrolled, of which two have completed seven weeks of follow-up and are included in the Company's initial data set. Review of these initial data enables the opening of Cohort B, which will enroll patients switching from eculizumab, the current standard of care, for PNH.Notable findings include: No safety or tolerability concerns identified; no injection site reactions; Near-complete inhibition of hemolytic activity; Rapid declines in lactate dehydrogenase (LDH); mean LDH at Week 7 = 1.6X upper limit of normal (ULN); and 100% compliance with once daily, subcutaneous self-administration.At the week 6 visit, one patient reported recurrence of PNH symptoms associated with hemoglobinuria and an elevated LDH level. This episode of breakthrough hemolysis occurred in the setting of an intercurrent illness, judged by the investigator to be most likely due to a viral infection.


Ra Pharmaceuticals Announces Presentation of Data at 2017 European Hematology Association
Jun 24 17
Ra Pharmaceuticals, Inc. has announced the presentation of scientific data at the 22nd Congress of the European Hematology Association (EHA), in Madrid, Spain. The data presented at EHA showcase a novel class of orally bioavailable small molecules that bind to C5 with high affinity and inhibit its cleavage into C5a and C5b.  These findings demonstrate the feasibility of an orally-administered therapy for complement-mediated disorders and support the continued advancement of these molecules. Inhibition of C5 is a clinically-validated approach for the therapeutic treatment of complement-mediated disorders. Ra Pharma's portfolio includes drug candidates for several such disorders, including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), myasthenia gravis (MG) and lupus nephritis (LN). The company is pursuing the identification of orally-available inhibitors of C5 with the goal of providing additional options for patients diagnosed with these and other complement-mediated disorders.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

What is the most important information I should know about XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR?
XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may cause serious side effects, including:
Serious infections. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. Some people can have serious infections while taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died from these infections. Your healthcare provider should test you for TB before starting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and monitor you closely for signs and symptoms of TB infection during treatment. You should not start taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR if you have any kind of infection unless your healthcare provider tells you it is okay.
You may be at a higher risk of developing shingles.
Before starting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, tell your healthcare provider if you:

think you have an infection or have symptoms of an infection, such as fever, sweating, or chills; cough; blood in phlegm; warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body; burning when you urinate or urinating more often than normal; muscle aches; shortness of breath; weight loss; diarrhea or stomach pain; or feeling very tired
are being treated for an infection
get a lot of infections or have infections that keep coming back
have diabetes, HIV, or a weak immune system. People with these conditions have a higher chance for infections
have TB, or have been in close contact with someone with TB
live or have lived in, or have traveled to certain parts of the country (such as the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys and the Southwest) where there is an increased chance for getting certain kinds of fungal infections (histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis). These infections may happen or become more severe if you use XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Ask your healthcare provider if you do not know if you have lived in an area where these infections are common
have or have had hepatitis B or C

After starting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, call your healthcare provider right away if you have any symptoms of an infection. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can make you more likely to get infections or make worse any infection that you have.
Cancer and immune system problems. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may increase your risk of certain cancers by changing the way your immune system works. Lymphoma and other cancers, including skin cancers, have happened in patients taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had any type of cancer.
Some people who have taken XELJANZ with certain other medicines to prevent kidney transplant rejection have had a problem with certain white blood cells growing out of control (Epstein Barr Virus–associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder).
Tears (perforation) in the stomach or intestines. Some people taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can get tears in their stomach or intestine. This happens most often in people who also take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or methotrexate.
Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have fever and stomach-area pain that does not go away and a change in your bowel habits.
Changes in certain lab test results. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests before you start receiving XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and while you take XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, to check for the following side effects:

changes in lymphocyte counts. Lymphocytes are white blood cells that help the body fight off infections.
low neutrophil counts. Neutrophils are white blood cells that help the body fight off infections.
low red blood cell count. This may mean that you have anemia, which may make you feel weak and tired.

Your healthcare provider should routinely check certain liver tests.
You should not receive XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR if your lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, or red blood cell count is too low or your liver tests are too high. Your healthcare provider may stop your XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR treatment for a period of time if needed because of changes in these blood test results.
Your healthcare provider should do blood tests to check your cholesterol levels 4-8 weeks after you start XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and as needed after that.
What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR?
XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may not be right for you. Before taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, tell your healthcare provider if you:

have an infection
have liver problems
have kidney problems
have any stomach area (abdominal) pain or been diagnosed with diverticulitis (inflammation in parts of the large intestine) or ulcers in your stomach or intestines, or narrowing within your digestive tract
have had a reaction to tofacitinib or any of the ingredients in XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR
have recently received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine. People taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR should not receive live vaccines but can receive non-live vaccines

      Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Treatment Options    



From pills like methotrexate, XELJANZ, and once-daily XELJANZ XR to infusions and needle-based injections, there are many different medications available for treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA). When talking with your healthcare provider about the right treatment option for you, it’s important to remember that RA affects everyone differently, including how fast it progresses, and you should work with your healthcare team to assess available treatment options. A healthcare provider will often prescribe different medications at different times, depending on a patient’s unique situation.
While treatment paths may vary, click below to learn more about potential treatment options. 





NSAIDs
For example, ibuprofen



WHAT ARE NSAIDs?

About NSAIDs

NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are often prescribed along with DMARDs to help reduce pain and swelling in the joints.
While DMARDs can help reduce the progression of joint damage, NSAIDs only treat pain and inflammation.

How do NSAIDs work?
NSAIDs block the production of prostaglandins, which are involved in triggering inflammation and increasing pain.
How to take it
Pill or patch











STEROIDS
For example, prednisone



WHAT ARE STEROIDS?

About steroids
Steroids (in this case, short for corticosteroids ) are naturally occurring hormones produced by the adrenal glands above the kidneys during exercise or as a reaction to stress.
How do steroids work?

Steroids normally help replace energy stores that are used up during exercise or stress, and promote efficient operation of the cardiovascular system.
Steroids also reduce the swelling and decrease inflammation associated with RA. Healthcare providers rarely use or prescribe corticosteroids by themselves, and will often use them only when you have acute RA symptoms, including inflammation in a single joint.

How to take it
Topical ointment, pill, or an injection into a muscle or directly into an affected joint.





While NSAIDs and steroids may be used along with other treatments to help manage pain and swelling, a healthcare provider may also recommend methotrexate, which unlike NSAIDs and steroids, can help slow the progression of RA joint damage.






DMARDs
For example, methotrexate



WHAT ARE DMARDs?

About methotrexate

Methotrexate is one of the most commonly prescribed DMARDs (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs). Other common DMARDs include hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine.
Methotrexate is often prescribed at the time of diagnosis to help reduce pain and swelling in the joints, and the progression of joint damage.

How does methotrexate work?
Methotrexate interferes with the production and maintenance of DNA, the genetic material in the cells of your body. It is not fully known how methotrexate works to treat RA.
How to take it
Pill and, in some cases, an injection





If methotrexate isn't doing enough, other treatment options are available to help reduce your RA symptoms.






JAK INHIBITORS
For example, XELJANZ® (tofacitinib citrate)



WHAT ARE JAK INHIBITORS?

About JAK inhibitors

Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, another type of DMARD, are the first in a class of treatments for moderate to severe RA.
XELJANZ, a JAK inhibitor, has been shown to help reduce pain and swelling in the joints, and to slow the progression of joint damage.
XELJANZ can work alone. It is proven to reduce RA pain, swelling, and joint damage without the need for methotrexate.
XELJANZ is also available as a once-daily pill called XELJANZ XR.

How do JAK inhibitors work?
JAK inhibitors work deep inside the cell to disrupt the signaling pathways between the cells of your immune system that are believed to play a role in the inflammation associated with RA.
How to take it
Pill











BIOLOGICS
For example, Humira® (adalimumab)



WHAT ARE BIOLOGICS?

About biologics

Biologics target the underlying disease process, including specific parts of the immune system, to help reduce moderate to severe RA symptoms.
Biologics, another type of DMARD, have been shown to help reduce pain, swelling, and stiffness in the joints, and the progression of joint damage.

How do biologics work?
There are various types of biologics available, each working in different ways to reduce, target, or block proteins that, when your body produces too much of them, can play a role in the pain, symptoms, and joint damage of RA.
How to take it
Injection and/or infusion, depending on medication

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

What is the most important information I should know about XELJANZ® (tofacitinib citrate) 5 mg tablets/XELJANZ® XR (tofacitinib citrate) extended release 11 mg tablets?
XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may cause serious side effects, including:
Serious infections. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. Some people can have serious infections while taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died from these infections. Your healthcare provider should test you for TB before starting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and monitor you closely for signs and symptoms of TB infection during treatment. You should not start taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR if you have any kind of infection unless your healthcare provider tells you it is okay.
You may be at a higher risk of developing shingles.
Before starting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, tell your healthcare provider if you:

think you have an infection or have symptoms of an infection, such as fever, sweating, or chills; cough; blood in phlegm; warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body; burning when you urinate or urinating more often than normal; muscle aches; shortness of breath; weight loss; diarrhea or stomach pain; or feeling very tired
are being treated for an infection
get a lot of infections or have infections that keep coming back
have diabetes, HIV, or a weak immune system. People with these conditions have a higher chance for infections
have TB, or have been in close contact with someone with TB
live or have lived in, or have traveled to certain parts of the country (such as the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys and the Southwest) where there is an increased chance for getting certain kinds of fungal infections (histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis). These infections may happen or become more severe if you use XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Ask your healthcare provider if you do not know if you have lived in an area where these infections are common
have or have had hepatitis B or C

After starting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, call your healthcare provider right away if you have any symptoms of an infection. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can make you more likely to get infections or make worse any infection that you have.
Cancer and immune system problems. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may increase your risk of certain cancers by changing the way your immune system works. Lymphoma and other cancers, including skin cancers, have happened in patients taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had any type of cancer.
Some people who have taken XELJANZ with certain other medicines to prevent kidney transplant rejection have had a problem with certain white blood cells growing out of control (Epstein Barr Virus–associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder).
Tears (perforation) in the stomach or intestines. Some people taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can get tears in their stomach or intestine. This happens most often in people who also take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or methotrexate.
Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have fever and stomach-area pain that does not go away and a change in your bowel habits.
Changes in certain lab test results. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests before you start receiving XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and while you take XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, to check for the following side effects:

changes in lymphocyte counts. Lymphocytes are white blood cells that help the body fight off infections.
low neutrophil counts. Neutrophils are white blood cells that help the body fight off infections.
low red blood cell count. This may mean that you have anemia, which may make you feel weak and tired.

Your healthcare provider should routinely check certain liver tests.
You should not receive XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR if your lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, or red blood cell count is too low or your liver tests are too high. Your healthcare provider may stop your XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR treatment for a period of time if needed because of changes in these blood test results.
Your healthcare provider should do blood tests to check your cholesterol levels 4-8 weeks after you start XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and as needed after that.
What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR?
XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may not be right for you. Before taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, tell your healthcare provider if you:

have an infection
have liver problems
have kidney problems
have any stomach area (abdominal) pain or been diagnosed with diverticulitis (inflammation in parts of the large intestine) or ulcers in your stomach or intestines, or narrowing within your digestive tract
have had a reaction to tofacitinib or any of the ingredients in XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR
have recently received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine. People taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR should not receive live vaccines but can receive non-live vaccines

After starting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, call your healthcare provider right away if you have any symptoms of an infection. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can make you more likely to get infections or make worse any infection that you have.
Cancer and immune system problems. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may increase your risk of certain cancers by changing the way your immune system works. Lymphoma and other cancers, including skin cancers, have happened in patients taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had any type of cancer.
Some people who have taken XELJANZ with certain other medicines to prevent kidney transplant rejection have had a problem with certain white blood cells growing out of control (Epstein Barr Virus–associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder).
Tears (perforation) in the stomach or intestines. Some people taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can get tears in their stomach or intestine. This happens most often in people who also take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or methotrexate.
Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have fever and stomach-area pain that does not go away and a change in your bowel habits.
Changes in certain lab test results. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests before you start receiving XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and while you take XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, to check for the following side effects:

changes in lymphocyte counts. Lymphocytes are white blood cells that help the body fight off infections.
low neutrophil counts. Neutrophils are white blood cells that help the body fight off infections.
low red blood cell count. This may mean that you have anemia, which may make you feel weak and tired.

Your healthcare provider should routinely check certain liver tests.
You should not receive XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR if your lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, or red blood cell count is too low or your liver tests are too high. Your healthcare provider may stop your XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR treatment for a period of time if needed because of changes in these blood test results.
Your healthcare provider should do blood tests to check your cholesterol levels 4-8 weeks after you start XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and as needed after that.

      How XELJANZ Works    



 














 




CLOSE X



 


XELJANZ is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that works deep inside the cell to disrupt activities occurring in signaling pathways. These JAK pathways are believed to play a role in the inflammation associated with RA. Watch to learn more about the science of XELJANZ and how it works to help disrupt the processes that can lead to inflammation.


Video description: Take a closer look at how XELJANZ works.
 


 









      Clinical Trial Results    



The effectiveness of XELJANZ, taken with and without a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD),  such as methotrexate, was tested in six studies that involved more than 4,200 adult patients with RA.

     
  

     
  

 


 
More Than Half Of XELJANZ Patients Felt An Improvement In RA Symptoms Within 3 Months.
In the ORAL Solo Study, at 2 weeks, 30% of XELJANZ patients (71 out of 240) and 12% of placebo patients (14 out of 119) experienced a 20% reduction in tender and swollen joint counts and 3 of these 5 indicators: blood test that measures inflammation, patient assessment, physician assessment, pain scale, and disability/functional questionnaire.
At 3 months, 59% of XELJANZ patients (143 out of 243) and 26% of placebo patients (31 out of 122) experienced the same results. During this study, patients did not take methotrexate.

  

 
At 3 Months, More Than Half of XELJANZ Patients Could More Easily Complete Daily Activities, Such As Getting Dressed, Walking Down Stairs, And Gripping Household Items.
In the ORAL Solo Study, a scale was used that defines RA disability as: 0-1 = mild; 1-2 = moderate to severe; 2+ = greater disability. At the study start, XELJANZ patients had a mean baseline score of 1.53.
At 3 months, XELJANZ patients saw an improved score of 1.05 (a statistically important difference) and, overall, 60% (143 out of 240) of XELJANZ patients experienced an improvement ≥0.22 on the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) that assesses the following categories: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and common daily activities. During this study, patients did not take methotrexate.

  

 
XELJANZ Reduced Joint Pain And Swelling Caused By RA, Even Without The Use Of Methotrexate.
In the ORAL Solo Study, at 2 weeks, 30% of XELJANZ patients (72 out of 240) and 12% of placebo patients (14 out of 120) experienced a 20% reduction in tender and swollen joint counts and 3 of these 5 indicators: blood test that measures inflammation, patient assessment, physician assessment, pain scale, and disability/functional questionnaire.
At 3 months, 59% of XELJANZ patients (143 out of 243) and 26% of placebo patients (31 out of 122) experienced the same results. During this study, patients did not take methotrexate.

  

 
At 6 Months, XELJANZ Patients Experienced Less Joint Damage Progression Than Methotrexate Patients.
Based on two studies, XELJANZ was shown on X-rays to help reduce further structural joint damage. This included holes in the bones known as erosions and the narrowing of the space between the bones where cartilage has been lost.
In the ORAL Start Study, XELJANZ patients hadn't taken methotrexate prior to the study. However, XELJANZ is only approved for use in patients for whom methotrexate did not work well. At 6 months, XELJANZ patients got worse by 0.2 units of change on the modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) scale, while patients taking methotrexate worsened by 0.8. mTSS measures joint damage progression in selected joints of the hands and feet. The higher the amount of change in the mTSS, the more joint damage has progressed.
In the ORAL Scan Study, patients who took XELJANZ and methotrexate had less progression of joint damage after 6 months (0.1) than those who took a placebo and methotrexate (0.5). However, the possibility was high enough that the difference between treatments may have been due to chance alone and not due to XELJANZ, so the results were not considered significant.

XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may cause serious side effects, including:
Serious infections. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. Some people can have serious infections while taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died from these infections. Your healthcare provider should test you for TB before starting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and monitor you closely for signs and symptoms of TB infection during treatment. You should not start taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR if you have any kind of infection unless your healthcare provider tells you it is okay.
You may be at a higher risk of developing shingles.
Before starting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, tell your healthcare provider if you:

think you have an infection or have symptoms of an infection, such as fever, sweating, or chills; cough; blood in phlegm; warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body; burning when you urinate or urinating more often than normal; muscle aches; shortness of breath; weight loss; diarrhea or stomach pain; or feeling very tired
are being treated for an infection
get a lot of infections or have infections that keep coming back
have diabetes, HIV, or a weak immune system. People with these conditions have a higher chance for infections
have TB, or have been in close contact with someone with TB
live or have lived in, or have traveled to certain parts of the country (such as the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys and the Southwest) where there is an increased chance for getting certain kinds of fungal infections (histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis). These infections may happen or become more severe if you use XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Ask your healthcare provider if you do not know if you have lived in an area where these infections are common
have or have had hepatitis B or C

After starting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, call your healthcare provider right away if you have any symptoms of an infection. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can make you more likely to get infections or make worse any infection that you have.
Cancer and immune system problems. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may increase your risk of certain cancers by changing the way your immune system works. Lymphoma and other cancers, including skin cancers, have happened in patients taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had any type of cancer.
Some people who have taken XELJANZ with certain other medicines to prevent kidney transplant rejection have had a problem with certain white blood cells growing out of control (Epstein Barr Virus–associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder).
Tears (perforation) in the stomach or intestines. Some people taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can get tears in their stomach or intestine. This happens most often in people who also take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or methotrexate.
Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have fever and stomach-area pain that does not go away and a change in your bowel habits.
Changes in certain lab test results. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests before you start receiving XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and while you take XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, to check for the following side effects:

changes in lymphocyte counts. Lymphocytes are white blood cells that help the body fight off infections.
low neutrophil counts. Neutrophils are white blood cells that help the body fight off infections.
low red blood cell count. This may mean that you have anemia, which may make you feel weak and tired.

Your healthcare provider should routinely check certain liver tests.
You should not receive XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR if your lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, or red blood cell count is too low or your liver tests are too high. Your healthcare provider may stop your XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR treatment for a period of time if needed because of changes in these blood test results.
Your healthcare provider should do blood tests to check your cholesterol levels 4-8 weeks after you start XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and as needed after that.

You should not start taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR if you have any kind of infection unless your healthcare provider tells you it is okay.
You may be at a higher risk of developing shingles.
Before starting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, tell your healthcare provider if you:

think you have an infection or have symptoms of an infection, such as fever, sweating, or chills; cough; blood in phlegm; warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body; burning when you urinate or urinating more often than normal; muscle aches; shortness of breath; weight loss; diarrhea or stomach pain; or feeling very tired
are being treated for an infection
get a lot of infections or have infections that keep coming back
have diabetes, HIV, or a weak immune system. People with these conditions have a higher chance for infections
have TB, or have been in close contact with someone with TB
live or have lived in, or have traveled to certain parts of the country (such as the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys and the Southwest) where there is an increased chance for getting certain kinds of fungal infections (histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis). These infections may happen or become more severe if you use XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Ask your healthcare provider if you do not know if you have lived in an area where these infections are common
have or have had hepatitis B or C

After starting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, call your healthcare provider right away if you have any symptoms of an infection. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can make you more likely to get infections or make worse any infection that you have.
Cancer and immune system problems. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may increase your risk of certain cancers by changing the way your immune system works. Lymphoma and other cancers, including skin cancers, have happened in patients taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had any type of cancer.
Some people who have taken XELJANZ with certain other medicines to prevent kidney transplant rejection have had a problem with certain white blood cells growing out of control (Epstein Barr Virus–associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder).
Tears (perforation) in the stomach or intestines. Some people taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can get tears in their stomach or intestine. This happens most often in people who also take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or methotrexate.
Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have fever and stomach-area pain that does not go away and a change in your bowel habits.
Changes in certain lab test results. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests before you start receiving XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and while you take XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, to check for the following side effects:

changes in lymphocyte counts. Lymphocytes are white blood cells that help the body fight off infections.
low neutrophil counts. Neutrophils are white blood cells that help the body fight off infections.
low red blood cell count. This may mean that you have anemia, which may make you feel weak and tired.

Your healthcare provider should routinely check certain liver tests.
You should not receive XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR if your lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, or red blood cell count is too low or your liver tests are too high. Your healthcare provider may stop your XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR treatment for a period of time if needed because of changes in these blood test results.
Your healthcare provider should do blood tests to check your cholesterol levels 4-8 weeks after you start XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and as needed after that.
What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR?
XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may not be right for you. Before taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, tell your healthcare provider if you:

have an infection
have liver problems
have kidney problems
have any stomach area (abdominal) pain or been diagnosed with diverticulitis (inflammation in parts of the large intestine) or ulcers in your stomach or intestines, or narrowing within your digestive tract
have had a reaction to tofacitinib or any of the ingredients in XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR
have recently received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine. People taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR should not receive live vaccines but can receive non-live vaccines
have any other medical conditions
plan to become pregnant or are pregnant. It is not known if XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR will harm an unborn baby
Pregnancy Registry: Pfizer has a registry for pregnant women who take XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. The purpose of this registry is to check the health of the pregnant mother and her baby. If you are pregnant or become pregnant while taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, talk to your healthcare provider about how you can join this pregnancy registry or you may contact the registry at 1-877-311-8972 to enroll
plan to breastfeed or are breastfeeding

Tell your healthcare provider about all of the medicines you take, especially any other medicines to treat your rheumatoid arthritis. You should not take tocilizumab (Actemra®), etanercept (Enbrel®), adalimumab (Humira®), infliximab (Remicade®), rituximab (Rituxan®), abatacept (Orencia®), anakinra (Kineret®), certolizumab pegol (Cimzia®), golimumab (Simponi®), azathioprine, cyclosporine, or other immunosuppressive drugs while you are taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Taking XELJANZ or XELJANZ XR with these medicines may increase your risk of infection.

Tell your healthcare provider if you are taking medicines that affect the way certain liver enzymes work. Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure if your medicine is one of these.

Taking XELJANZ XR
When you take XELJANZ XR, you may see something in your stool that looks like a tablet. This is the empty shell from the tablet after the medicine has been absorbed by your body.
What are other possible side effects of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR?
XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may cause serious side effects, including hepatitis B or C activation infection in people who carry the virus in their blood. If you are a carrier of the hepatitis B or C virus (viruses that affect the liver), the virus may become active while you use XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Tell your healthcare provider if you have the following symptoms of a possible hepatitis B or C infection: feel very tired, little or no appetite, clay-colored bowel movements, chills, muscle aches, skin rash, skin or eyes look yellow, vomiting, fevers, stomach discomfort, or dark urine.
Common side effects of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR include upper respiratory tract infections (common cold, sinus infections), headache, diarrhea, and nasal congestion, sore throat, and runny nose (nasopharyngitis).
What is XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR?
XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is a prescription medicine called a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is used to treat adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis in which methotrexate did not work well.

It is not known if XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is safe and effective in people with hepatitis B or C.
XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is not for people with severe liver problems.
It is not known if XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is safe and effective in children.

      Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Treatment Options    



From pills like methotrexate, XELJANZ, and once-daily XELJANZ XR to infusions and needle-based injections, there are many different medications available for treating rheumatoid arthritis (RA). When talking with your healthcare provider about the right treatment option for you, it’s important to remember that RA affects everyone differently, including how fast it progresses, and you should work with your healthcare team to assess available treatment options. A healthcare provider will often prescribe different medications at different times, depending on a patient’s unique situation.
While treatment paths may vary, click below to learn more about potential treatment options. 





NSAIDs
For example, ibuprofen



WHAT ARE NSAIDs?

About NSAIDs

NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are often prescribed along with DMARDs to help reduce pain and swelling in the joints.
While DMARDs can help reduce the progression of joint damage, NSAIDs only treat pain and inflammation.

How do NSAIDs work?
NSAIDs block the production of prostaglandins, which are involved in triggering inflammation and increasing pain.
How to take it
Pill or patch











STEROIDS
For example, prednisone



WHAT ARE STEROIDS?

About steroids
Steroids (in this case, short for corticosteroids ) are naturally occurring hormones produced by the adrenal glands above the kidneys during exercise or as a reaction to stress.
How do steroids work?

Steroids normally help replace energy stores that are used up during exercise or stress, and promote efficient operation of the cardiovascular system.
Steroids also reduce the swelling and decrease inflammation associated with RA. Healthcare providers rarely use or prescribe corticosteroids by themselves, and will often use them only when you have acute RA symptoms, including inflammation in a single joint.

How to take it
Topical ointment, pill, or an injection into a muscle or directly into an affected joint.





While NSAIDs and steroids may be used along with other treatments to help manage pain and swelling, a healthcare provider may also recommend methotrexate, which unlike NSAIDs and steroids, can help slow the progression of RA joint damage.






DMARDs
For example, methotrexate



WHAT ARE DMARDs?

About methotrexate

Methotrexate is one of the most commonly prescribed DMARDs (disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs). Other common DMARDs include hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine.
Methotrexate is often prescribed at the time of diagnosis to help reduce pain and swelling in the joints, and the progression of joint damage.

How does methotrexate work?
Methotrexate interferes with the production and maintenance of DNA, the genetic material in the cells of your body. It is not fully known how methotrexate works to treat RA.
How to take it
Pill and, in some cases, an injection





If methotrexate isn't doing enough, other treatment options are available to help reduce your RA symptoms.






JAK INHIBITORS
For example, XELJANZ® (tofacitinib citrate)



WHAT ARE JAK INHIBITORS?

About JAK inhibitors

Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, another type of DMARD, are the first in a class of treatments for moderate to severe RA.
XELJANZ, a JAK inhibitor, has been shown to help reduce pain and swelling in the joints, and to slow the progression of joint damage.
XELJANZ can work alone. It is proven to reduce RA pain, swelling, and joint damage without the need for methotrexate.
XELJANZ is also available as a once-daily pill called XELJANZ XR.

How do JAK inhibitors work?
JAK inhibitors work deep inside the cell to disrupt the signaling pathways between the cells of your immune system that are believed to play a role in the inflammation associated with RA.
How to take it
Pill











BIOLOGICS
For example, Humira® (adalimumab)



WHAT ARE BIOLOGICS?

About biologics

Biologics target the underlying disease process, including specific parts of the immune system, to help reduce moderate to severe RA symptoms.
Biologics, another type of DMARD, have been shown to help reduce pain, swelling, and stiffness in the joints, and the progression of joint damage.

How do biologics work?
There are various types of biologics available, each working in different ways to reduce, target, or block proteins that, when your body produces too much of them, can play a role in the pain, symptoms, and joint damage of RA.

Important Safety Information & Indication

Expand or Collapse










IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

What is the most important information I should know about XELJANZ® (tofacitinib citrate) 5 mg tablets/XELJANZ® XR (tofacitinib citrate) extended release 11 mg tablets?
XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may cause serious side effects, including:
Serious infections. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. Some people can have serious infections while taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died from these infections. Your healthcare provider should test you for TB before starting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and monitor you closely for signs and symptoms of TB infection during treatment. You should not start taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR if you have any kind of infection unless your healthcare provider tells you it is okay.
You may be at a higher risk of developing shingles.
Before starting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, tell your healthcare provider if you:

think you have an infection or have symptoms of an infection, such as fever, sweating, or chills; cough; blood in phlegm; warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body; burning when you urinate or urinating more often than normal; muscle aches; shortness of breath; weight loss; diarrhea or stomach pain; or feeling very tired
are being treated for an infection
get a lot of infections or have infections that keep coming back
have diabetes, HIV, or a weak immune system. People with these conditions have a higher chance for infections
have TB, or have been in close contact with someone with TB
live or have lived in, or have traveled to certain parts of the country (such as the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys and the Southwest) where there is an increased chance for getting certain kinds of fungal infections (histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis). These infections may happen or become more severe if you use XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Ask your healthcare provider if you do not know if you have lived in an area where these infections are common
have or have had hepatitis B or C

After starting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, call your healthcare provider right away if you have any symptoms of an infection. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can make you more likely to get infections or make worse any infection that you have.
Cancer and immune system problems. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may increase your risk of certain cancers by changing the way your immune system works. Lymphoma and other cancers, including skin cancers, have happened in patients taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had any type of cancer.
Some people who have taken XELJANZ with certain other medicines to prevent kidney transplant rejection have had a problem with certain white blood cells growing out of control (Epstein Barr Virus–associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder).
Tears (perforation) in the stomach or intestines. Some people taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can get tears in their stomach or intestine. This happens most often in people who also take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or methotrexate.
Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have fever and stomach-area pain that does not go away and a change in your bowel habits.
Changes in certain lab test results. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests before you start receiving XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and while you take XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, to check for the following side effects:

changes in lymphocyte counts. Lymphocytes are white blood cells that help the body fight off infections.
low neutrophil counts. Neutrophils are white blood cells that help the body fight off infections.
low red blood cell count. This may mean that you have anemia, which may make you feel weak and tired.

Your healthcare provider should routinely check certain liver tests.
You should not receive XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR if your lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, or red blood cell count is too low or your liver tests are too high. Your healthcare provider may stop your XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR treatment for a period of time if needed because of changes in these blood test results.
Your healthcare provider should do blood tests to check your cholesterol levels 4-8 weeks after you start XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and as needed after that.
What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR?
XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may not be right for you. Before taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, tell your healthcare provider if you:

have an infection
have liver problems
have kidney problems
have any stomach area (abdominal) pain or been diagnosed with diverticulitis (inflammation in parts of the large intestine) or ulcers in your stomach or intestines, or narrowing within your digestive tract
have had a reaction to tofacitinib or any of the ingredients in XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR
have recently received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine. People taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR should not receive live vaccines but can receive non-live vaccines
have any other medical conditions
plan to become pregnant or are pregnant. It is not known if XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR will harm an unborn baby
Pregnancy Registry: Pfizer has a registry for pregnant women who take XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. The purpose of this registry is to check the health of the pregnant mother and her baby. If you are pregnant or become pregnant while taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, talk to your healthcare provider about how you can join this pregnancy registry or you may contact the registry at 1-877-311-8972 to enroll
plan to breastfeed or are breastfeeding

Tell your healthcare provider about all of the medicines you take, especially any other medicines to treat your rheumatoid arthritis. You should not take tocilizumab (Actemra®), etanercept (Enbrel®), adalimumab (Humira®), infliximab (Remicade®), rituximab (Rituxan®), abatacept (Orencia®), anakinra (Kineret®), certolizumab pegol (Cimzia®), golimumab (Simponi®), azathioprine, cyclosporine, or other immunosuppressive drugs while you are taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Taking XELJANZ or XELJANZ XR with these medicines may increase your risk of infection.

Tell your healthcare provider if you are taking medicines that affect the way certain liver enzymes work. Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure if your medicine is one of these.

Taking XELJANZ XR
When you take XELJANZ XR, you may see something in your stool that looks like a tablet. This is the empty shell from the tablet after the medicine has been absorbed by your body.
What are other possible side effects of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR?
XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may cause serious side effects, including hepatitis B or C activation infection in people who carry the virus in their blood. If you are a carrier of the hepatitis B or C virus (viruses that affect the liver), the virus may become active while you use XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Tell your healthcare provider if you have the following symptoms of a possible hepatitis B or C infection: feel very tired, little or no appetite, clay-colored bowel movements, chills, muscle aches, skin rash, skin or eyes look yellow, vomiting, fevers, stomach discomfort, or dark urine.
Common side effects of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR include upper respiratory tract infections (common cold, sinus infections), headache, diarrhea, and nasal congestion, sore throat, and runny nose (nasopharyngitis).
What is XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR?
XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is a prescription medicine called a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is used to treat adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis in which methotrexate did not work well.

It is not known if XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is safe and effective in people with hepatitis B or C.
XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is not for people with severe liver problems.
It is not known if XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is safe and effective in children.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

What is the most important information I should know about XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR?
XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may cause serious side effects, including:
Serious infections. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. Some people can have serious infections while taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died from these infections. Your healthcare provider should test you for TB before starting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and monitor you closely for signs and symptoms of TB infection during treatment. You should not start taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR if you have any kind of infection unless your healthcare provider tells you it is okay.
You may be at a higher risk of developing shingles.
Before starting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, tell your healthcare provider if you:

think you have an infection or have symptoms of an infection, such as fever, sweating, or chills; cough; blood in phlegm; warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body; burning when you urinate or urinating more often than normal; muscle aches; shortness of breath; weight loss; diarrhea or stomach pain; or feeling very tired
are being treated for an infection
get a lot of infections or have infections that keep coming back
have diabetes, HIV, or a weak immune system. People with these conditions have a higher chance for infections
have TB, or have been in close contact with someone with TB
live or have lived in, or have traveled to certain parts of the country (such as the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys and the Southwest) where there is an increased chance for getting certain kinds of fungal infections (histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis). These infections may happen or become more severe if you use XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Ask your healthcare provider if you do not know if you have lived in an area where these infections are common
have or have had hepatitis B or C

After starting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, call your healthcare provider right away if you have any symptoms of an infection. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can make you more likely to get infections or make worse any infection that you have.
Cancer and immune system problems. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may increase your risk of certain cancers by changing the way your immune system works. Lymphoma and other cancers, including skin cancers, have happened in patients taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had any type of cancer.
Some people who have taken XELJANZ with certain other medicines to prevent kidney transplant rejection have had a problem with certain white blood cells growing out of control (Epstein Barr Virus–associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder).
Tears (perforation) in the stomach or intestines. Some people taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can get tears in their stomach or intestine. This happens most often in people who also take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or methotrexate.
Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have fever and stomach-area pain that does not go away and a change in your bowel habits.
Changes in certain lab test results. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests before you start receiving XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and while you take XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, to check for the following side effects:

changes in lymphocyte counts. Lymphocytes are white blood cells that help the body fight off infections.
low neutrophil counts. Neutrophils are white blood cells that help the body fight off infections.
low red blood cell count. This may mean that you have anemia, which may make you feel weak and tired.

Your healthcare provider should routinely check certain liver tests.
You should not receive XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR if your lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, or red blood cell count is too low or your liver tests are too high. Your healthcare provider may stop your XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR treatment for a period of time if needed because of changes in these blood test results.
Your healthcare provider should do blood tests to check your cholesterol levels 4-8 weeks after you start XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and as needed after that.
What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR?
XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may not be right for you. Before taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, tell your healthcare provider if you:

have an infection
have liver problems
have kidney problems
have any stomach area (abdominal) pain or been diagnosed with diverticulitis (inflammation in parts of the large intestine) or ulcers in your stomach or intestines, or narrowing within your digestive tract
have had a reaction to tofacitinib or any of the ingredients in XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR
have recently received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine. People taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR should not receive live vaccines but can receive non-live vaccines
have any other medical conditions
plan to become pregnant or are pregnant. It is not known if XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR will harm an unborn baby
Pregnancy Registry: Pfizer has a registry for pregnant women who take XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. The purpose of this registry is to check the health of the pregnant mother and her baby. If you are pregnant or become pregnant while taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, talk to your healthcare provider about how you can join this pregnancy registry or you may contact the registry at 1-877-311-8972 to enroll
plan to breastfeed or are breastfeeding

Tell your healthcare provider about all of the medicines you take, especially any other medicines to treat your rheumatoid arthritis. You should not take tocilizumab (Actemra®), etanercept (Enbrel®), adalimumab (Humira®), infliximab (Remicade®), rituximab (Rituxan®), abatacept (Orencia®), anakinra (Kineret®), certolizumab pegol (Cimzia®), golimumab (Simponi®), azathioprine, cyclosporine, or other immunosuppressive drugs while you are taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Taking XELJANZ or XELJANZ XR with these medicines may increase your risk of infection.

Tell your healthcare provider if you are taking medicines that affect the way certain liver enzymes work. Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure if your medicine is one of these.

Taking XELJANZ XR
When you take XELJANZ XR, you may see something in your stool that looks like a tablet. This is the empty shell from the tablet after the medicine has been absorbed by your body.
What are other possible side effects of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR?
XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may cause serious side effects, including hepatitis B or C activation infection in people who carry the virus in their blood. If you are a carrier of the hepatitis B or C virus (viruses that affect the liver), the virus may become active while you use XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Tell your healthcare provider if you have the following symptoms of a possible hepatitis B or C infection: feel very tired, little or no appetite, clay-colored bowel movements, chills, muscle aches, skin rash, skin or eyes look yellow, vomiting, fevers, stomach discomfort, or dark urine.
Common side effects of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR include upper respiratory tract infections (common cold, sinus infections), headache, diarrhea, and nasal congestion, sore throat, and runny nose (nasopharyngitis).

      Quick Facts    



      If moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) pain is getting in the way of your normal activities, it may be time to ask if XELJANZ or the once-daily formulation, XELJANZ XR, could be right for you.    

Vertical Tabs

1



 Available by prescription, XELJANZ (pronounced zel-jans ) is a small pill that treats moderate to severe RA. XELJANZ is also available as a once-daily pill called XELJANZ XR. Learn more about once-daily XELJANZ XR here.

 

XELJANZ is proven to work alone—even without methotrexate.
  




2



 XELJANZ is the first in a class of treatments for moderate to severe RA called Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. If methotrexate hasn’t done enough to help relieve your RA symptoms, and before you and your rheumatologist decide on a biologic, ask if XELJANZ is right for you.

      How XELJANZ Works    



 














 




CLOSE X



 


XELJANZ is a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that works deep inside the cell to disrupt activities occurring in signaling pathways. These JAK pathways are believed to play a role in the inflammation associated with RA. Watch to learn more about the science of XELJANZ and how it works to help disrupt the processes that can lead to inflammation.


Video description: Take a closer look at how XELJANZ works.
 


 









      Clinical Trial Results    



The effectiveness of XELJANZ, taken with and without a disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD),  such as methotrexate, was tested in six studies that involved more than 4,200 adult patients with RA.

     
  

     
  

 


 
More Than Half Of XELJANZ Patients Felt An Improvement In RA Symptoms Within 3 Months.
In the ORAL Solo Study, at 2 weeks, 30% of XELJANZ patients (71 out of 240) and 12% of placebo patients (14 out of 119) experienced a 20% reduction in tender and swollen joint counts and 3 of these 5 indicators: blood test that measures inflammation, patient assessment, physician assessment, pain scale, and disability/functional questionnaire.
At 3 months, 59% of XELJANZ patients (143 out of 243) and 26% of placebo patients (31 out of 122) experienced the same results. During this study, patients did not take methotrexate.

  

 
At 3 Months, More Than Half of XELJANZ Patients Could More Easily Complete Daily Activities, Such As Getting Dressed, Walking Down Stairs, And Gripping Household Items.
In the ORAL Solo Study, a scale was used that defines RA disability as: 0-1 = mild; 1-2 = moderate to severe; 2+ = greater disability. At the study start, XELJANZ patients had a mean baseline score of 1.53.
At 3 months, XELJANZ patients saw an improved score of 1.05 (a statistically important difference) and, overall, 60% (143 out of 240) of XELJANZ patients experienced an improvement ≥0.22 on the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index (HAQ-DI) that assesses the following categories: dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and common daily activities. During this study, patients did not take methotrexate.

  

 
XELJANZ Reduced Joint Pain And Swelling Caused By RA, Even Without The Use Of Methotrexate.
In the ORAL Solo Study, at 2 weeks, 30% of XELJANZ patients (72 out of 240) and 12% of placebo patients (14 out of 120) experienced a 20% reduction in tender and swollen joint counts and 3 of these 5 indicators: blood test that measures inflammation, patient assessment, physician assessment, pain scale, and disability/functional questionnaire.
At 3 months, 59% of XELJANZ patients (143 out of 243) and 26% of placebo patients (31 out of 122) experienced the same results. During this study, patients did not take methotrexate.

  

 
At 6 Months, XELJANZ Patients Experienced Less Joint Damage Progression Than Methotrexate Patients.
Based on two studies, XELJANZ was shown on X-rays to help reduce further structural joint damage. This included holes in the bones known as erosions and the narrowing of the space between the bones where cartilage has been lost.
In the ORAL Start Study, XELJANZ patients hadn't taken methotrexate prior to the study. However, XELJANZ is only approved for use in patients for whom methotrexate did not work well. At 6 months, XELJANZ patients got worse by 0.2 units of change on the modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) scale, while patients taking methotrexate worsened by 0.8. mTSS measures joint damage progression in selected joints of the hands and feet. The higher the amount of change in the mTSS, the more joint damage has progressed.
In the ORAL Scan Study, patients who took XELJANZ and methotrexate had less progression of joint damage after 6 months (0.1) than those who took a placebo and methotrexate (0.5). However, the possibility was high enough that the difference between treatments may have been due to chance alone and not due to XELJANZ, so the results were not considered significant.

      Safety & Side Effects    




SERIOUS INFECTIONS

Close X



SERIOUS INFECTIONS
Serious infections.
XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. Some people can have serious infections while taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died from these infections. Your healthcare provider should test you for TB before starting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and monitor you closely for signs and symptoms of TB infection during treatment. You should not start taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR if you have any kind of infection unless your healthcare provider tells you it is okay.
You may be at a higher risk of developing shingles.
Before starting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, tell your healthcare provider if you:

think you have an infection or have symptoms of an infection, such as fever, sweating, or chills; cough; blood in phlegm; warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body; burning when you urinate or urinating more often than normal; muscle aches; shortness of breath; weight loss; diarrhea or stomach pain; or feeling very tired
are being treated for an infection
get a lot of infections or have infections that keep coming back
have diabetes, HIV, or a weak immune system. People with these conditions have a higher chance for infections
have TB, or have been in close contact with someone with TB
live or have lived in, or have traveled to certain parts of the country (such as the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys and the Southwest) where there is an increased chance for getting certain kinds of fungal infections (histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis). These infections may happen or become more severe if you use XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Ask your healthcare provider if you do not know if you have lived in an area where these infections are common
have or have had hepatitis B or C

After starting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, call your healthcare provider right away if you have any symptoms of an infection. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can make you more likely to get infections or make worse any infection that you have.

CANCER AND IMMUNE SYSTEM PROBLEMS
Cancer and immune system problems.
XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may increase your risk of certain cancers by changing the way your immune system works. Lymphoma and other cancers, including skin cancers, have happened in patients taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had any type of cancer.
Some people who have taken XELJANZ with certain other medicines to prevent kidney transplant rejection have had a problem with certain white blood cells growing out of control (Epstein Barr Virus–associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder).

TEARS (PERFORATION) IN THE STOMACH OR INTESTINES 

Close X



TEARS (PERFORATION) IN THE STOMACH OR INTESTINES 
Tears (perforation) in the stomach or intestines.
Some people taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can get tears in their stomach or intestine. This happens most often in people who also take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or methotrexate.
Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have fever and stomach-area pain that does not go away and a change in your bowel habits.

CHANGES IN CERTAIN LAB TEST RESULTS

Close X



CHANGES IN CERTAIN LAB TEST RESULTS
Changes in certain lab test results.
Your healthcare provider should do blood tests before you start receiving XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and while you take XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, to check for the following side effects:

changes in lymphocyte counts. Lymphocytes are white blood cells that help the body fight off infections.
low neutrophil counts. Neutrophils are white blood cells that help the body fight off infections.
low red blood cell count. This may mean that you have anemia, which may make you feel weak and tired.

Your healthcare provider should routinely check certain liver tests.
You should not receive XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR if your lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, or red blood cell count is too low or your liver tests are too high. Your healthcare provider may stop your XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR treatment for a period of time if needed because of changes in these blood test results.
Your healthcare provider should do blood tests to check your cholesterol levels 4-8 weeks after you start XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and as needed after that.

Equity TypeORD


Ra Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a United States-based clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company. The Company focuses on the development of therapeutics for diseases of complement dysregulation and a range of orphan indications. It utilizes small molecules and peptide approaches to address pathological targets in the complement cascade. It has leveraged the Extreme Diversity peptide chemistry platform to develop a portfolio of products that selectively inhibit the complement system and other immune targets. Its main program, RA101495, is a macrocyclic peptide inhibitor of complement component 5 (C5), which is in Phase I stage of development for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). RA101495 binds a site on the C5 protein to inhibit cleavage into C5a and C5b, thereby preventing red blood cell lysis by inhibiting the production and assembly of the membrane attack complex (MAC). RA101495 is being developed as an alternative to eculizumab therapy for patients with PNH.

Comment Guidelines
 

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

What is the most important information I should know about XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR?
XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may cause serious side effects, including:
Serious infections. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. Some people can have serious infections while taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died from these infections. Your healthcare provider should test you for TB before starting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and monitor you closely for signs and symptoms of TB infection during treatment. You should not start taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR if you have any kind of infection unless your healthcare provider tells you it is okay.
You may be at a higher risk of developing shingles.
Before starting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, tell your healthcare provider if you:

think you have an infection or have symptoms of an infection, such as fever, sweating, or chills; cough; blood in phlegm; warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body; burning when you urinate or urinating more often than normal; muscle aches; shortness of breath; weight loss; diarrhea or stomach pain; or feeling very tired
are being treated for an infection
get a lot of infections or have infections that keep coming back
have diabetes, HIV, or a weak immune system. People with these conditions have a higher chance for infections
have TB, or have been in close contact with someone with TB
live or have lived in, or have traveled to certain parts of the country (such as the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys and the Southwest) where there is an increased chance for getting certain kinds of fungal infections (histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis). These infections may happen or become more severe if you use XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Ask your healthcare provider if you do not know if you have lived in an area where these infections are common
have or have had hepatitis B or C

After starting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, call your healthcare provider right away if you have any symptoms of an infection. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can make you more likely to get infections or make worse any infection that you have.
Cancer and immune system problems. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may increase your risk of certain cancers by changing the way your immune system works. Lymphoma and other cancers, including skin cancers, have happened in patients taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had any type of cancer.
Some people who have taken XELJANZ with certain other medicines to prevent kidney transplant rejection have had a problem with certain white blood cells growing out of control (Epstein Barr Virus–associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder).
Tears (perforation) in the stomach or intestines. Some people taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can get tears in their stomach or intestine. This happens most often in people who also take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or methotrexate.
Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have fever and stomach-area pain that does not go away and a change in your bowel habits.
Changes in certain lab test results. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests before you start receiving XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and while you take XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, to check for the following side effects:

changes in lymphocyte counts. Lymphocytes are white blood cells that help the body fight off infections.
low neutrophil counts. Neutrophils are white blood cells that help the body fight off infections.
low red blood cell count. This may mean that you have anemia, which may make you feel weak and tired.

Your healthcare provider should routinely check certain liver tests.
You should not receive XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR if your lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, or red blood cell count is too low or your liver tests are too high. Your healthcare provider may stop your XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR treatment for a period of time if needed because of changes in these blood test results.
Your healthcare provider should do blood tests to check your cholesterol levels 4-8 weeks after you start XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and as needed after that.
What should I tell my healthcare provider before taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR?
XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may not be right for you. Before taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, tell your healthcare provider if you:

have an infection
have liver problems
have kidney problems
have any stomach area (abdominal) pain or been diagnosed with diverticulitis (inflammation in parts of the large intestine) or ulcers in your stomach or intestines, or narrowing within your digestive tract
have had a reaction to tofacitinib or any of the ingredients in XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR
have recently received or are scheduled to receive a vaccine. People taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR should not receive live vaccines but can receive non-live vaccines
have any other medical conditions
plan to become pregnant or are pregnant. It is not known if XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR will harm an unborn baby
Pregnancy Registry: Pfizer has a registry for pregnant women who take XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. The purpose of this registry is to check the health of the pregnant mother and her baby. If you are pregnant or become pregnant while taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, talk to your healthcare provider about how you can join this pregnancy registry or you may contact the registry at 1-877-311-8972 to enroll
plan to breastfeed or are breastfeeding

Tell your healthcare provider about all of the medicines you take, especially any other medicines to treat your rheumatoid arthritis. You should not take tocilizumab (Actemra®), etanercept (Enbrel®), adalimumab (Humira®), infliximab (Remicade®), rituximab (Rituxan®), abatacept (Orencia®), anakinra (Kineret®), certolizumab pegol (Cimzia®), golimumab (Simponi®), azathioprine, cyclosporine, or other immunosuppressive drugs while you are taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Taking XELJANZ or XELJANZ XR with these medicines may increase your risk of infection.

Tell your healthcare provider if you are taking medicines that affect the way certain liver enzymes work. Ask your healthcare provider if you are not sure if your medicine is one of these.

Taking XELJANZ XR
When you take XELJANZ XR, you may see something in your stool that looks like a tablet. This is the empty shell from the tablet after the medicine has been absorbed by your body.
What are other possible side effects of XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR?
XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may cause serious side effects, including hepatitis B or C activation infection in people who carry the virus in their blood. If you are a carrier of the hepatitis B or C virus (viruses that affect the liver), the virus may become active while you use XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Tell your healthcare provider if you have the following symptoms of a possible hepatitis B or C infection: feel very tired, little or no appetite, clay-colored bowel movements, chills, muscle aches, skin rash, skin or eyes look yellow, vomiting, fevers, stomach discomfort, or dark urine.

 XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is the first in a new class of treatments for moderate to severe RA called Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. JAK inhibitors work deep inside the cell to disrupt cellular activities that occur in signaling pathways, known as the JAK pathways.
Learn more about the different treatment options and where XELJANZ fits into the mix.
  

 How soon will I notice a difference when taking XELJANZ? 
 In some patients, XELJANZ can begin to work in as early as 2 weeks to help relieve joint pain and swelling. And, in clinical trials, more than half of XELJANZ patients felt an improvement in RA symptoms at 3 months. Everybody is different though, so your results may differ.
Learn more about how XELJANZ performed in Clinical Trial Results.
  

 Does XELJANZ help reduce the progression of joint damage? 
 XELJANZ has been shown to be effective in slowing the progression of joint damage. In a clinical trial at 6 months, XELJANZ reduced joint damage progression better than methotrexate.
In the ORAL Start Study, XELJANZ patients hadn't taken methotrexate prior to the study. However, XELJANZ is only approved for use in patients for whom methotrexate did not work well. At 6 months, XELJANZ patients got worse by 0.2 units of change on the modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) scale, while patients taking methotrexate worsened by 0.8. mTSS measures joint damage progression in selected joints of the hands and feet. The higher the amount of change in the mTSS, the more joint damage has progressed.
In the ORAL Scan Study, patients who took XELJANZ and methotrexate had less progression of joint damage after 6 months (0.1) than those who took a placebo and methotrexate (0.5). However, the possibility was high enough that the difference between treatments may have been due to chance alone and not due to XELJANZ, so the results were not considered significant.
Learn how the progression of RA causes joint damage.
  

 What are the active ingredients in XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR? 
 The active ingredient in XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is tofacitinib citrate.
  

 What laboratory tests are necessary with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR? 
 Your healthcare provider should do blood tests before you start receiving XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and while you take XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, to check for the following side effects:

changes in lymphocyte counts. Lymphocytes are white blood cells that help the body fight off infections.
low neutrophil counts. Neutrophils are white blood cells that help the body fight off infections.
low red blood cell count. This may mean that you have anemia, which may make you feel weak and tired.

Your healthcare provider should routinely check certain liver tests.
You should not receive XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR if your lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, or red blood cell count is too low or your liver tests are too high. Your healthcare provider may stop your XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR treatment for a period of time if needed because of changes in these blood test results.
Your healthcare provider should do blood tests to check your cholesterol levels 4-8 weeks after you start XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and as needed after that.
  

 I do not want to take methotrexate. Can XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR work alone? 
 XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is proven to work alone—even without methotrexate. XELJANZ, a JAK inhibitor, has been shown to help reduce pain and swelling in the joints, and to slow the progression of joint damage.
  

 Can XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR be taken with a biologic treatment?  
 No. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR cannot be taken with a biologic treatment. Be sure to tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take.
For more information, see Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Treatment Options.
  

 How do I take XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR—does it require injections or infusions?  
 XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is taken by mouth. XELJANZ is taken twice daily while XELJANZ XR is taken once daily. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can be taken with or without food.
For more information, see What is XELJANZ?
  

 If I’m taking XELJANZ XR, will I see something in my stool? 
 When you take XELJANZ XR, you may see something in your stool that looks like a tablet. This is the empty shell from the tablet after the medicine has been absorbed by your body.
  

 What information is important to know when taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR? 
 
Take XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR as prescribed by your healthcare provider.
If you take too much XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away.

You should also take into account the following safety advice:

Keep XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR and all medicines out of the reach of children.
Do not use XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR for a condition for which it was not prescribed.
Do not give XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR to other people, even if they have the same symptoms you have. It may harm them.

For more information, see Safety & Side Effects.
  

 What should I do if I miss a dose?  
 Contact your healthcare provider if you miss a dose or forget to take XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR for an extended period of time.
  

 What should I do if I am not getting the results I expected? 
 Keep in mind that everybody is different. If you are not getting the results you expected, talk with your healthcare provider. Together you can determine if changing your course of treatment might be an appropriate step.
To help you determine how XELJANZ is working, see Tracking Your Progress.
  

 What are some tips for remembering to take XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR? 
 
Create daily reminders—by using your mobile phone or sticky notes—to help you stay on track. When you register for the XELJANZ+You Support Program, you’ll receive sticky notes and other helpful items like an RA-friendly water bottle as a free gift.
Set up alerts to remind you when it’s time to take XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR.
Take XELJANZ with your morning and evening meals or before or after you brush your teeth. Take once-daily XELJANZ XR only in the morning or only in the evening.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION AND INDICATION
What is the most important information I should know about XELJANZ® (tofacitinib citrate)/XELJANZ® XR (tofacitinib citrate)?
XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may cause serious side effects, including:
Serious infections. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can lower the ability of your immune system to fight infections. Some people can have serious infections while taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died from these infections. Your healthcare provider should test you for TB before starting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and monitor you closely for signs and symptoms of TB infection during treatment. You should not start taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR if you have any kind of infection unless your healthcare provider tells you it is okay.
You may be at a higher risk of developing shingles.
Before starting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, tell your healthcare provider if you:

think you have an infection or have symptoms of an infection, such as fever, sweating, or chills; cough; blood in phlegm; warm, red, or painful skin or sores on your body; burning when you urinate or urinating more often than normal; muscle aches; shortness of breath; weight loss; diarrhea or stomach pain; or feeling very tired
are being treated for an infection
get a lot of infections or have infections that keep coming back
have diabetes, HIV, or a weak immune system. People with these conditions have a higher chance for infections
have TB, or have been in close contact with someone with TB
live or have lived in, or have traveled to certain parts of the country (such as the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys and the Southwest) where there is an increased chance for getting certain kinds of fungal infections (histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, or blastomycosis). These infections may happen or become more severe if you use XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Ask your healthcare provider if you do not know if you have lived in an area where these infections are common
have or have had hepatitis B or C

After starting XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, call your healthcare provider right away if you have any symptoms of an infection. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can make you more likely to get infections or make worse any infection that you have.
Cancer and immune system problems. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR may increase your risk of certain cancers by changing the way your immune system works. Lymphoma and other cancers, including skin cancers, have happened in patients taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR. Tell your healthcare provider if you have ever had any type of cancer.
Some people who have taken XELJANZ with certain other medicines to prevent kidney transplant rejection have had a problem with certain white blood cells growing out of control (Epstein Barr Virus–associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder).
Tears (perforation) in the stomach or intestines. Some people taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can get tears in their stomach or intestine. This happens most often in people who also take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or methotrexate.
Tell your healthcare provider right away if you have fever and stomach-area pain that does not go away and a change in your bowel habits.
Changes in certain lab test results. Your healthcare provider should do blood tests before you start receiving XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and while you take XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, to check for the following side effects:

changes in lymphocyte counts. Lymphocytes are white blood cells that help the body fight off infections.
low neutrophil counts. Neutrophils are white blood cells that help the body fight off infections.
low red blood cell count. This may mean that you have anemia, which may make you feel weak and tired.

Your healthcare provider should routinely check certain liver tests.
You should not receive XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR if your lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, or red blood cell count is too low or your liver tests are too high. Your healthcare provider may stop your XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR treatment for a period of time if needed because of changes in these blood test results.
Your healthcare provider should do blood tests to check your cholesterol levels 4-8 weeks after you start XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and as needed after that.

      About XELJANZ & XELJANZ XR    




Expand All +
 


 How can I learn if XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is right for me?  
 XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is a medication called a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor. It is used to treat adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in which methotrexate did not work well. Your healthcare provider can help determine if XELJANZ or once-daily XELJANZ XR is right for you.
For more information, see Is XELJANZ for You?
  

 What is a JAK inhibitor and why does it matter for me? 
 XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is the first in a new class of treatments for moderate to severe RA called Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. JAK inhibitors work deep inside the cell to disrupt cellular activities that occur in signaling pathways, known as the JAK pathways.
Learn more about the different treatment options and where XELJANZ fits into the mix.
  

 How soon will I notice a difference when taking XELJANZ? 
 In some patients, XELJANZ can begin to work in as early as 2 weeks to help relieve joint pain and swelling. And, in clinical trials, more than half of XELJANZ patients felt an improvement in RA symptoms at 3 months. Everybody is different though, so your results may differ.
Learn more about how XELJANZ performed in Clinical Trial Results.
  

 Does XELJANZ help reduce the progression of joint damage? 
 XELJANZ has been shown to be effective in slowing the progression of joint damage. In a clinical trial at 6 months, XELJANZ reduced joint damage progression better than methotrexate.
In the ORAL Start Study, XELJANZ patients hadn't taken methotrexate prior to the study. However, XELJANZ is only approved for use in patients for whom methotrexate did not work well. At 6 months, XELJANZ patients got worse by 0.2 units of change on the modified Total Sharp Score (mTSS) scale, while patients taking methotrexate worsened by 0.8. mTSS measures joint damage progression in selected joints of the hands and feet. The higher the amount of change in the mTSS, the more joint damage has progressed.
In the ORAL Scan Study, patients who took XELJANZ and methotrexate had less progression of joint damage after 6 months (0.1) than those who took a placebo and methotrexate (0.5). However, the possibility was high enough that the difference between treatments may have been due to chance alone and not due to XELJANZ, so the results were not considered significant.
Learn how the progression of RA causes joint damage.
  

 What are the active ingredients in XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR? 
 The active ingredient in XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is tofacitinib citrate.
  

 What laboratory tests are necessary with XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR? 
 Your healthcare provider should do blood tests before you start receiving XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and while you take XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, to check for the following side effects:

changes in lymphocyte counts. Lymphocytes are white blood cells that help the body fight off infections.
low neutrophil counts. Neutrophils are white blood cells that help the body fight off infections.
low red blood cell count. This may mean that you have anemia, which may make you feel weak and tired.

Your healthcare provider should routinely check certain liver tests.
You should not receive XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR if your lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, or red blood cell count is too low or your liver tests are too high. Your healthcare provider may stop your XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR treatment for a period of time if needed because of changes in these blood test results.
Your healthcare provider should do blood tests to check your cholesterol levels 4-8 weeks after you start XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, and as needed after that.
  

 I do not want to take methotrexate. Can XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR work alone? 
 XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is proven to work alone—even without methotrexate. XELJANZ, a JAK inhibitor, has been shown to help reduce pain and swelling in the joints, and to slow the progression of joint damage.
  

 Can XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR be taken with a biologic treatment?  
 No. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR cannot be taken with a biologic treatment. Be sure to tell your healthcare provider about all the medicines you take.
For more information, see Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) Treatment Options.
  

 How do I take XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR—does it require injections or infusions?  
 XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR is taken by mouth. XELJANZ is taken twice daily while XELJANZ XR is taken once daily. XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR can be taken with or without food.
For more information, see What is XELJANZ?
  

 If I’m taking XELJANZ XR, will I see something in my stool? 
 When you take XELJANZ XR, you may see something in your stool that looks like a tablet. This is the empty shell from the tablet after the medicine has been absorbed by your body.
  

 What information is important to know when taking XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR? 
 
Take XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR as prescribed by your healthcare provider.
If you take too much XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR, call your healthcare provider or go to the nearest hospital emergency room right away.

You should also take into account the following safety advice:

Keep XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR and all medicines out of the reach of children.
Do not use XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR for a condition for which it was not prescribed.
Do not give XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR to other people, even if they have the same symptoms you have. It may harm them.

For more information, see Safety & Side Effects.
  

 What should I do if I miss a dose?  
 Contact your healthcare provider if you miss a dose or forget to take XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR for an extended period of time.
  

 What should I do if I am not getting the results I expected? 
 Keep in mind that everybody is different. If you are not getting the results you expected, talk with your healthcare provider. Together you can determine if changing your course of treatment might be an appropriate step.
To help you determine how XELJANZ is working, see Tracking Your Progress.
  

 What are some tips for remembering to take XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR? 
 
Create daily reminders—by using your mobile phone or sticky notes—to help you stay on track. When you register for the XELJANZ+You Support Program, you’ll receive sticky notes and other helpful items like an RA-friendly water bottle as a free gift.
Set up alerts to remind you when it’s time to take XELJANZ/XELJANZ XR.
Take XELJANZ with your morning and evening meals or before or after you brush your teeth. Take once-daily XELJANZ XR only in the morning or only in the evening.
