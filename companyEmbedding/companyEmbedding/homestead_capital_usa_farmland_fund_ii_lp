Homestead Capital Closes Oversubscribed Fund II at $400 Million






November 14, 2016 08:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Homestead Capital USA LLC (“Homestead”), a private equity firm investing 
      in operating farmland in the United States, has held a final close of 
      its second fund, Homestead Capital USA Farmland Fund II, L.P. (“Fund 
      II”), at its hard cap of $400 million in limited partner capital 
      commitments, surpassing an original fundraising target of $350 million 
      and more than doubling the size of its debut fund.
    


      “We are very pleased with the support we received from returning 
      investors and the quality of new limited partners that we were able to 
      attract to Fund II. Our investor base spans a broad range of partners 
      including public pension funds, endowments, foundations, insurance 
      companies and fund-of-funds,” said Gabe Santos, a co-founder and 
      portfolio manager of Homestead.
    

      Dan Little, also a co-founder and portfolio manager of Homestead, added, 
      “With the capital from Fund II, we plan to continue to execute on our 
      value-add investment strategy. Because of our local presence and broad 
      agricultural network, we are seeing many attractive investment 
      opportunities in our targeted regions.”
    

      Like its predecessor fund Homestead Capital USA Farmland Fund I, L.P., 
      which owns a portfolio of farms across 11 states producing 16 different 
      crops, Homestead will continue its focus on making row and permanent 
      crop farmland investments in the Mountain West, Pacific, Midwest and 
      Delta regions.
    

      Homestead applies a bottom-up approach to its investment decisions and 
      management by identifying opportunities to create value and is committed 
      to preserving the value of farmland over the long term by adhering to 
      sustainable farm management practices. Homestead also applies a top-down 
      overlay to portfolio construction and risk management in an effort to 
      ensure proper diversification and an appropriate risk and reward profile.
    

      Homestead was represented by Kirkland & Ellis LLP as fund counsel and 
      did not use a placement agent.

 Homestead Capital has announced the final closing of its inaugural farmland investment fund, Homestead Capital USA Farmland Fund I, at $173 million.
California and Iowa-based Homestead Capital USA LLC is a private equity firm with a vertically integrated investment platform focused on investing in operating farmland throughout the Mountain West, Delta, Midwest and Pacific regions of the United States. The fund has already made a cornerstone investment of $60 million throughout all four key regions across eight projects.
The firm’s first fund will target the acquisition of assets across its key regions to build a diversified portfolio consisting of various crops, lease types, farm operators and risk profiles.
 Homestead Capital USA Farmland Fund I has attracted the attention of a varied field of institutional investors including pension funds, endowments, foundations, funds of funds, high net worth individuals and insurance companies.
“We are proud that our first fund has generated such strong interest from established institutional investors,” said Daniel Little, managing partner of portfolio construction at Homestead Capital in a company statement. “It reflects growing investor interest in farmland as an asset class and the opportunity it offers to produce attractive, risk-adjusted returns and act as a portfolio diversifier and hedge against inflation.”
“Our unique approach to farmland investing pairs on-the-ground, local farm management expertise with more than half a century of combined investment, acquisition and asset management experience,” explained Gabe Santos, managing partner and head of acquisitions and structuring at Homestead. “Our local networks and national scope allow us to employ a bottom-up strategy in our deal sourcing, to ensure access to a wealth of investment opportunities with the highest risk-reward profiles.”

Homestead Capital USA LLC has acquired Sage Creek Vineyard, a vineyard located in Napa County’s Chiles Valley. No financial terms were disclosed. Dickenson, Peatman & Fogarty provided acquisition advice for Homestead.
PRESS RELEASE
SAN FRANCISCO–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Homestead Capital USA LLC (“Homestead”), a private equity firm investing in operating farmland in the United States, announced today that it has completed the acquisition of an 105-acre vineyard in the Chiles Valley of Napa County. Homestead will continue the vineyard’s heritage as an independent wine grape grower, providing high quality fruit to Napa Valley wineries. The vineyard is planted to primarily Cabernet Sauvignon and Sauvignon Blanc, but also includes small blocks of other red Bordeaux varieties.
“We are very excited to add the Sage Creek Vineyard to our permanent crop portfolio. The vineyard’s location in the Napa Valley American Viticultural Area provides us with a unique opportunity to establish a platform property focused on meeting the needs of high-end Napa Valley wineries,” said Alex Sauer, Vice President of Permanent Crops for Homestead.
The acquisition further expands Homestead’s presence in the wine grape industry, following its December 2015 acquisition of a 284.7-acre vineyard located in the Santa Maria Valley of Santa Barbara County, and a vineyard producing Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, and Syrah in Eastern Washington.
The vineyard was sourced by Richard Brockmeyer, one of Homestead’s Pacific Region Farm Managers, who will continue in a management role with the property. Dickenson, Peatman & Fogarty acted as acquisition counsel for Homestead.
In November 2016, Homestead held a final close of its second fund, Homestead Capital USA Farmland Fund II, L.P., at its hard cap of $400 million in limited partner capital commitments.

PRESS RELEASE
SAN FRANCISCO–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Homestead Capital USA LLC (“Homestead”), a private equity firm investing in operating farmland in the United States, has held a final close of its second fund, Homestead Capital USA Farmland Fund II, L.P. (“Fund II”), at its hard cap of $400 million in limited partner capital commitments, surpassing an original fundraising target of $350 million and more than doubling the size of its debut fund.
“We are very pleased with the support we received from returning investors and the quality of new limited partners that we were able to attract to Fund II. Our investor base spans a broad range of partners including public pension funds, endowments, foundations, insurance companies and fund-of-funds,” said Gabe Santos, a co-founder and portfolio manager of Homestead.
Dan Little, also a co-founder and portfolio manager of Homestead, added, “With the capital from Fund II, we plan to continue to execute on our value-add investment strategy. Because of our local presence and broad agricultural network, we are seeing many attractive investment opportunities in our targeted regions.” 





Like its predecessor fund Homestead Capital USA Farmland Fund I, L.P., which owns a portfolio of farms across 11 states producing 16 different crops, Homestead will continue its focus on making row and permanent crop farmland investments in the Mountain West, Pacific, Midwest and Delta regions.
Homestead applies a bottom-up approach to its investment decisions and management by identifying opportunities to create value and is committed to preserving the value of farmland over the long term by adhering to sustainable farm management practices. Homestead also applies a top-down overlay to portfolio construction and risk management in an effort to ensure proper diversification and an appropriate risk and reward profile.
Homestead was represented by Kirkland & Ellis LLP as fund counsel and did not use a placement agent.

Approach – Homestead Capital















































				            	 Approach
				            


HomeApproach









Homestead’s local presence, experience and knowledge form the basis of its bottom-up approach to sourcing, underwriting and managing its farmland investments





The Homestead Capital Difference











Diversified Portfolio
Homestead manages a diversified portfolio of high quality farmland throughout the U.S. across regions, crops, lease types, farm operators and certain other risk factors. We focus on acquisitions where opportunities for value creation exist through: (i) capital improvements, (ii) improved farm management, (iii) economies of scale, (iv) efficient crop selection and rotation, and (v) customized farm operating strategies.













Bottom-Up Approach
Our investment approach pairs a bottom-up approach to sourcing and value creation driven by our locally based regional farmland managers with a top-down portfolio construction and risk management framework to ensure proper diversification and an appropriate risk and reward profile at the portfolio level.













Unique Platform
We utilize a proprietary software platform for modeling asset returns, taking into account commodity prices, yields, soil quality, climate patterns, and numerous other inputs. This platform enables Homestead to manage concentration risk at the portfolio level and stress test the portfolio against various risk factors.
