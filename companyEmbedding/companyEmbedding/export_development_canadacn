History[edit]
In 1944, the Export Credits Insurance Act was proclaimed. Export Credit Insurance Corporation (ECIC) was created following WWII to help stimulate the Canadian economy, create jobs and help Canadian exporters. The Export Development Act proclaimed on October 1, 1969, repealed Part 1 of the Export Credits Insurance Act and established the Export Development Corporation (EDC) as successor to all property, rights, and obligations.[9] In 2001, EDC changed its name from Export Development Corporation to Export Development Canada[10]
Operations[edit]
EDC operates at arm's length from the federal government and according to commercial principles. EDC's mandate is spelled out in the Export Development Act. In response to the global credit crunch, in 2009 the Government of Canada broadened EDC's mandate and scope of activity for a two-year period to include support for domestic trade and domestic business opportunities. The period was extended to March 12, 2014.[11]
The Corporation is financially self-sustaining. EDC raises funds by charging fees for its services and interest on its loans, as well as issuing debt in capital markets.
EDC operates according to a Corporate Plan approved annually by the federal government, and its Operating Principles dictate that it conducts its business in a manner that is respectful of applicable international agreements to which Canada is a party; is consistent with its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) commitments; and ensures the sound financial management of its activities.[12]
EDC publishes an online magazine for Canadian Exporters, ExportWise (Exportateurs avertis in French).
In 2011, EDC and BDC (Business Development Bank of Canada) announced the signing of a new protocol to coordinate collaborative efforts between the two Crown corporations to better benefit Canadian businesses.[13]

History[edit]
In 1944, the Export Credits Insurance Act was proclaimed. Export Credit Insurance Corporation (ECIC) was created following WWII to help stimulate the Canadian economy, create jobs and help Canadian exporters. The Export Development Act proclaimed on October 1, 1969, repealed Part 1 of the Export Credits Insurance Act and established the Export Development Corporation (EDC) as successor to all property, rights, and obligations.[9] In 2001, EDC changed its name from Export Development Corporation to Export Development Canada[10]
Operations[edit]
EDC operates at arm's length from the federal government and according to commercial principles. EDC's mandate is spelled out in the Export Development Act. In response to the global credit crunch, in 2009 the Government of Canada broadened EDC's mandate and scope of activity for a two-year period to include support for domestic trade and domestic business opportunities. The period was extended to March 12, 2014.[11]
The Corporation is financially self-sustaining. EDC raises funds by charging fees for its services and interest on its loans, as well as issuing debt in capital markets.
EDC operates according to a Corporate Plan approved annually by the federal government, and its Operating Principles dictate that it conducts its business in a manner that is respectful of applicable international agreements to which Canada is a party; is consistent with its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) commitments; and ensures the sound financial management of its activities.[12]
EDC publishes an online magazine for Canadian Exporters, ExportWise (Exportateurs avertis in French).
In 2011, EDC and BDC (Business Development Bank of Canada) announced the signing of a new protocol to coordinate collaborative efforts between the two Crown corporations to better benefit Canadian businesses.[13]
In addition to the Ottawa headquarters, EDC operates from 18 regional offices in Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, Calgary, Halifax, etc., as well as representation abroad including China, Brazil, Germany, South Africa, Singapore, United States, and more.

Export Development Canada Sets Up New and First Financing Branch in Singapore
Mar 24 17
Export Development Canada (EDC) announced its new and first global branch outside of Canada, in Singapore. EDC’s new branch will bring its global-scale financing business closer to projects and companies across Asia, ASEAN, and Oceania by negotiating and underwriting its financing from Singapore. The new Singapore branch is expected to play an important role in doubling EDC’s loan bookings by 2021, when it hopes to be providing over USD 4 billion in new commercial financing annually. EDC’s focus will be developing financing relationships with corporations and project owners across the region that may already have Canadian suppliers, or where there is potential for future Canadian supply. EDC can also support Canadian foreign investment and foreign investment into Canada where there is a direct link to Canadian exports. In addition, EDC will actively pursue opportunities to partner with commercial banks within club and syndicated financing facilities of select corporations across Asia and Oceania.

History[edit]
In 1944, the Export Credits Insurance Act was proclaimed. Export Credit Insurance Corporation (ECIC) was created following WWII to help stimulate the Canadian economy, create jobs and help Canadian exporters. The Export Development Act proclaimed on October 1, 1969, repealed Part 1 of the Export Credits Insurance Act and established the Export Development Corporation (EDC) as successor to all property, rights, and obligations.[9] In 2001, EDC changed its name from Export Development Corporation to Export Development Canada[10]
Operations[edit]
EDC operates at arm's length from the federal government and according to commercial principles. EDC's mandate is spelled out in the Export Development Act. In response to the global credit crunch, in 2009 the Government of Canada broadened EDC's mandate and scope of activity for a two-year period to include support for domestic trade and domestic business opportunities. The period was extended to March 12, 2014.[11]
The Corporation is financially self-sustaining. EDC raises funds by charging fees for its services and interest on its loans, as well as issuing debt in capital markets.
EDC operates according to a Corporate Plan approved annually by the federal government, and its Operating Principles dictate that it conducts its business in a manner that is respectful of applicable international agreements to which Canada is a party; is consistent with its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) commitments; and ensures the sound financial management of its activities.[12]
EDC publishes an online magazine for Canadian Exporters, ExportWise (Exportateurs avertis in French).
In 2011, EDC and BDC (Business Development Bank of Canada) announced the signing of a new protocol to coordinate collaborative efforts between the two Crown corporations to better benefit Canadian businesses.[13]
In addition to the Ottawa headquarters, EDC operates from 18 regional offices in Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, Calgary, Halifax, etc., as well as representation abroad including China, Brazil, Germany, South Africa, Singapore, United States, and more.

Corporate social responsibility[edit]
Corporate social responsibility is an operating principle at EDC,[16] as demonstrated through the continuing partnership with CARE Canada.[17] as well as various awards and recognitions given to the company (See Awards and recognitions section).
Youth Education Program[18] – International Business Scholarships: EDC awards up to 30 scholarships annually, 25 of which go to undergraduate university or college students interested in pursuing a career or furthering their studies in international business, with up to 5 additional scholarships for students in programs which combine business with environmental or sustainability studies. An EDC scholarship is worth a $4,000 cash award.
Events by EDC[edit]
EDC participates in many events, both their own hosted and partnered events, including conferences, webinars, matchmaking sessions, and roundtable discussions.
Notable EDC events include:
Lets Talk Exports: Each spring, EDC’s Vice-President and Chief Economist travels across Canada to share his view on the global economy.[19]
Global Export Forecast: EDC’s Vice-President & Chief Economist provides attendees an insightful look at what Canadian exporters and investors may expect for the upcoming year. The Global Export Forecast is produced twice per year in April and October.[20]
Awards and recognitions[edit]

History[edit]
In 1944, the Export Credits Insurance Act was proclaimed. Export Credit Insurance Corporation (ECIC) was created following WWII to help stimulate the Canadian economy, create jobs and help Canadian exporters. The Export Development Act proclaimed on October 1, 1969, repealed Part 1 of the Export Credits Insurance Act and established the Export Development Corporation (EDC) as successor to all property, rights, and obligations.[9] In 2001, EDC changed its name from Export Development Corporation to Export Development Canada[10]
Operations[edit]
EDC operates at arm's length from the federal government and according to commercial principles. EDC's mandate is spelled out in the Export Development Act. In response to the global credit crunch, in 2009 the Government of Canada broadened EDC's mandate and scope of activity for a two-year period to include support for domestic trade and domestic business opportunities. The period was extended to March 12, 2014.[11]
The Corporation is financially self-sustaining. EDC raises funds by charging fees for its services and interest on its loans, as well as issuing debt in capital markets.
EDC operates according to a Corporate Plan approved annually by the federal government, and its Operating Principles dictate that it conducts its business in a manner that is respectful of applicable international agreements to which Canada is a party; is consistent with its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) commitments; and ensures the sound financial management of its activities.[12]
EDC publishes an online magazine for Canadian Exporters, ExportWise (Exportateurs avertis in French).
In 2011, EDC and BDC (Business Development Bank of Canada) announced the signing of a new protocol to coordinate collaborative efforts between the two Crown corporations to better benefit Canadian businesses.[13]
In addition to the Ottawa headquarters, EDC operates from 18 regional offices in Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, Calgary, Halifax, etc., as well as representation abroad including China, Brazil, Germany, South Africa, Singapore, United States, and more.

Corporate social responsibility[edit]
Corporate social responsibility is an operating principle at EDC,[16] as demonstrated through the continuing partnership with CARE Canada.[17] as well as various awards and recognitions given to the company (See Awards and recognitions section).
Youth Education Program[18] – International Business Scholarships: EDC awards up to 30 scholarships annually, 25 of which go to undergraduate university or college students interested in pursuing a career or furthering their studies in international business, with up to 5 additional scholarships for students in programs which combine business with environmental or sustainability studies. An EDC scholarship is worth a $4,000 cash award.
Events by EDC[edit]
EDC participates in many events, both their own hosted and partnered events, including conferences, webinars, matchmaking sessions, and roundtable discussions.
Notable EDC events include:
Lets Talk Exports: Each spring, EDC’s Vice-President and Chief Economist travels across Canada to share his view on the global economy.[19]
Global Export Forecast: EDC’s Vice-President & Chief Economist provides attendees an insightful look at what Canadian exporters and investors may expect for the upcoming year. The Global Export Forecast is produced twice per year in April and October.[20]

	About Us
	









Page ContentWho are we?
We are Canada’s export credit agency. Our job is to support and develop Canada’s export trade by helping Canadian companies respond to international business opportunities. We are a self-financing, Crown corporation that operates at arm's length from the Government. Our new subsidiary, Development Finance Institution, will be a specialized financial institution whose role is to support the growth and success of developing economies.
What do we do?
We provide insurance and financial services, bonding products and small business solutions to Canadian exporters and investors and their international buyers. We also support Canadian direct investment abroad and investment into Canada. Much of our business is done in partnership with other financial institutions and through collaboration with the Government of Canada.















How we operate
Unlike most export credit agencies that rely on governmental annual appropriations, we are financially self-sufficient and operate much like a commercial institution. We collect interest on our loans and premiums on our insurance products. We also have a treasury department that sells bonds and raises money in global capital markets.
We are committed to the principles of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Our rigorous due diligence requirements ensure that all projects and transactions we support are financially, environmentally and socially responsible. We believe that good business — adopting and embracing these principles while we facilitate trade for Canadian investors and exporters — is good for business.

Page Content 3Benefits to Canada
Since we were founded in 1944, we have facilitated more than $1.3 trillion in exports and foreign investment by Canadian companies. This is important because Canada’s economy relies on trade; one in three jobs depends on exports. Given our small domestic market, Canadian businesses have to think globally to compete and grow.
In 2016 we helped more than 7,150 Canadian companies do business in over 200 countries. The majority of these companies were small business, and more than 30 per cent of this business was conducted in fast-growing emerging markets. Using our financial products and services, our customers’ export sales and investments totalled almost $99 billion. We estimate that this helped generate $63.9 billion of Canada’s GDP, contributed more than 4 cents for every dollar earned and helped sustain 525,400 jobs.
Making the connections to create trade
Critical to Canada’s trade success is the ability for Canadian companies, particularly SMEs, to make a connection with international buyers. But many of these companies do not have the size or visibility to make that happen, particularly in emerging markets. One of EDC’s strategies is to help make these connections through match-making sessions with the Canadian Trade Commissioners’ Service, through our equity investments and by leveraging our financial relationships with foreign buyers to encourage them to procure from Canadian suppliers. This strategy is particularly geared toward helping Canadian small-and medium-sized business grow internationally.
Partnership preferred philosophy
When we work on a transaction, we prefer to do it in explicit partnership with the private sector. We let the private sector player set the terms and we add capacity and share the risk. This encourages the private sector to move into new areas, leaving us to move to new frontiers to create new trade for Canada.
We have also signed a protocol with the Business Development Bank of Canada (BDC), to ensure that Canadian companies looking to expand their business in global markets have access to the services and financial capacity that best suit their needs. The protocol aims to improve the coordination between our two Crown corporations by placing more emphasis on guiding new customers towards the core strengths of each organization.
We also work closely with the Canadian Commercial Corporation. Our two organizations work together in the international trade space and continue to look for new areas of collaboration with a goal of continuing to improve our overall service to Canadian companies.

EDC was founded in 1944. Its corporate headquarters is located in Ottawa and has 17 regional offices across Canada and permanent representations in 12 foreign markets.[7][8]

History[edit]
In 1944, the Export Credits Insurance Act was proclaimed. Export Credit Insurance Corporation (ECIC) was created following WWII to help stimulate the Canadian economy, create jobs and help Canadian exporters. The Export Development Act proclaimed on October 1, 1969, repealed Part 1 of the Export Credits Insurance Act and established the Export Development Corporation (EDC) as successor to all property, rights, and obligations.[9] In 2001, EDC changed its name from Export Development Corporation to Export Development Canada[10]
Operations[edit]
EDC operates at arm's length from the federal government and according to commercial principles. EDC's mandate is spelled out in the Export Development Act. In response to the global credit crunch, in 2009 the Government of Canada broadened EDC's mandate and scope of activity for a two-year period to include support for domestic trade and domestic business opportunities. The period was extended to March 12, 2014.[11]
The Corporation is financially self-sustaining. EDC raises funds by charging fees for its services and interest on its loans, as well as issuing debt in capital markets.
EDC operates according to a Corporate Plan approved annually by the federal government, and its Operating Principles dictate that it conducts its business in a manner that is respectful of applicable international agreements to which Canada is a party; is consistent with its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) commitments; and ensures the sound financial management of its activities.[12]
EDC publishes an online magazine for Canadian Exporters, ExportWise (Exportateurs avertis in French).
In 2011, EDC and BDC (Business Development Bank of Canada) announced the signing of a new protocol to coordinate collaborative efforts between the two Crown corporations to better benefit Canadian businesses.[13]
In addition to the Ottawa headquarters, EDC operates from 18 regional offices in Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, Calgary, Halifax, etc., as well as representation abroad including China, Brazil, Germany, South Africa, Singapore, United States, and more.

Corporate social responsibility[edit]
Corporate social responsibility is an operating principle at EDC,[16] as demonstrated through the continuing partnership with CARE Canada.[17] as well as various awards and recognitions given to the company (See Awards and recognitions section).
Youth Education Program[18] – International Business Scholarships: EDC awards up to 30 scholarships annually, 25 of which go to undergraduate university or college students interested in pursuing a career or furthering their studies in international business, with up to 5 additional scholarships for students in programs which combine business with environmental or sustainability studies. An EDC scholarship is worth a $4,000 cash award.
Events by EDC[edit]
EDC participates in many events, both their own hosted and partnered events, including conferences, webinars, matchmaking sessions, and roundtable discussions.
Notable EDC events include:
Lets Talk Exports: Each spring, EDC’s Vice-President and Chief Economist travels across Canada to share his view on the global economy.[19]
Global Export Forecast: EDC’s Vice-President & Chief Economist provides attendees an insightful look at what Canadian exporters and investors may expect for the upcoming year. The Global Export Forecast is produced twice per year in April and October.[20]
Awards and recognitions[edit]

Also in 2013, EDC has won two Gold Quill Awards from the International Association of Business Communicators (IABC) for its 2012 Employee Conference and for Link Magazine, its internal employee magazine.[23]

Its mandate is to support and develop trade between Canada and other countries and Canada's competitiveness in the international market-place.[3] EDC products and services include trade credit insurance, export financing for Canadian companies and for their foreign customers, bonding solutions, international market expertise, as well as information on opportunities in international markets.[4][5][6]
EDC was founded in 1944. Its corporate headquarters is located in Ottawa and has 17 regional offices across Canada and permanent representations in 12 foreign markets.[7][8]

History[edit]
In 1944, the Export Credits Insurance Act was proclaimed. Export Credit Insurance Corporation (ECIC) was created following WWII to help stimulate the Canadian economy, create jobs and help Canadian exporters. The Export Development Act proclaimed on October 1, 1969, repealed Part 1 of the Export Credits Insurance Act and established the Export Development Corporation (EDC) as successor to all property, rights, and obligations.[9] In 2001, EDC changed its name from Export Development Corporation to Export Development Canada[10]
Operations[edit]
EDC operates at arm's length from the federal government and according to commercial principles. EDC's mandate is spelled out in the Export Development Act. In response to the global credit crunch, in 2009 the Government of Canada broadened EDC's mandate and scope of activity for a two-year period to include support for domestic trade and domestic business opportunities. The period was extended to March 12, 2014.[11]
The Corporation is financially self-sustaining. EDC raises funds by charging fees for its services and interest on its loans, as well as issuing debt in capital markets.
EDC operates according to a Corporate Plan approved annually by the federal government, and its Operating Principles dictate that it conducts its business in a manner that is respectful of applicable international agreements to which Canada is a party; is consistent with its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) commitments; and ensures the sound financial management of its activities.[12]
EDC publishes an online magazine for Canadian Exporters, ExportWise (Exportateurs avertis in French).
In 2011, EDC and BDC (Business Development Bank of Canada) announced the signing of a new protocol to coordinate collaborative efforts between the two Crown corporations to better benefit Canadian businesses.[13]
In addition to the Ottawa headquarters, EDC operates from 18 regional offices in Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, Calgary, Halifax, etc., as well as representation abroad including China, Brazil, Germany, South Africa, Singapore, United States, and more.

Services[edit]
EDC provides trade credit insurance and export financial services, bonding products and small business solutions to Canadian exporters and investors and their international buyers.

Governance[edit]

The Board reports to Parliament through the Minister for International Trade. Board members are appointed by the Government of Canada.[15]
EDC's Board of Directors provides oversight for the Corporation's overall Corporate Social Responsibility orientation. This program includes environmental, human rights and political risk assessments for each transaction being considered.

Corporate social responsibility[edit]
Corporate social responsibility is an operating principle at EDC,[16] as demonstrated through the continuing partnership with CARE Canada.[17] as well as various awards and recognitions given to the company (See Awards and recognitions section).
Youth Education Program[18] – International Business Scholarships: EDC awards up to 30 scholarships annually, 25 of which go to undergraduate university or college students interested in pursuing a career or furthering their studies in international business, with up to 5 additional scholarships for students in programs which combine business with environmental or sustainability studies. An EDC scholarship is worth a $4,000 cash award.
Events by EDC[edit]
EDC participates in many events, both their own hosted and partnered events, including conferences, webinars, matchmaking sessions, and roundtable discussions.
Notable EDC events include:
Lets Talk Exports: Each spring, EDC’s Vice-President and Chief Economist travels across Canada to share his view on the global economy.[19]
Global Export Forecast: EDC’s Vice-President & Chief Economist provides attendees an insightful look at what Canadian exporters and investors may expect for the upcoming year. The Global Export Forecast is produced twice per year in April and October.[20]
Awards and recognitions[edit]
EDC was listed as one of Canada's Top 100 Employers by Mediacorp Canada, 2017. The national competition recognizes Canadian employers that lead their industries in offering exceptional workplaces for their employers, grading businesses in eight key areas, including: physical workspace; work atmosphere and social, performance management, and health, financial and family benefits.
EDC has also been identified as the eighth top sustainability performer in Canada, according to the 2017 publication of Future 40 Responsible Corporate Leaders by Corporate Knights.[21]
EDC was recognized as Best Global Export Credit Agency by Trade Finance at its 2016 Annual Trade Finance and Global Awards ceremony held in London UK, March 16, 2016.
EDC received the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada's 2015 Award of Excellence in Financial Reporting – Federal Crown (Large).
In January 2013, the head office for EDC located in downtown Ottawa was granted LEED for Core and Shell (CS) Gold certification by the Canadian Green Building Council[22] . Also in 2013, EDC has won two Gold Quill Awards from the International Association of Business Communicators (IABC) for its 2012 Employee Conference and for Link Magazine, its internal employee magazine.[23]
EDC's productions have also garnered much recognition.

What problem do you solve?
We provide insurance and financial services, bonding products to Canadian exporters and investors and their international buyers. We also support Canadian direct investment abroad and investment into Canada. EDC can also leverage its global network to facilitate introductions between Canadian companies and foreign companies.
What is your solution (product, software, service) and what differentiates it from the competition? 
We are Canada’s export credit agency. Our job is to support and develop Canada’s export trade by helping Canadian companies respond to international business opportunities. We are a self-financing, Crown corporation that operates at arm's length from the Government. Unlike most export credit agencies that rely on governmental annual appropriations, we are financially self-sufficient and operate much like a commercial institution. We collect interest on our loans and premiums on our insurance products.

We are committed to the principles of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Our rigorous due diligence requirements ensure that all projects and transactions we support are financially, environmentally and socially responsible.
