Disclaimer1Please refer to the prospectus for additional information about cut-off times. Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The Fund's adviser and/or its affiliates have contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses to the extent Total Annual Fund Operating Expenses (excluding acquired fund fees and expenses, dividend and interest expenses related to short sales, interest, taxes, expenses related to litigation and potential litigation and extraordinary expenses) exceed  of the average daily net assets. The Fund may invest in one or more money market funds advised by the adviser or its affiliates (affiliated money market funds). The Fund's adviser has contractually agreed to waive fees and/or reimburse expenses in an amount sufficient to offset the fees and expenses of the affiliated money market funds incurred by the Fund because of the Fund's investment in such money market funds. This waiver is in effect through , at which time the adviser and/or its affiliates will determine whether to renew or revise it. The difference between net and gross fees includes all applicable fee waivers and expense reimbursements. Mutual funds have fees that reduce their performance: indexes do not. You cannot invest directly in an index. The Bloomberg Barclays U.S. MBS Index covers the mortgage-backed pass-through securities of Ginnie Mae (GNMA), Fannie Mae (FNMA), and Freddie Mac (FHLMC). The performance of the Lipper U.S. Mortgage Funds Index includes expenses associated with a mutual fund, such as investment management fees. These expenses are not identical to the expenses charged by the Fund. Total return figures (for the fund and any index quoted) assume payment of fees and reinvestment of dividends (after the highest applicable foreign withholding tax) and distributions. Without fee waivers, fund returns would have been lower. Due to rounding, some values may not total 100%. Â©2017, American Bankers Association, CUSIP Database provided by the Standard & Poor's CUSIP Service Bureau, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. All rights reserved.The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10- year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.Rankings do not take sales loads into account.The following risks could cause the fund to lose money or perform more poorly than other investments. For more complete risk information, see the prospectus. CMOs are collateralized mortgage obligations, which are issued in multiple classes, and each class may have its own interest rate and/or final payment date. A class with an earlier final payment date may have certain preferences in receiving principal payments or earning interest. As a result, the value of some classes may be more volatile and may be subject to higher risk of nonpayment.Total return assumes reinvestment of income. The top 10 holdings listed reflect only the Fund's long-term investments. Short-term investments are excluded. Holdings are subject to change. The holdings listed should not be considered recommendations to purchase or sell a particular security. Each individual security is calculated as a percentage of the aggregate market value of the securities held in the Fund and does not include the use of derivative positions, where applicable.

Wells Fargo Mortgage Loans Review 2017

Finding the Right Mortgage, Mortgages




You can trust that we maintain strict editorial integrity in our writing and assessments; however, we receive compensation when you click on links to products from our partners and get approved. Here's how we make money.

Wells Fargo Mortgage is the 800-pound gorilla of home loans. But standing next to this gorilla is a big elephant in the room.
Wells Fargo has been the leading originator and servicer of residential mortgages for 24 out of the past 25 years. The bank has a loan product selection that is long and wide. Last year, it financed one of every eight home loans in America.
‘We’re not a perfect company. We made a mistake’
But in 2016, Wells Fargo suffered a costly and embarrassing corporate setback. After news spread that thousands of employees set up as many as 2 million unauthorized customer accounts in a five-year cross-selling scheme, the bank is struggling to regain consumer confidence.
And on Oct. 2016, Wells Fargo agreed to pay a $50 million settlement in a class-action lawsuit alleging the bank overcharged 250,000 customers for mortgage appraisal fees.
“Wells Fargo is a great company, and it’s been a great company for over 160 years,” says Greg Gwizdz, national sales manager for Wells Fargo Home Mortgage. “But we’re not a perfect company. We made a mistake. And I think it has been well documented that we have made corrections based on that mistake.”
He says the bank has changed its compensation policies, given refunds to customers, reviewed sales practices and “taken steps to change the organization to make sure that that doesn’t happen again.”
If you’re considering Wells Fargo Home Mortgage, here’s what you need to know.



NerdWallet is a free tool to find you the best credit cards, cd rates, savings, checking accounts, scholarships, healthcare and airlines. Start here to maximize your rewards or minimize your interest rates.
Hal M. Bundrick, CFP



NerdWallet's rating: 3.5 / 5


AT A GLANCEA full range of traditional and specialty mortgages.Minimum credit score of 620, though alternative credit data may be considered for certain loan products.A first-time homebuyer program allows down payments as low as 3% plus “expanded credit criteria.”




Get started 





Compare Wells Fargo with other lenders.
A full product mortgage lender
Wells Fargo offers the extended list of mortgage products you’d expect from a “big box” lender. Beyond conventional mortgages, home equity lines of credit and government loans from the Federal Housing Administration, Veterans Affairs and Department of Agriculture, Wells Fargo Mortgage offers:

Jumbo loans on up to 89.9% of a home’s value, with support provided by a specialized private mortgage banking team.
Renovation loans, with financing based on after-home-improvement value built into purchase or refi loans.
New construction home loans, with options for an extended rate lock during the building period.
Relocation and employee mortgage programs for many large companies.
A loan program with special benefits for eligible union members.

The Union Plus Mortgage program is available to 59 national and international labor unions and 30,000 local unions. Participants get a $500 award card on a purchase loan or a $300 award card on a refinance. “If you [become] disabled, unemployed or your union goes on strike, you can apply for a grant and interest-free loan to make your mortgage payment,” Gwizdz says.
Programs for first-time or declined homebuyers
Wells Fargo’s yourFirst Mortgage offers down payments as low as 3% on fixed-rate mortgages, expanded credit criteria and incentives for homebuyer education.
“From a credit perspective, this would be [considering] things like utility bills and other forms of credit, in addition to just a standard credit report,” Gwizdz says. “And we provide an eighth lower interest rate (0.125%) if consumers go through our homebuyer education classes.”
Gwizdz says these classes aren’t for learning about mortgages and the mortgage process. “It’s really learning about being a homeowner and understanding everything that comes with that: the taxes and the insurance and the maintenance — and saving money because, guess what, the furnace is going to break, and the roof is going to leak.”
Meanwhile, the My Home Roadmap program offers free credit counseling for customers who have been turned down for credit or have decided not to apply for a mortgage. It offers a referral for up to two hours of free counseling with a certified credit counselor to discuss your situation.

Wells Fargo mortgage process
You can’t get a prequalification or complete a mortgage application online at Wells Fargo. While the bank’s website offers some affordability tools, educational videos and national mortgage rates, that’s pretty much as far as you can go online.
Once you’re ready to make an application, you can sign into yourLoanTracker, the online bridge between you and your Wells Fargo Mortgage loan advisor. After you apply in person or over the phone, this is where you can track your application’s status and exchange information and documents via computer or mobile device. There are also e-signature capabilities.
Even though the lending process and timeline are typical, the online interface can save a lot of the time you otherwise might spend on taking or mailing documents to a loan office.
Gwizdz says technology upgrades are in the works, with “full online capabilities” coming soon.

What Wells Fargo does best

Wells Fargo offers a deep product bench for borrowers at every financial stage in life.
Specialty loan programs target first-time homebuyers, union members and others.
While some other large banks are growing wary of mortgage lending, Wells Fargo maintains a dominant position.

Where Wells Fargo falls short

Borrowers can’t yet apply for a mortgage online.
With a long list of government actions, the embattled bank has an uphill climb to regain consumer trust.

Wells Fargo has a world-class selection of mortgage products and deep resources for customers to draw upon, but the fact remains that this bank has a lot of baggage. While employees are putting on brave faces and working to regain trust, homebuyers may find it hard to put their largest purchase in the hands of Wells Fargo Mortgage.
“What I say to my team is, ‘At this point, our actions have to speak louder than our words,'” Gwizdz says. “And all we can do is continue to provide great service to all of our customers and give it some time, and we believe we’ll win back the trust of our customers. But we have to earn it back.”

NerdWallet’s star ratings for mortgage lenders are awarded based on our evaluation of the products and services that lenders offer to consumers who are actively shopping for the best mortgage. The six key areas we evaluated include the loan types and loan products offered, online capabilities, online mortgage rate information, customer service and the number of complaints filed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau as a percentage of loans issued. We also awarded lenders up to one bonus star for a unique program or borrower focus that set them apart from other lenders. To ensure consistency, our ratings are reviewed by multiple people on the NerdWallet Mortgages team.

Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
