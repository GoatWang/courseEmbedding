scope blocks






		SCOPE BLOCKS






Pricing change November 2016 - in addition to a slight 
		price increase, mount screws are now included in all block prices.

Scope blocks are available in many configurations and 
		heights.  The list below shows the more common, in-stock items.

Blocks are unhardened, black-oxide finished, and for 
		both round and octagonal barrels, unless 
		otherwise specified.  

Hole spacing is .560" front and .860" rear, unless noted.

Prices are for individual blocks, except for Springfield 
		blocks which are priced as a set.
Shipping is $5.00 
		for the first set, $1.00 more for each additional set.
		 
		 
On-line ordering of scope blocks may be problematic due 
		to the vast range available.  Consequently, I am going to 
		stay with email or phone ordering.
		 
Please note that this product line is all directed 
		towards the 60° dovetail, external-adjustment type of scopes.

I do not currently carry any products for the "modern" Weaver or Picatinny sort of mounts.



Additional scope block 
		information...I certainly do not claim to know everything in this 
		field, but with experience, many trends have become visible.  With 
		that said, the following information is provided, but is open for 
		correction or rebuttal!
Traditional scope blocks often seem to be described as 
		either "3/8 inch wide" or "1/2 inch wide."  In fact they are 
		neither, although 1/2" is close.  Original Unertl dovetails 
		(the rings, not the blocks) generally measure .494" to a theoretical sharp corner.  This 
		matches the older Winchester A5 scope mount dimensions.  MVA has 
		told me that they cut their mounts to .484" to a sharp corner, which is 
		slightly smaller.  It's a theoretical number because due to the 
		wear of the cutter, or even the wire EDM radius, a perfectly sharp inside corner on 
		the mount is 
		almost never achieved.  This is why if the block has a 
		perfectly sharp corner, it is not a good situation - it would hang up on that small 
		non-sharp inside corner of the mount.  Additionally, because these 
		"corners" may not actually exist, measuring an existing scope block or a mount by going 
		across the corners may not give a truly useful dimension.
The solution for these issues is two things.  
		First, the scope block width must be slightly narrower than the mount 
		that it's intended to fit.  And second, the sharp corner of the 
		block should be knocked off.  The standard blocks I make are 
		targeted to .482" across the sharp corner.  But the actual top 
		width will be .465", which gives an intentional small flat, allowing for 
		non-sharp-cornered mounts or even dirt in the corners.  It also 
		makes the edge must less susceptible to damage.
Hole spacings for scope blocks are mostly standardized 
		(although slightly odd) dimensions.  Since about 1920 or so, they 
		seem to have been set at .560" front and .860" rear, with holes tapped 
		6-48.  Sometimes the .560" is .562" - I have old charts which show 
		both.  Realistically that .002" difference is not significant.  
		There are numerous exceptions to these rules, however.  Older 
		original Stevens rifles (pre-model 414 rifles) were often drilled at 
		.700" front and .825" rear, with 5-40 holes.  I have encountered a 
		handful of rifles where the rear holes are spaced .875" (7/8") rather 
		than .860".  (In fact, a tape-measure examination of .860"-spaced 
		holes will frequently lead to the conclusion that they are spaced at 
		7/8", which is only rarely true.)  Sometimes rifles have been 
		drilled for Weaver-type mounts, and then the holes may be spaced either 
		.500" or .504".  Remington 40X and 700-series rifles have a spacing 
		on the rear ring of .600".  And a recently-discovered Remington 
		513T oddity is that the factory holes are not 6-48; they are 6-44's.  
		Kimber 82G has a front sight (at the muzzle) hole spacing of .500".
Note regarding CUSTOM BLOCKS OR SIGHT 
		MOUNTS - as of June 2017.  
		Continuing the need to suspend making odd 
		blocks as one-of-a-kind items.  I hope to continue to 
		provide black-finished, standard height and length blocks with odd hole spacings.
Thanks for reading!  



Standard mounts Vs. Posa mounts - how 
		to tell the difference...




The mount and blocks on the left of 
		the picture are standard Unertl mounts.

		 

    - The mount is not 
		split - it's solid all the way around.

    - The clamping 
		thumbnut has a cup-shaped end and is of one diameter.

    - The clamping nut 
		pushes against one side of the block.

    - The block has a 
		shallow crescent cut (also called a thumbnail or smiley cut).

		 

		 

		 

The parts to the right are the Unertl 
		"Posa" style.

		 

    - The mount is 
		split or saw-cut through and squeezes onto the block.

    - The thumbnut is 
		square-ended and has two different diameters.

    - The nut pulls 
		the mount together and does NOT bottom out in the locking cut.

    - The block has a 
		much deeper square-bottomed cut.

		 

Redfield 3200 scopes can use a 
		standard block for the rimfire mount, but require a 

Posa-type block for the "big-bore" 
		mount.  The only difference is the clamp screw itself.


 


 






Standard
 

Standard blocks are available in heights of 3/16", 1/4", 
		5/16", 3/8", 7/16", 1/2", 5/8", 3/4", and 1".  The base has a 
		slight concavity which allows them to mount on either a round or an 
		octagonal barrel.  Heights are measured from a flat surface.  
		They will sit .005" to .018" lower on a round barrel.  They have the 
		Lyman/Unertl crescent on one side and the Winchester dimple on 
		the other.
 
Price: $18.00 
		each; 5/8" and taller $21.00 each






Flat-bottom
 

Flat-bottom blocks are specifically for mounting on an 
		octagonal barrel.  They may "rock" on old draw-filed barrels; in 
		that case, use the standard blocks (above).  Heights available are: 
		3/16", 1/4", 5/16", and 3/8".  
 
Price: $18.00 
		each






Posa
 

Posa blocks are for use with Unertl Posa-mount rings.  
		They are available either Posa/Lyman combination or Posa only (limited 
		supply). They can 
		also be used with the Redfield 3200 "big bore" rings.  Heights available are: 
		3/16", 1/4", 5/16", 3/8", 1/2", 5/8" and 3/4".  
		Available color-cased also.

		 
Price: $18.00 
		each black, $22.00 each color-cased.
5/8" and 3/4" 
		high are $21.00 each - black only.
 






Color-cased

		 

Color-cased blocks are available in several 
		configurations, including standard, Posa/Lyman and flat-bottom.  
		Heights available are: 3/16", 1/4", 5/16", and 3/8".  
		Flat-bottom are 3/16" height only.

		 
Price: $22.00 
		each
 






Stainless Steel
 

Stainless steel blocks are available either in standard 
		or Posa/Lyman configurations.  Heights available are: 3/16", 1/4", and 5/16".  
 
Price: $24.00 
		each; stainless screws are $2.00 each






Fecker
 

Blocks for Fecker mounts are slightly narrower than 
		standard.  (Lyman and Unertl scopes will fit Fecker blocks, but 
		Fecker scopes may not fit standard blocks).  
		Heights available are: 3/16", 1/4", and 5/16".  
 
Price: $18.00 
		each 






1903 Springfield
 

These blocks duplicate the blocks provided on 1903 
		Springfield rifles.  Also available in Posa configuration.  
		Either color-cased or black finish.  

		 

NEW for 2013 - heights that are .100 or .200 taller than 
		the standard.  This allows for low-height scopes such as the Lyman 
		to clear the bolt handle.

		 

Note - a lot of questions have arisen about using 
		"Springfield" blocks or Unertl O & E blocks.  Functionally they are 
		identical.  My understanding (and I am not an '03 expert) is 
		that the "Springfield" blocks are the style that would have been 
		provided by the armory, and that the O & E (Unertl-made) is what Unertl would have 
		provided with their scopes if intended for an '03 rifle.  I have 
		seen O & E marked blocks both square-ended, or somewhat rounded, like 
		the "Springfield" ones.  Adding to the confusion, the opinions 
		about color-cased or black finish, and for exactly what era, seem to be 
		all over the map.
 
Price: $47.00 
		per set






Stevens
 

These blocks are specifically for Stevens scopes.  
		They have the original-style V-shaped locking groove, and are available 
		with either Stevens holes (for 5-40 screws, .700" and .825" spacing) or 
		with standard holes.   They are also available flat-bottomed.  
		Heights are 3/16" and 1/4".

		 
Price: $18.00 
		each 






-70 series
 

These are the front blocks used on the Winchester Model 
		70 target rifles, with the 1.750" hole spacing.  Heights are as follows... 
		A-70 - .170";  B-70 - .230";  C-70 - .315";  LC-70 - 
		.370".

Also available in Posa configuration.
 
Price: $22.00 
		each






Mann-Neidner blocks
 

Tapered blocks for Mann-Neidner mounts, 
		intended to tighten on recoil.  They are specifically for use on 
		'03 Springfield rifles.

		 

New for 2016 - color-cased finish.
 
Price: $57.00 
		per set






Mann-Neidner scope 
		ring base blanks
 

Tapered dovetail blank bases, for making your own 
		Mann-Neidner scope rings.  They have been left about 1/4" longer 
		than finished length, so they can be matched to the tapered blocks being 
		used and cut to length appropriately.  In the white only.  
		Limited quantities.

		 
Price: $45.00 
		per set
 






Cross-dovetail blocks
 

Meant to go into a standard 3/8" x 60° barrel dovetail.  
		The lower ones are usually used for front sights, and the taller ones 
		for a front scope mount, when it mounts into a rear sight cut in the 
		barrel.  The lower ones are either 3/16" or 1/4" high.  The 
		higher ones are duplicates of the Unertl BK, K and KK blocks.  Any 
		of them can be provided with the brass set screw.  I have some that 
		are intentionally .005" larger, to be filed to fit.
 
Price: $25.00 
		each






Vaver blocks etc.
 

These blocks are for Vaver front sights.  They are 
		available either for the sights with the little pointy clamp screw, or 
		for the ones that use the side clamp ring.  Heights are .100" or 
		3/16".  The .100" high blocks require special low-head screws.  
		The clamp rings are also available.
 
Blocks - $18.00 
		each
Screws - $1.50 
		each
Clamp ring - 
		$5.00






Blanks
 

We have many blank, undrilled blocks on hand, already 
		black finished.  Drill them yourself, or let us know what hole 
		spacing you need and we will do it for you.  Heights available are 
		3/16", 1/4", 5/16", and 3/8".

		 
Price: $18.00 
		each - note includes screws even though undrilled






Screws
 

Screws are available for all block heights.  
		Standard thread is 6-48.  Stevens screws are 5-40.  But don't 
		worry if your rifle has yet different tapped holes - I currently have 
		screws in sizes of 6-32, 6-40, 6-44, 8-36, 8-40, 10-32 and 10-36.  We 
		should be able to find it there! 
 
Price: $1.50 
		each; Stainless $2.00 each






6-48 Taps
 

Set of taps (plug and bottoming) for 
		standard 6-48 scope block mount holes.  These taps are 4-flute HSS, 
		made in USA specifically for Steve Earle Products.  Sold as the set 
		of 2 only.
 
Price: $45.00 
		per set
 
(Note MSC's 
		price for these taps is $45 each.)
