Shirley Brian Color Changing Cotton Yarn – Page 1

Rated 5.00 out of 5 based on 2 customer ratings (2 customer reviews) 
$24.00

This gorgeous yarn is very similar to Wolles Color Changing Yarn in that it is 4 strands of unplyed yarn with each colour change taking place one strand at a time. This allows for a very long and gradual colour change as you knit. The yarn also comes with a free pattern for the Mariner shawl shown in the picture.
All the colours wouldn’t fit on 1 page so here is the link to the 2nd page of colours!
100% Cotton Gradient Yarn / Fingering Weight / 480 yards / 130 grams
3.75 mm needle is recommended
Made in Merrickville, Ontario Canadaa

Description
This gorgeous yarn is very similar to Wolles Color Changing Yarn in that it is 4 strands of unplyed yarn with each colour change taking place one strand at a time. This allows for a very long and gradual colour change as you knit. The yarn also comes with a free pattern for the Mariner shawl shown in the picture.
All the colours wouldn’t fit on 1 page so here is the link to the 2nd page of colours!

Picked up this yarn when I went into Rosehaven for needles. Started the Mariner pattern and am loving the gradual colour change and the ever increasing number of stitches. Working on my first “knot” row now and finding it fairly simple but effective. Converted the pattern into an excel spreadsheet for ease of making. There are quite a few repeats of rows one and two and I find it easier to tick off the rows rather than write it down. Pics soon on ravelry.

Really enjoyed doing this Mariner pattern- quite simple and especially the blocking made the finished piece so attractive! would do it again
