Outbox Systems Unveils First Product on Salesforce AppExchange with Salesforce.com Integration to AtTask | Business Wire


























































Outbox Systems Unveils First Product on Salesforce AppExchange with 
      Salesforce.com Integration to AtTask




      - Company’s First Commercial SaaS Integration Module Connects 
      Salesforce to Project Management Leader AtTask; Available on AppExchange 
      Marketplace Now -






December 18, 2014 08:00 AM Eastern Standard Time



SALT LAKE CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--In a move that underscores an agile response to rapid growth in the 
      cloud services market, Outbox Systems, an emerging provider of 
      cloud integration for the global enterprise market, today unveiled its 
      first commercial application, AtTask® for Salesforce. The product 
      is available from the Salesforce 
      AppExchange marketplace now.
    


      Since its inception in early 2014, Outbox has emerged as an innovation 
      leader and has expanded quickly, securing scores of enterprise customers 
      for its cloud consulting and integration offerings since the start of 
      this year.
    

      Today’s announcement marks the first of many integration tools that will 
      also be available as commercial offerings with Salesforce.com and AtTask 
      being the company’s first predominant platforms and partners. The new 
      product also brings together the communities of two organizations that 
      are #1 in their class. The app delivers ready-made integration of 
      Enterprise Work Management with Salesforce, and the selection of AtTask, 
      one of the fastest growing and most predominant platforms in the 
      Enterprise Work Management sector, and will contribute to additional 
      sales and market traction for the popular platform.
    

      “Our partnerships with Salesforce and AtTask have allowed us an ideal 
      launching pad to achieve immediate traction and to illustrate the full 
      power of cloud computing that strong integration can bring,” said Ryan 
      Westwood, Outbox founder and CEO. “We have chosen these two 
      organizations as our first strategic implementations, and we are 
      tremendously pleased with the strong results these integrations are 
      bringing to organizations that employ Salesforce and AtTask.”
    

      “Salesforce.com is utilized by the majority of our customers and is a 
      focal point for many work activities inside a business. However, 
      oftentimes other work can be unstructured and chaotic,” said Bryan 
      Nielson, Chief Strategy and Product Officer for AtTask. “AtTask brings 
      order to that work. And now with the smooth work handoff that the Outbox 
      integration provides, there is a higher level of work efficiency, 
      transparency, and value for Salesforce.com and AtTask customers.”
    

      For more information on Outbox services and consulting for AtTask, 
      Salesforce.com, and other cloud platforms, please visit www.outboxsystems.com 
      or call 855.256.8391.
