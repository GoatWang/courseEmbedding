He was appointed Vice Chairman of the NASDAQ Stock Market, Inc. in July 2000, serving through July 2003, and served as President of NASDAQ from 1996 until 2000. From 1972 to 1996, Mr. Berkeley served in a number of capacities at Alex. Brown & Sons Incorporated, which was acquired by Bankers Trust New York Corporation and later by Deutsche Bank AG. Most recently, he was Managing Director in the corporate finance department where he financed computer software and electronic commerce companies. He joined Alex.
