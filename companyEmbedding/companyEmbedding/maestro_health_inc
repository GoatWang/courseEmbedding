Maestro Healthcare Technology, Inc. Key Developments

Maestro Health Launches Benefits Administration Version 2.0 Solution
Apr 18 17
Maestro Health announced the launch of Ben Admin 2.0. (me)BENEFITS ADMIN 2.0 represents a new hybrid approach to employee benefits that finally combines an engaging enrollment experience with robust eligibility management to ease the burden on HR professionals and deliver a consumer-like experience for employees. No longer is the industry dependent on paper-based processes, systems that lack support or the clutter of unnecessary and rarely-used features. Say goodbye to the old way of doing benefits administration. With constant legislative changes, rising cost of premiums and evolving needs of the modern workforce, HR professionals shouldn’t have to deal with systems that can’t keep up or make things more complicated than they need to be. (me)BENEFITS ADMIN 2.0 aims to mend the long-standing rocky relationship HR professionals have had with their Ben Admin processes. Unlike old school solutions, which provided thousands of unnecessary features, (me)BENEFITS ADMIN 2.0 offers what really matters most: eligibility management, core consolidated billing, automated administrative services plus a personalized shopping/enrollment experience and a service model that actually delivers. Version 2.0 doesn’t require long implementation times or costly personalizations as the modular technology defies the status quo with its flexibility. (me)BENEFITS ADMIN 2.0 seamlessly integrates into Maestro Health’s all-in, technology-meets-service platform, maestroEDGE™, which is built to simplify, personalize and optimize how people shop, enroll and live with their benefits. The flexible solutions are designed to be all-in or á la carte, so HR professionals can customize their HR suite by choosing what works best for their organization.


University of Texas System Selects Maestro Health to Administer Benefit Accounts
Jun 28 16
Maestro Health announced has been selected by the University of Texas System to administer its UT FLEX Flexible Spending Accounts (FSA) program for the higher education system's approximately 93,000 benefits-eligible employees. Maestro Health, which features a modern HR Operating platform that includes Private Exchange, Benefit Administration, Self-Funding, and Benefit Accounts, will help implement its system across all institutions, including different campus locations, a cancer center, and the university's medical branch. Despite current UT FLEX participation above the national average at 25% of all eligible employees, UT System knew that existing benefit communications needed a face lift: one that would provide the context and humanized interaction needed to bring healthcare decisions to life. Through Maestro Health’s Benefit Accounts technology and service, the university seeks to improve communication with members both frequency of correspondence and a range of touchpoints for meaningful engagement to further increase participation in its FSA programs. The goal signals UT System's commitment to employee health and wellness with more rigorous offerings and initiatives to educate its employees on their benefit options.

            GoCo is one of the leading ben admins for 3 simple reasons: (1) Its modern - half the other ben admins were developed a decade ago. (2) It's robust - benefits can be complicated, so we worked with OneDigital, the largest small business benefits brokerage in the nation, to make sure we got it right. (3) It's free - just switch your broker to OneDigital and GoCo comes included. And you'll get an expert, local advisor you can reach anytime!

They pay very well and provide the opportunity to work remotely in addition to a couple offices across the country.The employees you will work with are amazing individuals who work tirelessly to create the product.ConsDue to their attempt to grow rapidly, they cram an inordinate amount of work into each "sprint" and release. They recently switched process in an attempt to be agile by incorporating sprints. In doing so, they extended our release cycles, but added more work, in effect, rendering this extension in release time irrelevant.You can expect to often work on weekends and put in over time with little incentive other than continuing to have a job. This is in part due to the amount of work they want done, but also due to the minimal training of the system they provide to new employees. The system is extremely complex making self training a tiring and extensive task that often never occurs since you'll need to pivot regularly, placing you at square one.Finally, expect to be micromanaged and have fingers pointed at you despite being a part of a "team effort." When things go awry, it is always, "who messed up" rather than "we as a team missed something, lets figure out why and fix it."Advice to ManagementThe client is important, but the employees that build the product for the client should be the most important, not the other way around. Especially when your employees work tirelessly with little incentive other than remaining employed.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (7) Maestro Health Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Maestro Health 2017-01-29 15:24 PST Jan 16, 2017"Quality Assurance Lead"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOI have been working at Maestro Health full-timeProsGreat work life balance, lots of flexibility, competitive payConsConstantly changing landscape due to the nature of the benefits administration and ACA compliance dependence of our productsAdvice to ManagementKeep it up!!Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Maestro Health Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Maestro Health 2017-01-16 12:58 PST Showing 26 of 26 reviewsReset FiltersPrevious123NextReviews > Maestro Health RSS Feed</>EmbedCloseOutline of two peoples' headsWork in HR or Marketing?Grow your employer brandUnlock your free employer accountCloseOutline of two peoples' headsWork in HR or Marketing?Grow your employer brandUnlock your free employer accountCompany Updates http://glassdoor.com/slink.htm?key=vIM0J—30+ days agoMaestroHealth Brand WeAreMaestronites Intro Maestro has offices in the 3 of the cities where your money goes furthest, Charlotte, Detroit and Chicago. http://glassdoor.com/slink.htm?key=vI3jw—30+ days agoThe 25 cities where your pay goes the furthestSee AllSee AllCompanies to ExploreMaestro Health PhotosSee All PhotosSee AllView Allnum of numClose (Esc) Company BenefitsDoctor's valiseThere are currently no benefit reviews for this company.Add Benefits ReviewAffiliated Companies Job Seekers Also ViewedProductive Edge ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 35 ReviewsCeCity.com ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 13 ReviewsForte Group ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 28 ReviewsGroup Associates ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 9 ReviewsMaestros Mediline Systems ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 13 ReviewsUline ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 341 ReviewsADP ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 5,290 ReviewsArtisan Talent ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 15 ReviewsUniversal Software ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 35 Reviews3M ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 1,652 ReviewsBenaissance ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 4 ReviewsBoeing ReviewsStarStarStarStarStar 5,772 Reviews Related Job SearchSoftware Engineer jobsSoftware Engineer salaries ($84k)Senior Software Engineer jobsSenior Software Engineer salaries ($110k)Sales Representative jobsSales Representative salaries ($39k)Account Manager jobsAccount Manager salaries ($52k)Inside Sales Representative jobsInside Sales Representative salaries ($37k)Intern jobsIntern salaries ($33k)Software Developer jobsSoftware Developer salaries ($79k)Account Executive jobsAccount Executive salaries ($47k)Business Analyst jobsBusiness Analyst salaries ($66k)Director jobsDirector salaries ($137k)Technical Support Engineer jobsTechnical Support Engineer salaries ($70k)Sales jobsSales salaries ($52k)Interested in a New Job?Upload a resume to mobile apply.

Bathroom Vanities (2,623)Bathroom Mirrors (682)Medicine Cabinets (227)Bathroom Linen Cabinets (202)Over-The-Toilet Storage (64)Makeup Mirrors (236)Bathroom Furniture & Mirrors Top Sellers

































Bathroom furniture consists of different specialized pieces that can add storage, functionality, and style to one of the most useful rooms in any home. While many might not think of a bathroom as a space where one would typically put pieces of furniture, there are actually a huge range of helpful additions that can make any bathroom more organized and cohesive.


One of the largest furniture pieces in many bathrooms is the vanity. A bathroom vanity holds the bathroom sink (or sinks) and can range from a compact floating unit to a vanity of a substantial size, featuring drawers and cabinets for storage. There are huge variety of bathroom vanity styles from sleek modern pieces to classic or transitional looks, any of which can add a distinct design tone to your space. 


Bathroom storage pieces are another very popular type of bathroom furniture. Many bathrooms do not have a lot of extra floor space, so bathroom cabinets or shelves tend to be either tall and narrow, or wall mounted. There are also a variety of flexible over the toilet storage options that can make use of the otherwise wasted space above the toilet tank. A shelving unit or linen cabinet in any of these configurations can add valuable storage space for everything from towels, washcloths, or soap, to make-up or cleaning supplies. Alternately, if you’re looking for something more petite, a medicine cabinet can provide great wall mounted or recessed storage for smaller items. 


Of course, no bathroom is complete without a suitable mirror. So we offer a full range of stylish and functional mirror designs from modern bathroom vanity mirrors to traditional styles of framed mirrors and even specialized make-up mirrors.


Whatever you need to complete your bathroom design, shop our great selection of bathroom furniture to find the perfect pieces!

Bathroom Faucets (1,527)Shower Heads (794)Shower Sets (650)Shower Trims (1,060)Bathtub Faucets (942)Faucets Top Sellers

































    Faucets are crucial fixtures in kitchens, bathrooms, laundry rooms, and just about any other spaces that feature water usage of some kind. themine.com
    provides a huge selection of faucets and plumbing hardware unrivaled by traditional faucet stores. With our collection of over 5,000 different faucets for
    you to choose from, including all the best faucet brands like Moen, American Standard, and Delta Faucet, you are sure to find the ideal fittings for your
    space.


    These fixtures are made in a wide range of specialized designs that can accommodate different spaces and uses. Some of the most used types include kitchen
    faucets, bathroom faucets, bathtub faucets, and utility sink faucets:



Kitchen faucets
        are designed for flexibility and functionality as well as bold aesthetics. These fixtures are meant to handle tough jobs and frequent usage, but also
        intended to complement one of the most used spaces in your home. They can incorporate useful features such as retractable sprayers or touch or motion
        activated control. We also have a few additional kitchen faucet types that can supplement your spaces with additional convenience features such as
        water filtration or water cooling.
    

Utility sink faucets
        are, as you would expect, much more utilitarian than other sink designs. They are typically quite sturdy in construction and sized to be proportional
        to large utility sinks for use in laundry rooms or garages. For ease of use, many
        of the laundry and utility faucets also come with sprayer attachments that can help with cleaning tough messes.
    

Bathroom faucets
        are typically much lower profile than kitchen faucets, merely because they are mostly for hand washing, and don’t require the clearance for dishes or
        other large items underneath. But just because they are smaller does not mean that they can’t also have a big impact on the space stylistically. We
        offer bathroom faucets in a huge range of designs and expressive finishes such as shiny chrome, dark oil rubbed bronze, and sophisticated polished
        nickel.
    

Bathtub faucets
        , also sometimes referred to as tub fillers, are the standard faucets used for every bathtub installation. They are much bigger and have a higher water
        output than any sink faucet would, as they have a much more sizable vessel to fill. Tub faucets come in a range of designs such as roman tub faucets,
        waterfall faucets, and clawfoot tub fillers, among others, to complement different bath arrangements and preferences.
    


For more information on sink faucets, check out our    faucet installation guide that gives crucial insight and
    helpful step-by-step DIY instructions for tackling this plumbing update.
