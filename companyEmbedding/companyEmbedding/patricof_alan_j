Early life and education[edit]
Patricof grew up in a Jewish family[2] on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York City,[3] the son of parents who had immigrated from Russia to the United States. His father was a small-time stockbroker.[1] Patricof graduated from Ohio State University in 1955, after three years, and earned an M.B.A. from Columbia University in 1957 while working full-time as an analyst for an investment firm.[3][4]
Career[edit]
Patricof worked from the ground up and eventually was assigned the management of the Gottesman pulp and paper fortune.[1] Tired of the irrational volatility of the stock market,[3] he focused his efforts on the new private companies in the portfolio.[1] In 1967, he invested in New York magazine, a new publication, where he served as the founding chairman of the board. The magazine was a success and his efforts elevated his business profile.[1] In 1969, he was able to raise $2.5 million and founded one of the first venture capital firms, Patricof Company Ventures. In 1977, he founded the private equity firm Apax Partners.[3] Patricof is an active investor: he always takes a seat on the company's board and is very vocal with his views.[3]
By the mid-1990s Apax had become one of the larger private equity firms globally. In 2001, Patricof stepped back from day-to-day management of Apax Partners, Inc., the US arm of the firm to return to his original focus on making venture capital investments in small early-stage companies. In 2006, Patricof left Apax to form Greycroft Partners which focuses on small early-stage venture capital investments.
As an early investor in venture capital he has been involved in the development of numerous major companies including America Online, Office Depot, Cadence Design Systems, Apple Computer and FORE Systems. He was a founder and chairman of the board of New York magazine, which later acquired the Village Voice and New West magazine.[5] Patricof also acquired style magazine Details in 1987.[6] He has also been involved with Cellular Communications, Inc., NTL, and Audible.
Over the course of his 40-year career in private equity, Patricof has been instrumental in growing the venture capital field from a base of high net-worth individuals to its position today with broad institutional backing, as well as playing a key role in the essential legislative initiatives that have guided its evolution.
Personal life[edit]
Patricof has been married twice:

He was married to Bette Patricof Hollander.[7][8][9] They later divorced. They had one child:

Mark F. Patricof (b. 1964) who is married to Martha Shelburne Jones, a daughter of Anne Shelburne Jones and Bishop Edward Witker Jones of Indianapolis. Her father was then bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Indianapolis.[7][8] They have two children: Lily and Nina.


His second marriage was to Susan Hatkoff.[10] She is the sister of Craig Hatkoff.[11] They have two sons:

Jamie Patricof, movie and television producer. He is married to the Co-President of Baby2Baby Kelly Sawyer.[12] They have two children: Riley and Sawyer.
Jonathan Cale Patricof (b. 1973), President of Tribeca Enterprises the company that owns and operates the Tribeca Film Festival. He is married to Victoria Ann Radford of New York.[13] They have three children: Jack, Chloe and Lila.[14][15]



The Patricofs live in New York, New York.[1]
Political and other affiliations[edit]
Patricof has been active in Democratic Party politics, contributing to candidates including Bill and Hillary Clinton,[16][17][18][19][20] whom he met in the Hamptons when they were there as guests of lobbyist and Democratic activist Liz Robbins.[21] Patricof serves on the Board of Overseers of Columbia University Graduate School of Business.[22] As of 2011[update] he serves as an advisor to the Grassroots Business Fund.[23]

Early life and education[edit]
Patricof grew up in a Jewish family[2] on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York City,[3] the son of parents who had immigrated from Russia to the United States. His father was a small-time stockbroker.[1] Patricof graduated from Ohio State University in 1955, after three years, and earned an M.B.A. from Columbia University in 1957 while working full-time as an analyst for an investment firm.[3][4]
Career[edit]
Patricof worked from the ground up and eventually was assigned the management of the Gottesman pulp and paper fortune.[1] Tired of the irrational volatility of the stock market,[3] he focused his efforts on the new private companies in the portfolio.[1] In 1967, he invested in New York magazine, a new publication, where he served as the founding chairman of the board. The magazine was a success and his efforts elevated his business profile.[1] In 1969, he was able to raise $2.5 million and founded one of the first venture capital firms, Patricof Company Ventures. In 1977, he founded the private equity firm Apax Partners.[3] Patricof is an active investor: he always takes a seat on the company's board and is very vocal with his views.[3]
By the mid-1990s Apax had become one of the larger private equity firms globally. In 2001, Patricof stepped back from day-to-day management of Apax Partners, Inc., the US arm of the firm to return to his original focus on making venture capital investments in small early-stage companies. In 2006, Patricof left Apax to form Greycroft Partners which focuses on small early-stage venture capital investments.
As an early investor in venture capital he has been involved in the development of numerous major companies including America Online, Office Depot, Cadence Design Systems, Apple Computer and FORE Systems. He was a founder and chairman of the board of New York magazine, which later acquired the Village Voice and New West magazine.[5] Patricof also acquired style magazine Details in 1987.[6] He has also been involved with Cellular Communications, Inc., NTL, and Audible.
Over the course of his 40-year career in private equity, Patricof has been instrumental in growing the venture capital field from a base of high net-worth individuals to its position today with broad institutional backing, as well as playing a key role in the essential legislative initiatives that have guided its evolution.
Personal life[edit]
Patricof has been married twice:

He was married to Bette Patricof Hollander.[7][8][9] They later divorced. They had one child:

Mark F. Patricof (b. 1964) who is married to Martha Shelburne Jones, a daughter of Anne Shelburne Jones and Bishop Edward Witker Jones of Indianapolis. Her father was then bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Indianapolis.[7][8] They have two children: Lily and Nina.


His second marriage was to Susan Hatkoff.[10] She is the sister of Craig Hatkoff.[11] They have two sons:

Jamie Patricof, movie and television producer. He is married to the Co-President of Baby2Baby Kelly Sawyer.[12] They have two children: Riley and Sawyer.
Jonathan Cale Patricof (b. 1973), President of Tribeca Enterprises the company that owns and operates the Tribeca Film Festival. He is married to Victoria Ann Radford of New York.[13] They have three children: Jack, Chloe and Lila.[14][15]



The Patricofs live in New York, New York.[1]
Political and other affiliations[edit]
Patricof has been active in Democratic Party politics, contributing to candidates including Bill and Hillary Clinton,[16][17][18][19][20] whom he met in the Hamptons when they were there as guests of lobbyist and Democratic activist Liz Robbins.[21] Patricof serves on the Board of Overseers of Columbia University Graduate School of Business.[22] As of 2011[update] he serves as an advisor to the Grassroots Business Fund.[23]

My fellow venture capitalists and private equity investors are paying close attention to the heated election-year rhetoric about the future of “carried interest,” which is the performance fee we charge to manage other people’s money. Carried interest is the fund manager’s share of the earnings from a profitable investment, normally paid on top of a much smaller management fee.It’s also a subject of increasing political disfavor. Over the past year, every major presidential candidate — from Jeb Bush and Donald J. Trump to Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders — has called for an end to a tax loophole that exists for carried interest. Mrs. Clinton has vowed that if Congress does not close the loophole, as president she would ask the Treasury Department to use its regulatory authority to do so.Ultimately, the controversy has to do with tax fairness, or the lack thereof. Instead of being taxed as wages or commissions earned, carried interest is currently taxed as if it were a personal investment, or capital gains. This gives us a significant tax advantage since the capital gains tax rate is about 50 percent lower than the top rate on ordinary income.When I started my first fund, Alan Patricof Associates, in 1970, I vividly remember my accountant telling me about my first sale of an investment: “We’re going to treat this as capital gain, but sooner or later, it will be characterized as ordinary income.”

That was 46 years ago — and virtually nothing has changed.Other countries have taken action: Britain recently recognized the wisdom of doing away with the special tax treatment of carried interest by maintaining a much higher tax rate on such income. But not the United States. Continue reading the main story

It is past time for that to change, and for fund managers like myself to accept the reality: We should not be receiving a tax break meant for investors when our work does not involve the risk of our own investment of capital.As the former Treasury secretary Larry Summers once said of carried interest, “Rarely has a policy existed so long with such weak arguments in its favor.”The capital gains tax benefit was originally created for people who invested with their own capital at risk. It was established as an incentive for investors to take greater risk than they would with their ordinary income. But because of the nature of our work, carried interest does not merit that incentive.

To the extent that venture capitalists and private equity investors have their own capital invested in their own or any funds, they deserve capital gains treatment, just as any other limited partner does. But the same does not hold true for a general partner.The general partner is managing the funds of others and rarely puts his own money into the initial investment. The risk he takes is that his ultimate payout is not guaranteed unless the venture is profitable — which is very different from the investor who is putting his own money at stake.And there is a cost. According to the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, carried interest costs the American people nearly $2 billion in tax receipts every year. While eliminating the carried interest advantage would make only a small dent in the national debt, it would send a meaningful message to the American people.Most important, it comes back to a question of fairness. Our current political and cultural environment is marred by a toxic belief that the country’s economic order is rigged against ordinary Americans — that the world of high finance unjustly supersedes their rights, needs and wants.

A new report by Gallup found that 86 percent of Americans agreed that members of Congress paid too much attention to what their major financial contributors wanted them to do. It feeds the cynicism that is fraying our democracy.“Congress’s harshest critics,” Gallup reported, “feel more strongly about the undue influence that donors and lobbyists have on Congress than they do about any other major criticism of the institution.”For that reason alone, my fellow venture capitalists and private equity investors should support the closing of the carried interest loophole: It would carry great symbolic weight.

There needs to be a more realistic attitude from those of us who have benefited from the carried interest loophole for too many years.We need to demonstrate a little more patriotism, and a greater sense of fairness, even if it affects our pocketbooks.

In Search Of A Better Business Plan


With more money to invest than ever before, venture capitalists are going on the regional conference circuit to find new deals, providing entrepreneurs with one of the best opportunities to get financing that has come along for years.






By Bruce G. Posner













WRITE A COMMENT



















CREDIT: 










Last spring, at a conference in Albany, N.Y., designed to acquaint entrepreneurs with venture capital, Alan J. Patricof, a New York City venture capitalist, was reflecting on his 14 years as a backer of promising young companies. Until a couple of years ago, he recalls, "we could invest in nearly anybody we wanted, and at very attractive prices." But, he observes, as record dollars have flowed into the hands of the nation's venture capitalists and the public equity market has soared, the pendulum has been swinging more in favor of those needing money. "There must be 500 venture capitalists for you to talk to, so it's a darn good environment," says Patricof, whose firm has participated in financing such successful companies as Apple Computer and Childcraft Education. "This is the time to quit your job and do what you want to do."Lured by the recent performance of venture capital professionals, investors, including a growing number of employee-benefit and college-endowment funds, have been pouring money into risk capital pools like never before. In the past three years, more than $4 billion in new funds have come into the market; the $1.7 billion inflow during 1982 alone was nearly four times the total sum invested from 1970 to 1977, according to Stanley Pratt, president of Capital Publishing Corp. in Wellesley Hills, Mass., which publishes Venture Capital Journal. As the increased supply of venture capital money brings hundreds of entrepreneurs out of the woodwork and helps generate dozens of new investment funds, it is also fueling a proliferation of venture capital conferences in such cities as Albany, Cleveland, and Pittsburgh -- stops many fund managers didn't often make during the days when money was less plentiful.The venture capitalists, who typically seek returns of 40% to 60% per year, have hardly given up looking for attractive investments in California's Silicon Valley and Massachusetts's Route 128, where they have been ubiquitous and mostly successful. But the growing competition among fund managers, together with the sheer amount of new capital available, is prompting many of the managers to spend more time sniffing out early-stage investment prospects in other parts of the country. It is a process which at least some venture capitalists believe is being enhanced by the increased number of regional conferences. "Contrary to popular perception," says Stevan Birnbaum, a Los Angeles -- based general partner with Oxford Partner, "we have to market our money and our abilities to help companies succeed, just as entrepreneurs have to sell us on what they're trying to do."The conferences, most of which art jointly organized by universities and accounting firms, are providing venture capitalists with opportunities to make initial contacts with a number of companies at once and to establish early impressions about products and management talent -- judgments that may be hard to make from a stack of business plans. At a seminar last May in Albany, sponsored by Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and Venture Capital Journal, for example, around 20 professional venture capitalists, among them Patricof and Birnbaum, spent two days listening to company presentations and mixing informally with entrepreneurs from more than 60 businesses based in upstate New York and in New England, as well as with Big Eight and local accountants and attorneys. The companies attending the RPI conference, mostly early-stage concerns involved in applications of proven technologies, represented everything from robotics to biotechnology and solar energy.In a field where time can be the most limiting factor, "it's usually hard to justify hopping on a plane to see one company in a region you're not familiar with," says Birnbaum, whose four-man partnership gets about 500 proposals annually before selecting perhaps 10 investments. By necessity, he says, most of his traveling is thus associated with deals that have been qualified by the firm's analyses or by other venture capitalists looking for co-investors. "But if I can get a feel for 10 or 12 companies at a two-day conference," says Birnbaum, a former principal with Xerox Corp.'s venture capital subsidiary, "that's a fairly productive use of my time."Venture capitalists, though, aren't attending conferences solely for the purpose of harvesting the current crop of investment candidates. "By going into an area," says G. Felda Hardymon, a partner with Bessemer Venture Partners of New York, "we can learn an awful lot about what's happening there and begin to develop some strong local contacts with accountants and attorneys." Particularly in a climate where attractive prospects are being pursued by several competing fund managers at once, he notes, "it's important for people to know who we are and be aware of our track record."For entrepreneurs, the regional conferences are providing insights into how venture capitalists evaluate investment prospects and what it takes to rise above the sea of companies looking for backing. Four-year-old Power Kinetics Inc., a $2 million company in Troy, N.Y., involved in research and development and the manufacture of renewable energy products, for example, presented its business plan at the Albany conference as a prelude to "a serious approach to venture capitalists late this year or in early 1984," says president Mark P. Rice. "We used it as a learning opportunity and a way to make our next proposals better." Among the things Rice learned was that he and his associates would have to do a much more detailed market analysis in order to be taken seriously by investors.In a similar spirit, Thomas J. Gregory, president of one-year-old Ovation Technologies Inc. of Canton, Mass., spent his time in Albany talking with fund managers and studying the formal presentations of other companies in an effort to find ways to sharpen his sales pitch when his fund-raising efforts get under way. During the fall, Ovation (formerly named Spectrum Group Inc.), a microcomputer software developer, hopes to raise $5 million to market and promote its first product targeted at first-time executive users. Based on discussions with venture capitalists, Gregory was planning to revamp his business plan extensively before pursuing further contacts. "Positioning a product in the market will be the critical thing," he says. "Once we're ready to go, I've got a handful of business cards and I'm hoping we'll be able to raise the money we're looking for more efficiently."For other businesses, however, the conferences have become opportunities to pursue fund-raising efforts already in progress. One example is Athenaeum Technology Inc., a Braintree, Mass., start-up company developing a 5 1/4-inch, hard-disk computer-storage system. Athenaeum presented its business plan, which calls for $2.5 million of equity to meet current working capital needs, at a conference sponsored by the American Electronics Association last March in Monterey, Calif. In May, three of the company's top executives traveled to Albany to renew relationships with venture capitalists they had previously met and to make initial contacts with others.It's all part of our systematic attempt to market the company," notes Jean-Paul Garodel, co-founder and marketing vice-president. "We're trying to build awareness among investors about who we are. To get what it is looking for -- $2.5 million for about 25% of the company's equity -- Garodel figures Athenaeum may have to spend at least six months meticulously following up its leads with potential investors. Yet no matter how aggressively the company promotes itself, he notes, it won't be a substitute for the basic requirements any venture capitalist expects from a deal. Says Garodel: "Whoever puts money in the company will be taking a hard look at the management and the products."With so many attractive companies trying to get a piece of the new money, venture capitalists say the standards for the deals they do are as high as ever. While some lucky entrepreneurs are receiving more favorable prices for their start-up businesses than any time before, "there will always be a lot of losers," observes Pratt of Capital Publishing. But as venture capitalists devote part of their time to the seminar circuit, some companies may find ways to break through the filter. "If I were trying to build a company, I'd use the conferences and the entire process to build a better business plan," says Alan patricof. In 1982, he and five associates looked at nearly 400 plans, met with about 100 entrepreneurs, and financed just 12. "We'll do about the same this year," Patricof says. Even so, there are plenty of others looking for deals, he says "So one of the most important things is to get your idea listened to."STALKING THE CONFERENCESBefore committing the time (usually a day or two) and the $250 that is the typical registration fee for regional conferences, entrepreneurs should check out the sponsors and find out which venture capitalists will be attending. The following is a list of some of the conferences on the calendar this fall. Inquiries about them, except where noted, should be directed to Venture Capital Journal, (617) 431-8100.September 12-13*: DallasSeptember 22: Fort Lauderdale, Fla.September 28: AtlantaSeptember 29-30: Salt Lake CityOctober 4: Washington, D.C.October 6: PhoenixOctober 11: ChicagoOctober 13-14**: Atlanta* For information, call Arthur Young & Co., (214) 969-8666.** For information, call Georgia Institute of Technology, (404) 894-2408.
