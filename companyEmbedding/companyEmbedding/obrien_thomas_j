DALLAS, May 16, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Dallas-based Rose Walker LLP, a national trial and business law firm, is announcing the addition of accomplished family law attorney Thomas J. O'Brien as a partner.
"Asking Tom to join us was one of the easiest things we've ever done," says Rose Walker founder Martin Rose. "We've been referring our clients to Tom for family law matters for years, and they always rave about his effectiveness and style, and the results he gets while controlling clients' costs. Although Tom is technically a new partner, he is an old and trusted friend and advisor to many of our clients."
Mr. O'Brien, formerly of the Law Office of Thomas O'Brien, handles a variety of family law issues, including divorce, child custody, and marital and partition agreements, among others. He earned his B.B.A. in Finance from the University of Texas at Austin and his law degree from St. Mary's University School of Law. Mr. O'Brien is Board Certified in Family Law by the Texas Board of Legal Specialization.
He says the decision to join Rose Walker was an easy one.
"We've always shared the same philosophy that we don't need to fight, but we're not afraid to," Mr. O'Brien says. "Particularly in family law, where emotions run high, your goal is to reach an amicable resolution. But I and the rest of the lawyers here know that attorneys who are ready to go to trial are the ones who get the best verdicts and settlements for their clients."
In addition to Mr. Rose and Mr. O'Brien, several other Rose Walker attorneys have been recognized by the publishers of Texas Super Lawyers among the top lawyers in the state. The firm also is home to multiple honorees in the annual Texas Rising Stars list of the state's top young lawyers.
Rose Walker LLP is a national trial and business law firm, focusing on complex civil litigation and corporate legal matters. With offices in Texas, California and Colorado, the firm represents businesses and individuals, and its many major courtroom victories have helped Rose Walker earn a national reputation for excellence. More information about the firm is available at http://www.rosewalker.com.
For more information on Mr. O'Brien and Rose Walker's family law practice, please contact Amy Hunt at 800.559.4534 or amy@androvett.com.

Employees







Kevin Obrien
Owner


















Before you Hire

Here are some rules, regulations, and laws governing general contractors
in Michigan:













Does Thomas J. Obrien Company carry a valid contracting license?



Michigan requires contractors performing any work on residential properties to be licensed with the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs. 











How important is contractor licensing in Michigan?



Contractors in Michigan must complete a 60 hour approved prelicensure education class prior to taking a buisness and law exam. Contractors are required to take continuing education upon renewal of an active license. 











Your liability risk when hiring Thomas J. Obrien Company



Michigan requires licensed contractors to carry an active workers' compensation policy. Although general liability insurance is not required under Michigan state law, it is always advisable to hire contractors who carry it. Request copies of the certificates for both forms of insurance for your records. 











How is the BuildZoom score calculated?



The BuildZoom score is based on a number of factors including the contractor's license status, insurance status, verified work history, standing with local consumer interest groups, verified reviews from other BuildZoom users and self-reported feedback from the contractor.











Why you should hire through BuildZoom



When it comes to major construction work or even minor alterations to your home, hiring the wrong contractor could result in incomplete or defective work. You may even find yourself dealing with huge liability claims. BuildZoom does the homework for you and helps you hire the right contractor.











You should get several bids before hiring a contractor



Before hiring a contractor in Michigan, be sure to get at least 3 detailed bids. Quality contractors will take the time to explain their budget proposal, and help guide you through the estimate process. Be wary of an abnormally low bid, they are not worth the risk. These underpriced projects often do not end well for the homeowner, choose a contractor you trust and can clearly communicate with. BuildZoom has made the bid collection process extremely simple (and free). Just click here to get started.

Here are some of the most common attorneys individuals seek out when they require legal aid:Criminal Lawyer
A criminal defense lawyer is probably the attorney the average person imagines. Criminal attorneys are the men and women who defend individuals accused of a crime. The lawyer may work pro bono - for the public good - so the accused is certain to have representation, even if he or she cannot afford an attorney.Criminal lawyers are experts in the criminal justice system. They help their clients decide how to plead when first charged by the police and guide them through trial procedures. Defense lawyers must use every bit of their knowledge and resources to get their clients the fairest results from criminal proceedings.Business Lawyer
If you are a small business owner or the head of a larger corporation, you may come into contact with a business lawyer. Many big companies keep a legal staff on payroll to deal with the daily operations of running and maintaining a large enterprise. Business lawyers may have more specific specialties like copyright law, product liability and mergers and acquisitions.Business attorneys may focus their practices on certain industries. There are entertainment lawyers to guide artists through royalties and media contracts, while hospitals employ malpractice attorneys to protect doctors from aggressive litigation.Employment Lawyer
When you work for a company, you may find yourself in need of an employment lawyer - especially if the relationship between you and your employer sours. An employment attorney prevents people from losing their jobs due to unfair reasons. Workers' compensation lawyers help maintain safe employment conditions and ensure workers receive fair compensation after workplace injury or discrimination.Finance Lawyer
A personal finance attorney can protect and manage your investments and securities. You may use a finance lawyer to help you prepare your taxes, but you might be better off working with an accountant. A tax attorney is more commonly contacted after a business or individual runs into trouble with the IRS or state regulators.Real Estate Lawyer
Your family may keep a lawyer on retainer to guide you through the major expenses that come up in life. When buying a home, you could work with a real estate lawyer to make sure you get the best deal and won't get taken advantage of by tricky mortgage agreements or unfair landlords. An estate attorney can help you plan for the worst by creating a will and preparing your finances for after your death.Bankruptcy Lawyer
A bankruptcy lawyer is essential to help you resolve your financial difficulties when they start to spin out of control. Certain attorneys help create strategies to bring you out of debt and speak to your creditors. A lawyer can advise you on which type of bankruptcy you should file for.Civil Lawyer
If you are suing someone or being sued, you need a civil lawyer. Civil attorneys - and criminal lawyers - are the legal representatives who argue on your behalf in a courtroom setting. Civil lawyers may represent you on matters of business, finance or a wide variety of other specialized needs.One of the most common types of civil attorneys is a personal injury lawyer. When you're hurt by an outside party and you would like to hold them legally responsible, a personal injury attorney conducts litigation and negotiates settlements to compensate for your pain and suffering. Sometimes many wronged people will join together with a single civil lawyer or law office to form a class action lawsuit.Family/Divorce Lawyer
Most people will turn to a lawyer during a divorce to navigate the emotionally charged legal proceedings. A divorce attorney can assist in determining grounds for separation, division of property and custody of children.Family attorneys deal with much more personal matters. If you're getting married, a family lawyer can help you prepare a prenuptial agreement or other family planning paperwork such as adoption or inheritance documents.Questions One Should Ask a Lawyer Before Hiring ThemTo ensure you find a competent attorney who won't abuse your trust or drain your finances, you have to make the proper inquiries. There are several questions you should ask, but the majority will fall under three general topics:Training and Experience Questions
One of the best ways to determine quality is to examine an attorney's history. When you first step into a lawyer's office, you should check for the appropriate certifications and diplomas. You have to ask how long he or she has practiced law and request information that demonstrates the practice's success. Look for precise details such as percentage of cases settled out of court.Once you inquire about the broad details of their legal career, you should ask questions about their experience that pertains to your specific issue. You should ask how many similar cases they have handled and if they have special skills or training that applies specifically to your needs. Lawyers can't mention clients by name, but you should ask for basic details about identical past cases.Financial Questions
You need to ask about every possible fee that will come up when working with an attorney. You should request a list of all costs in advance so you won't be surprised by additional expenses like overhead. Also determine exactly when you will start being billed. You want to inspect paperwork carefully. If the attorney charges you for his or her experience, you need to make sure he or she will perform tasks personally and not hand it off to an assistant.Find out if the attorney has a flat fee or charges by the hour. Many civil lawyers work on contingency. Whatever the payment plan, make inquiries about how the lawyer plans to provide service for your money and what you can do if you start to feel unsatisfied with his or her performance.Lawyer/Client Relationship Questions
When you hire a lawyer, you're agreeing to work with someone over a certain period of time. You need to ask questions about how the attorney will communicate with you and what responsibilities you hold in the relationship. The attorney should let you know the best channel for quick communication and you need to inform him or her when you want updates.You should also ask questions to get to know the attorney as an individual in order to ensure this is a person you can trust. Ask about their legal philosophy and how he or she views the lawyer/client relationship. Great questions to start off with are ones that will make your life easier, such as how to keep fees down or what daily disruptions you should expect from a long legal battle. The more forthcoming the lawyer appears to be with individual needs, the better.Top Reasons to Hire a LawyerYou may keep a lawyer on retainer or you could turn to an attorney during specific situations. Here are some common reasons people begin seeking legal representation or advice:You Know Your Limitations
If you sign documents and you come across a word you don't recognize, you need assistance. You may need a third party to help you navigate important employment or real estate paperwork. It's essential you fully understand the terms of any legally binding documentation or activity you become a part of. If you are not an expert in a given field, you'll want to hire an attorney who is.A lawyer may find legal implications or opportunities you might miss. If you find yourself in a civil or criminal matter, a proper attorney ensures you don't receive a harsh punishment for a small mistake.You're Facing an Important Event/Decision
When making decisions critical to your financial stability or personal life, you may want a lawyer with expertise in your situation to make sure you do everything you can to arrive at the proper resolution. This is especially true when you become involved in a criminal case and your freedom is on the line.It's not just a matter of legal knowledge; lawyer's have access to numerous resources you do not. They have staff ready to work around the clock and experts in a variety of fields to give your important issues the attention they deserve.You Can't Be Impartial
During times when personal matters intersect with legal proceedings, you may need to have an advocate to prevent your emotions from getting in the way of level-headed thinking. For example, divorce lawyers can mediate a heated argument and help both partners get on with their lives.Emotional investment could be subtle. You may want to have a lawyer look over an investment opportunity that looks too good to be true or investigate the merits of a possible civil suit when you feel wronged.You're Out of Options
Many people turn to lawyers when they are in trouble. If you've been accused of a crime or are in a terrible financial situation, you can find an attorney who will work with what you have available to assist you as you deal with your problems.Personal injury lawyers find solutions for people who can no longer work under their own power and bankruptcy attorneys prevent people from giving in to debt. If you find yourself in a situation where you can't find a solution, a lawyer may be able to offer the counsel you need.How to Choose a LawyerWhen it comes time to choose a lawyer, you should start by searching close to home. While you probably don't want the conflict of interest that comes from being represented by a family member, friends and loved ones can recommend lawyers who served them well in the past. If you do have attorneys you are familiar with, ask who they believe would be best for you.After going through personal references - especially from individuals who had similar needs - you should broaden your search through public information resources. You can call your area's attorney referral service or check legal organizations like Martindale-Hubbell. There are other resources available online. You should check websites for client reviews and other third-party forms of approval.When you build a list of possible candidates, perform a background check on each one. See if you can find information on their history and success record. Once you find a possible lawyer, you should call to arrange a consultation so you can ask your important questions in person.By performing the necessary research and taking every available precaution, you can narrow your search to the attorney most suited to your needs.

PER CURIAM:


1
Thomas J. O'Brien appeals from the district court's order granting defendant's motion for summary judgment in O'Brien's personal injury diversity action.1


2
O'Brien, a Virginia resident, was injured when he fell while attempting to enter an overhead bunk in a recreational vehicle ("RV") he had rented.  The RV was not equipped with a ladder, so in order to reach the sleeping area O'Brien stood on the driver's seat, which was a reclining, swivel chair.  The second time he attempted to enter the bunk the chair shifted under his weight and O'Brien fell to the floor.  The accident occurred while O'Brien was vacationing in Alaska.  O'Brien subsequently filed suit in the Eastern District of Virginia against the corporation which rented him the RV and the manufacturer, Coachman, alleging that the RV was defective in that it did not come equipped with a ladder to be used in entering the overhead sleeping area.  Jurisdiction was based on diversity of citizenship.  The renter was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction.  Coachman moved for summary judgment on the basis of O'Brien's deposition and his responses to discovery.  The district court granted Coachman's motion, holding that O'Brien had failed to provide sufficient evidence either of causation or of a duty on the part of Coachman which had been breached.  O'Brien noticed a timely appeal.


3
This Court reviews a grant of summary judgment de novo, applying the same standards employed by the district court.    Felty v. Graves-Humphreys Co., 818 F.2d 1126, 1127-28 (4th Cir.1987).  Summary judgment is proper only when it is clear that there is no genuine dispute concerning either the facts material to the controversy or the reasonable inferences to be drawn from those facts.    Pulliam Inv. Co. v. Cameo Properties, 810 F.2d 1282, 1286 (4th Cir.1987).  Nonetheless, summary judgment is mandated if, after an adequate discovery period, the nonmoving party "fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial."    Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322 (1986).


4
The allegations in the complaint support a claim for recovery under either of two theories available to O'Brien under Alaska law:2  negligence and strict products liability.  The complaint, coupled with O'Brien's statements to the court at the summary judgment hearing, give rise to two claims of where the problem with the RV lay:  First, that the adjusting knobs on the chair were defective, and second, that the design of the RV was defective because it lacked a ladder.


5
The district court concluded that O'Brien had not made a sufficient showing to survive summary judgment under either theory of recovery and under either theory of where the defect lay.  We affirm in part, vacate in part, and remand.

The Negligence Claim

6
The essential elements of a negligence claim under Alaska law are (1) duty, (2) breach of that duty, (3) proximate cause, and (4) damages.    Wickwire v. Arctic Circle Air Services, 722 P.2d 930, 932 (Alaska 1986).  To survive summary judgment O'Brien was required to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of each of these essential elements.    Catrett, 477 U.S. at 322.  While Catrett sets the standard for the sufficiency of the evidence, state law nonetheless determines what evidence the nonmoving party must adduce to meet that burden.


7
The district court properly granted summary judgment for Coachman on the theory that a defect within the chair itself was a proximate cause of O'Brien's injuries.  O'Brien was able to produce only three documents evidencing repairs to the chair.  He offered no proposed testimony, expert or otherwise, as to the condition of the knobs, whether they had broken under stress, or whether they were adequately designed and manufactured.  Proximate causation is an essential element of O'Brien's claim of negligence;  he failed to produce sufficiently probative evidence establishing that the adjusting knobs were a proximate cause of his injuries.  Coachman was entitled to judgment on this claim.


8
Finding that O'Brien had not shown that a duty to provide a ladder existed, the district court granted summary judgment for Coachman on the theory that negligence lay in the failure to provide a ladder.  The court based its ruling upon the absence of any regulatory or statutory requirement for a ladder and O'Brien's own admission that he had discovered that only two out of six RV's seen at a local lot had ladders.  Coachman emphasized the lack of expert testimony on the duty question.  We believe that in this type of case Alaska law does not require particularized testimony on the question of duty and that O'Brien met the minimal burden imposed.


9
In Lynden Transp., Inc. v. Haragan, 623 P.2d 789 (Alaska 1981), the plaintiff died from injuries he received when a truck trailer he was standing on collapsed.  The case was submitted to the jury solely on evidence that the trailer's landing gear was "pretty rusty" and that the condition was readily visible.    Id. at 793.  On appeal, the defendant argued that plaintiff had failed to establish a duty owed by trailer owners since he had not introduced evidence of, among other things, how much rust was reasonable and had offered no expert testimony on whether any duty existed or had been breached.  Id.  Affirming the decision below, the Alaska Supreme Court stated "[d]etection and avoidance of rust, or the deleterious effects of rust on metal, is not a matter 'of such professional abstrusity that standards can be determined only with the aid of expert testimony.' "    Id., quoting Northern Lights Motel, Inc. v. Sweaney, 561 P.2d 1176, 1192 (Alaska 1977) (plaintiff did not need to provide expert testimony concerning duty to provide smoke detectors or sprinklers in hotels since jury could determine appropriate standard of care).


10
We believe that Alaska courts allow the jury to determine the requisite duty where the issue does not require an understanding of complex, technical issues, and where the conduct complained of can have an obviously detrimental impact on public safety.  The jury would need no technical knowledge to determine whether the average person could safely enter the bunk in the RV without a ladder.  By a simple observation of the vehicle the jury can determine whether the distance is such that it can be safely traversed without additional assistance.  If it is not, the jury can determine whether ordinary care would require that a ladder be provided.  It is not clear, as a matter of law, that no such duty exists.  The district court's grant of summary judgment on the claim that Coachman negligently failed to provide a ladder was erroneous.3

Strict liability

11
Under Alaska law, in a cause of action for strict liability, the plaintiff must prove that a product is defective and that the defect in the product was the proximate cause of his injuries.    Prince v. Parachutes, Inc., 685 P.2d 83, 89 (Alaska 1984).  There are two tests for determining whether a product's design is defective.


12
[A] product is defectively designed if:


13
"(1) the plaintiff proves that the product failed to perform as an ordinary consumer would expect when used in an intended or reasonably foreseeable manner, or (2) the plaintiff proves that the product's design proximately caused injury and the defendant fails to prove, in light of the relevant factors, that on balance the benefits of the challenged design outweigh the risk of danger inherent in such design."


14
Beck, 593 P.2d at 886, quoting Barker v. Lull Eng'g Co., Inc., 20 Cal. 3d 413, 432, 573 P.2d 443, 452, 143 Cal. Rptr. 225, 234 (1978);  Dura Corp. v. Harned, 703 P.2d 396, 405-06 (Alaska 1985).  Under the second test, once the plaintiff has made a prima facie case by introducing evidence sufficient to permit a jury to find that the product's design features were a proximate cause of his injuries the burden of proof shifts to the defendant.  Dura Corp., 703 P.2d at 406.  The defendant may then either introduce evidence on the risk benefit analysis or refute causation.  Id.


15
The plaintiff must also prove that the defect in the product was the proximate cause of plaintiff's injuries.    Prince, 685 P.2d at 89.  "It is not necessary that the plaintiff establish that the defect in the product was the sole proximate cause of injury.  The issue of proximate cause is normally one for the trier of fact, and becomes a matter of law only where reasonable minds could not differ."    Id.  (citations omitted).  The plaintiff's burden on this issue is a minimal one.  In Prince, an inadequate warning case, the court reversed a grant of summary judgment for the defendant where plaintiff's only evidence on proximate cause was his own statement that he would not have used the defendant's parachute had he been adequately warned about its characteristics.    Id. at 86.  The court held that this was sufficient to go to the jury on the issue of proximate cause.    Id. at 87-88.


16
To survive summary judgment under a strict products liability theory O'Brien would have to show that he used the chair in an intended or reasonably foreseeable fashion, that it failed to perform as safely as an ordinary or reasonable customer would have expected it to, and that his injuries were a proximate result of its failure to perform properly.  Alternatively, he would have to show that the product's design proximately caused his injury.


17
To satisfy the foreseeable use requirement the plaintiff need only establish that the use of the product, viewed objectively, was either intended, or reasonably foreseeable.    Lamer v. McKee Indus., Inc., 721 P.2d 611, 616 (Alaska 1986).  Since a ladder was not provided, it was foreseeable that some other method of gaining access to the bunk would be used.  Whether using the driver's seat was a reasonable method, as opposed to some other one, is a question for the jury since such use was not unreasonable as a matter of law.4


18
The next question is whether the product performed as safely as an ordinary consumer of the product would expect.  Unlike in Lamer, the product here is not used by a specialized group of persons.  Rental RVs are used by a variety of different people with no particular professional capabilities.  It is sufficient for O'Brien to state that the RV did not perform as he expected;  the jury can then determine whether his expectations were the same as those of the ordinary consumer of rental RVs.  O'Brien would also have to prove causation, but it appears undisputed that he injured himself through the use of the chair.  Under the first of the Beck strict products liability theories, a grant of summary judgment for the defendant was improper on a claim that the RV was defective because it lacked a ladder.5


19
In conclusion, the district court properly granted summary judgment to defendant Coachman on O'Brien's claim that Coachman negligently provided a chair with defective adjusting knobs.  The grant of summary judgment on this theory is affirmed.  Under Alaska law O'Brien made a sufficient showing to survive summary judgment under both negligence and strict liability theories on a claim that the RV was defective because it did not come equipped with a ladder.  The grant of summary judgment on these theories is vacated.  The case is remanded for further consideration in light of this opinion.  We dispense with oral argument because the facts and legal contentions are adequately presented in the materials before the Court and argument would not aid the decisional process.

 In a diversity case federal courts apply the choice of law rules of the state in which they sit.    Moore v. Subaru of America, 891 F.2d 1445, 1448 (10th Cir.1989).  In tort actions Virginia follows the rule of lex loci delicti, or place of the harm.    McMillan v. McMillan, 219 Va. 1127, 1130, 253 S.E.2d 662, 663 (1979).  Since O'Brien was injured in Alaska, Alaska law governs

 Alaska has adopted pure comparative negligence in tort cases.    Kaatz v. State, 540 P.2d 1037, 1049 (Alaska 1975).  Under pure comparative negligence a plaintiff may recover even where he was himself 99% negligent, but his damages will be reduced accordingly.  Assumption of the risk has been abolished as an affirmative defense in tort cases.    Leavitt v. Gillaspie, 443 P.2d 61, 67-69 (Alaska 1968);  Caterpillar Tractor Co. v. Beck, 593 P.2d 871, 888 (Alaska 1979).  The question of whether O'Brien unreasonably encountered a known danger when he used the chair, and thus contributed to the cause of his injuries, is subsumed within the comparative negligence analysis.    Beck, 593 P.2d at 888

 O'Brien's actual subjective knowledge of the fact that the chair swiveled and reclined is irrelevant to the question of defect.    See Lamer, 721 P.2d at 615.  If a jury finds that O'Brien was aware that the nature of the chair made it dangerous, and yet proceeded unreasonably and voluntarily to encounter this known risk, it may reduce any damage award on the basis of his comparative negligence.  However, it is irrelevant in terms of the reasonable foreseeability of such use by O'Brien.  See id

 Since we conclude that O'Brien made a sufficient showing to survive summary judgment under the first Beck test, we do not address whether he had made a sufficient showing under the second
