 Educational Background



 
Class of 2008 


Princeton University

                  Princeton University is a vibrant community of scholarship and learning that stands in the nation's service and in the service of all nations. Chartered in 1746, Princeton is the fourth-oldest college in the United States. Princeton is an independent, coeducational, nondenominational institution that provides undergraduate and graduate instruction in the humanities, social sciences, natural sciences and engineering.

As a world-renowned research university, Princeton seeks to achieve the highest levels of distinction in the discovery and transmission of knowledge and understanding. At the same time, Princeton is distinctive among research universities in its commitment to undergraduate teaching.

Today, more than 1,100 faculty members instruct approximately 5,000 undergraduate students and 2,500 graduate students. The University's generous financial aid program ensures that talented students from all economic backgrounds can afford a Princeton education.                





 Career History



Analyst

                                    2012 - Current                


Altalis Capital Management LLC


                  Altalis Capital Management utilizes a variety of methods and strategies to make investment decisions and recommendations. The firm utilizes a globally diversified approach that primarily relies on a fundamental, data-driven process to generate both long and short investments. Their core investment universe is in North American equities, across all sectors. The firm's equity strategy primarily focuses on a value investment style, based on fundamental research. Altalis may also invest in non-North American equities or non-equity strategies on an opportunistic basis. While the firm has a broad mandate which allows for the investment in credit and other instruments, it is generally expected that non-equity investments and investments outside North America will constitute less than 20% of the portfolio.

 Career History



Managing Member

                                    2012 - Current                


Altalis Capital Management LLC


                  Altalis Capital Management utilizes a variety of methods and strategies to make investment decisions and recommendations. The firm utilizes a globally diversified approach that primarily relies on a fundamental, data-driven process to generate both long and short investments. Their core investment universe is in North American equities, across all sectors. The firm's equity strategy primarily focuses on a value investment style, based on fundamental research. Altalis may also invest in non-North American equities or non-equity strategies on an opportunistic basis. While the firm has a broad mandate which allows for the investment in credit and other instruments, it is generally expected that non-equity investments and investments outside North America will constitute less than 20% of the portfolio.

                                    Tenure Unconfirmed                


Taconic Capital Advisors UK LLP


                  TCA UK is an active, research-driven, probabilistic manager which follows a team-oriented investment approach and a distributed decision-making process. The firm constructs relatively concentrated portfolios on a bottom-up basis using fundamental and risk/reward analysis. The co-portfolio managers size positions and make investment decisions for the funds. The firm utilizes probabilistic investing and focuses on companies undergoing change to their business or capital structures. They employ fundamental, legal and regulatory analyses to identify misperceptions and mispricings with the potential to lead to outsized returns on capital. The funds also include fundamental deep-value investments that typically have a soft catalyst.  The Opportunity Fund invests in merger arbitrage, special situations, distressed and capital structure arbitrage. The funds typically have a long bias and the firm actively manages the potential downside risk of the overall portfolio. Individual positions with offsetting short hedges are implemented when appropriate.The firm's hedging philosophy aims to limit losses and preserve capital during severe market dislocations. Macro portfolio hedges are the primary method of protecting against portfolio tail risk. The firm searches for inexpensive volatility in an effort to build a diversified portfolio of hedges with the goal of limiting overall portfolio risk. The risk management and portfolio management teams are separate and distinct, providing appropriate checks and balances. The Co-Portfolio Managers shape the portfolio on a regular basis with respect to factor risks.  The portfolio is manually stress tested and stress test results and factor risk analyses are reviewed by the full risk management team at regular risk meetings. If the stress test yields an expected loss greater than 10%, the portfolio is adjusted and/or portfolio hedges are increased.
