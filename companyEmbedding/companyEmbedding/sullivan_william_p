Johns Hopkins University - Carey Business School

                    Timid doesn’t play well here. Since its founding in 1876 as the first research university in the United States, Johns Hopkins has been proving that risk is worth taking when attacking the most vexing problems of society – poverty, corruption, illness, ignorance.

We believe that business, by embracing the bigger picture, has the power to change the world in a positive way. We don’t educate business men and business women; we educate humanistic business leaders and entrepreneurs who can transform business and in the process help our society thrive. A thriving society, after all, is the best setting in which to do business and benefit the investor. Business should be a solution to society’s challenges, not their cause.

Business success is not an end unto itself. It should be the means for building a more successful society.
