UMA Enterprises | Long Point Capital










































 













UMA Enterprises



www.umainc.com
Business Description
UMA Enterprises, Inc. is a leading full-service importer and wholesaler of home décor products. Headquartered in Compton, CA, UMA is distinguished by its broad product offering, competitive price points, and high degree of customer service. UMA serves a diverse customer base including specialty retail stores, furniture stores, discount stores, distributors, and non-traditional home décor retailers throughout the United States.
Transaction Overview
Long Point Capital invested in UMA through a leveraged recapitalization structure, where the owners of the Company monetized the majority of the illiquid value contained in their business, while continuing to retain a significant ownership interest in the Company and maintaining operational control along with the existing management team.
Post-Transaction
UMA has continued its strong growth by adding new product categories and higher-end products, and expanding its international distribution. As a step to achieving liquidity for its investors, Long Point has sold the Company to a newly-formed ESOP while retaining a significant investment in the Company.
Add-On Acquisition Criteria
UMA is seeking acquisitions of niche companies of any size that sell complementary products while expanding the Company’s customer base.

"Funded.com has been great and my project is in the final stages of being funded by an investor I found on here. I was surprized at the quick process and how fast investors funded my project. Website was a big help!"

Let me first start by saying I believe your site is THE BEST there is for connecting Entrepreneurs and Investors.  It is the site I've had most success with.  I had about 6 Investors either respond back or contact me because of your site with an interest in investing in my company. Thank you very much!  I love your site and will recommend it to any of my Colleagues.  I love the fact that we are able to contact the Investors directly (which many of the sites joining Entrepreneurs and Investors don't allow).  It looks like I'm about to go into contract with an Investor because of your site.  Thank you again.

I am grateful I had the opportunity to access your network of investors. I am reasonably confident that the current negotiations with one of your investors will go through for our film production. I will be back for my next production.
