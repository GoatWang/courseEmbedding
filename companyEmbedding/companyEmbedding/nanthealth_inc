FALSE REPORTING
While it is not befitting for us to dignify false reporting or be distracted by false claims, both an online health trade publication and an online political publication, published articles containing numerous inaccuracies. Letters we wrote to these publications, pointing out those inaccuracies, are posted on NantHealth’s website. As just one example:
The reporter stated, that NantWorks purchased the Jefferson property from the foundation for $6 million. That statement is false. What is worse, the reporter had the facts before he published the article, that NantWorks in fact paid $15.5M. Yet he published a false statement of apparent self-dealing by NantWorks by stating a fabricated amount of $6M.
The written statement the reporter sent to Dr. Soon-Shiong in his interview before the story published demonstrated this fact. He wrote: “According to our review of your form 990s, the NantHealth Foundation sold nearly $15.5 million in assets to NantWorks, LLC,” which clearly demonstrates that he knew he was publishing a false number. Thus, the reporter was well aware and understood the false and defamatory implication of what he wrote.
The reporter’s assertion that NantWorks paid $6M is also belied as can be seen in the foundations publicly viewable tax returns. The foundation sold the 9920 Jefferson property in May, 2012 to NantWorks for $15,450,000. The price was based on two appraisals, which came in within 99% of each other, by unaffiliated and well-regarded real estate appraisal firms. Upon advice of counsel, the disinterested foundation directors decided to sell the real estate to NantWorks, at the median price between the two appraisals. Dr. Soon-Shiong did not participate in the directors’ decision. Rather, he disclosed his conflict to the foundation’s board and recused himself from the meeting before the vote.
We demanded a retraction and correction but so far, the editors declined.

Our Company
NantHealth is a next-generation, evidence-based, personalized healthcare company enabling improved patient outcomes and more effective treatment decisions for critical illnesses. NantHealth‘s unique systems-based approach to personalized healthcare integrates novel diagnostics with large-scale, biometric and phenotypic data to track patient outcomes and deliver precision medicine. In addition, NantHealth’s adaptive learning system, CLINICS™, continuously improves decision-making and further optimizes our clinical pathways and decision algorithms over time.
Our Mission
The current healthcare system is complex, dynamic and fragmented across competing priorities of medical research, care delivery and value-based reimbursement—inhibiting interoperability and coordination, producing excessive systemic costs and suboptimal patient outcomes. What’s more, it is extremely challenging to bring the best advancements in care to patients fast enough. Our mission is to change that.
We have developed our Comprehensive Learning Integrated NantHealth Intelligent Clinical System, or CLINICS, an integrated and adaptive model for the delivery of healthcare. It consists of a comprehensive suite of solutions that bridge across three often-siloed domains – knowledge, care delivery, and payer – to create a cohesive, coordinated system in which the best available knowledge is always available to clinicians to drive informed, evidence-based healthcare delivery, and outcomes information is readily available to tune and refine this system over time, and thereby drive healthcare improvement. Through CLINICS, we can rally the power of innovation to:

Empower providers to seamlessly act on the best evidence-based information available to better fulfill their roles as caregivers rather than as financial managers
Provide payers with the necessary tools to better fulfill their roles as stewards of an increasingly complex and rapidly evolving healthcare system,
Facilitate biopharmaceutical companies to accelerate development of drugs for critical illnesses based upon the unique biology and specific health conditions of patients
Empower patients with the knowledge to enable active participation in the management of their own health, or self-care

Our unique systems-based approach to the science and delivery of precision care is powered by our integrated and adaptive Systems Infrastructure, Knowledge Platform, Provider Platform and Payor Platform, which we refer to collectively as CLINICS™.

 



Systems Infrastructure
Systems Infrastructure includes the software, middleware, and hardware modules that organize and integrate the data streams that form the foundation of our adaptive learning system. Our Systems Infrastructure, which is built on a secure, HIPAA-compliant cloud environment, features:

Access to next-generation, genomic and proteomic sequencing technologies with near real-time bioinformatics; access to a secure HIPAA-compliant cloud environment
An open architecture, service-oriented platform enabling the integration and interoperability of disparate electronic medical records through 250 clinical, financial, and operational systems connectors and 300 infrastructure and healthcare services
Device connectivity in more than 350 hospitals and roughly 30,000 unique medical devices, which collect tens of billions of vital signs annually


 

Knowledge Platform
Our Knowledge Platform is a comprehensive set of advanced diagnostics and decision support solutions to enable our clients to improve decision-making and determine the right treatment before treatment begins. Our molecular test, GPS Cancer™, is the only comprehensive and commercially available clinical cancer platform integrating whole genome (DNA) sequencing – comparing both a patient’s normal and tumor tissue, whole transcriptome (RNA) sequencing, and quantitative proteomics to generate actionable information into to a clinical report for oncologists. Our decision support platform (eviti) gives providers access to nearly 13,000 active clinical trials updated weekly and over 2,500 evidence-based treatment regimens for cancer care. Today, over 75% of all oncology practices nationwide have used eviti.

 

Provider Platform
Our provider software solutions, built on NantOS™, leverages the data available on our Systems Infrastructure to enable patient-centered engagement and coordination across care locations. Our web-based and mobile apps include patient, provider and collaboration portals for advanced care coordination. This includes vitals connectivity, clinical and administrative workflows, eligibility and benefits, claims, referral and readmissions management solutions, secure messaging and analytical applications to measure outcomes and costs. Our flexible applications analyze and interpret patient- and provider-specific information and deliver critical clinical and administrative insights. Today, our provider platform solutions are used by hundreds of health systems and provider offices globally.

 

Payor Platform
Our payor apps enable practice managers and caregivers to facilitate payment for value. Our payor-provider collaboration platform, NaviNet Open, offers provider end-users a uniform set of workflows and services across many payors with whom they routinely collaborate. This includes eligibility and benefits, claims submission, referrals, and authorizations. Our payor apps also identify high-risk patient populations, implement advanced diagnostics and real-time biometric patient monitoring solutions to identify opportunities for precision medicine and preventive interventions, and enable provider and payor engagement in integrated and coordinated value-based models. Today, we have over 70 health plans as clients representing over 70 million covered lives and growing.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.
The technique has proven to be very useful for finding positive surprises. In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time, while they also saw 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    1.26      Net Money Flow ($)  23,868    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

FALSE REPORTING
While it is not befitting for us to dignify false reporting or be distracted by false claims, both an online health trade publication and an online political publication, published articles containing numerous inaccuracies. Letters we wrote to these publications, pointing out those inaccuracies, are posted on NantHealth’s website. As just one example:
The reporter stated, that NantWorks purchased the Jefferson property from the foundation for $6 million. That statement is false. What is worse, the reporter had the facts before he published the article, that NantWorks in fact paid $15.5M. Yet he published a false statement of apparent self-dealing by NantWorks by stating a fabricated amount of $6M.
The written statement the reporter sent to Dr. Soon-Shiong in his interview before the story published demonstrated this fact. He wrote: “According to our review of your form 990s, the NantHealth Foundation sold nearly $15.5 million in assets to NantWorks, LLC,” which clearly demonstrates that he knew he was publishing a false number. Thus, the reporter was well aware and understood the false and defamatory implication of what he wrote.
The reporter’s assertion that NantWorks paid $6M is also belied as can be seen in the foundations publicly viewable tax returns. The foundation sold the 9920 Jefferson property in May, 2012 to NantWorks for $15,450,000. The price was based on two appraisals, which came in within 99% of each other, by unaffiliated and well-regarded real estate appraisal firms. Upon advice of counsel, the disinterested foundation directors decided to sell the real estate to NantWorks, at the median price between the two appraisals. Dr. Soon-Shiong did not participate in the directors’ decision. Rather, he disclosed his conflict to the foundation’s board and recused himself from the meeting before the vote.
We demanded a retraction and correction but so far, the editors declined.
