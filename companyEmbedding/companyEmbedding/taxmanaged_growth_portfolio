Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market vola tility, the Fund’s current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value (NAV) with all distributions reinvested. Returns for other classes of share s offered by the Fund are different. Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative. After-tax returns are calculated using certain assumptions, including using the highest historical individual federal income tax rates, and do not reflect the  impact of state/local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on a shareholder's tax situation and the actual characterization of distributions and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns are not relevant to shareholders who hold shares in tax-defe rred accounts or shares held by nontaxable entities. Return After Taxes on Distributions may be the same as Return Before Taxes for the same period because no taxable distributions were made during that period. Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sal e of Fund Shares may be greater than or equal to Return After Taxes on Distributions for the same period because of losses realized on the sale of Fund shares. Before-tax and after-tax returns for other classes of shares offered by the Fund are different . Max Sales Charge: 5.75%.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considere d a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding  consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.The Overall Morningstar Rat ing for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns,  60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most  weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load.©2017 Morningstar. All  Rights Reserved.

		Why invest in this Fund?
The fund seeks long-term capital appreciation consistent with minimizing realized capital gains. To pursue its goal, the fund normally invests at least 80% of its net assets, plus any borrowings for investment purposes, in common stocks and employs a   tax-managed strategy. The fund focuses on 'blue-chip' companies with market capitalizations exceeding $5 billion at the time of purchase, including multinational companies.The fund employs a 'buy-and-hold' investment strategy, which generally has resulted in an annual portfolio turnover of below 15%.

		The S&P 500® Index is widely regarded as the best single gauge of large-cap U.S. equities. The index includes 500 leading companies and captures approximately 80% coverage of available market capitalization.The total return performance figures presented for Class I shares of the fund represent the performance of the fund's Class A for periods prior to May 14, 2004, the inception date for Class I shares, and the performance of Class I, respectively, from that inception date. Performance reflects the applicable class' distribution/servicing fees since the inception date. Had these fees and expenses been reflected for periods prior, performance would have been different. Investors should consider, when deciding whether to purchase a particular class of shares, the investment amount, anticipated holding period and other relevant factors.


Average Annual Returns After Taxes

After-tax returns are calculated using the highest historical individual federal marginal income tax rates, and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor's tax situation and may differ from those shown here and are not relevant to investors who hold their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts.
Return after taxes on distributions (pre-liquidation) assume an investor held shares throughout the measurement period and reflect the effect of taxable distributions (assuming reinvestment in the fund) by a fund to its shareholders.
Return after taxes on distributions and sale of fund shares (post-liquidation) assume an investor sold shares at the end of the measurement period and, therefore, reflect the effect of both taxable distributions and any taxable gain or loss realized by the shareholder upon sale of fund shares.

If a third-party estimate for the current year EPS is not available, Morningstar will calculate an internal estimate based on the most recently reported EPS and average historical earnings growth rates. Price/ earnings is one of the five value factors used to calculate the Morningstar Style Box.

An R-squared of 100 indicates fund movements that are perfectly correlated to those of the benchmark.

For example, the R-squared of both a small cap, domestic equity fund and a domestic technology fund would be determined against the S&P 500 Index.

The performance data quoted represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Share price and investment return fluctuate and an investor's shares may be worth more or less than original cost upon redemption. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance quoted. Please use the pulldown menu above to view month-end performance.

After-tax returns are calculated using the highest historical individual federal marginal income tax rates, and do not reflect the impact of state and local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on an investor's tax situation and may differ from those shown here and are not relevant to investors who hold their fund shares through tax-deferred arrangements such as 401(k) plans or individual retirement accounts. A fund's past performance, both before and after taxes, is not indicative of its future performance. For funds which offer more than one class of shares, after-tax returns are shown for only one share class and after-tax returns for other share classes will vary.

Notes & Disclosures
 Performance is historical and not indicative of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate and an investor will receive more or less than the original cost upon redemption. Investors should consider, when deciding whether to purchase a particular class of shares, the investment amount, anticipated holding period and other relevant factors, and should read the prospectus carefully.Pre-liquidation, after-tax returns assume an investor held shares throughout the measurement period(s) and reflect the effect of taxable distributions (assuming reinvestment in the fund) by a fund to its shareholders.Post-liquidation, after-tax returns assume an investor sold shares at the end of the measurement period(s) and, therefore, reflect the effect of both taxable distributions and any taxable gain or loss realized by the shareholder upon sale of fund shares.Source: Morningstar, Inc.

StyleboxThe stylebox gives information about a fund’s investment style in visual form.For equity funds, a stylebox’s rows and columns indicate market capitalization (small, mid, large) and investment style (value, blend, growth); for fixed income funds, its rows and columns indicate credit quality and/or duration (short, medium, long).Two important things about a fund are shown in its stylebox:Central tendency. The fund’s central tendency reflects the aggregate characteristics resulting from the fund’s approach to security selection. Because it is based on an analysis of the performance characteristics of the fund’s potential holdings over long periods, the central tendency is expected to be relatively stable. In the stylebox, it is shown as a dot within the shaded oval.Expected range. Within the fund’s universe of potential holdings, and depending on the fund’s investment approach, some categories of investments will be owned more frequently; together, they are known as the expected range. In the stylebox, the expected range of frequently owned categories is represented by a shaded oval.Note: Styleboxes for  fixed income funds uses duration rather than average weighted maturity. Duration is a more accurate measure of interest rate sensitivity because it takes into consideration all mortgage prepayments, puts, and adjustable coupons.

The value of a single share is called its share value or share price.For money market funds that seek to maintain a stable price per share, the NAV is calculated by valuing securities at amortized cost, which approximates market value.

SEC yield
A non-money market fund's SEC yield is based on a formula mandated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that calculates a fund's hypothetical annualized income, as a percentage of its assets. A security's income, for the purposes of this calculation, is based on the current market yield to maturity (in the case of bonds) or projected dividend yield (for stocks) of the fund's holdings over a trailing 30 day period. This hypothetical income will differ (at times, significantly) from the fund's actual experience; as a result, income distributions from the fund may be higher or lower than implied by the SEC yield.The SEC yield for a money market fund is calculated by annualizing its daily income distributions for the previous seven days.

Fees and minimums




Purchase fee:
A fee charged by some mutual funds when an investor buys shares. This fee is not a sales charge or load because it is paid directly to the fund to offset the costs of trading certain securities.


None



Redemption fee:
A fee charged by some mutual funds when an investor sells shares. A redemption fee differs from a back-end load because the money is paid back into the fund. Many funds charge redemption fees only when shares are bought and then sold within a specific period of time, generally in an effort to discourage market-timing and short-term trading. Some brokers also charge their clients redemption fees for the sale of securities.

An investment in the fund could lose money over short or even long periods. You should expect the fund’s share price and total return to fluctuate within a wide range, like the fluctuations of the overall stock market. Because of the fund’s policy of realizing losses to help offset capital gains, its performance will periodically deviate from that of the S&P 500 Index. However, over time this deviation is expected to be relatively modest. The fund’s performance could be hurt by: Stock market risk: The chance that stock prices overall will decline. Stock markets tend to move in cycles, with periods of rising stock prices and periods of falling stock prices. The fund’s target index may, at times, become focused in stocks of a particular sector, category, or group of companies.Investment style risk: The chance that returns from large-capitalization stocks will trail returns from the overall stock market. Large-cap stocks tend to go through cycles of doing better—or worse—than other segments of the stock market or the stock market in general. These periods have, in the past, lasted for as long as several years.

 Fact SheetMar 31, 2017







The Fund
Managed with a focus on after-tax portfolio returns, the Fund invests primarily in stocks of U.S. companies that are expected to, among other things, grow faster than the overall U.S. economy. The growth companies held by the Fund may be of varying sizes , including established large-cap market leaders, as well as less seasoned small- and midcap companies.



The Approach
The Fund employs a primarily bottom-up approach to identify stocks that appear reasonably priced relative to their fundamental prospects, and that management believes will grow in value over time. Stock selection involves consideration of price appreciat ion potential, risk/return characteristics and other factors. To help limit shareholder taxes, the Fund generally seeks to minimize taxable distributions.



The Features
The Fund leverages the analytical expertise and collaboration of two experienced investment professionals. Its focus on after-tax returns may be well-suited to tax-sensitive investors, while its emphasis on growth-oriented companies may appeal to investo rs seeking long-term capital appreciation. In addition, its “multicap” approach provides the Fund managers the flexibility to pursue growth opportunities up and down the market-capitalization spectrum as warranted.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate so that shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Performance is for the stated time period only; due to market vola tility, the Fund’s current performance may be lower or higher than quoted. Returns are historical and are calculated by determining the percentage change in net asset value (NAV) with all distributions reinvested. Returns for other classes of share s offered by the Fund are different. Performance less than or equal to one year is cumulative. After-tax returns are calculated using certain assumptions, including using the highest historical individual federal income tax rates, and do not reflect the  impact of state/local taxes. Actual after-tax returns depend on a shareholder's tax situation and the actual characterization of distributions and may differ from those shown. After-tax returns are not relevant to shareholders who hold shares in tax-defe rred accounts or shares held by nontaxable entities. Return After Taxes on Distributions may be the same as Return Before Taxes for the same period because no taxable distributions were made during that period. Return After Taxes on Distributions and Sal e of Fund Shares may be greater than or equal to Return After Taxes on Distributions for the same period because of losses realized on the sale of Fund shares. Before-tax and after-tax returns for other classes of shares offered by the Fund are different . Max Sales Charge: 5.75%.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considere d a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding  consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.The Overall Morningstar Rat ing for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns,  60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most  weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load.©2017 Morningstar. All  Rights Reserved.

Data quoted is past performance and current performance may be lower or higher. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.Risk Factors. The value of the Fund's shares will change, and you could lose money on your investment. Tax-management strategies may alter investment decisions and affect portfolio holdings, when compared to those of non tax-managed mutual funds. Market conditions may limit the Fund’s ability to realize tax losses or to generate dividend income that is taxed at favorable Federal income tax rates. In addition, the Fund’s tax-managed strategy may cause the Fund to hold a security in order to achieve more favorable tax-treatment or to sell a security in order to realize tax losses, which could result in losses that exceed any benefits of the tax-managed strategy. The Fund’s ability to utilize various tax-management techniques may be curtailed or eliminated in the future by tax legislation or regulations. While the fund seeks to minimize tax distributions to shareholders, it may realize capital gains and earn some dividends. Not all funds or fund classes may be offered at all broker/dealers. These and other risks are more fully described in the Fund’s prospectus. Index Description: The Russell 1000 Growth Index measures the performance of the large-cap growth segment of the U.S. equity universe. It is not possible to invest directly in an index.Performance results for some funds may include the effect of expense reduction arrangements. If those arrangements had not been in place, the performance results would have been lower.The Class Y shares of Waddell & Reed Advisors Tax-Managed Equity Fund were reorganized as the Class I shares of Ivy Tax-Managed Equity Fund on May 18, 2009. The performance shown for periods prior to this date is that of the Class Y shares of Waddell & Reed Advisors Tax-Managed Equity Fund. Performance has not been restated to reflect the estimated annual operating expenses of the Ivy Tax-Managed Equity Fund. If those expenses were reflected, performance shown would differ. Ivy Tax-Managed Equity Fund Class I shares are not subject to sales charges.Pricing: All prices and year-to-date returns are based on closing quotes unless noted, as supplied to the NASDAQ by 6:00 p.m. Eastern time. YTD Prices can be updated 3 to 4 hours after the Daily Pricing information which can result in mismatching data.Style Analysis: The Morningstar Style Box reveals a fund's investment style. For equity funds the vertical axis shows the market capitalization of the stocks owned and the horizontal axis shows investment style (value, blend, or growth). For fixed-income funds, the vertical axis shows the credit quality of the bonds owned and the horizontal axis shows interest rate sensitivity as measured by a bond's effective duration. Morningstar seeks credit rating information from fund companies on a periodic basis (e.g., quarterly). In compiling credit rating information, Morningstar instructs fund companies to only use ratings that have been assigned by the following Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations (NRSROs): Moody's, Standard & Poor's, Fitch, and Egan-Jones. If two NRSROs have rated a security, fund companies are to report the lowest rating; if three or more NRSROs have rated the same security differently, fund companies are to report the rating that is in the middle. For example, if NRSRO X rates a security AA-, NRSRO Y rates the same security an A and NRSRO Z rates it a BBB+, the fund company should use the credit rating of 'A' in its reporting to Morningstar. PLEASE NOTE: Morningstar, Inc. is not itself an NRSRO nor does it issue a credit rating on the fund. An NRSRO rating on a fixed-income security can change from time-to-time. For credit quality, Morningstar combines the credit rating information provided by the fund companies with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weighted-average credit quality. The weighted-average credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading NRSRO. Bond funds are assigned a style box placement of "low", "medium", or "high" based on their average credit quality. Funds with a low credit quality are those whose weighted-average credit quality is determined to be less than "BBB-"; medium are those less than "AA-", but greater or equal to "BBB-"; and high are those with a weighted-average credit quality of "AA-" or higher. When classifying a bond portfolio, Morningstar first maps the NRSRO credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates (as determined by Morningstar's analysis of actual historical default rates). Morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund. Finally, Morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve. For interest-rate sensitivity, Morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. Generally, Morningstar classifies a fixed-income fund's interest-rate sensitivity based on the effective duration of the Morningstar Core Bond Index (MCBI), which is currently three years. The classification of Limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between 25% to 75% of MCBI's average effective duration; funds whose average effective duration is between 75% to 125% of the MCBI will be classified as Moderate; and those that are at 125% or greater of the average effective duration of the MCBI will be classified as Extensive. For municipal bond funds, Morningstar also obtains from fund companies the average effective duration. In these cases static breakpoints are utilized. These breakpoints are as follows: (i) Limited: 4.5 years or less; (ii) Moderate: more than 4.5 years but less than 7 years; and (iii) Extensive: more than 7 years. In addition, for non-US taxable and non-US domiciled fixed income funds static duration breakpoints are used: (i) Limited: less than or equal to 3.5 years; (ii) Moderate: greater than 3.5 and less than equal to 6 years; (iii) Extensive: greater than 6 years.Unsubsidized yields reflect what the yield would have been without the effect of reimbursements and waivers. The adviser and its affiliates have or may voluntarily waive a portion of their fees (including, but not limited to, distribution and service (12b-1) fees) and reimburse certain expenses. There is no guarantee that the fund will avoid a negative yield. Such undertaking may be amended or withdrawn at any time. 12-Month Trailing Distribution Yield: at NAV refers to the 12-month historical cash flow paid over the past 12 months in dividends, divided by the past months ending NAV. Alpha, Beta, R-Squared, Standard Deviation, Sharpe Ratio and Capture Ratio are 5 year statistics. Alpha is a measure of a fund's actual returns and expected performance, given its level of risk (as measured by beta). Beta reflects the sensitivity of the fund's return to fluctuations in the market index. R-squared indicates how much of a fund's fluctuations were attributable to movements in the fund's benchmark. Standard deviation is a measure of how volatile a fund's returns are. Sharpe ratio is a measure of a fund's risk-adjusted performance. Capture ratio reflects the annualized product of fund vs. index returns for all months in which the index had a positive return (upside capture) or negative return (downside capture).The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance, and does not include the effects of sales charges. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.  © 2017 Morningstar, Inc.
