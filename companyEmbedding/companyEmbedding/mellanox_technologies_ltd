Company overview[edit]
Mellanox Technologies provides InfiniBand and Ethernet switches for servers and storage used in enterprise data centers[4] and also makes its own integrated circuits to support the InfiniBand protocol.[5] Mellanox offers interconnect products: adapters, switches, software and silicon for a range of markets including high-performance computing, enterprise data centers, Web 2.0, cloud, storage and financial services.
The company is listed on NASDAQ under the symbol "MLNX".
In 2016, Mellanox Technologies began to employ programmers in the Gaza Strip, in addition to its team of Israeli Arab programmers and programmers in Ramallah and Nablus.[6]
History[edit]
Mellanox was founded in 1999 by former executives of Intel Corporation and Galileo Technology (which was acquired by Marvell Technology Group in October 2000 for $2.8 billion[7]) Eyal Waldman, Shai Cohen, Roni Ashuri, Micheal Kagan, Evelyn Landman, Eitan Zahavi, Shimon Rottemberg, Udi Katz and Alon Webman.[3] Initially founded as a integrated circuit (chip) manufacturer, it evolved into a producer of complete end-to-end systems by 2009.[8] The company raised over $89 million in 3 financing rounds of venture capital.[when?] [9][10]
The company went public in 2007, with an initial public offering on NASDAQ that raised $102 million, and valued the company at over half a billion dollars.[11] In 2010, Oracle Corporation became a major investor in the company, holding around 10% of its stock.[9] Oracle uses InfiniBand technology in its Exadata and Exalogic appliances.[12] In February 2011, Mellanox acquired Voltaire Ltd., a provider of data center switches for about $218 million.[13][5] Stock shares were also listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, until 2013 when the company de-listed itself, but remained on NASDAQ.[14]
Acquisitions[edit]
In February 2016, Mellanox acquired publicly-held EZchip Semiconductor, a provider of network processors and multi-core processors from EZchip's earlier acquisition of Tilera.
In July 2014, Mellanox acquired privately-held Integrity Project, for its software connectivity, low-level development, real-time applications and security technology.[15]
In July 2013, Mellanox acquired privately-held Kotura, Inc., a developer of silicon photonics optical interconnect technology for high-speed networking.[16]
In July 2013, Mellanox acquired privately-held IPtronics A/S, a designer of optical interconnect components for digital communications.[17]
In 2013 Mellanox acquired certain assets of XLoom Communications Ltd., including opto-electric chip-scale packaging, as well as hired XLoom's technology personnel.
Manufacturing[edit]
Mellanox is a fabless semiconductor company.[18] The current generation of its chips are produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp.[19]
Products and market[edit]
In 2010, a press release from Oracle described Mellanox as "the premier switched fabric provider for enterprise data centers and high performance computing". According to the same press release, Mellanox's InfiniBand technology is faster, more scalable and provides higher throughput than alternative communications technologies.[20] Larry Ellison, CEO of Oracle, promoted Mellanox’s main technology, InfiniBand.[8]

SwitchX is a multi-protocol ASIC that handles both InfinBand and Ethernet traffic.[19] It builds on the older 90 nanometer architecture of ConnectX technology, originally developed by Mellanox to support both Ethernet and Infiniband on one chip.[11] SwitchX is the fifth generation, using a 40 nanometer process with 1.4 billion transistors on a 45mm by 45mm chip.[19]
ConnectX-3 is a 10/40GbE adapter for VMware ESXi 5.0 that provides virtual protocol interconnect, meaning it can run 10 Gigabit Ethernet, 40Gb Ethernet, or Infiniband at up to 56Gb per second from the same card.[4] ConnectX-4 and ConnectX-5 adapters have enhanced capabilities.[21][22] The ConnectX architecture has been described as "novel", with excellent performance that is "very well suited for modern multi-core platforms."[23]

High-performance computing[edit]
Mellanox Technologies' InfiniBand products for computer clusters have been deployed in many of the TOP500 list of high-performance computers.[24] They provide high performance and some include a TCP offload engine.[citation needed]
Storage[edit]
Mellanox also promotes its products for storage area networks.[citation needed]
Customers[edit]
As of 2011[update] Mellanox derived more than a quarter of its revenues from two large customers, Hewlett-Packard and IBM.[25] Intel Corporation accounts for over 2% of revenues.[26] As of June 2011, Oracle owns 10% of Mellanox and is also a major customer.[27] Other customers include Chevron, Viacom, JPMorgan, Comcast and Airbus.[28]
Hiring practices[edit]
Mellanox outsourced some of its engineering to the West Bank. Rather than setting up offshore engineering centers in the Far East or Eastern Europe, Mellanox hired Palestinian engineers from Ramallah through a Palestinian outsourcing firm.[29] Waldman stated that Mellanox would build a research and development center in Ramallah even though it is more expensive than outsourcing to Eastern Europe.[30]
Awards and recognition[edit]

In November 2012, Mellanox was named one of the Fastest Growing Companies in Deloitte's 2012 Technology Fast 500 Rankings.[31]
In November 2012, Mellanox was awarded - 'Readers’ Choice: Best HPC Interconnect Product or Technology' from HPCwire[32]

Company overview[edit]
Mellanox Technologies provides InfiniBand and Ethernet switches for servers and storage used in enterprise data centers[4] and also makes its own integrated circuits to support the InfiniBand protocol.[5] Mellanox offers interconnect products: adapters, switches, software and silicon for a range of markets including high-performance computing, enterprise data centers, Web 2.0, cloud, storage and financial services.
The company is listed on NASDAQ under the symbol "MLNX".
In 2016, Mellanox Technologies began to employ programmers in the Gaza Strip, in addition to its team of Israeli Arab programmers and programmers in Ramallah and Nablus.[6]
History[edit]
Mellanox was founded in 1999 by former executives of Intel Corporation and Galileo Technology (which was acquired by Marvell Technology Group in October 2000 for $2.8 billion[7]) Eyal Waldman, Shai Cohen, Roni Ashuri, Micheal Kagan, Evelyn Landman, Eitan Zahavi, Shimon Rottemberg, Udi Katz and Alon Webman.[3] Initially founded as a integrated circuit (chip) manufacturer, it evolved into a producer of complete end-to-end systems by 2009.[8] The company raised over $89 million in 3 financing rounds of venture capital.[when?] [9][10]
The company went public in 2007, with an initial public offering on NASDAQ that raised $102 million, and valued the company at over half a billion dollars.[11] In 2010, Oracle Corporation became a major investor in the company, holding around 10% of its stock.[9] Oracle uses InfiniBand technology in its Exadata and Exalogic appliances.[12] In February 2011, Mellanox acquired Voltaire Ltd., a provider of data center switches for about $218 million.[13][5] Stock shares were also listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, until 2013 when the company de-listed itself, but remained on NASDAQ.[14]
Acquisitions[edit]
In February 2016, Mellanox acquired publicly-held EZchip Semiconductor, a provider of network processors and multi-core processors from EZchip's earlier acquisition of Tilera.
In July 2014, Mellanox acquired privately-held Integrity Project, for its software connectivity, low-level development, real-time applications and security technology.[15]
In July 2013, Mellanox acquired privately-held Kotura, Inc., a developer of silicon photonics optical interconnect technology for high-speed networking.[16]
In July 2013, Mellanox acquired privately-held IPtronics A/S, a designer of optical interconnect components for digital communications.[17]
In 2013 Mellanox acquired certain assets of XLoom Communications Ltd., including opto-electric chip-scale packaging, as well as hired XLoom's technology personnel.
Manufacturing[edit]
Mellanox is a fabless semiconductor company.[18] The current generation of its chips are produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp.[19]
Products and market[edit]
In 2010, a press release from Oracle described Mellanox as "the premier switched fabric provider for enterprise data centers and high performance computing". According to the same press release, Mellanox's InfiniBand technology is faster, more scalable and provides higher throughput than alternative communications technologies.[20] Larry Ellison, CEO of Oracle, promoted Mellanox’s main technology, InfiniBand.[8]

SwitchX is a multi-protocol ASIC that handles both InfinBand and Ethernet traffic.[19] It builds on the older 90 nanometer architecture of ConnectX technology, originally developed by Mellanox to support both Ethernet and Infiniband on one chip.[11] SwitchX is the fifth generation, using a 40 nanometer process with 1.4 billion transistors on a 45mm by 45mm chip.[19]
ConnectX-3 is a 10/40GbE adapter for VMware ESXi 5.0 that provides virtual protocol interconnect, meaning it can run 10 Gigabit Ethernet, 40Gb Ethernet, or Infiniband at up to 56Gb per second from the same card.[4] ConnectX-4 and ConnectX-5 adapters have enhanced capabilities.[21][22] The ConnectX architecture has been described as "novel", with excellent performance that is "very well suited for modern multi-core platforms."[23]

High-performance computing[edit]
Mellanox Technologies' InfiniBand products for computer clusters have been deployed in many of the TOP500 list of high-performance computers.[24] They provide high performance and some include a TCP offload engine.[citation needed]
Storage[edit]
Mellanox also promotes its products for storage area networks.[citation needed]
Customers[edit]
As of 2011[update] Mellanox derived more than a quarter of its revenues from two large customers, Hewlett-Packard and IBM.[25] Intel Corporation accounts for over 2% of revenues.[26] As of June 2011, Oracle owns 10% of Mellanox and is also a major customer.[27] Other customers include Chevron, Viacom, JPMorgan, Comcast and Airbus.[28]
Hiring practices[edit]
Mellanox outsourced some of its engineering to the West Bank. Rather than setting up offshore engineering centers in the Far East or Eastern Europe, Mellanox hired Palestinian engineers from Ramallah through a Palestinian outsourcing firm.[29] Waldman stated that Mellanox would build a research and development center in Ramallah even though it is more expensive than outsourcing to Eastern Europe.[30]
Awards and recognition[edit]

In November 2012, Mellanox was named one of the Fastest Growing Companies in Deloitte's 2012 Technology Fast 500 Rankings.[31]
In November 2012, Mellanox was awarded - 'Readers’ Choice: Best HPC Interconnect Product or Technology' from HPCwire[32]

Company overview[edit]
Mellanox Technologies provides InfiniBand and Ethernet switches for servers and storage used in enterprise data centers[4] and also makes its own integrated circuits to support the InfiniBand protocol.[5] Mellanox offers interconnect products: adapters, switches, software and silicon for a range of markets including high-performance computing, enterprise data centers, Web 2.0, cloud, storage and financial services.
The company is listed on NASDAQ under the symbol "MLNX".
In 2016, Mellanox Technologies began to employ programmers in the Gaza Strip, in addition to its team of Israeli Arab programmers and programmers in Ramallah and Nablus.[6]
History[edit]
Mellanox was founded in 1999 by former executives of Intel Corporation and Galileo Technology (which was acquired by Marvell Technology Group in October 2000 for $2.8 billion[7]) Eyal Waldman, Shai Cohen, Roni Ashuri, Micheal Kagan, Evelyn Landman, Eitan Zahavi, Shimon Rottemberg, Udi Katz and Alon Webman.[3] Initially founded as a integrated circuit (chip) manufacturer, it evolved into a producer of complete end-to-end systems by 2009.[8] The company raised over $89 million in 3 financing rounds of venture capital.[when?] [9][10]
The company went public in 2007, with an initial public offering on NASDAQ that raised $102 million, and valued the company at over half a billion dollars.[11] In 2010, Oracle Corporation became a major investor in the company, holding around 10% of its stock.[9] Oracle uses InfiniBand technology in its Exadata and Exalogic appliances.[12] In February 2011, Mellanox acquired Voltaire Ltd., a provider of data center switches for about $218 million.[13][5] Stock shares were also listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, until 2013 when the company de-listed itself, but remained on NASDAQ.[14]
Acquisitions[edit]
In February 2016, Mellanox acquired publicly-held EZchip Semiconductor, a provider of network processors and multi-core processors from EZchip's earlier acquisition of Tilera.
In July 2014, Mellanox acquired privately-held Integrity Project, for its software connectivity, low-level development, real-time applications and security technology.[15]
In July 2013, Mellanox acquired privately-held Kotura, Inc., a developer of silicon photonics optical interconnect technology for high-speed networking.[16]
In July 2013, Mellanox acquired privately-held IPtronics A/S, a designer of optical interconnect components for digital communications.[17]
In 2013 Mellanox acquired certain assets of XLoom Communications Ltd., including opto-electric chip-scale packaging, as well as hired XLoom's technology personnel.
Manufacturing[edit]
Mellanox is a fabless semiconductor company.[18] The current generation of its chips are produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp.[19]
Products and market[edit]
In 2010, a press release from Oracle described Mellanox as "the premier switched fabric provider for enterprise data centers and high performance computing". According to the same press release, Mellanox's InfiniBand technology is faster, more scalable and provides higher throughput than alternative communications technologies.[20] Larry Ellison, CEO of Oracle, promoted Mellanox’s main technology, InfiniBand.[8]

SwitchX is a multi-protocol ASIC that handles both InfinBand and Ethernet traffic.[19] It builds on the older 90 nanometer architecture of ConnectX technology, originally developed by Mellanox to support both Ethernet and Infiniband on one chip.[11] SwitchX is the fifth generation, using a 40 nanometer process with 1.4 billion transistors on a 45mm by 45mm chip.[19]
ConnectX-3 is a 10/40GbE adapter for VMware ESXi 5.0 that provides virtual protocol interconnect, meaning it can run 10 Gigabit Ethernet, 40Gb Ethernet, or Infiniband at up to 56Gb per second from the same card.[4] ConnectX-4 and ConnectX-5 adapters have enhanced capabilities.[21][22] The ConnectX architecture has been described as "novel", with excellent performance that is "very well suited for modern multi-core platforms."[23]

High-performance computing[edit]
Mellanox Technologies' InfiniBand products for computer clusters have been deployed in many of the TOP500 list of high-performance computers.[24] They provide high performance and some include a TCP offload engine.[citation needed]
Storage[edit]
Mellanox also promotes its products for storage area networks.[citation needed]
Customers[edit]
As of 2011[update] Mellanox derived more than a quarter of its revenues from two large customers, Hewlett-Packard and IBM.[25] Intel Corporation accounts for over 2% of revenues.[26] As of June 2011, Oracle owns 10% of Mellanox and is also a major customer.[27] Other customers include Chevron, Viacom, JPMorgan, Comcast and Airbus.[28]
Hiring practices[edit]
Mellanox outsourced some of its engineering to the West Bank. Rather than setting up offshore engineering centers in the Far East or Eastern Europe, Mellanox hired Palestinian engineers from Ramallah through a Palestinian outsourcing firm.[29] Waldman stated that Mellanox would build a research and development center in Ramallah even though it is more expensive than outsourcing to Eastern Europe.[30]
Awards and recognition[edit]

In November 2012, Mellanox was named one of the Fastest Growing Companies in Deloitte's 2012 Technology Fast 500 Rankings.[31]
In November 2012, Mellanox was awarded - 'Readers’ Choice: Best HPC Interconnect Product or Technology' from HPCwire[32]

Mellanox Technologies' InfiniBand products for computer clusters have been deployed in many of the TOP500 list of high-performance computers.[24] They provide high performance and some include a TCP offload engine.[citation needed]
Storage[edit]
Mellanox also promotes its products for storage area networks.[citation needed]
Customers[edit]
As of 2011[update] Mellanox derived more than a quarter of its revenues from two large customers, Hewlett-Packard and IBM.[25] Intel Corporation accounts for over 2% of revenues.[26] As of June 2011, Oracle owns 10% of Mellanox and is also a major customer.[27] Other customers include Chevron, Viacom, JPMorgan, Comcast and Airbus.[28]
Hiring practices[edit]
Mellanox outsourced some of its engineering to the West Bank. Rather than setting up offshore engineering centers in the Far East or Eastern Europe, Mellanox hired Palestinian engineers from Ramallah through a Palestinian outsourcing firm.[29] Waldman stated that Mellanox would build a research and development center in Ramallah even though it is more expensive than outsourcing to Eastern Europe.[30]
Awards and recognition[edit]

In November 2012, Mellanox was named one of the Fastest Growing Companies in Deloitte's 2012 Technology Fast 500 Rankings.[31]
In November 2012, Mellanox was awarded - 'Readers’ Choice: Best HPC Interconnect Product or Technology' from HPCwire[32]

Company overview[edit]
Mellanox Technologies provides InfiniBand and Ethernet switches for servers and storage used in enterprise data centers[4] and also makes its own integrated circuits to support the InfiniBand protocol.[5] Mellanox offers interconnect products: adapters, switches, software and silicon for a range of markets including high-performance computing, enterprise data centers, Web 2.0, cloud, storage and financial services.
The company is listed on NASDAQ under the symbol "MLNX".
In 2016, Mellanox Technologies began to employ programmers in the Gaza Strip, in addition to its team of Israeli Arab programmers and programmers in Ramallah and Nablus.[6]
History[edit]
Mellanox was founded in 1999 by former executives of Intel Corporation and Galileo Technology (which was acquired by Marvell Technology Group in October 2000 for $2.8 billion[7]) Eyal Waldman, Shai Cohen, Roni Ashuri, Micheal Kagan, Evelyn Landman, Eitan Zahavi, Shimon Rottemberg, Udi Katz and Alon Webman.[3] Initially founded as a integrated circuit (chip) manufacturer, it evolved into a producer of complete end-to-end systems by 2009.[8] The company raised over $89 million in 3 financing rounds of venture capital.[when?] [9][10]
The company went public in 2007, with an initial public offering on NASDAQ that raised $102 million, and valued the company at over half a billion dollars.[11] In 2010, Oracle Corporation became a major investor in the company, holding around 10% of its stock.[9] Oracle uses InfiniBand technology in its Exadata and Exalogic appliances.[12] In February 2011, Mellanox acquired Voltaire Ltd., a provider of data center switches for about $218 million.[13][5] Stock shares were also listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, until 2013 when the company de-listed itself, but remained on NASDAQ.[14]
Acquisitions[edit]
In February 2016, Mellanox acquired publicly-held EZchip Semiconductor, a provider of network processors and multi-core processors from EZchip's earlier acquisition of Tilera.
In July 2014, Mellanox acquired privately-held Integrity Project, for its software connectivity, low-level development, real-time applications and security technology.[15]
In July 2013, Mellanox acquired privately-held Kotura, Inc., a developer of silicon photonics optical interconnect technology for high-speed networking.[16]
In July 2013, Mellanox acquired privately-held IPtronics A/S, a designer of optical interconnect components for digital communications.[17]
In 2013 Mellanox acquired certain assets of XLoom Communications Ltd., including opto-electric chip-scale packaging, as well as hired XLoom's technology personnel.
Manufacturing[edit]
Mellanox is a fabless semiconductor company.[18] The current generation of its chips are produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp.[19]
Products and market[edit]
In 2010, a press release from Oracle described Mellanox as "the premier switched fabric provider for enterprise data centers and high performance computing". According to the same press release, Mellanox's InfiniBand technology is faster, more scalable and provides higher throughput than alternative communications technologies.[20] Larry Ellison, CEO of Oracle, promoted Mellanox’s main technology, InfiniBand.[8]

SwitchX is a multi-protocol ASIC that handles both InfinBand and Ethernet traffic.[19] It builds on the older 90 nanometer architecture of ConnectX technology, originally developed by Mellanox to support both Ethernet and Infiniband on one chip.[11] SwitchX is the fifth generation, using a 40 nanometer process with 1.4 billion transistors on a 45mm by 45mm chip.[19]
ConnectX-3 is a 10/40GbE adapter for VMware ESXi 5.0 that provides virtual protocol interconnect, meaning it can run 10 Gigabit Ethernet, 40Gb Ethernet, or Infiniband at up to 56Gb per second from the same card.[4] ConnectX-4 and ConnectX-5 adapters have enhanced capabilities.[21][22] The ConnectX architecture has been described as "novel", with excellent performance that is "very well suited for modern multi-core platforms."[23]

High-performance computing[edit]
Mellanox Technologies' InfiniBand products for computer clusters have been deployed in many of the TOP500 list of high-performance computers.[24] They provide high performance and some include a TCP offload engine.[citation needed]
Storage[edit]
Mellanox also promotes its products for storage area networks.[citation needed]
Customers[edit]
As of 2011[update] Mellanox derived more than a quarter of its revenues from two large customers, Hewlett-Packard and IBM.[25] Intel Corporation accounts for over 2% of revenues.[26] As of June 2011, Oracle owns 10% of Mellanox and is also a major customer.[27] Other customers include Chevron, Viacom, JPMorgan, Comcast and Airbus.[28]
Hiring practices[edit]
Mellanox outsourced some of its engineering to the West Bank. Rather than setting up offshore engineering centers in the Far East or Eastern Europe, Mellanox hired Palestinian engineers from Ramallah through a Palestinian outsourcing firm.[29] Waldman stated that Mellanox would build a research and development center in Ramallah even though it is more expensive than outsourcing to Eastern Europe.[30]
Awards and recognition[edit]

In November 2012, Mellanox was named one of the Fastest Growing Companies in Deloitte's 2012 Technology Fast 500 Rankings.[31]
In November 2012, Mellanox was awarded - 'Readers’ Choice: Best HPC Interconnect Product or Technology' from HPCwire[32]

Company overview[edit]
Mellanox Technologies provides InfiniBand and Ethernet switches for servers and storage used in enterprise data centers[4] and also makes its own integrated circuits to support the InfiniBand protocol.[5] Mellanox offers interconnect products: adapters, switches, software and silicon for a range of markets including high-performance computing, enterprise data centers, Web 2.0, cloud, storage and financial services.
The company is listed on NASDAQ under the symbol "MLNX".
In 2016, Mellanox Technologies began to employ programmers in the Gaza Strip, in addition to its team of Israeli Arab programmers and programmers in Ramallah and Nablus.[6]
History[edit]
Mellanox was founded in 1999 by former executives of Intel Corporation and Galileo Technology (which was acquired by Marvell Technology Group in October 2000 for $2.8 billion[7]) Eyal Waldman, Shai Cohen, Roni Ashuri, Micheal Kagan, Evelyn Landman, Eitan Zahavi, Shimon Rottemberg, Udi Katz and Alon Webman.[3] Initially founded as a integrated circuit (chip) manufacturer, it evolved into a producer of complete end-to-end systems by 2009.[8] The company raised over $89 million in 3 financing rounds of venture capital.[when?] [9][10]
The company went public in 2007, with an initial public offering on NASDAQ that raised $102 million, and valued the company at over half a billion dollars.[11] In 2010, Oracle Corporation became a major investor in the company, holding around 10% of its stock.[9] Oracle uses InfiniBand technology in its Exadata and Exalogic appliances.[12] In February 2011, Mellanox acquired Voltaire Ltd., a provider of data center switches for about $218 million.[13][5] Stock shares were also listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, until 2013 when the company de-listed itself, but remained on NASDAQ.[14]
Acquisitions[edit]
In February 2016, Mellanox acquired publicly-held EZchip Semiconductor, a provider of network processors and multi-core processors from EZchip's earlier acquisition of Tilera.
In July 2014, Mellanox acquired privately-held Integrity Project, for its software connectivity, low-level development, real-time applications and security technology.[15]
In July 2013, Mellanox acquired privately-held Kotura, Inc., a developer of silicon photonics optical interconnect technology for high-speed networking.[16]
In July 2013, Mellanox acquired privately-held IPtronics A/S, a designer of optical interconnect components for digital communications.[17]
In 2013 Mellanox acquired certain assets of XLoom Communications Ltd., including opto-electric chip-scale packaging, as well as hired XLoom's technology personnel.
Manufacturing[edit]
Mellanox is a fabless semiconductor company.[18] The current generation of its chips are produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp.[19]
Products and market[edit]
In 2010, a press release from Oracle described Mellanox as "the premier switched fabric provider for enterprise data centers and high performance computing". According to the same press release, Mellanox's InfiniBand technology is faster, more scalable and provides higher throughput than alternative communications technologies.[20] Larry Ellison, CEO of Oracle, promoted Mellanox’s main technology, InfiniBand.[8]

SwitchX is a multi-protocol ASIC that handles both InfinBand and Ethernet traffic.[19] It builds on the older 90 nanometer architecture of ConnectX technology, originally developed by Mellanox to support both Ethernet and Infiniband on one chip.[11] SwitchX is the fifth generation, using a 40 nanometer process with 1.4 billion transistors on a 45mm by 45mm chip.[19]
ConnectX-3 is a 10/40GbE adapter for VMware ESXi 5.0 that provides virtual protocol interconnect, meaning it can run 10 Gigabit Ethernet, 40Gb Ethernet, or Infiniband at up to 56Gb per second from the same card.[4] ConnectX-4 and ConnectX-5 adapters have enhanced capabilities.[21][22] The ConnectX architecture has been described as "novel", with excellent performance that is "very well suited for modern multi-core platforms."[23]

High-performance computing[edit]
Mellanox Technologies' InfiniBand products for computer clusters have been deployed in many of the TOP500 list of high-performance computers.[24] They provide high performance and some include a TCP offload engine.[citation needed]
Storage[edit]
Mellanox also promotes its products for storage area networks.[citation needed]
Customers[edit]
As of 2011[update] Mellanox derived more than a quarter of its revenues from two large customers, Hewlett-Packard and IBM.[25] Intel Corporation accounts for over 2% of revenues.[26] As of June 2011, Oracle owns 10% of Mellanox and is also a major customer.[27] Other customers include Chevron, Viacom, JPMorgan, Comcast and Airbus.[28]
Hiring practices[edit]
Mellanox outsourced some of its engineering to the West Bank. Rather than setting up offshore engineering centers in the Far East or Eastern Europe, Mellanox hired Palestinian engineers from Ramallah through a Palestinian outsourcing firm.[29] Waldman stated that Mellanox would build a research and development center in Ramallah even though it is more expensive than outsourcing to Eastern Europe.[30]
Awards and recognition[edit]

In November 2012, Mellanox was named one of the Fastest Growing Companies in Deloitte's 2012 Technology Fast 500 Rankings.[31]
In November 2012, Mellanox was awarded - 'Readers’ Choice: Best HPC Interconnect Product or Technology' from HPCwire[32]

Company overview[edit]
Mellanox Technologies provides InfiniBand and Ethernet switches for servers and storage used in enterprise data centers[4] and also makes its own integrated circuits to support the InfiniBand protocol.[5] Mellanox offers interconnect products: adapters, switches, software and silicon for a range of markets including high-performance computing, enterprise data centers, Web 2.0, cloud, storage and financial services.
The company is listed on NASDAQ under the symbol "MLNX".
In 2016, Mellanox Technologies began to employ programmers in the Gaza Strip, in addition to its team of Israeli Arab programmers and programmers in Ramallah and Nablus.[6]
History[edit]
Mellanox was founded in 1999 by former executives of Intel Corporation and Galileo Technology (which was acquired by Marvell Technology Group in October 2000 for $2.8 billion[7]) Eyal Waldman, Shai Cohen, Roni Ashuri, Micheal Kagan, Evelyn Landman, Eitan Zahavi, Shimon Rottemberg, Udi Katz and Alon Webman.[3] Initially founded as a integrated circuit (chip) manufacturer, it evolved into a producer of complete end-to-end systems by 2009.[8] The company raised over $89 million in 3 financing rounds of venture capital.[when?] [9][10]
The company went public in 2007, with an initial public offering on NASDAQ that raised $102 million, and valued the company at over half a billion dollars.[11] In 2010, Oracle Corporation became a major investor in the company, holding around 10% of its stock.[9] Oracle uses InfiniBand technology in its Exadata and Exalogic appliances.[12] In February 2011, Mellanox acquired Voltaire Ltd., a provider of data center switches for about $218 million.[13][5] Stock shares were also listed on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, until 2013 when the company de-listed itself, but remained on NASDAQ.[14]
Acquisitions[edit]
In February 2016, Mellanox acquired publicly-held EZchip Semiconductor, a provider of network processors and multi-core processors from EZchip's earlier acquisition of Tilera.
In July 2014, Mellanox acquired privately-held Integrity Project, for its software connectivity, low-level development, real-time applications and security technology.[15]
In July 2013, Mellanox acquired privately-held Kotura, Inc., a developer of silicon photonics optical interconnect technology for high-speed networking.[16]
In July 2013, Mellanox acquired privately-held IPtronics A/S, a designer of optical interconnect components for digital communications.[17]
In 2013 Mellanox acquired certain assets of XLoom Communications Ltd., including opto-electric chip-scale packaging, as well as hired XLoom's technology personnel.
Manufacturing[edit]
Mellanox is a fabless semiconductor company.[18] The current generation of its chips are produced by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp.[19]
Products and market[edit]
In 2010, a press release from Oracle described Mellanox as "the premier switched fabric provider for enterprise data centers and high performance computing". According to the same press release, Mellanox's InfiniBand technology is faster, more scalable and provides higher throughput than alternative communications technologies.[20] Larry Ellison, CEO of Oracle, promoted Mellanox’s main technology, InfiniBand.[8]

SwitchX is a multi-protocol ASIC that handles both InfinBand and Ethernet traffic.[19] It builds on the older 90 nanometer architecture of ConnectX technology, originally developed by Mellanox to support both Ethernet and Infiniband on one chip.[11] SwitchX is the fifth generation, using a 40 nanometer process with 1.4 billion transistors on a 45mm by 45mm chip.[19]
ConnectX-3 is a 10/40GbE adapter for VMware ESXi 5.0 that provides virtual protocol interconnect, meaning it can run 10 Gigabit Ethernet, 40Gb Ethernet, or Infiniband at up to 56Gb per second from the same card.[4] ConnectX-4 and ConnectX-5 adapters have enhanced capabilities.[21][22] The ConnectX architecture has been described as "novel", with excellent performance that is "very well suited for modern multi-core platforms."[23]

High-performance computing[edit]
Mellanox Technologies' InfiniBand products for computer clusters have been deployed in many of the TOP500 list of high-performance computers.[24] They provide high performance and some include a TCP offload engine.[citation needed]
Storage[edit]
Mellanox also promotes its products for storage area networks.[citation needed]
Customers[edit]
As of 2011[update] Mellanox derived more than a quarter of its revenues from two large customers, Hewlett-Packard and IBM.[25] Intel Corporation accounts for over 2% of revenues.[26] As of June 2011, Oracle owns 10% of Mellanox and is also a major customer.[27] Other customers include Chevron, Viacom, JPMorgan, Comcast and Airbus.[28]
Hiring practices[edit]
Mellanox outsourced some of its engineering to the West Bank. Rather than setting up offshore engineering centers in the Far East or Eastern Europe, Mellanox hired Palestinian engineers from Ramallah through a Palestinian outsourcing firm.[29] Waldman stated that Mellanox would build a research and development center in Ramallah even though it is more expensive than outsourcing to Eastern Europe.[30]
Awards and recognition[edit]

In November 2012, Mellanox was named one of the Fastest Growing Companies in Deloitte's 2012 Technology Fast 500 Rankings.[31]
In November 2012, Mellanox was awarded - 'Readers’ Choice: Best HPC Interconnect Product or Technology' from HPCwire[32]

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
