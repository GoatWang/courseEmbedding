        We hired Mike Hoover (Fallon Construction) to do our painting. He was prompt in getting back to us._ He is a one man operation who does quality work, one time and met the bid price. He was able to match the original color on a wall that needed repair and painting. We would recommend you give Mike a call when you have a home improvement job.

        I was so happy with the professionalism and quality of their work.  They were always on time, always did what they said they would do, always cleaned up after themselves and were pleasant to work with.  There were no hidden fees.  They stayed with the job and finished in the time they said they would.  I would highly recommend them.  The name of the company is  Bej construction.

You might have a garage remodel  or room addition planned, or a large-scale job that calls for a specialized crew, such as a foundation repair or drywall installation. In addition to completing the work involved, your contractor can pull permits,  hire and manage subcontractors, and keep all the details organized to save you time and frustration.

Choosing the right type of contractor comes down to the kind of work you need done. General and remodeling contractors are the best choice for construction or renovation jobs that involve several trades, while specialized contractors are dedicated to installation and repair work in their respective fields. Our contractors have all been background-checked and verified, and they have the experience and credentials to handle your project from start to finish.CompanyAboutBlogCareersContact UsDiscoverPro DirectoryService DirectoryHome GuidesAsk An ExpertPro CenterBecome A ProPrivacy PolicyTerms of ServicePowered by The Home Depot

Net Pro Referral, Inc. 506(c) Offering Platform
INTRODUCTION TO OUR COMPANY
Net Pro Referral, Inc. (the “Company” or “NPR, Inc.”) is a patent pending professional search and referral network located at NetProReferral.com. The website provides its visitors with a free database of professionals and their referral networks. This empowers the visitors to find the most qualified professional for the services they need based on referral information by other professionals.
NetProReferral.com focuses on the concept of referrals as the value proposition. The value of referral by professionals is offered to those who want to offer their services online as well as those who want to search for services online. Members have professional profiles similar to those found on LinkedIn or Yelp.  NPR, Inc. creates free profiles for professionals they find online and invite them to create an account so that they can complete their profile and build their referral information.
NPR, Inc.’s primary motivation is to offer a high quality and integrity source of information that would serve the public as means to identify professional members referred by other professional members based on qualifications such as character, education, experience and expertise. The professionals will be ranked when searching criteria is entered in the landing page before they are listed. The ranked search results are shown on the page, advertising may also be shown similar to Google search results and PPC advertising. Our goal is to monetize this service by selling advertisement to those who have created profiles in the database.








Every day in the United States, there are approximately 2.4 billion brand-related conversations.
according to Word of Mouth Marketing Association

SUMMARY OF OPERATIONS
How It Works: 
NetProReferral.com focuses on the concept of referrals as the value proposition. The value of referral by professionals is offered to those who want to offer their services online as well as those who want to search for services online. Members have professional profiles similar to those found on LinkedIn or Yelp.  NPR, Inc. created free profiles for professionals they find online and invite them to create an account so that they can complete their profile and build their referral information.
Once they have a profile on the database, professionals are able to ask other professionals to provide them with a reference. Each member can refer other members and also be referred by other members. The database will be built virally and through digital marketing as more contacts are made and more referrals are requested. This database will be promoted as a searchable database of professionals. The quality and quantity of professional references may be viewed on the database providing a more reliable source to find professional services.
The search results are ranked similar to the way search engine results are ranked before listing. The order of listing is based on a quality score which is a function of profile content of the member being ranked as well as those who refer that member.  Pay-per-click and other types of click advertising are venues for monetization after a substantial database is used and the site traffic builds up.
Customers
NPR, Inc. will advertise for the members of the database to the visitors who search the database. Visitors may search the site free of charge and do not have to register or login. Members are professionals who create free profiles on the site. Members are encouraged to ask other members or future potential members for referral. The active motivation to gain referrals will drive the site to grow virally.
What Drives Us
NPR, Inc.’s primary motivation is to offer a high quality and integrity source of information that would serve the public as means to identify professional members referred by other professional members based on qualifications such as character, education, experience and expertise. The professionals will be ranked when searching criteria is entered in the landing page before they are listed. On the page the ranked search results are shown, advertising may also be shown similar to Google search results and PPC advertising shown.

Company Overview

Net Pro Referral enables a large database of professionals within its referral network to offer their services, credentials and referral history to those who search for local professional services. This patent pending method creates a great environment for pay-per-click and other types of advertising. This is a hybrid of LinkedIn, Yelp and Google that focuses on serving generally underrepresented professionals such as those in medical, dental, legal and financial fields. We welcome professionals in all other areas but our initial marketing effort is to attract the above mentioned.The site launch on 8/17/2016 is the result of efforts by a team of over 60 developers, graphic designers, legal and financial experts that are contracted to create this innovative approach. Alireza Baktashian, the founder and CEO, is a veteran Silicon Valley entrepreneur with a solid leadership track record in both business and technology spanning 26 years.

        We hired Mike Hoover (Fallon Construction) to do our painting. He was prompt in getting back to us._ He is a one man operation who does quality work, one time and met the bid price. He was able to match the original color on a wall that needed repair and painting. We would recommend you give Mike a call when you have a home improvement job.

        I was so happy with the professionalism and quality of their work.  They were always on time, always did what they said they would do, always cleaned up after themselves and were pleasant to work with.  There were no hidden fees.  They stayed with the job and finished in the time they said they would.  I would highly recommend them.  The name of the company is  Bej construction.
