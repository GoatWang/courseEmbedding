January 12, 2015 09:00 PM Eastern Standard Time



SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Citrix today announced that Carlos Sartorius has been appointed as 
      senior vice president, Worldwide Sales and Services, reporting to Citrix 
      president and CEO, Mark Templeton. Sartorius was formerly managing 
      director and vice president of the Citrix EMEA organization, 
      headquartered in Switzerland, which he has run since joining Citrix in 
      2011.
    


      Al Monserrat, a fifteen year Citrix veteran, will be leaving the 
      company. He has run sales and services since 2008, during which time he 
      re-engineered the sales organization – greatly strengthening the Citrix 
      go-to-market model and growing revenues by nearly 90 percent. Monserrat 
      will remain with the company until April 1 as senior vice president, 
      Sales Strategy, to ensure an orderly transition.
    

      “I want to recognize the huge contribution and impact Al has had since 
      joining our company 15 years ago,” said Mark Templeton. “It has been an 
      honor and a privilege to have had him on our team, and I want to extend 
      my heartfelt thanks and best wishes to him as he takes the next step in 
      his journey.”
    

      Sartorius is a senior global executive with deep cross-functional 
      expertise in the technology and telecommunications industries. Prior to 
      his time at Citrix, Sartorius held a range of senior industry leadership 
      positions, most recently with HP, where he was vice president and 
      general manager of HP’s networking business unit in EMEA. Prior to that 
      he served as CEO of Orange Business Services; president for Avaya’s EMEA 
      business; and in a number of leadership roles for Motorola, including 
      vice president and general manager of its Government and Enterprise 
      Mobility Solutions business in EMEA.
    

      Templeton continued, “Looking forward, we are extremely fortunate to 
      have an executive of Carlos’ caliber and experience who is ready and 
      able to step up to this expanded role. Carlos has done a remarkable job 
      getting our EMEA business back on track and has all of the right 
      qualities to lead the ongoing development and growth of our global field 
      organizations. He is well versed in our go-to-market, partner and 
      channel models and has a deep understanding of our customers’ challenges 
      and perspectives, making him the perfect executive for this role as we 
      continue to drive toward our vision of a software-defined workplace.”
    

      Sartorius’ promotion is effectively immediately. He is moving to the US 
      and will be based in the company’s Santa Clara, Calif. facility.

Everyone was so welcoming and positive (unfortunately besides my manager). This position is perfect to get some experience and start a career, since it is a well-established company. If I did not have to leave for school I would have stayed and maybe tried to switch departments since I found that data entry processing was not my passion.ConsAt the time the manager of my department was intimidating, unfriendly and standoff-ish. Didn't feel comfortable approaching them with questions/concerns. Really bad for business productivity and feeling appreciated for all the hard work you've done. However, not too worry because I've heard that manager is no longer with the company due to multiple complaints.Advice to ManagementHire managers who make you feel wanted and appreciated for all of your hard work!Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (2) Sartorius Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Sartorius 2016-09-01 11:02 PDT Jul 10, 2017"This can be a Great Company"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeNeutral OutlookNo opinion of CEOI have been working at Sartorius full-timeProsThe atmosphere within the employee network is fun to work with.ConsRumors of employees being under paid and management can be a little lackadaisical at times.Advice to ManagementBecome more like leaders and stop showing up to just collect your paycheck.

In order processing, there is high volume for little acknowledgement or reward. Management (which have since left their roles after me) were poor communicators and did not listen to recommendations from day-to-day interactions OPS encounter. Management was focused on developing metrics to address issues when the foundation of said metrics were inconsistent and poor at best. Companies were acquired, which meant order processing absorbed other job tasks without additional staffing to accompany foreseen company growth. Sartorius is an excellent stepping stone to a company that values input and employee worth. When attempting to pursue opportunities in other departments, management highly discouraged branching out.Advice to ManagementListen to your employees and make efforts to reward them when necessary. A thank you or expression of appreciation goes a long way.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (2) Sartorius Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Sartorius 2017-03-08 15:17 PST Feb 21, 2017"Sales Rep"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementFormer Employee - Outside Sales RepresentativeFormer Employee - Outside Sales RepresentativeRecommendsNeutral OutlookDisapproves of CEOI worked at Sartorius full-timeProsGreat benefits.

Bonus's are given based on some subjects that the employee has no control over so they can make the excuse to not pay the full bonus. Hard work and dedication is not rewarded where it should be. Employees who don't care for the company and/or get by doing the bare minimum only "shine" when they know management is paying attention to make themselves look better.Advice to ManagementNeed to enforce the rules to everyone better. For example if people are late everyday then write them up. We are here to do a job within a certain time frame. Why should they get to be late every day? Also, make sure you let your employees know they are appreciated and doing a good job every now and then. It helps people want to stay with the company longer and cut down on turnover rate.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Sartorius Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Sartorius 2016-12-12 05:04 PST Jun 9, 2016"Continued Growth and Opportunities"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeRecommendsPositive OutlookApproves of CEOProsSartorius is a fast growing bioprocessing equipment provider that supports the Biotech and Pharmaceutical Industries globally.

Often feel like things never get solved because it's put out one fire and move to the next.Advice to ManagementFocus on internal process improvements, manufacturing improvements and improving supplier relationships. Add more technical/service resources because many travel so much and they will burn out.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (2) Sartorius Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Sartorius 2016-06-01 16:02 PDT Apr 13, 2016"Good company"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeRecommendsNeutral OutlookProsGood hours, friendly environment, flexible, good benefits, great PresidentConsLong to hire new managers, long temp to hire, not much elseShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (0) Sartorius Response seconds agoEdit • Delete Sartorius 2016-04-13 06:53 PDT Showing 60 of 64 reviewsReset FiltersPrevious12345NextReviews > Sartorius RSS Feed</>Embed Sartorius Careers Founded in 1870 in Goettingen, Germany, Sartorius today is a joint stock company with production facilities, sales subsidiaries and local...    – More Careers What We Offer Who We Look For How We WorkThis is the employer's chance to tell you why you should work for them.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
