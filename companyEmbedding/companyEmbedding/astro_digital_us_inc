Story 1 of 15:The Aral Sea is disappearing
Kazakhstan


The Aral Sea is disappearing: in 2014, the eastern Aral Sea totally dried up. You can see that in 2015 there is some water there, but the levels are much lower than they were historically.




Story 2 of 15:Tracking the Louisiana Coast
Louisiana, USA


Much of the Louisiana coast is actually made up of water rather than land.
It can be difficult to separate the two using normal processing methods but the Land-Water Boundary band combination uses Landsat's near infrared band to
better illuminate the difference.




Story 3 of 15:Sahara Desert Farming
Egypt


NDVI shows the growth rates of farms in Southern Egypt, west of Lake Nasser.
Large-scale irrigation projects are underway to convert portions of the desert to arable land.




Story 4 of 15:Bogota Urban Growth
Colombia


Flanked by the Andes mountains, Bogota, Colombia, boasts a population of over 8 million people. With rapid growth over the last several decades, the city has expanded to the north, south, and west. But on its eastern edge, federally protected areas prevent urban sprawl from destroying the vistas of the mountains for all Bogotanos to enjoy.




Story 5 of 15:Portuguese Wildfires
Portugal


This image was acquired on August 6 and shows an area in the interior of Portugal with an estimated size of 50 x 25 km. Wildfires have been raging in this area for some time. The true color image shows the area after fires have started burning. The change is even clearer in the before and after NDVI images.




Story 6 of 15:Beautiful Hope
Christmas Island, Australia


People fleeing countries across the Middle East and Asia get on boats to make their way to tiny Christmas Island, a tiny Australian island 200 miles from Indonesia, in the hopes of getting asylum.




Story 7 of 15:Frozen
Lake Superior, USA


Towards the end of winter, you can see huge chunks of ice floating on the eastern edge of Lake Superior.




Story 8 of 15:Another Way Around
Nicaragua


A proposed competitor to the Panama Canal in Nicaragua, set to be finished by 2019, will run through Lake Nicaragua, a large freshwater lake. The lake is home to rare freshwater sharks and Ometepe, a volcanic island.




Story 9 of 15:Swamp Thing
Georgia, USA


With the land-water boundary processing, you can more easily see where the swampy areas are in Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge in southern Georgia.




Story 10 of 15:Ain't No Mountain High Enough
Ecuador


Most people count Mt. Everest as the tallest mountain in the world, but that's if you're measuring from sea level. But because of the Earth's rotation, it bulges at the equator, making snow-capped Chimborazo in Ecuador the tallest mountain if you measure from the center of the Earth.




Story 11 of 15:Salty Seas
Mexico


Guerrero Negro has one of the most productive salt mines in the world, producing over seven million tons of salt per year. It was established near the Ojo de Liebre coastal lagoon to take advantage of the high salinity levels there. The area is also a popular whale watching lagoon and UNESCO World Heritage Site.




Story 12 of 15:A River Runs Through It
China


The Three Gorges Dam is the world's largest power station in terms of installed capacity (22,500 MW). The dam creates electricity, is intended to increase the Yangtze River's shipping capacity, and reduces the potential for floods downstream. The state-of-the-art large turbines are a huge move toward limiting greenhouse gas emissions from China.




Story 13 of 15:Farmlands in California
California


Vegetation in California is the most active in spring, before the summer drought plants reach their highest results for green mass. The image is processed to highlight vegetation productivity using the NDVI calculation where the brightest color shows the highest vegetation. The fields in orange, highest vegetation, are likely tomatoes.




Story 14 of 15:Sandstorm
Iran


What looks like snow is actually piles of sand and dust transferred to the hills and mountains near Dasht-e Kevir, Iran. This is the result of a huge sandstorm in the area in June, 2016.




Story 15 of 15:Mexico City
Mexico


The details captured by Sentinel-2 allow us to see crisp outlines of city blocks and large buildings, ideal for monitoring changes to urban environments. The frequency of imaging captures trends in rapidly changing environments like Mexico City.

Astro Digital



























































Our Satellites
The Landmapper constellation is Aquila Space Technology. Its uniqueness is in the reliability of coverage and diversity of sensors. Flying 30 satellites and two sensor configurations, Landmapper captures both daily coverage and high resolution shots of our planet.




Landmapper-HD
Landmapper-HD is a constellation of 20 satellites imaging all agricultural land, globally every 3-4 days.







Satellite

      Imaging the world at 2.5 meters resolution, the spacecraft weighs 20kg and is about the size of a small microwave
      


Radio

      The Ka band transmitter moves data from space to ground faster than your iPhone 6 sends a text message over LTE. Downlinking 10x faster than industry standard means more data from space to ground and into your app.
      



Telescope

      The largest part on the spacecraft is the telescope. From 600km up we need this huge telescope to zoom in on the Earth’s surface and capture details like cars, rows of crops, pipelines, houses, and shipping containers.
      







Camera

      The 5 band imager captures data in the blue, green, red, red edge, and near infrared spectrum. With each pixel equal to 2.5 meters on the ground, about the size of car. The pixels are assembled into an image which covers 450 km2 on Earth's surface - about the size of Guam.
      


Butcher Block Filter

      As the name suggests, this filter assembles stripes of colour in a way thatresembles the strips of wood glued together on a butcher block. A single filter means that all the energy of the telescope and camera are sent through a single plane.
      











Landmapper-BC
Landmapper-BC is a constellation of 10 broad coverage satellites that complement the HD sensor. Imaging all agricultural land daily creates deep stacks of pixels for trend detection and identifying change.



Satellite

      Imaging the world at 22 meters resolution, the spacecraft weighs 10kg and is about the size of a shoebox.
      


Solar panels

      Solar panels generate the power to image and downlink long strips of land over every orbit. Panels are mounted on every surface which means that each spacecraft generates enough power to capture 1TB of imagery.
      














Data Power Module

      The data power module is the brain of the satellite: GPS imprints ground coordinates on each image, flight computer makes all of the bits talk to each other, batteries store energy from the solar panels.The plug and play nature of the design means fewer touches during assembly and less chance of failure.
      


Batteries

      These are the same batteries you'll find in a Tesla!
      







Camera

      The camera is tuned to capture images beyond what the eye can see. The light coming into the camera creates pixels used to detect the productivity of planets and forests. Each image covers 30,000 km2 which is about the size of Washington, DC.
      


Focal Plane

      The focal plane detects the light coming into the camera and converts the analog signal into 12-bit digital high quality imagery.
      



Filter

      The red, green, and near infrared filters exactly match Landsat 8. Among other analysis, the red and near infrared spectrum are used to calculate the productivity of plants and estimate crop yields.

Open Data


Landsat

      Landsat 8 is used from drought monitoring to regional planning to forest management to geological mapping. The diverse spectral bands allow us to see beyond the visible spectrum into subsurface minerals, through the smoke of wildfires, and into the chlorophyll in plant leaves.
      

      The USGS and NASA Landsat program has been collecting a fresh image of Earth every 16 days at 30 meters resolution for over 40 years.
      


Sentinel

      Sentinel-2 consists of 2 identical satellites with multi-spectral coverage tuned for agriculture and forest monitoring, natural disaster management, soil and water cover sensing, and climate change monitoring.
      The mission provides high resolution (10-60 meters resolution) global coverage of the Earth's land surface every 10 days with one satellite and 5 days with 2 satellites, making the data of great use in on-going studies.
      

      Sentinel-2 data is an free and open data source where the satellites are operated by the European Space Agency as part of the Copernicus Program. Sentinel-2 launched the first satellite in the pair in June 2015 and the second is scheduled for launch in mid-2016.

Canada’s Assent Compliance raises $31.4M Series B round to help businesses stay in compliance












The global imaging and analysis company, Astro Digital, has sent its first imaging satellites into space early this morning as part of larger payload launched by the Russian company Glavkosmos.
The two satellites from Astro Digital join 70 other satellites transported on a Soyuz rocket launched from a site in Kazakhstan by the subsidiary of Russia’s state space agency Roscosmos.
With the launch, Astro Digital will begin to demonstrate the full system it had hoped to build since it was founded three years ago, according to a blog post from co-founder and head of product Bronwyn Agrios.
it’s a shot across the bow of the roughly 15 competing satellite imaging companies vying for a piece of the global imaging market.
While Astro Digital is starting small, the satellite imaging business has massive implications for any number of industries. The business relates to mapping, autonomous driving and so many other services that rely on location, both for consumers and businesses and for governments as well.
There is a race on to be able to create and update imaging of this kind, and while some larger groups are hoping to hold the keys, the fact that there are still also a sizable number of startups trying, points to how competitive the field.
And satellites are a tricky business. Alphabet basically ceded its position in the market when it sold Terra Bella to Planet earlier this year. Coupled with the disintegration of the proposed merger of OneWeb and Intelsat, there’s mounting evidence that crossing the finish line with a viable business in the space race isn’t easy.
Astro Digital can now provide imaging, downlink, processing, analysis and distribution in a unified system, with each image covering roughly 30,000 square kilometers, or an area half the size of Austria.
In a few months, Agrios said, the satellites will be able to cover areas of the U.S., Canada, and Russia.
The goal for the company is to get to global, daily imaging by the first quarter of 2018.
Since it raised $16 million in funding earlier this year from investors including Vast Ventures, undisclosed family offices and angel investors, Astro Digital has been hard at work getting the different pieces of its imaging and analysis platform for monitoring the earth up and running.
In February, the company announced on its Medium page that it had put up the datasets it had generated from information collected from NASA’s MODIS satellite onto Amazon Web Services. The data repository was a signpost of the types of analytical work that Astro Digital’s software can do (the company’s satellites already can be used to collect data used by forestry services to provide early information on potential forest fires).
Then, in June, the company sent employees off to the Arctic to commission its ground station antenna and simulate the conditions under which the ground station would receive data from its first two Landmapper satellites.

As Astro Digital enters the crowded market for satellite imaging, the company is touting its system which it says is “specifically designed for large scale change monitoring”.
Everything from the size of the company’s satellite, its optics system, power sources, and orbit, to its downlink technology has been designed to provide a more thorough picture of the earth from space, the company claims.
Here’s how the company describes its downlink technology:

10TB of data per day coming down from space at a rate of 1 Gigabit per second. We are pushing the limits of data downlink capacity and need a ground station partner that can capture the data at the velocity that we downlink and at a cost that works for us as a small business.
Our partnership with Norway’s Kongsberg Satellite Services (KSAT) enables us to run lean and fast.


Where small satellites typically operate in the increasingly congested X-band spectrum, we operate in the Ka-band spectrum. Ka is the best way to downlink the volumes of data that we capture in space with just one ground antenna. We are the first commercial small sat company to operate in the Ka-spectrum which means that the ground station infrastructure didn’t exist.
We partnered with KSAT to build the ground infrastructure up in Svalbard, Norway that operates on the Ka-spectrum. We lease the antenna which means we didn’t need the up front capital to setup and own the infrastructure. We designed on a business model that works more like a subscription so that can downlink our massive data load at an optimal cost.

The company’s claims are one thing, but the reality is that there are a slew of companies out in the market (some with much stronger balance sheets) that are competing for a share of the roughly $260 billion spent on global satellites.
CBInsights tracks at last 15 satellite operators vying for the lion’s share of the earth imaging business.

With the satellite launch earlier today (at about 1:36 AM Eastern) Astro Digital has sent its first shot across the bow at these competitors.
The new satellites will join their celestial counterparts at a position 600 kilometers above the earth in a synchronous orbit. The company expects the satellites to be aloft for a bit more than 5 years.
