Capital good

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia


					Jump to:					navigation, 					search

A capital good is a durable good (one that does not quickly wear out) that is used in the production of goods or services. Capital goods are one of the three types of producer goods, the other two being land and labour which are also known collectively as primary [factors of production]. This classification originated during the [Classical economics][classical economic] period and has remained the dominant method for classification.
Capital goods are acquired by a society by saving wealth which can be invested in the means of production. In terms of economics one can consider capital goods to be [Tangible property].They are used to produce other goods or services during a certain period of time. Machinery, tools, buildings, computers, or other kind of equipment that is involved in production of other things for sale, represent the term of a Capital good. The owners of the Capital good can be individuals, households, corporations or governments. Any material that is used in production of other goods is also considered to be a capital good.
Many definitions and descriptions of capital goods production have been proposed in the literature. Capital goods are generally considered one-of-a-kind, capital intensive products that consist of many components. They are often used as manufacturing systems or services themselves.
Examples include battleships, oil rigs, baggage handling systems and roller coaster equipment. Their production is often organized in projects, with several parties cooperating in networks (Hicks et al. 2000; Hicks and McGovern 2009; Hobday 1998). A capital good lifecycle typically consists of tendering, engineering and procurement, manufacturing, commissioning, maintenance and (sometimes) decommissioning (Blanchard 1997; Hicks et al. 2000; Hobday 1998; Vianello and Ahmed 2008).

Differences between capital and consumer goods[edit]
One should distinguish capital goods from consumption, as the aim of their purchase is different from the production of things. An example of it is a good car, that is normally considered to be a consumer good as it is bought for a private usage. Nevertheless, dump trucks used by manufacturing or constructing companies are obviously a production goods. The reason is that they assist in creating things like roads, dams, buildings or bridges. The same way, a chocolate candy bar is a consumer good, but the machines that are used to produce the candy would be considered production goods. Some of the capital goods can be used in both production of consumer goods or production ones, such as machinery for production of dump trucks. It is generally considered that the consumption is the logical result of all economic activity, but it is also obvious that the level of the future consumption depends on the future capital stock, and this in turn depends on the current level of production in the capital-goods sector. Hence if there is a desire to increase the consumption, the output of the capital goods should be maximized. [2]
The importance of capital goods[edit]
Capital goods, often called complex products and systems (CoPS) (Gann and Salter 2000; Hobday 2000), play an important role in today’s economy (Acha et al. 2004). Aside from allowing a business to create goods or provide services for consumers, capital goods are important in other ways. In an industry where production equipment and materials are quite expensive, they can be a high barrier to entry for new companies. If a new business cannot afford to purchase the machines it needs to create a product, for example, it may not be able to compete as effectively in the market. Such a company might turn to another business to supply its products, but this can be expensive as well. This means that, in industries where the means of production represent a large amount of a business's start up costs, the number of companies competing in the market is often relatively small.
Investment required[edit]
The acquisition of machinery and other expensive equipment often represents a significant investment for a company. When a business is struggling, it will often put off such purchases as long as possible, since it does not make sense to spend money on equipment if the company is not around to use it. Capital spending can be a sign that a manufacturer expects growth or at least a steady demand for its products, a potentially positive economic sign. In most cases, capital goods require a substantial investment on behalf of the producer, and their purchase is usually referred to as a capital expense. These goods are important to businesses because they use these items to make functional goods for customers or to provide consumers with valuable services. As a result, they are sometimes referred to as producers' goods, production goods or means of production.[1]
Capital goods in international trade[edit]
In the theory of the international trade the causes and nature of trade of capital goods receive little attention. Trade in capital goods is a crucial part of the dynamic relationship between international trade and development. The production and trade of capital goods as well as consumer goods must be introduced to trade models, and the entire analysis integrated with domestic capital accumulation theory.

Capital goods are one of the three types of producer goods, the other two being land and labour which are also known collectively as primary [factors of production]. This classification originated during the [Classical economics][classical economic] period and has remained the dominant method for classification.
Capital goods are acquired by a society by saving wealth which can be invested in the means of production. In terms of economics one can consider capital goods to be [Tangible property].They are used to produce other goods or services during a certain period of time. Machinery, tools, buildings, computers, or other kind of equipment that is involved in production of other things for sale, represent the term of a Capital good. The owners of the Capital good can be individuals, households, corporations or governments. Any material that is used in production of other goods is also considered to be a capital good.
Many definitions and descriptions of capital goods production have been proposed in the literature. Capital goods are generally considered one-of-a-kind, capital intensive products that consist of many components. They are often used as manufacturing systems or services themselves.
Examples include battleships, oil rigs, baggage handling systems and roller coaster equipment. Their production is often organized in projects, with several parties cooperating in networks (Hicks et al. 2000; Hicks and McGovern 2009; Hobday 1998). A capital good lifecycle typically consists of tendering, engineering and procurement, manufacturing, commissioning, maintenance and (sometimes) decommissioning (Blanchard 1997; Hicks et al. 2000; Hobday 1998; Vianello and Ahmed 2008).

Differences between capital and consumer goods[edit]
One should distinguish capital goods from consumption, as the aim of their purchase is different from the production of things. An example of it is a good car, that is normally considered to be a consumer good as it is bought for a private usage. Nevertheless, dump trucks used by manufacturing or constructing companies are obviously a production goods. The reason is that they assist in creating things like roads, dams, buildings or bridges. The same way, a chocolate candy bar is a consumer good, but the machines that are used to produce the candy would be considered production goods. Some of the capital goods can be used in both production of consumer goods or production ones, such as machinery for production of dump trucks. It is generally considered that the consumption is the logical result of all economic activity, but it is also obvious that the level of the future consumption depends on the future capital stock, and this in turn depends on the current level of production in the capital-goods sector. Hence if there is a desire to increase the consumption, the output of the capital goods should be maximized. [2]
The importance of capital goods[edit]
Capital goods, often called complex products and systems (CoPS) (Gann and Salter 2000; Hobday 2000), play an important role in today’s economy (Acha et al. 2004). Aside from allowing a business to create goods or provide services for consumers, capital goods are important in other ways. In an industry where production equipment and materials are quite expensive, they can be a high barrier to entry for new companies. If a new business cannot afford to purchase the machines it needs to create a product, for example, it may not be able to compete as effectively in the market. Such a company might turn to another business to supply its products, but this can be expensive as well. This means that, in industries where the means of production represent a large amount of a business's start up costs, the number of companies competing in the market is often relatively small.
Investment required[edit]
The acquisition of machinery and other expensive equipment often represents a significant investment for a company. When a business is struggling, it will often put off such purchases as long as possible, since it does not make sense to spend money on equipment if the company is not around to use it. Capital spending can be a sign that a manufacturer expects growth or at least a steady demand for its products, a potentially positive economic sign. In most cases, capital goods require a substantial investment on behalf of the producer, and their purchase is usually referred to as a capital expense. These goods are important to businesses because they use these items to make functional goods for customers or to provide consumers with valuable services. As a result, they are sometimes referred to as producers' goods, production goods or means of production.[1]
Capital goods in international trade[edit]
In the theory of the international trade the causes and nature of trade of capital goods receive little attention. Trade in capital goods is a crucial part of the dynamic relationship between international trade and development. The production and trade of capital goods as well as consumer goods must be introduced to trade models, and the entire analysis integrated with domestic capital accumulation theory.

Capital goods are man-made, durable items businesses use to produce goods and services. They include tools, machinery and equipment. Capital goods are also called durable goods, real capital and economic capital. Some experts just refer to them as "capital." This last term is confusing because it can also mean financial capital. In accounting, capital goods are treated as fixed assets. They’re also known as “plant, property and equipment.”









Capital goods are one of the four factors of production. The other three are:Natural resources, such as land.Labor, such as workers.Entrepreneurship, which is the drive to create new companies. (Source: "Factors of Production," St. Louis Federal Reserve.)How Much Does the United States Produce?In the United States, the monthly Durable Goods Orders Report measures capital goods production. It reports capital goods shipments, new orders, and inventory. Check it each month because it is one of the most revealing leading economic indicators.The Census Bureau provides the Durable Goods Report. It surveys companies that ship more than $500 million a year. These companies may be divisions of big diversified corporations. They also include large homogeneous companies as well as single-unit manufacturers in 89 industry categories. (Source: "Durable Goods Order Reports," U.S. Census.)How Capital Goods Drive U.S. Economic SuccessThe United States has been a technological innovator in creating capital goods, from the cotton gin to drones.



 That's important because capital goods production creates more manufacturing jobs. These are among the most well-paid positions, averaging $70,000 a year. America's success as a provider of capital goods has created a comparative advantage for the country. That helped it to remain the world's largest economy until 2015 when China attained that spot.









 For more, see Silicon Valley: America's Innovative Advantage.Here are eight examples of how U.S. innovations in capital goods created these advantages.In 1789, Samuel Slater improved textile manufacturing. Eli Whitney invented the cotton gin in 1793. These made the United States a leader in clothing manufacturing.The invention of Morse code and the telegraph in 1849, and Graham Bell's telephone in 1877, made communication faster.Thomas Edison invented a safe incandescent lamp in 1880. That allowed people to work longer and made urban living more attractive.Steamboats led to steam locomotives. They allowed private railroad networks to facilitate coast-to-coast commerce and development of the West.In 1902, air conditioning allowed migration to formerly hot areas and the ability to work effectively through the summer.In 1903, the Wright Brothers' invented the airplane, leading to faster travel.In 1908, Ford's assembly line allowed mass production of affordable cars. That increased demand for expanded travel and led to the 1956 Interstate Highway Act. It improved shipping and a created a higher suburban standard of living.In 1926, Robert Goddard invented the liquid propulsion rocket. That gave the United States an advantage in defense.









Core Capital GoodsCore capital goods are another leading indicator of economic growth. That's because they don't include defense equipment and aircraft, which are typically large orders that don't appear consistently. Core capital goods orders tell you how much businesses use on an everyday basis.The Census Department measures both orders and shipments. The latter usually show up in that quarter's gross domestic product estimate. Orders don't show up until later, when the goods are manufactured and shipped. When orders for core capital goods rise, GDP will increase 6-12 months later.Capital Goods vs. Consumer GoodsUnlike capital goods, consumer goods are not used to create other products. But some of them can be durable goods, as well. Like capital goods, durable consumer goods are heavy-duty and long-lasting.

 They’re the appliances bought by households, such cars, refrigerators and dryers. Shipments of consumer goods are also included in U.S. GDP. For more, see Consumer Spending Drives Nearly 70 Percent of GDP.ExamplesMany items can be both capital goods and consumer goods. The difference is how the items are used. For example, commercial aircraft are capital goods because they are used by airlines to produce a service, transportation. An airplane used by private pilots for weekend hobbies is a consumer good. That same type of plane used for a sightseeing business is a capital good.Here are some more examples. Capital goods include trucks and cars used by businesses, but not those used by families. They include commercial buildings, like factories, offices, and warehouses. They would include apartment buildings because they are used to provide rental housing, which is a service. They would not include privately-owned homes.Computers are capital goods if they are used by a business, but not if they are used by a family. The same goes for any ovens, refrigerators and dishwashers. If they are for commercial use only, they are capital goods.

What is the difference between a capital good and a consumer good?


    By Sean Ross | Updated March 7, 2017 — 2:22 PM EST    






Share









































A:
Capital goods and consumer goods are classified based on how they are used. A capital good is any good deployed to help increase future production. The most common capital goods are property, plant and equipment, or PP&E. Consumer goods are any goods that are not capital goods; they are goods used by consumers and have no future productive use.
Economists and businesses pay special attention to capital goods because of the role they play in improving the productive capacity of a firm or country. In other words, capital goods make it possible to produce at a higher level of efficiency.
For a simple explanation of how capital goods increase marginal productivity, consider two workers who are digging ditches. The first worker has a spoon and the second worker has a tractor with a hydraulic shovel. The second worker can dig much faster because he has the superior capital good.
Capital Goods
Capital goods are also known as intermediate goods, durable goods or economic capital. They are different than financial capital, which refers to funds companies use to grow their businesses. Natural resources not modified by human hands are not considered capital goods, although both are factors of production.
Businesses do not sell capital goods, which means capital goods do not directly create revenue like consumer goods. To financially survive the accumulation of capital goods, businesses rely on savings, investment or loans.
Consumer Goods
A consumer good is any good purchased for consumption and not later used for the production of another consumer good. Consumer goods are sometimes called final goods. When economists and statisticians calculate gross domestic product, or GDP, they do so based off of consumer goods.
The same physical good could be a consumer good or a capital good. An apple bought at a grocery store and immediately eaten is a consumer good. An identical apple bought by a company to make apple juice is a capital good. The difference lies in its utilization.

Capital goods are essential for the business activities of many companies.  In this lesson, you'll learn what capital goods are and how they fit into the overall picture of a company.
 What are Capital Goods?Capital goods are goods used by businesses to produce goods and services used by consumers. Capital goods are usually considered fixed goods that are not easily converted into cash. Conceptual FrameworkCapital goods are one of the three basic factors of production, which facilitate the creation of goods and services. In other words, they are the inputs you use to create outputs called products or services. The other two basic factors of production include labor and land. Unlike land and natural resources, capital goods consist of things that are created by people. You can use capital goods to help transform other goods and resources into other products or you can use them to increase the efficiency of your production process. It's important to remember that you do not buy capital goods to sell to customers (that's called inventory). Long-term capital assets can usually be depreciated. Depreciation is where you expense a portion of the cost of the capital good over a period of time. Depreciation is used to offset income and can reduce tax obligations. Depreciation is reported on your profit and loss statement.

The Balance SheetCapital goods are reported on a company's balance sheet as assets. Assets, as you probably know, help bring income into a company. Capital goods are typically reported as long-term assets because they generally bring income into a business after a year or more. This makes sense because most capital assets are expensive, and it will take some time to recover their costs before they start making you money. ExamplesLet's look at a few examples of capital goods. 
Buildings 
Machinery 
Equipment 
Furniture 
Fixtures or anything attached to real property, such as cabinets 
Lesson SummaryLet's review. Capital goods are one of the three basic factors of production in business. They are purchased and used to help your company produce consumer goods or provide services. They are reported as assets on a company's balance sheet and often can be depreciated over time. Examples of capital goods include buildings, machines, equipment, furniture and fixtures.

In economics, capital goods are tangible objects that are used in the production of other goods or commodities or during the providing of services. They can include things such as buildings, machinery, tools, computers and any other equipment that is used to make or do something else, which can then be sold to another party. The means of production might be owned by individuals, businesses, organizations or governments. This term also refers to any material used or consumed while other goods are being produced or services are being provided.
Investment Required
In most cases, capital goods require a substantial investment on behalf of the producer, and their purchase is usually referred to as a capital expense. These goods are important to businesses because they use these items to make functional goods for customers or to provide consumers with valuable services. As a result, they are sometimes referred to as producers' goods, production goods or means of production.  


Capital Goods vs. Capital
The economic term "capital goods" should not be confused with the financial term "capital," which simply refers to money or wealth. Production goods generally are man-made and do not include natural resources such as land or minerals. They also do not include "human capital" — the labor, intellectual skills and physical skills provided by people in the production of other goods. So, for example, a company that provides limousine services would include its fleet of limousines and its facilities among its capital goods, but its drivers would not be included. 
Different from Consumer Goods
A distinction also should be made between capital and consumer goods, which are purchased for purposes other than to be used in the production of other things. For example, cars generally are considered consumer goods because they are often bought by individuals for personal use. Dump trucks, however, might be considered production goods if they are used by construction and manufacturing companies to assist in making products such as roads, bridges, dams or buildings. Similarly, a chocolate candy bar is a consumer good, but the machines that are used to produce the candy would be considered production goods. 
Capital goods typically are used to produce consumer goods, but they also might be used to manufacture other production goods. A company that builds dump trucks, for example, requires equipment and facilities to create that vehicle.
The Importance of Capital Goods
Aside from allowing a business to create goods or provide services for consumers, capital goods are important in other ways. In an industry where production equipment and materials are quite expensive, they can be a high barrier to entry for new companies. If a new business cannot afford to purchase the machines it needs to create a product, for example, it may not be able to compete as effectively in the market. Such a company might turn to another business to supply its products, but this can be expensive as well. This means that, in industries where the means of production represent a large amount of a business's start up costs, the number of companies competing in the market is often relatively small.
The acquisition of machinery and other expensive equipment often represents a significant investment for a company, so spending on such assets is often watched closely by economists. When a business is struggling, it will often put off such purchases as long as possible, since it doesn't make sense to spend money on equipment if the company isn't around to use it. Capital spending can be a sign that a manufacturer expects growth or at least a steady demand for its products, a potentially positive economic sign.
Tax Implications
Money spent to buy or improve equipment, factories, and other similar assets is called a capital expenditure. Under standard accounting rules, because the asset won't be useful for just the year in which it was purchased, it must be depreciated over time. A fixed percentage of the value of the asset can be deducted from the business's taxes each year for a specific number of years, in many cases. Laws on depreciation vary by country, and can also vary within a country, depending on the asset and the type of business.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

 Consumer Goods vs Capital Goods


There are two types of goods namely consumer goods and capital goods. Why this dichotomy, you might wonder? But then, can you compare a machine that produces shampoo sachets with the sachets themselves that are ultimately used by end consumers? Though both are goods, they are entirely different in form and function, aren’t they? This is not the only difference between capital and consumer goods as would be clear to you after reading this article.
As their name implies, consumer goods are goods meant for the end consumers. Whether you buy a cold drink, a pack of cigarettes, or a laptop, they are going to be utilized by you and hence, classify as consumer goods. Bread that you buy from market is a consumer good, but the huge oven that is used by the company manufacturing bread is classified as a capital good.  Consumer goods are thus products that are bought from retail stores for personal or household need.
On the other hand, capital goods are goods that are used to make more goods, which are to be used by end consumers. All machinery, equipment, even factories that are used to produce consumer goods come under the category of capital goods. Capital goods are not natural, and are man made. The word capital is enough to convey the impression that these are goods that are expensive, and require a huge investment on the part of the company trying to make consumer goods.
Cars and other automobiles are consumer goods, but dump trucks are not classified under consumer goods. This is because they are mainly used by construction companies to haul other vehicles, and not by end consumers.





What is the difference between Consumer Goods and Capital Goods?
•	Capital goods are goods used to make more consumer goods, whereas consumer goods are goods meant for the use of end consumers only.
•	One buys consumer goods from retail stores for personal, family, or household use.
•	Capital goods are bought by companies desirous of making the consumer goods.
•	Machines, tools, equipments are examples of capital goods, whereas bread, butter, cold drinks, TV, laptops etc (in fact everything that is used by people) are examples of consumer goods.

Historical Examples



                            The capital goods have to be taken unit by unit if their value for productive purposes is to be rightly gauged.                        


Essentials of Economic Theory


                            John Bates Clark                        




                            Lugo, Lessius, and Molina adduced the productivity of capital goods as a reason for allowing gains to the investor.                        


Distributive Justice


                            John A. (John Augustine) Ryan                        




                            That Fisher means the money-prices of capital goods when he speaks of capital-values is perfectly clear.                        


The Value of Money


                            Benjamin M. Anderson, Jr.                        




                            The construction or acquisition of the concrete "capital goods" was simply an easy consequence.                        


The Place of Science in Modern Civilisation and Other Essays


                            Thorstein Veblen                        




                            In an exactly similar way a body of capital goods is maintained as a perpetual instrumentality of production.                        


Essentials of Economic Theory


                            John Bates Clark                        




                            But in that case there would be no question of capital goods, or of capital, or of labor.
