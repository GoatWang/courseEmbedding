ARGONAUT - A full-service advertising agency with award-winning talent.

About


Let’s be clear here. We’re an advertising agency. We make things that surprise and delight the world. But our focus is also on helping clients tackle their hairiest business problems, not just their advertising challenges.
We’re about people first – the best talent teamed with the bravest clients. We don’t have a hit list of brands we want to go after. Instead, we have a list of people we’d kill to work with, again or for the first time.
We’re looking for courageous souls and fearless thinkers more interested in making history than repeating it, all in pursuit of work that both drives business results and leaves a dent in culture.

People


Rick Condos and Hunter Hindman
Chief Creative Officers
Rick and Hunter are responsible for making sure that every person in the company understands that they play a creative role, and all have a responsibility in helping to craft the world-class executions they produce for clients.
Their partnership began 10 years ago at Goodby, Silverstein & Partners in San Francisco. Rick had moved from New York and Hunter from Dallas to work on the +HP campaign. Over the next decade, they’ve never looked back, splitting time between GS&P and Wieden+Kennedy Amsterdam.
At GS&P, their responsibilities included helping to run HP, both during the “+HP” effort and “The Computer is Personal” Campaign. For Frito-Lay, they shepherded Doritos’ Crash The Super Bowl (now in its 7th year) and Hotel 626 (widely regarded as one of the most innovative digital efforts of the 2000’s). Under their guidance, they grew the Frito-Lay business from just Doritos to a portfolio including Cheetos, Fritos, Tostitos, Ruffles and Rold Gold. They ran the Chevrolet account. And they pitched and won Dickies, TD Ameritrade and Cisco, repositioning each of those brands with dynamic integrated campaigns. During their tenure, GS&P won Agency of the Year three times (twice in AdWeek, once in AdAge), Digital Agency of the Year at Cannes, and Agency of the Decade in AdWeek.
At Wieden+Kennedy Amsterdam, they pitched and won Coca-Cola’s global business, launching “The Coke Side of Life” campaign with the widely awarded “Happiness Factory” entertainment property. The campaign ran in 191 countries and was adopted and built on by every region. During their two years abroad they also helped launch Nike+ in Europe.
Throughout their time together, they’ve won lots of awards (Cannes, The One Show, Art Director’s Club, D&AD, Epica, AICP, etc.) and their work has regularly appeared in both the international and domestic press. They’ve made a bunch of Super Bowl spots for many different clients. They were named two of the top 20 creative directors worldwide by Creativity magazine, while also twice winning Campaign of the Year honors in the same publication. Further, they were awarded International Campaign of the year by Campaign magazine and received the prestigious Vision award by the New York Art Director’s Guild.
Together, they have a collective 36 years of experience as creatives.
They also share an irrational love of automobiles. Hunter’s obsession runs much deeper, and is much more costly than Rick’s, but the education continues.






People


Max Heilbron
Head of Strategy

Having no silos when it comes to strategy makes for smarter, more holistic work. As Head of Strategy at ARGONAUT, Max brings an integrated approach to problem solving that few agencies can mimic. He spent the last decade at Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, mastering every aspect of the strategic arts: media buying, media planning, communication strategy, and brand strategy. His ability to work across all strategic disciplines is unique in the industry: he's as happy being swaddled in creative briefs or wrapped up in media plans. He grunts quietly when he's thinking hard, which is often.
During his 10 years at GS&P he was recognized across the strategic spectrum (Effies, Media Lions, David Oglivy Awards, Jay Chiat Awards, Creative Media Awards) for work on clients such as Frito-Lay, NBA, eBay, Kayak.com, and Foster Farms. His past experience includes clients such as Saturn, Hyundai, Elizabeth Arden, Got Milk, Häagen-Dazs, Dreyer’s, Google, Comcast, Sonic Drive-In, Nickelodeon, Cheetos, Doritos, Tostitos, and Fritos – all of the –itos, actually. It’s fair to say he’s an –ito expert.
Max lives in San Francisco with his dog Meatball. 









People


Katie Miller
Head of Brand Management

As Head of Brand Management, Katie is responsible for re-imagining how ARGONAUT approaches the client/agency relationship. Her passion for creating trusted relationships that lead to groundbreaking work is infectious. She is tireless in her dedication to both our growing agency and our trusted clients, always pushing both to get world-class work that delivers world-class results.
Prior to joining ARGONAUT, Katie ran TD Ameritrade, Sonic Drive-In and Frito-Lay at Goodby, Silverstein & Partners.
For TD Ameritrade, she oversaw three major re-branding initiatives: the Long Term Investor-targeted “Financial Storytelling” campaign, the fully integrated 2012 Olympics brand campaign, and the Elite Trader-targeted thinkorswim campaign. Together, these efforts helped transform the brand from being known for the “Law & Order guy” to one that was more human and trusted, generating measurable business results that surpassed yearly open-account goals.
On Frito-Lay, Katie ran the $120 million all-natural effort to promote the 'better for you' transformation of the Tostitos, Lays and SunChips brands. This campaign successfully shifted brand perceptions, while also resulting in a Guinness World Record for “most number of Facebook fan likes in 24 hours" within Zynga's Farmville platform.
Prior to Goodby, Silverstein & Partners, Katie oversaw the Kellogg’s kids cereal business at Leo Burnett in Chicago. There she managed the strategy and development of the first-ever Super Bowl spot for a kids’ cereal brand (via the Frosted Flakes Plant-a-Seed initiative) and helped reverse a decade’s worth of sales declines for Kellogg’s Corn Pops by leading an Effie award-winning campaign that overcame perceptions among tweens that the cereal just tasted like corn.
In her spare time, Katie likes to play the guitar, tickle the ivories, and, also, she eats enough red meat to compensate for the surplus of vegetarians in San Francisco. (She’s from Kansas.)

Maura Heilbron
Head of Culture

As Head of Culture, Maura oversees all aspects of our agency life here at ARGONAUT.  Leading everything from staffing & recruitment to agency events and operations, she keeps a hawkish eye on our growing agency. Her principle responsibility is making sure that as we grow, we are making thoughtful choices that will further the growth and development of our people.
A former Account Director, Maura understood the ARGONAUT vision from day one and after several months of leading the agency’s early accounts, we knew that there was no one that would be more perfect for this vital role.  She has been an instrumental part of our growth and her passion for the agency is contagious.
Before ARGONAUT, Maura spent four years at Goodby Silverstein & Partners, as the Global Account Director across various brands in the Frito Lay portfolio including Doritos, Cheetos, and Ruffles. Prior to that, she held account leadership roles on iconic brands such as Pepsi, Pepsi Max,  and The GRAMMYs, at TBWA\Chiat\Day\LA , and Volkswagen at Crispin Porter + Bogusky.
Maura lives in San Francisco with her husband Max and their dog Meatball.

Heath Tohara
Director of Finance

As Director of Finance, Heath does so much more than make sure we make money (although thankfully, he does a bang-up job of that). His real passion lies in unlocking the true market value of creativity and ideas. And the way he does that is by believing in the spirit of negotiation, and partnering with clients to ensure they’re feeling happy about the value they’re getting from the agency. Because happy clients = happy balance sheet = happy Heath.
Heath joins ARGONAUT with over 12 years of experience successfully managing finance and accounting teams. He has worked in various types of agencies, from traditional to digital, ranging in size from rapid growth VC backed start-ups, to highly mature international organizations. Most recently, Heath held the Director of Finance role at Goodby, Silverstein & Partners. He brings a hands-on, roll up your sleeves attitude to any task at hand, and especially enjoys working in the fast-paced, intensely collaborative environment of highly creative agencies.
Although Heath loves number crunching, he is most passionate about his wife and extended family. He and his wife, Patricia, live in San Francisco, where they enjoy spoiling their two nieces and five nephews.
