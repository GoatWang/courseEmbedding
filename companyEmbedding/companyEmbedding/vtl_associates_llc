OppenheimerFunds Acquires RevenueShares ETFs

OppenheimerFunds on Wednesday said that it is acquiring VTL
  Associates, LLC, the owner of the RevenueShares brand of exchange
  traded funds, a move that gives Oppenheimer a footprint in the
  fast-growing smart beta ETF segment.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
  In a statement

  issued by the companies earlier today, VTL said it manages $1.7
  billion in assets across eight ETFs and separate accounts.
In May, VTL hired Royal Bank of Canada to find suitors for
  RevenueShares. Well-known RevenueShares ETFs include the
  RevenueShares Large Cap Fund (NYSE:
  RWL

  ), RevenueShares Financials Sector Fund (NYSE:
  RWW

  ) and the and the RevenueShares Ultra Dividend Fund (NYSE:
  RDIV

  ). Of the six RevenueShares ETFs with long enough track records,
  four carry either four- or five-star ratings from Morningstar,
  according to the statement.
RevenueShares ETFs such as RWL and RWW weight member companies
  by revenue whereas RDIV, the dividend fund, holds 60 members of
  the S&P 900 "ranked by the average 12 month trailing dividend
  yield in each of the previous trailing four quarters,"
  according to RevenueShares

  .
Weighting stocks by revenue or dividends "is designed to lower
  exposure to overvalued companies, while maintaining
  diversification by investing in all of the stocks in the given
  index.
VTL has been successfully employing this strategy in ETFs
  since 2008," according to the statement.
Smart or strategic beta ETFs refer to funds that blend
  properties of both active and passive management.
"Today there are more than 350 smart-beta ETFs available in
  the U.S. comprising over $230 billion in AUM, up from just 212
  products and $64.8 billion in 2010,"
  according to PowerShares

  , the fourth-largest U.S. ETF issuer.
A
  recent study by PowerShares

  indicates nearly two-thirds of institutional investors plan to
  boost usage of smart beta ETFs over the next year, data that
  could explain why some asset managers could look to acquire
  smaller issuers of strategic beta ETFs. 
"Clients have expressed interest in OppenheimerFunds expanding
  its array of investment capabilities," Peter Mintzberg, head of
  corporate strategy and development at OppenheimerFunds, said in
  the statement. "We continue to look for these types of
  opportunities to further broaden our offering."

PRESS RELEASE
NEW YORK, Sept. 9, 2015 /PRNewswire/ — OppenheimerFunds, a leader in global asset management, today announced an agreement to acquire VTL Associates, LLC (VTL), an independent institutional investment firm best known for its RevenueShares exchange traded funds (ETFs). The acquisition expands OppenheimerFunds’ active client offering into the growing smart-beta space, subject to customary closing conditions and consents.
VTL manages $1.7 billion for investors across eight ETFs and its separate accounts. Of the six ETFs that have sufficient track records to be rated by Morningstar, four are either four- or five-star rated.
“Investors are looking to active managers for innovative solutions to add to their overall investment strategy, including products that are designed to deliver better-than-market returns with full transparency of their investment process,” said Art Steinmetz, Chairman, President and CEO of OppenheimerFunds. “For nearly 60 years we have been in the forefront of developing strategies for serving our clients, from offering one of the first global equity funds to being an early adopter of strategic income strategies as well as master limited partnerships in the energy space. VTL’s distinctive approach to smart beta is an outstanding addition to our compelling array of investment strategies across all asset classes.” 





The acquisition will bring both high-quality smart-beta ETFs and an ETF platform offering cost- and tax-efficient investment solutions that financial advisors are increasingly using in their investors’ portfolios.
In general, smart beta strives to identify factors that have the potential to generate positive risk-adjusted returns compared with market-cap-weighted index funds. VTL applies a proprietary methodology to screen and weight the stocks in each ETF according to various factors such as revenue or dividends, instead of by market capitalization. This practice is designed to lower exposure to overvalued companies, while maintaining diversification by investing in all of the stocks in the given index. VTL has been successfully employing this strategy in ETFs since 2008.
“Our firm has grown by serving the needs of investors seeking above-market returns delivered through a suite of custom index products and institutional advisory services,” saidVince Lowry, Founder of VTL.  “We’re delighted to join the OppenheimerFunds family and make our strategies available through OppenheimerFunds’ retail, high net worth and institutional channels.”
Peter Mintzberg, Head of Corporate Strategy and Development at OppenheimerFunds, said, “Clients have expressed interest in OppenheimerFunds expanding its array of investment capabilities.  We are expediting that process with a strategic acquisition, as we did most recently in 2012 with SteelPath, which enabled clients and their investors to participate in the income and tax advantages afforded by master limited partnerships. We continue to look for these types of opportunities to further broaden our offering in a way that is consistent with our core investment approach.” 





Citigroup Global Markets acted as financial advisor and Willkie Farr & Gallagher as legal counsel to OppenheimerFunds on the transaction. RBC Capital Markets served as financial advisor and Metz Lewis Brodman Must O’Keefe as legal counsel to VTL.
