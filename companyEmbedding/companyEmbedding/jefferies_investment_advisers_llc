History[edit]
1962–1987[edit]
Jefferies was founded by Boyd Jefferies in 1962. The firm started with $30,000 in borrowed capital, which Boyd Jefferies used to purchase a seat on the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange.[8] In the early years, the firm was a successful trader and pioneer in what would be called the "third market", which allowed for the trading of listed stocks directly between institutional investors in an over-the-counter style, providing liquidity and anonymity to buyers. In addition to its third market niche, Jefferies pioneered use of the split commissions in 1964. By 1965, Jefferies had joined the Detroit, Midwest, Boston, and Philadelphia stock exchanges. In 1967, the company joined the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), opening a five-person office in New York. The growing third market helped Jefferies become the seventh largest firm in size and trading on the NYSE during those years.
Jefferies was acquired in 1969 by Minneapolis-based Investors Diversified Services (IDS), the second largest U.S. financial services company at the time, and resigned all its stock exchange memberships.[9] Jefferies saw the acquisition as a means to increase the size of its institutional business with additional capital. However, because IDS did not derive at least 50 percent of its gross income from broker-dealer operations, Jefferies had to quit the New York exchange under Exchange Rule 318. In 1971, IDS and Jefferies filed an antitrust lawsuit against the exchange, seeking $6 million in damages. Jefferies and its parent company claimed that the NYSE Big Board was an illegal monopoly and that exclusion had placed the company at a competitive disadvantage.[10] In 1973 the presiding judge informed the NYSE that he planned to rule in Jefferies favour. Membership was opened to brokerage firms owned by other kinds of companies, so long as 80 percent of brokerage was conducted with the public.[11] Jefferies rejoined the exchange in March 1973.
The period during which IDS owned Jefferies was tumultuous and ultimately in September 1973 Boyd Jefferies bought back the company, then based in Los Angeles.[12] By 1977, Jefferies had expanded with offices in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Dallas, Boston, and Atlanta.
Jefferies went public on October 13, 1983, with an initial offering of 1.75 million shares at $13 per share. By 1984, according to Business Week, Jefferies was among the ten most profitable publicly held brokerages.[citation needed] International expansion led the company to develop a new overseas office in London, headed by Frank Baxter. In 1986, Baxter became president and chief operating officer, returning to New York to manage the company.[13]
In 1987, Boyd Jefferies was charged by the government and the Securities and Exchange Commission with two securities violations: "parking" stock for a customer Ivan Boesky and a customer margin violation. Jefferies, who had also earlier testified against Boesky, pleaded guilty; receiving a fine and a probation barring him from the securities industry for five years. The company itself was not charged but its brokerage unit was censured by the SEC. Boyd Jefferies resigned from the company in 1987.[14]
1988–1999[edit]
Frank Baxter took over as CEO in 1987 and under his leadership the company focused on diversification, moving beyond its third market niche.[15] In 1990, Jefferies derived approximately 80 percent of its revenues from equity block trades. In that year, following the collapse of Los Angeles-based Drexel Burnham Lambert, the fifth largest investment bank at the time, Jefferies hired 60 of its bankers and traders, including Jefferies' current chairman and CEO, Richard B. Handler.[16][17] The hires marked the firm's entry into the high yield markets and investment banking. Three years later Jefferies launched its first sector-focused investment banking effort by hiring a group of bankers from Howard Weil, an oil and gas specialty boutique. In March 1994, Jefferies acquired a 25% stake in BBY Ltd, an Australian stockbroking and corporate advisory firm.[citation needed]
Baxter's expansion plans also included global expansion in electronic trading, corporate finance, international convertible sales and derivative sales. Jefferies also moved quickly into the fourth market: off-exchange, computer-based (electronic) trading. In the fourth market the broker's position was eliminated by the Portfolio System for Institutional Trading (POSIT) that traded portfolios and matched buyers and sellers automatically. The company created a wholly owned subsidiary, Investment Technology Group in 1987 to run POSIT. Investment Technology Group was eventually spun off as a separate public company in 1999.[18]
2000–2010[edit]
In January 2000 Frank Baxter stepped down as president of Jefferies and relinquished the CEO title later that year. In January 2001, Handler became Chairman and CEO; and John Shaw became sole president and COO. Handler and Shaw set out to build a fully integrated investment bank and to develop a merchant bank. The new leadership proposed to give equity to every employee and diversify the firm's revenue with asset management, a more aggressive buildup of investment banking and merchant banking. In September 2001, the firm moved its headquarters from Los Angeles to New York. During this period, Jefferies built its investment banking division primarily by acquiring boutique advisory firms with specific sector expertise, most notably Randall & Dewey (energy) and Broadview (technology). Significant acquisitions during this period included:

FS Private Investments, renamed Jefferies Capital Partners, 2001
Lawrence Helfant, a NYSE Floor Broker Unit, August 2001[19]
Quarterdeck Investment Partners, an aerospace and defense advisory firm, December 2002
Broadview International, a technology-focused advisory firm, December 2003
Randall & Dewey, an energy-focused advisory firm, February 2005
Helix, a private equity fund placement firm, May 2005
LongAcre Partners, a media advisory firm, May 2007
Putnam Lovell, a financial services advisory firm, July 2007[20]
Depfa First Albany Securities, municipal securities, March 2009
Bache & Co., FX, commodities and options trading, July 2011
Hoare Govett, corporate broking, February 2012

Beginning in 2008, Jefferies took advantage of the dislocation created during the credit crisis to enter several new business segments, including mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds.[citation needed] On June 17, 2009, after several primary dealers, including Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, and Merrill Lynch, either collapsed or were acquired by other firms, Jefferies was named one of just 17 primary dealers participating in the New York Fed's open-market buying and selling of securities and Treasury auctions and providing market information to the New York Fed.[21]
Beginning in 2009 the firm expanded its European businesses. Its new European Rates unit, based in London, became an official member of the Federal Republic of Germany's bidding group in October 2009,[22] a Gilt-Edged Market Maker (GEMM) appointed jointly by the UK Debt Management Office and London Stock Exchange,[23] and was recognized as a Dutch Primary Dealer by the Dutch State Treasury,[24] both in December 2009. Additionally, in February 2010 Jefferies was appointed as an EBT (Especialistas em Bilhetes do Tesouro) for Treasury Bills and as an OMP (Operadores de Mercado Primário) for long-term bonds by the Portuguese Treasury and Government Debt Agency (Instituto de Gestão da Tesouraria e do Crédito Público, IGCP).[25] Jefferies is also providing liquidity across the whole spectrum of other European government bonds.
In June 2009 the firm hired more than 35 healthcare-focused investment banking professionals from UBS. UBS’s health care group, then led by Benjamin Lorello, was a major moneymaker for the firm. The group had closed more than $567 billion in transactions since 2005, generating in excess of $1 billion in revenues for UBS. Since moving to Jefferies, the healthcare group has been ranked the #1 bookrunner in number of healthcare follow-on equity transactions and the #1 ranked financial advisor in number of healthcare M&A transactions.[26][27]
2010 onward[edit]
In November 2011, Jefferies was accused by Egan-Jones of having 77% of its shareholder's equity tied up in the same illiquid sovereign debt securities that just toppled MF Global.[28] This was accompanied by a concurrent large-scale short seller attack and a campaign of what turned out to be misinformation. Handler and the management team responded with unprecedented immediacy and transparency, collapsed 75% of the position to prove the bonds were hedged and highly liquid, sharply reduced the rest of Jefferies balance sheet and publicly addressed every false accusation. This aggressive and unconventional response resulted in an evenutual 100% increase in Jefferies share price from the November lows. Leucadia, a 29% shareholder, later called this event Jefferies' "finest hour."[29]
On April 16, 2012 Jefferies CEO Richard Handler and Chairman of the Executive Committee Brian Friedman formed the Jefferies Global Senior Advisory Board which includes James D Robinson III, Lord Hollick, Michael Goldstein, Bernard Bourigeaud, Dennis Archer, Gilles Pélisson and Sir David Reid.[30]
On August 1, 2012, Knight Capital took a pre-tax loss of $440m due to a trading glitch.[31] On Sunday Aug 5 the company managed to raise around $400 million from six investors led by Jefferies in an attempt to stay in business after the trading error.[32] Jefferies CEO Richard Handler and Executive Committee Chair Brian Friedman structured and led the rescue and Jefferies purchased $125 million of the $400 million investment and became Knight's largest shareholder.
On November 12, 2012, Jefferies announced its merger with Leucadia, its largest (28%) shareholder. Leucadia is often referred to as a Baby Berkshire because of its similarities to Berkshire Hathaway. Jefferies was valued at $3.8 billion and at the time of the acquisition the newly combined company had $9.4 billion of shareholder's equity, over $5 billion of cash, and $4 billion of net operating loss ("NOL") tax credits. Jefferies remains independent and is the largest operating company within Leucadia. Richard Handler became CEO of Leucadia while retaining his position as CEO of Jefferies. Brian Friedman became President of Leucadia while retaining his duties at Jefferies. Ian Cumming retired as CEO of Leucadia and remains a Board Member and Joe Steinberg became Chairman of Leucadia.[33]
In September 2014, Jefferies announced a $500 million deal with CircleBack Lending, which was the largest of its kind at the time. They aimed to leverage their experience with securitization markets to structure securities upheld by CircleBack Lending assets, which could then be rated and sold to an array of investors.[34] In June 2015, the first securitization from this deal took place, totaling $106 million.[35]
Operations[edit]
Jefferies has coverage groups spanning across all industries including Aerospace & Defense, Business Services, CleanTech, Consumer & Retail, Energy, Financial Institutions Group, Financial Sponsors, Gaming & Leisure, Healthcare, Industrials, Maritime, Media, Public Finance, Real Estate & Lodging, Technology, and Telecommunications.
The firm also provides investors fundamental research and trade execution in equity, equity-linked, and fixed income securities, including corporate bonds, United States government and agency securities, repo finance, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, municipal bonds, whole loans, and emerging market debt, as well as commodities and derivatives. In addition, Jefferies provides asset management services and products to institutions and other investors.
The Group Global Headquarters located in New York City, European Headquarters located in London & Asia Headquarters located in Hong Kong,[36] Jefferies has over 30 offices worldwide including Boston, Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Silicon Valley area as well as in leading financial centers around the world that include Frankfurt, Zürich, Singapore, Shanghai, Tokyo, and Mumbai.[16]

The period during which IDS owned Jefferies was tumultuous and ultimately in September 1973 Boyd Jefferies bought back the company, then based in Los Angeles.[12] By 1977, Jefferies had expanded with offices in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Dallas, Boston, and Atlanta.
Jefferies went public on October 13, 1983, with an initial offering of 1.75 million shares at $13 per share. By 1984, according to Business Week, Jefferies was among the ten most profitable publicly held brokerages.[citation needed] International expansion led the company to develop a new overseas office in London, headed by Frank Baxter. In 1986, Baxter became president and chief operating officer, returning to New York to manage the company.[13]
In 1987, Boyd Jefferies was charged by the government and the Securities and Exchange Commission with two securities violations: "parking" stock for a customer Ivan Boesky and a customer margin violation. Jefferies, who had also earlier testified against Boesky, pleaded guilty; receiving a fine and a probation barring him from the securities industry for five years. The company itself was not charged but its brokerage unit was censured by the SEC. Boyd Jefferies resigned from the company in 1987.[14]
1988–1999[edit]
Frank Baxter took over as CEO in 1987 and under his leadership the company focused on diversification, moving beyond its third market niche.[15] In 1990, Jefferies derived approximately 80 percent of its revenues from equity block trades. In that year, following the collapse of Los Angeles-based Drexel Burnham Lambert, the fifth largest investment bank at the time, Jefferies hired 60 of its bankers and traders, including Jefferies' current chairman and CEO, Richard B. Handler.[16][17] The hires marked the firm's entry into the high yield markets and investment banking. Three years later Jefferies launched its first sector-focused investment banking effort by hiring a group of bankers from Howard Weil, an oil and gas specialty boutique. In March 1994, Jefferies acquired a 25% stake in BBY Ltd, an Australian stockbroking and corporate advisory firm.[citation needed]
Baxter's expansion plans also included global expansion in electronic trading, corporate finance, international convertible sales and derivative sales. Jefferies also moved quickly into the fourth market: off-exchange, computer-based (electronic) trading. In the fourth market the broker's position was eliminated by the Portfolio System for Institutional Trading (POSIT) that traded portfolios and matched buyers and sellers automatically. The company created a wholly owned subsidiary, Investment Technology Group in 1987 to run POSIT. Investment Technology Group was eventually spun off as a separate public company in 1999.[18]
2000–2010[edit]
In January 2000 Frank Baxter stepped down as president of Jefferies and relinquished the CEO title later that year. In January 2001, Handler became Chairman and CEO; and John Shaw became sole president and COO. Handler and Shaw set out to build a fully integrated investment bank and to develop a merchant bank. The new leadership proposed to give equity to every employee and diversify the firm's revenue with asset management, a more aggressive buildup of investment banking and merchant banking. In September 2001, the firm moved its headquarters from Los Angeles to New York. During this period, Jefferies built its investment banking division primarily by acquiring boutique advisory firms with specific sector expertise, most notably Randall & Dewey (energy) and Broadview (technology). Significant acquisitions during this period included:

FS Private Investments, renamed Jefferies Capital Partners, 2001
Lawrence Helfant, a NYSE Floor Broker Unit, August 2001[19]
Quarterdeck Investment Partners, an aerospace and defense advisory firm, December 2002
Broadview International, a technology-focused advisory firm, December 2003
Randall & Dewey, an energy-focused advisory firm, February 2005
Helix, a private equity fund placement firm, May 2005
LongAcre Partners, a media advisory firm, May 2007
Putnam Lovell, a financial services advisory firm, July 2007[20]
Depfa First Albany Securities, municipal securities, March 2009
Bache & Co., FX, commodities and options trading, July 2011
Hoare Govett, corporate broking, February 2012

Beginning in 2008, Jefferies took advantage of the dislocation created during the credit crisis to enter several new business segments, including mortgage-backed securities and municipal bonds.[citation needed] On June 17, 2009, after several primary dealers, including Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, and Merrill Lynch, either collapsed or were acquired by other firms, Jefferies was named one of just 17 primary dealers participating in the New York Fed's open-market buying and selling of securities and Treasury auctions and providing market information to the New York Fed.[21]
Beginning in 2009 the firm expanded its European businesses. Its new European Rates unit, based in London, became an official member of the Federal Republic of Germany's bidding group in October 2009,[22] a Gilt-Edged Market Maker (GEMM) appointed jointly by the UK Debt Management Office and London Stock Exchange,[23] and was recognized as a Dutch Primary Dealer by the Dutch State Treasury,[24] both in December 2009. Additionally, in February 2010 Jefferies was appointed as an EBT (Especialistas em Bilhetes do Tesouro) for Treasury Bills and as an OMP (Operadores de Mercado Primário) for long-term bonds by the Portuguese Treasury and Government Debt Agency (Instituto de Gestão da Tesouraria e do Crédito Público, IGCP).[25] Jefferies is also providing liquidity across the whole spectrum of other European government bonds.
In June 2009 the firm hired more than 35 healthcare-focused investment banking professionals from UBS. UBS’s health care group, then led by Benjamin Lorello, was a major moneymaker for the firm. The group had closed more than $567 billion in transactions since 2005, generating in excess of $1 billion in revenues for UBS. Since moving to Jefferies, the healthcare group has been ranked the #1 bookrunner in number of healthcare follow-on equity transactions and the #1 ranked financial advisor in number of healthcare M&A transactions.[26][27]
2010 onward[edit]
In November 2011, Jefferies was accused by Egan-Jones of having 77% of its shareholder's equity tied up in the same illiquid sovereign debt securities that just toppled MF Global.[28] This was accompanied by a concurrent large-scale short seller attack and a campaign of what turned out to be misinformation. Handler and the management team responded with unprecedented immediacy and transparency, collapsed 75% of the position to prove the bonds were hedged and highly liquid, sharply reduced the rest of Jefferies balance sheet and publicly addressed every false accusation. This aggressive and unconventional response resulted in an evenutual 100% increase in Jefferies share price from the November lows. Leucadia, a 29% shareholder, later called this event Jefferies' "finest hour."[29]
On April 16, 2012 Jefferies CEO Richard Handler and Chairman of the Executive Committee Brian Friedman formed the Jefferies Global Senior Advisory Board which includes James D Robinson III, Lord Hollick, Michael Goldstein, Bernard Bourigeaud, Dennis Archer, Gilles Pélisson and Sir David Reid.[30]
On August 1, 2012, Knight Capital took a pre-tax loss of $440m due to a trading glitch.[31] On Sunday Aug 5 the company managed to raise around $400 million from six investors led by Jefferies in an attempt to stay in business after the trading error.[32] Jefferies CEO Richard Handler and Executive Committee Chair Brian Friedman structured and led the rescue and Jefferies purchased $125 million of the $400 million investment and became Knight's largest shareholder.
On November 12, 2012, Jefferies announced its merger with Leucadia, its largest (28%) shareholder. Leucadia is often referred to as a Baby Berkshire because of its similarities to Berkshire Hathaway. Jefferies was valued at $3.8 billion and at the time of the acquisition the newly combined company had $9.4 billion of shareholder's equity, over $5 billion of cash, and $4 billion of net operating loss ("NOL") tax credits. Jefferies remains independent and is the largest operating company within Leucadia. Richard Handler became CEO of Leucadia while retaining his position as CEO of Jefferies. Brian Friedman became President of Leucadia while retaining his duties at Jefferies. Ian Cumming retired as CEO of Leucadia and remains a Board Member and Joe Steinberg became Chairman of Leucadia.[33]
In September 2014, Jefferies announced a $500 million deal with CircleBack Lending, which was the largest of its kind at the time. They aimed to leverage their experience with securitization markets to structure securities upheld by CircleBack Lending assets, which could then be rated and sold to an array of investors.[34] In June 2015, the first securitization from this deal took place, totaling $106 million.[35]
Operations[edit]
Jefferies has coverage groups spanning across all industries including Aerospace & Defense, Business Services, CleanTech, Consumer & Retail, Energy, Financial Institutions Group, Financial Sponsors, Gaming & Leisure, Healthcare, Industrials, Maritime, Media, Public Finance, Real Estate & Lodging, Technology, and Telecommunications.
The firm also provides investors fundamental research and trade execution in equity, equity-linked, and fixed income securities, including corporate bonds, United States government and agency securities, repo finance, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, municipal bonds, whole loans, and emerging market debt, as well as commodities and derivatives. In addition, Jefferies provides asset management services and products to institutions and other investors.

History[edit]
1962–1987[edit]
Jefferies was founded by Boyd Jefferies in 1962. The firm started with $30,000 in borrowed capital, which Boyd Jefferies used to purchase a seat on the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange.[8] In the early years, the firm was a successful trader and pioneer in what would be called the "third market", which allowed for the trading of listed stocks directly between institutional investors in an over-the-counter style, providing liquidity and anonymity to buyers. In addition to its third market niche, Jefferies pioneered use of the split commissions in 1964. By 1965, Jefferies had joined the Detroit, Midwest, Boston, and Philadelphia stock exchanges. In 1967, the company joined the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), opening a five-person office in New York. The growing third market helped Jefferies become the seventh largest firm in size and trading on the NYSE during those years.
Jefferies was acquired in 1969 by Minneapolis-based Investors Diversified Services (IDS), the second largest U.S. financial services company at the time, and resigned all its stock exchange memberships.[9] Jefferies saw the acquisition as a means to increase the size of its institutional business with additional capital. However, because IDS did not derive at least 50 percent of its gross income from broker-dealer operations, Jefferies had to quit the New York exchange under Exchange Rule 318. In 1971, IDS and Jefferies filed an antitrust lawsuit against the exchange, seeking $6 million in damages. Jefferies and its parent company claimed that the NYSE Big Board was an illegal monopoly and that exclusion had placed the company at a competitive disadvantage.[10] In 1973 the presiding judge informed the NYSE that he planned to rule in Jefferies favour. Membership was opened to brokerage firms owned by other kinds of companies, so long as 80 percent of brokerage was conducted with the public.[11] Jefferies rejoined the exchange in March 1973.
The period during which IDS owned Jefferies was tumultuous and ultimately in September 1973 Boyd Jefferies bought back the company, then based in Los Angeles.[12] By 1977, Jefferies had expanded with offices in Los Angeles, New York, Chicago, Dallas, Boston, and Atlanta.
Jefferies went public on October 13, 1983, with an initial offering of 1.75 million shares at $13 per share. By 1984, according to Business Week, Jefferies was among the ten most profitable publicly held brokerages.[citation needed] International expansion led the company to develop a new overseas office in London, headed by Frank Baxter. In 1986, Baxter became president and chief operating officer, returning to New York to manage the company.[13]
In 1987, Boyd Jefferies was charged by the government and the Securities and Exchange Commission with two securities violations: "parking" stock for a customer Ivan Boesky and a customer margin violation. Jefferies, who had also earlier testified against Boesky, pleaded guilty; receiving a fine and a probation barring him from the securities industry for five years. The company itself was not charged but its brokerage unit was censured by the SEC. Boyd Jefferies resigned from the company in 1987.[14]

Financial advisors use their knowledge of investments, 
tax laws, and insurance to recommend financial options to individuals.
The SEC typically regulates investment advisers that have assets under management in excess of $25,000,000. Investment advisers that do not meet this threshold generally are regulated by the states. The SEC registers IA firms but does not separately register individual representatives of IA firms. The states register IA firms, and many separately register individual investment adviser representatives.

Currently, you can only search for IA firms on this website. In the future, this website also will provide the ability to search for individual investment adviser representatives.

In 1996 Congress amended the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require that the SEC establish a readily accessible electronic process to respond to public inquiries about investment advisers and their disciplinary information. The SEC created this website to satisfy Congress? mandate.

	Our Firm

	For over 50 years, Jefferies has measured success just one way: We only win when our clients win. What makes this approach so important today is not just our dedication to it, but that these values and character of work have never been more important to our clients.

	Jefferies provides insight, expertise and execution to investors, companies and government entities. We offer deep sector expertise across a full range of products and services in investment banking, equities, fixed income and wealth management in the Americas, Europe and the Middle East and Asia.

	As what may be the last true, pure-play investment bank in the world, we still pride ourselves on a hands-on approach, lack of bureaucratic process or over-complexity of products, and the dedication of our first team to every client.     


		For corporate clients, we are a top M&A and restructuring advisor and underwriter of debt and equity new issues

		Serving institutional investors and high-net-worth individuals, we are a leading provider of trade execution and liquidity in equity, convertible and high yield securities and a market maker of fixed income products

		Jefferies also offers top-tier wealth management, prime services and securities finance

		The firm has an award-winning research practice, covering equity, high yield and convertible securities.


	Most of all, we never forget that what will distinguish us is not our range of capabilities, but one simple commitment:
	Clients first, always.

What’s Coming Out of Silicon Valley


				By Randall Stross			
August 23, 2012 6:20 am
August 23, 2012 6:20 am







Randall Stross, the Digital Domain columnist for The New York Times, has been following Y Combinator, the Silicon Valley start-up incubator, for more than a year. His book, “The Launch Pad: Inside Y Combinator, Silicon Valley’s Most Exclusive School for Startups,” will be published next month by Portfolio/Penguin. 
He got a rare insider look at all of the incubator’s fledgling start-ups in robotics, mobile apps, e-commerce services and software for companies. Here is his exhaustive, but not exhausting, special report for Bits on the current crop of companies Y Combinator has produced.

Peer through the window of a hospital nursery and you see rows and rows of cute babies. I think newborn start-ups possess the same kind of cheek-pinching appeal.
And nowhere can you find as large a collection of start-ups in a single place as those that come out of Y Combinator, the Mountain View, Calif., seed fund.
On Tuesday, YC, as insiders call it, staged its 15th semiannual Demo Day for investors. Sixty-three of the summer batch’s companies made a formal public presentation to investors and the press. That’s a lot of newborns.
The Demo Day format hasn’t changed much as YC has grown over the years, attracting ever larger numbers of applications and funding larger batches of start-ups. The purpose of the exercise is to give investors a tantalizing tidbit or two of information sufficient for determining whether to have the conversations that may eventually lead to an investment. Each presentation lasts just two or two and a half minutes, is filled with astounding figures (“a $150 billion market!”), comes in thematically random order, and is stacked one on top of the other, in a blur. (Eleven more presentations came at the end that were designated off-the-record.)
Sure, some of the babies appear to be a bit cuter than the others. But all deserve a chance to make their way. What can be done immediately is view the group portrait. YC’s summer 2012 batch captures prevailing start-up ideas in one moment in time.
A little more than half of the start-ups that presented are attempting to sell to business customers. Let’s start, however, with the start-ups that are consumer oriented. Many are fledgling media businesses built upon user-generated content.  We users apparently have very short attention spans. The humor site 9gag , which serves up silly memes found by users — and draws 65 million unique users a month — says “bite size is the future of entertainment.” Reelsurfer lets users reduce a video clip, which may already be short, to extremely short length.
For more conventional entertainment, there is Mars Frontier, a massively multiplayer, real-time strategy game, the first game produced by SpinPunch. What is not so conventional, at least not yet, is the use of HTML5, which requires no download as Flash-based games do.
Tapin, which like many of its batchmates incorporates the twin motifs of mobile and social, is a mobile video app designed for a speedy start. Kamcord also is in social and mobile entertainment: mobile game developers are invited to use its software so that gamers can record and share their gameplay. Another company makes the Coco Controller, a smartphone case that has physical buttons for use with mobile games that are written to work with the case. 
Circular applies the social theme to news, letting one’s friends act as a filter. Or, for those who would like to not have the social overlay on everything one does, there’s Everyday.me, an iPhone app that “captures all your life moments” but whose default setting is private: not to be shared with others.
There is some playful experimentation with communication. Visitors to Voicegem’s Web site can record a voice message that is sent to an e-mail address rather than a phone number.  Hubchilla matches users up with strangers to have conversations via texting but keeps the participants’ phone numbers hidden. (One of its co-founders, who is a 20 Under 20 Thiel Fellow, said he began coding at the age of 8.)
Tablets receive the focused attention of Grid, which makes a spreadsheet that does some tricks that no spreadsheet on a PC could ever match.
Amid the fascination with mobile, the Web has not disappeared completely, however. For sharing favorite images found on the Web, there’s Imgfave. For favorite links, with the pitch addressed to office workers in particular, there’s Kippt.  For finding stuff of our own that is stored in Google Docs, Collections provides a “finder for the cloud.”
No fewer than four of the start-ups in the batch provide travel-related services. Flightfox runs contests in which travel agents and other humans compete to find the lowest fare for international or multicity flights. Or travelers can use GetGoing, which describes itself as “the next-generation Priceline.” It supplies a deeply discounted fare for leisure travelers who are willing to agree to go to either of two separate destinations — but cannot choose which one it is.  Vayable offers unusual travel experiences, bringing travelers and independent guides together. TomoGuides is preparing smartphone city guides that will be offered free. 
Like Vayable, other start-ups are creating an online marketplace, bringing together suppliers and customers and offering prices lower than those available using existing middlemen in the physical world. Tastemaker does the same for interior designers and customers.
RegistryLove works with existing merchants but is attempting to create a consolidated wedding registry that spans all stores.
Healthy Labs, a start-up hosting what it calls “patient social networks” for chronic diseases, has begun with a site for those with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis:  Crohnology.
In education, Knowmia has set up a site that invites teachers to contribute video lessons, what the company describes as “a crowdsourced Khan Academy.”  StudyEdge offers college students study guides, video content and live review sessions that address challenging courses at particular universities. It’s now available at the University of Florida. 
The personal finance category of software is an old one. SmartAsset, a Web-based service, applies its own analytical engine to the category, which supplies customized answers to users’ questions like how much house can one afford.
Instacart is an intrepid start-up that has entered another old category, one known for the notorious failure of early pioneers: Web-based grocery ordering. Its founder stressed that it carried no inventory (unlike the infamous failure Webvan): “We’re entirely software.”
A category of software with a much shorter history is that for 3-D printers. Dreamforge lets users create a customized design for a three-dimensional superhero that the company will print — that is, manufacture — then send back to the customer.
The blend of the physical and the digital is also found in Vastrm, a Web site that offers customized shirts, including a “Home Try-On Program,” similar to what Warby Parker offers for eyeglasses. Vastrm’s founder received one of the loudest appreciative laughs of the day when he pointed to Warby Parker’s success and remarked, “Not everyone wears glasses, but everyone wears a shirt.”
Suppose you’re not home when U.P.S. tries to deliver your Dreamforge superhero or Vastrm polo shirt to your apartment? Someday you may live close to a BufferBox location, each with a box containing multiple parcel lockers that are controlled through software. (BufferBox is rolling out its initial boxes in Toronto.)
The remaining start-ups in this summer batch are pitching to the enterprise or to fellow software developers.
Some services are focused on a particular industry and are highly specialized. Keychain Logistics brings together shippers and truckers, eliminating human brokers. Viacycle runs bike-sharing programs for universities, cities and businesses. Rentio tells apartment owners what they should charge for rent. Eligible helps insurance companies and health care providers fully automate insurance eligibility queries, eliminating the expense of placing, and fielding, phone calls between humans. Hiptype teams up with e-book publishers, embedding its software in the books to gather data for what it calls “data-driven book publishing.”
If the business is one in which individuals outside the company send in documents that must then be reviewed — résumés, grant applications, college applications — there’s a YC company that handles the process: Submittable.
Parallel Universe supplies a database service for businesses or organizations that manage vast amounts of spatial data in real time, like the Israeli air force, an early customer.
Amicus seeks to profit from helping nonprofits replace inefficient fund-raising using old means, like mail appeals and cold calls, with social media: friends referring friends.
Finance, with its large I.T. budgets, has attracted BigCalc, which does fast simulations for quants and algo traders, and DataNitro, which weds Python financial and math libraries to Excel spreadsheets. 
FundersClub wants to be “the future Nasdaq,” matching accredited investors with tech start-ups. Coinbase offers a way for nontechnical users to get started with Bitcoin, the digital currency.
Many of the start-ups that are selling to the enterprise aim at customers that belong to no particular industry.  MicroEval seeks to move performance reviews to the cloud. Statwing supplies easy “data visualization” to nontechnical people working with spreadsheets.  QuicklyChat is a video chat service for co-workers that the company claims is easy to use but will not interrupt the work of the person who is asked to respond because of the software’s “intelligent availability detection.”
Small and medium-size businesses that need a customized phone system can turn to Profig. For warehouse management, there’s HD Trade Services’ cloud-based inventory manager.
A large cluster of the start-ups are in marketing or advertising. Sponsorfied seeks to match corporate sponsors with targets. LeanMarket guides ad buyers on banner-ad exchanges. Canopy Labs does customer modeling to help clients evaluate the value of leads. Referly expands affiliate marketing, working with more than 30,000 retailers. Tracksby plans to arrange celebrity endorsements. Virool offers to help spread advertisers’ videos through social networks, blogs and phones. On behalf of clients, Survata distributes market research surveys to Web publishers, who let visitors who complete the surveys read articles free instead of paying.
Mth Sense provides mobile advertisers with information about the gender and interests of users;  the company deduces these by looking at what other apps are installed on a phone. (This company holds what I believe must be the day’s record for largest figure mentioned — 25 trillion — a reference to the number of in-app ads that the company says will appear in 2016.)
We come to the last category of start-ups in the batch, the one that is, by far, the largest: tools and services for software developers. YC has always attracted strong technical teams and no one knows better than developers and designers themselves what they need. This batch has Light Table, an interactive programming development that had raised more than $300,000 on Kickstarter last spring; Easel and Markupwand for Web site design; Scoutzie,  a marketplace for mobile app designers; Airbrite for tightly integrating e-commerce functionality to mobile apps; Clever, which has APIs for software developers who are working with schools and their student rosters; Plivo, challenging the dominant incumbent, Twilio, which has APIs for voice and SMS applications; Filepicker.io, which eases file movement between a local device and the cloud; and Zapier, which seeks to be the master translator of all APIs.
Representatives of one company in the batch stood out in particular; they were arguably the sensation of the day and had a thick knot of observers surrounding them at every break. These were the svelte robots of Double Robotics, designed to provide telepresence inexpensively. One iPad is mounted on top, facing outward; another iPad is held by the human who controls the machine. In developing it, the founders took on challenges in hardware as well as software, but they were able to come to market with a price of $2,000, a fraction of the price for telepresence robots from incumbents. The company received $500,000 of advance orders in just one week.
Gratifying, yes, but being in the hardware business means dealing with real materials and finite supplies. The company sold out its first production run and says orders placed today won’t be filled until early 2013.
