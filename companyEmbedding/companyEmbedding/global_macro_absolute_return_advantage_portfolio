Summary







 


Overall Rating

5 out of 5 Stars

Morningstar has awarded this fund 5 stars based on its risk-adjusted performance compared to the 259 funds within its Morningstar Category.



How is it determined?


The Overall Morningstar RatingTM for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics, which are based on risk-adjusted returns, as of the date stated.

 funds
                       




What does it mean?


A fund's Morningstar Rating is a quantitative assessment of a fund's past performance that accounts for both risk and return, with funds earning between 1 and 5 stars. As always, this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process. A high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision.











 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High


This fund scored High because it delivered returns that were in the top 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category over a 3-year period.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve. In each Morningstar Category: top 10% - High next 22.5% - Above Average middle 35% - Average next 22.5% - Below Average bottom 10% - Low




What does it mean?



While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Expenses


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Average


This fund's expenses are rated as Average because they fall between the 40th and 60th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category.





How is it calculated?


This Morningstar data point compares the fund's net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its Morningstar Category grouping.





What does it mean?


Excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance. While you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios, a fund's expense structure may be one factor to consider.











 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Fund Overview




Objective



The investment seeks total return.




Strategy



The fund seeks its investment objective by investing in securities, derivatives and other instruments to establish long and short investment exposures around the world. Total return is defined as income plus capital appreciation. It normally invests in multiple countries and frequently has significant exposure to foreign currencies and investments. The fund's long and short investments primarily are sovereign exposures, including currencies, interest rates and debt instruments issued or guaranteed by sovereign entities. The fund is non-diversified.


Risk



Lower-quality debt securities that involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer. Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which may be magnified in emerging markets. In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible. May not be suitable for all investors. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.




Additional Disclosures

This description is only intended to provide a brief overview of the mutual fund. Read the fund's prospectus for more detailed information about the fund.
Additional Risk Information: Short positions pose a risk because they lose value as a security's price increases; therefore, the loss on a short sale is theoretically unlimited.

Risk


LOW
AVG
HIGH


Above Average

This fund scores Above Average because Morningstar has rated its risk between the 60th and 80th percentiles when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category.




How is it calculated?


Risk is calculated using the Sharpe ratio, which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to U.S. Treasury bonds, relative to the fund's overall volatility. For this measure, Morningstar has compared the Sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in it's Morningstar Category.




What does it mean?


A higher Sharpe implies better risk-adjusted returns. Therefore, if a fund has a Sharpe ratio higher than its category average, it's returns relative to it's risk were better than other similar funds. If its Sharpe ratio is lower, that's usually a sign that the risk-adjusted returns were lower than other similar funds.










 


Returns


LOW
AVG
HIGH


High


This fund scored High because it delivered returns that were in the top 10% when compared to other funds within its Morningstar category over a 3-year period.





How is it calculated?



This rating is based on a fund's Morningstar Return (its annualized return in excess to the return of the 90-day U.S. Treasury bill over a three-, five-, or ten-year period). The Morningstar Returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve.

While past performance is no guarantee of future results, the Morningstar Return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group. It does not, however, show the effects of risk.Therefore, the Morningstar Return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the Morningstar Risk Score. For example, an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same Morningstar Star Rating and similar Morningstar Risk Adjusted Returns but different levels of risk.










 


Risk of this Type of Fund


LOWER
HIGHER





Morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories. These risk levels range from 1 for those funds with least amount of risk to 10 for those with the greatest amount of risk.






How is it calculated?



Morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the Morningstar Risk of the funds in the Category over the previous 5-year period. Morningstar Risk is the difference between the Morningstar Return, based on fund total returns, and the Morningstar Risk Adjusted Return, based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average Morningstar Risk of the funds in the category.  Morningstar's Research Committee evaluates the Category Morningstar Risk and assigns the Category Risk Level after further qualitative judgment.




What does it mean?



This score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular Morningstar category of funds, which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment. The Category Risk Level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category. It does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular Morningstar category.  Because the score is based on past performance, it may not reflect the future risk of the category. In addition to risk, you should evaluate a fund's investment objective, strategy, fees and other characteristics before making your investment decision.Learn more

Risk



Lower-quality debt securities that involve greater risk of default or price changes due to potential changes in the credit quality of the issuer. Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which may be magnified in emerging markets. In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible. May not be suitable for all investors. Additional risk information for this product may be found in the prospectus or other product materials, if available.

The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. (Exchange-traded funds and open-end mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes.) It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of  funds in each fund category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.

In general the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk and credit  and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so avoiding losses caused by price volatility by holding them until maturity is not possible.

The "Mutual Funds" area at the top of each page allows access to mutual fund holdings with individual and joint Fidelity non-retirement accounts. Individual stock positions, ETFs and 529 funds are not available through this view. For the full list of your holdings visit Portfolio Summary.Mutual Funds are priced as of the previous business day's market close when the market is open. Mutual fund positions are priced as of the official market close (typically 4p.m.) and prices are generally available between 5 p.m. and 6p.m.

The performance data featured represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results.  Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate; therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.  Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.











1. Transaction Fee:A transaction fee is similar to a  brokerage fee or commission which you pay when you buy or sell a stock. For some funds available through Fidelity you are required to pay a transaction fee. However, you will not pay a sales load on Transaction Fee (TF) funds. You will only be charged a transaction fee when you buy a FundsNetwork TF fund, not when you sell one. All other fees and expenses described in a fund's prospectus still apply. You can choose to buy or sell shares directly from the fund itself or its principal underwriter or distributor without paying a transaction fee to Fidelity.Online Transaction Fees:  $49.95 for most funds.  Certain funds will have a transaction fee of $75. To identify any applicable transaction fees associated with the purchase of a given fund, please refer to the "Fees and Distributions" tab.Fidelity Automated Service Telephone (FAST): 25% off representative-assisted rates, Maximum: $187.50, Minimum:$75Representative-Assisted: 0.75% of principal, Maximum: $250, Minimum: $100Automatic Investment: $5 per transaction, after the initial investment.Sales load:A sales charge added to the price of the fund.  Funds have different sales charge structures, including front-end loads, back-end loads (deferred), and no loads. Sales loads can either be charged when a fund is purchased, commonly known as a front-end load, or when a fund is sold, known as a deferred load. Not  all funds charge a load. Refer to the Loads, Expense and Minimums section of the fund's prospectus for details on these amounts. Although no load funds do not have a front-end or deferred load, they may incur other fees, such as a 12b-1 fee.
2. Total returns are historical and include change in share value and reinvestment of dividends and capital gains, if any. Cumulative total returns are reported as of the period indicated.  Life of fund figures are reported as of the commencement date to the period indicated and are cumulative if the fund is less than one year old. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sales charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower.
3. The Morningstar Category Average is the average return for the peer group based on the returns of each individual fund within the group, for the period shown. This average assumes reinvestment of dividends.
4. This chart illustrates the performance of a hypothetical $10,000 investment made in this investment product (and a benchmark or category average, if shown) from the beginning date shown or on the inception date of the product (whichever is later).  The inception date used for products with underlying funds, or multiple shares classes, or are offered as a separate account, strategy or sub account, may be the inception date of the underlying fund, the earliest share class of the product, or the date composite performance for the product was first made available. The product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Benchmark returns include reinvestment of capital gains and dividends, if any, but do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest in an index. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. This chart is not intended to imply any future performance of the investment product.
5. Initial minimum investments into group retirement accounts such as Fidelity Simplified Employee Pension-IRA, Keogh, Self-Employed 401(k), and Non-Fidelity Prototype Retirement accounts are $500 or higher. Additional investments into Regular, IRA, and Group accounts are $250 or higher.
6. A standard yield calculation developed by the Securities and Exchange Commission for bond funds. The yield is calculated by dividing the net investment income per share earned during the 30-day period by the maximum offering price per share on the last day of the period. The yield figure reflects the dividends and interest earned during the 30-day period, after the deduction of the fund's expenses. It is sometimes referred to as "SEC 30-Day Yield" or "standardized yield".
7. Any holdings, asset allocation, diversification breakdowns or other composition data shown are as of the date indicated and are subject to change at any time. They may not be representative of the fund's current or future investments. Some breakdowns may be intentionally limited to a particular asset class or other subset of the fund's entire portfolio, particularly in multi-asset class funds where the attributes of the equity and fixed income portions are different. Under the asset allocation section, international (or foreign) assets may be reported differently depending on how an investment options reports its holdings.  Some do not report international (or foreign) holdings here, but instead report them in a "Regional Diversification" section.  Some report them in this section as an to the equity, bond and other allocation shown.  Others report international (or foreign) holding as a subset of the equity and bond allocations shown.  If the allocation without the foreign component (or round to) 100%, then international (or foreign) is a subset of the equity and bond percentage shown.
8. Percent Rank in Category is the fund's total-return percentile rank relative to all funds that have the same Morningstar Category.  The highest (or most favorable) percentile rank is 1 and the lowest (or least favorable) percentile rank is 100. The top-performing fund in a category will always receive a rank of 1. % Rank in Category is based on total returns which include reinvested dividends and capital gains, if any, and exclude sales charges.


Generally, data on Fidelity mutual funds is provided by FMR, LLC, Morningstar ratings and data on non-Fidelity mutual funds is provided by Morningstar, Inc. and data on non-mutual fund products is provided by the product's investment manager, trustee or issuer or the plan sponsor whose plan is offering the product to  participants.  Although Fidelity believes the data gathered from these third-party sources is reliable, it does not review such information and cannot warrant it to be accurate, complete or timely.  Fidelity is not responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this third-party information.

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a free prospectus and, if available, summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds and exchange-traded funds) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considere d a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding  consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.The Overall Morningstar Rat ing for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns,  60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most  weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. Star ratings do not reflect the effect of any applicable sales load.©2017 Morningstar. All  Rights Reserved.

Portfolio profile subject to change due to active management. Percentages may not total 100% due to rounding. Fund primarily invests in an affiliated investment company (Portfolio) with the same objective(s) and policies as the Fund and may also invest d irectly. References to investments are to the aggregate holdings of the Fund and the Portfolio.


About Risk: 
The Fund employs an "absolute return" investment approach, benchmarking itself to an index of cash instruments and seeking to achieve returns that are largely independent of broad movements in stocks and bonds. Investments in foreign instruments or curre ncies can involve greater risk and volatility than U.S. investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other conditions. In emerging or frontier countries, these risks may be more significant. An imbalance in supp ly and demand in the income market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. Investments in income securities may be affected by changes in the cr editworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of nonpayment of principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer's ability to make principal and interest payments. De rivative instruments can be used to take both long and short positions, be highly volatile, result in economic leverage (which can increase both the risk and return potential of the Fund), and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying inst rument on which the derivative is based, such as counterparty, correlation and liquidity risk. If a counterparty is unable to honor its commitments, the value of Fund shares may decline and/or the Fund could experience delays in the return of collateral  or other assets held by the counterparty. Because the Fund may invest significantly in a particular geographic region or country, value of Fund shares may fluctuate more than a fund with less exposure to such areas. As interest rates rise, the value of c ertain income investments is likely to decline. The value of commodities investments will generally be affected by overall market movements and factors specific to a particular industry or commodity, including weather, embargoes, tariffs, or health, poli tical, international and regulatory developments. Investments rated below investment grade (typically referred to as "junk") are generally subject to greater price volatility and illiquidity than higher-rated investments.
A nondiversified fund may be subject to greater risk by investing in a smaller number of investments than a diversified fund. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment pra ctices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.

References to investments are to the aggregate holdings of the Fund and the Portfolio.


About Risk: 
The Fund employs an "absolute return" investment approach, benchmarking itself to an index of cash instruments and seeking to achieve returns that are largely independent of broad movements in stocks and bonds. Investments in foreign instruments or curre ncies can involve greater risk and volatility than U.S. investments because of adverse market, economic, political, regulatory, geopolitical or other conditions. In emerging or frontier countries, these risks may be more significant. An imbalance in supp ly and demand in the income market may result in valuation uncertainties and greater volatility, less liquidity, widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency in the market. Investments in income securities may be affected by changes in the cr editworthiness of the issuer and are subject to the risk of nonpayment of principal and interest. The value of income securities also may decline because of real or perceived concerns about the issuer's ability to make principal and interest payments. De rivative instruments can be used to take both long and short positions, be highly volatile, result in economic leverage (which can increase both the risk and return potential of the Fund), and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying inst rument on which the derivative is based, such as counterparty, correlation and liquidity risk. If a counterparty is unable to honor its commitments, the value of Fund shares may decline and/or the Fund could experience delays in the return of collateral  or other assets held by the counterparty. Because the Fund may invest significantly in a particular geographic region or country, value of Fund shares may fluctuate more than a fund with less exposure to such areas. As interest rates rise, the value of c ertain income investments is likely to decline. The value of commodities investments will generally be affected by overall market movements and factors specific to a particular industry or commodity, including weather, embargoes, tariffs, or health, poli tical, international and regulatory developments. Investments rated below investment grade (typically referred to as "junk") are generally subject to greater price volatility and illiquidity than higher-rated investments.
A nondiversified fund may be subject to greater risk by investing in a smaller number of investments than a diversified fund. No fund is a complete investment program and you may lose money investing in a fund. The Fund may engage in other investment pra ctices that may involve additional risks and you should review the Fund prospectus for a complete description.

Ratings are based on Moody's, S&P or Fitch, as applicable. If securities are rated differently by the ratings agencies, the higher rating is applied. Ratings, which are subject to change, apply to the creditworthiness of the issuers of the underlying sec urities and not to the Fund or its shares. Credit ratings measure the quality of a bond based on the issuer's creditworthiness, with ratings ranging from AAA, being the highest, to D, being the lowest based on S&P's measures. Ratings of BBB or higher by  S&P or Fitch (Baa or higher by Moody's) are considered to be investment-grade quality. Credit ratings are based largely on the ratings agency's analysis at the time of rating. The rating assigned to any particular security is not necessarily a reflection  of the issuer's current financial condition and does not necessarily reflect its assessment of the volatility of a security's market value or of the liquidity of an investment in the security. Holdings designated as "Not Rated" are not rated by the nati onal ratings agencies stated above.

 Insights & Analysis  Commentary
A Word On The Markets as of  Mar 31, 2017
The financial markets posted widespread gains in the first quarter. Key themes driving the broad rally included optimism about Trump's pro-growth agenda, stronger European economic data and improving sentiment on emerging markets.
Surveys of U.S. consumer and business confidence surged to multi-year highs on expectations that the new administration's policies would accelerate GDP growth. However, measures of "hard" economic activity, such as retail sales and capital spending, had  yet to show similar strength. At its mid-March policy meeting, the Federal Reserve kept its 2017 growth forecast at 2.1% but raised interest rates 0.25% as its preferred inflation metric, the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, neared th e central bank's 2% target. On March 31, the government reported that the PCE climbed at an annual pace of 2.1% in February — the first time it had exceeded 2% in nearly five years.
Outside the U.S., the U.K. economy remained resilient following the June 2016 "Brexit" vote, with unemployment falling to its lowest level since 1975. Eurozone unemployment also continued to decline and manufacturing activity picked up across the region,  despite heightened political uncertainty. Emerging markets experienced robust investor inflows due to several factors, including attractive valuations and a weakening in the U.S. dollar.
In this environment, the global equity market registered a strong gain, led by emerging markets. Returns were also positive — albeit more modest — for local currency and U.S. dollar-denominated emerging market sovereign debt, and for U.S. cre dit. The Treasury yield curve flattened, as short rates rose and long rates dipped slightly. Falling oil prices contributed to a loss in the broad commodity market.


Performance Summary 
Eaton Vance Global Macro Absolute Return Fund and Eaton Vance Global Macro Absolute Return Advantage Fund outperformed their benchmark, the BofA Merrill Lynch 3 Month U.S. Treasury Bill Index (the Index),2 at net asset value during the quarter.

By risk factor, currency exposure was the top contributor to Fund performance, followed by rates and sovereign credit. Commodity investments also gained, led by a short in oil. The equity sleeve had minimal impact on Global Macro Absolute Return Fund but  was a slight detractor in Global Macro Absolute Return Advantage Fund. Corporate credit hurt performance for both Funds.
In terms of regions, Eastern Europe was the top contributor to Fund performance and Western Europe was the next-largest contributor. The favorable results in Eastern Europe were due to currency, sovereign credit and rates exposures, including long positi ons in the Russian ruble and Russian rates. Russia's economy has been recovering and inflation has fallen more quickly than expected, prompting the central bank to cut interest rates and signal more rate cuts in 2017. Long investments in Cypriot and Turk ish sovereign credit boosted returns in the region as well. In Western Europe, a strong gain from long exposure to the Icelandic krona versus the euro drove results in the region.
Latin America also positively impacted returns, helped by rates and sovereign credit exposures. Notable contributors included a long rates position in Colombia, where the central bank eased policy, and a long sovereign credit position in Brazil, where ec onomic improvement led a major ratings agency to raise its credit outlook on the country. The Dollar Bloc added a modest amount of value in Global Macro Absolute Return Advantage Fund; however, its performance was flat in Global Macro Absolute Return Fun d. Within the Dollar Bloc, a long in Australian rates was a plus, while a short in the Canadian dollar detracted.
Asia, as well as the Middle East and Africa region, dampened results. Although rates exposure was positive in Asia, the gain was overshadowed by currency investments, particularly a short in the Chinese yuan. Currency, rates and sovereign credit detracte d in the Middle East and Africa, including shorts in the Omani rial, Israeli rates and South African sovereign credit.

Contributors 
Factors contributing to the Fund's performance during the quarter:

At the individual position level, the long in the Icelandic krona versus the euro added significant value. Despite retreating in March, the krona strengthened against the euro over the full quarter amid a tourism boom in Iceland that is fueling strong ec onomic growth. Long investments in the Russian ruble and Turkish sovereign credit were also especially helpful. Other top contributors included long positions in the Colombian peso and Indonesian rupiah, which performed well amid broad U.S. dollar weakne ss. Following its rapid fourth-quarter rise, the dollar declined in response to concerns about how quickly Trump's pro-growth policies would be implemented given Congressional opposition.



Detractors 
Factors detracting from the Fund's performance during the quarter:

Consistent with U.S. dollar weakness, the list of detractors was dominated by short currency positions. Chief among these were shorts in the Chinese yuan, Omani rial, euro and Mexican peso.



Investment Outlook And Fund Positioning 
We expect a wide range of potential investment outcomes due to the change in U.S. political leadership. While markets appear to have priced in fiscal spending, lower taxes and less regulation, trade policy remains a key factor that will have a significan t impact on the global economy and the individual countries the team covers. Beyond the United States, China's capital account management and multiple European elections are likely to drive volatility in financial markets, and further consolidation in oi l markets may continue to stress those Middle East producers with inadequate fiscal capacity to absorb lower commodity prices. Against this backdrop, we have positioned the Funds to be more sensitive to country-level factors rather than broad macro facto rs as we expect country-level factors to be the main drivers of their performance going forward.
At quarter-end, both Funds' foreign currency positioning was net long. Long U.S. dollar and euro positions versus select emerging and frontier market currencies balance the risk.
Credit spread duration was slightly negative for both Funds. Long sovereign credit positions in Turkey, Cyprus and El Salvador were somewhat offset by short sovereign credit positions in South Africa and Qatar, in addition to short broad European corpora te credit exposure.
U.S. interest-rate duration and non-U.S. interest-rate duration were less than one year for Global Macro Absolute Return Fund and near one year for Global Macro Absolute Return Advantage Fund. A long position in New Zealand rates and a short in Saudi Ara bian rates were the larger duration contributors to overall interest-rate sensitivity.
