‹›



 From Greek statues to Roman baths, marble has been used for centuries in just about every possible interior and exterior application. Marble is generally thought to be from Italy, but in actuality it is quarried all over the world. The Romans carried marble home from far corners of their empire, giving marble its time honored cache. Marble is a unique natural stone created by limestone deposits. Re-crystallized through the action of heat and pressure, marble literally morphs into its unique patterns, colors, and swirls, with no two pieces ever identical.
Marble has become extremely popular in the United States in the last five years. Marble has the same general properties of limestone, only becomes more beautiful over time and use. Most marble has veining mineral deposits throughout. It is very popular for fireplaces, countertops, bar-tops, backsplash, flooring, and bathrooms, and comes in a wide range of colors.
We import all of our marble slabs directly from the quarries in Italy, Portugal and Spain. This allows us to offer our clients the finest quality marble with the best pricing in Palo Alto, San Jose, San Francisco, Atherton, Sunnyvale, Los Altos, Carmel, Monterey, and Pebble Beach. With its beautiful veining and patterns, marble always adds elegance to any kitchen. It also provides a lush backdrop for your perfect bathroom and is strong, durable, and easy to clean. Let Carmel Stone Imports selection of shades and styles of marble transform your home.

                Manager Monday: Marble Arch Investments            






 Faryan Amir-Ghassemi
Director of Analytics




 
                        Every Monday, Novus digs into the public holdings of a prominent hedge fund manager. This week, we take a look at Marble Arch Investments.                    





Marble Arch is a prime example of the wildly successful lineage of Julian Robertson’s Tiger Management. Its founder, Scott McLellan, worked at Hound Partners, whose founder, Jonathan Auerbach, worked at Tiger. This “family tree” of hedge funds has produced prolific and successful long/short equity managers, and Marble Arch Investments is no exception. What is particularly interesting to study is the “family resemblance” in investment style and underlying holdings for these managers.
About our Data
Everything mentioned in this post is sourced exclusively from public data, including the manager’s profile, simulated performance and all other analysis and commentary. The data used here omits the short side, non-equity securities, many non-US securities and all non-public information such as actual fund performance.
Marble Arch Investments and Hound Partners
While we’ve talked extensively about the similarity in portfolio structure between Tiger lineage managers, many have noted the tremendous overlap between Hound and its sibling, Marble Arch. As of the most recent 13-F filings, 60% of Marble Arch’s portfolio is owned by Hound. While that sounds a lot, prior quarters have been nearly 70%!

Both managers take meaty positions in names such as Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Fleetcor Technologies, and Spirit Aerosystems. These are, of course, Tiger lineage favorites as most of these names hold in excess of 10 participants through our capture of all Tiger “family members.” Before you prematurely conclude that overlap is a bad thing, our data shows that Tiger Cub consensus names greatly outperform and the same can’t be said about all unique stocks. Most of these are world class managers and the securities they invest in have compounded at exceptional rates, so perhaps they are on to something.
Recent Marble Arch Outperformance
Marble Arch’s simulated long portfolio performance has been outpacing the S&P 500 by about 450bps per year, since our first public data capture in Jan 2008. A large amount of the portfolio’s outperformance began after the US debt ceiling crisis in the 3rd quarter of 2011:

Structural Changes
If we look at their portfolio since then, a few things become apparent in terms of structural changes:

The portfolio has reduced the number of long positions from a peak of 26 (07/31/13) to 15 as of the most recent filing
As a corollary, portfolio concentration has risen dramatically, constituting a 50% relative increase in terms of top 5 / top 10 position concentration


This has led to a greater allocation of larger positions in the portfolio, as positions greater than 10% of reported assets have gone from non-existent to nearly 50% of the book. In the last 30 months, that largest position size bucket has annualized at an astounding 40.5%, which shows why the move to a more concentrated portfolio explains the widening outperformance:


We can truly isolate position sizing value add by comparing an equal weighted portfolio to their actual return profile. This allows us to measure how additive the escalation in concentration has been for Marble Arch’s portfolio. We estimate, it has added nearly 3000 bps of outperformance since September 2011:

Finally, if we simply sort the names with the highest average weighting during this period, we can see a strong relationship between sizing and outsized return on invested capital. In fact, there has only been one notable miss (Applied Materials) amongst overweight positions.

This phenomenon is punctuated by the firm’s positioning in Valeant, which has been a huge driver of outperformance, delivering over 4000bps of simulated contribution:

With these trends, we can see the manager engaging in a higher octane investment style, with a clear escalation in the median P/E of the portfolio, as well as a widening negative beta to value:


Conclusion
Marble Arch’s reported long positions have had an extended period of outperformance, beginning in late 2011. This has coincided with a strong move towards increased concentration and is dominated by a growth-factor tilt. The manager continues to outperform the market, and has demonstrated adaptability in the past. The question is whether or not this trend of amplified concentration and growth bias will persist if the market begins to change in tenor.


Three Managers. Three Styles.
An analysis of three different hedge fund strategies and how they generate alpha.

What makes a successful hedge fund manager? We believe that studying performance alone does not adequately answer the question. By looking at thousands of active manager portfolios, we peek under the hood of managers’ investment process and recognize patterns that lead managers to consistent outperformance. These patterns can be viewed as investment skill, or managers’ ability to generate alpha through certain repeatable methods.
In this article we use public ownership data and the Novus Alpha platform to evaluate three very distinct money managers. The three case studies aim to identify the driver of these managers’ success: investment skill.

 From Greek statues to Roman baths, marble has been used for centuries in just about every possible interior and exterior application. Marble is generally thought to be from Italy, but in actuality it is quarried all over the world. The Romans carried marble home from far corners of their empire, giving marble its time honored cache. Marble is a unique natural stone created by limestone deposits. Re-crystallized through the action of heat and pressure, marble literally morphs into its unique patterns, colors, and swirls, with no two pieces ever identical.
Marble has become extremely popular in the United States in the last five years. Marble has the same general properties of limestone, only becomes more beautiful over time and use. Most marble has veining mineral deposits throughout. It is very popular for fireplaces, countertops, bar-tops, backsplash, flooring, and bathrooms, and comes in a wide range of colors.
We import all of our marble slabs directly from the quarries in Italy, Portugal and Spain. This allows us to offer our clients the finest quality marble with the best pricing in Palo Alto, San Jose, San Francisco, Atherton, Sunnyvale, Los Altos, Carmel, Monterey, and Pebble Beach. With its beautiful veining and patterns, marble always adds elegance to any kitchen. It also provides a lush backdrop for your perfect bathroom and is strong, durable, and easy to clean. Let Carmel Stone Imports selection of shades and styles of marble transform your home.

KATIE HYER




Senior Marketing Manager Of Heartland

I have had several occasions where presentations were needed as quickly as the same day and they were accommodating without sacrificing quality. In the dozens of times I have worked with SlideGenius, they have never missed a deadline."









RYAN JONES




Sales Vice President of Mogl




"I have used SlideGenius for various projects. The first was a sales presentation deck in 2012. The project was completed on time and within budget. While I was very happy with the end result of the first project, the real litmus test was with the sales team, who loved it. The presentation had become not just a PowerPoint, but almost like a short animation, which allowed our sales team to 'tell a story' - sales increased by over 18% in the 3 months proceeding the new deck."

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
