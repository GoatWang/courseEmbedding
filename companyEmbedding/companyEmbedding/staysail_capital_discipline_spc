Defining a primary task-What is the firm in the business of doing?2. Assessing core competencies-What does the firm do better than anyone else?3. Determining order winners and order qualifiers-What qualifies an item to be considered for purchase?-What wins the order?4. Positioning the firm-How will the firm compete?5. Deploying the strategyStrategyHow the mission of a company is accomplished (provides direction for achieving a mission).Primary TaskRepresents the purpose of a firm- what the firm is in the business of doing.Core competenciesWhat the firm does better than anyone elseOrder qualifiers & order winnersorder qualifiers: what qualifies an item to be considered for purchase.order winner: What wins the order.Positioning the FirmInvolves making choices- choosing one or two important things on which to concentrate and doing them extremely well (how the firm chooses to compete).-Cost -Speed-Quality-FlexibilityPositioning the Firm: Cost1.

Performance: basic operating characteristics of a product; how well a car handles or its gas mileage2. Features : "extra" items added to basic features, such as a stereo CD or a leather interior in a car3. Reliability: probability that a product will operate properly within an expected time frame; that is, a TV will work without repair for about seven yearsConformance, durability, and serviceability4.

Edwards Deming -Developed courses during WW II to teach statistical quality-control techniques to engineers and executives of military suppliers-After war, began teaching statistical quality control to Japanese companiesJoseph M. Juran-Followed Deming to Japan in 1954, and Focused on strategic quality planning -Quality improvement achieved by focusing on projects to solve problems and securing breakthrough solutionsArmand V. Feigenbaum-In 1951, introduced concepts of total quality control and continuous quality improvementPhilip Crosby -In 1979, emphasized that costs of poor quality far outweigh cost of preventing poor quality-In 1984, defined absolutes of quality management—conformance to requirements, prevention, and "zero defects"Kaoru Ishikawa-Promoted use of quality circles, Developed "fishbone" diagram, and Emphasized importance of internal customerDeming's 14 points1. Create constancy of purpose2. Adopt philosophy of prevention3. Cease mass inspection4. Select a few suppliers based on quality5. Constantly improve system and workers6. Institute worker training7. Instill leadership among supervisors8. Eliminate fear among employees9. Eliminate barriers between departments10. Eliminate slogans11. Eliminate numerical quotas12. Enhance worker pride13. Institute vigorous training and education programs14. Develop a commitment from top management to implement above 13 pointsDeming Wheel: PDCA Cycle1. Plan: Study process, identify the problem, set goals, and develop the plan for improvement.2. Do: Implement the plan on a test basis, measure improvement.3. Study/Check: Assess the plan; is it working? Goals achieved?4. Act: Institutionalize improvement; continue the cycle with new problems at stage 1.Quality Tools-the seven well known tools for identifying quality problems and their causes are sometimes called the "magnificent seven".1.

Process layouts-group similar activities together according to process or function they perform2. Product layouts-arrange activities in line according to sequence of operations for a particular product or service3. Fixed-position layouts-are used for projects in which product cannot be movedFixed-Position Layouts-Typical of projects -Fragile, bulky, heavy items-Equipment, workers & materials brought to site-Low equipment utilization-Highly skilled labor-Typically low fixed cost-Often high variable costsDesigning Process LayoutsGoal: minimize material handling costsBlock Diagramming:-minimize nonadjacent loads -use when quantitative data is availableRelationship Diagramming:-based on location preference between areas-use when quantitative data is not availableBlock Diagramming1. Unit load-quantity in which material is normally moved2. Nonadjacent load-distance farther than the next block3. Steps-create load summary chart-calculate composite (two way) movements-develop trial layouts minimizing number of nonadjacent loadsComputerized Layout Solutions1. CRAFT-Computerized Relative Allocation of Facilities Technique2. CORELAP-Computerized Relationship Layout Planning3. PROMODEL and EXTEND-visual feedback-allow user to quickly test a variety of scenarios4. Three-D modeling and CAD -integrated layout analysis-available in VisFactory and similar softwareDesigning Service Layouts1. Must be both attractive and functional2. Free flow layouts-encourage browsing, increase impulse purchasing, are flexible and visually appealing3. Grid layouts-encourage customer familiarity, are low cost, easy to clean and secure, and good for repeat customers4. Loop and Spine layouts-both increase customer sightlines and exposure to products, while encouraging customer to circulate through the entire storeDesigning Product Layouts1. Objective-Balance the assembly line2. Line balancing-tries to equalize the amount of work at each workstation3. Precedence requirements-physical restrictions on the order in which operations are performed4. Cycle time-maximum amount of time a product is allowed to spend at each workstationLine Balancing Procedure1. Draw and label a precedence diagram2. Calculate desired cycle time required for line3. Calculate theoretical minimum number of workstations4. Group elements into workstations, recognizing cycle time and precedence constraints5. Calculate efficiency of line6. Determine if theoretical minimum number of workstations or an acceptable efficiency level has been reached. If not, go back to step 4.Computerized Line BalancingUse heuristics to assign tasks to workstations...-Longest operation time-Shortest operation time-Most number of following tasks-Least number of following tasks-Ranked positional weightHybrid Layouts1. Cellular layouts-group dissimilar machines into work centers (called cells) that process families of parts with similar shapes or processing requirements2. Production flow analysis (PFA)-reorders part routing matrices to identify families of parts with similar processing requirements3.
