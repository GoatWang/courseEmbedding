 William F. Andrews 
            Date of birth: September 13, 1958Home of record: Waterloo New YorkStatus: POW 
            Bill Andrews Graduated from the U.S. Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs, Colorado, Class of 1980. Captured in this action on February 27, 1991, he was released from captivity on March 4. He was one of TWO airmen to receive the Air Force Cross during Operation DESERT STORM, the second award going to Captain Paul T. Johnson. 

AWARDS AND CITATIONS





See more recipients of this award
Awarded for actions during the Gulf War 
The President of the United States of America, authorized by Title 10, Section 8742, United States Code, takes pleasure in presenting the Air Force Cross to Captain William F. Andrews, United States Air Force, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against the armed forces of the Republic of Iraq, while serving as a Pilot with the 10th Tactical Fighter Squadron, Hahn Air Base, Germany, in action approximately 30 miles northwest of Basra, Iraq, on 27 February 1991, during Operation DESERT STORM. On that date, while leading an F-16 flight against heavily defended armor and mechanized forces, Captain Andrews' F-16 suffered major damage from enemy air defenses forcing him to eject in enemy territory. While in the parachute descent, he made contact with his flight using his survival radio and, despite being fired upon by enemy forces while in the parachute descent, provided an area description and direction to his flight. After landing, at which point he broke his leg, Captain Andrews made numerous threat calls and directed members of his flight to execute a break turn and to initiate decoy flares in response to surface-to-air missile launches. Shortly thereafter, he was in radio contact with NAIL 51, an OA-10 in the area, and twice directed the pilot to break and expend decoy flares when he saw missile launches. In both cases, the pilots indicated that they would have suffered direct hits from enemy infrared seeking missiles had Captain Andrews not made the threat calls from the ground. Captain Andrews provided the support despite the fact that he had just suffered a broken leg and could not move, was exposed in the open, and was being fired upon by enemy forces. Through his extraordinary heroism, superb airmanship, and aggressiveness in the face of the enemy, Captain Andrews reflected the highest credit upon himself and the United States Air Force.

Legion of Merit

Awarded for actions during the Global War on Terror 
The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, 20 July 1942, takes pleasure in presenting the Legion of Merit to Colonel William F. Andrews, United States Air Force, for exceptionally meritorious conduct in the performance of outstanding services to the Government of the United States as Commander, 366th Operations Group, 366th Wing, Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, from 10 August 2000 to 16 August 2002. During this period, Colonel Andrews decisively led Air Combat Command's largest and most diverse operations group that delivered devastating combat air power across the entire spectrum of modern day combat. He oversaw the flawless closeout of the third largest annual Flying Hour Program in Air Combat Command, zeroing 21,750 hours under a 128 million dollar cost cap. During his command, he led the lightening-fast response to Operations NOBLE EAGLE and ENDURING FREEDOM. For Operation NOBLE EAGLE, his air control squadron provided twenty-four-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week radar coverage for the western United States for 170 consecutive days. His F-15C fighters flew 532 hours of combat air patrols supporting the Vice President of the United States and the 2002 Olympics held in Salt Lake City, Utah. In Operation ENDURING FREEDOM, he trained and deployed the B-1B, F-15E, and F-16CJ squadrons that delivered over 7.6 million pounds of munitions against targets in Afghanistan. The superior initiative, outstanding leadership, and personal endeavor displayed by Colonel Andrews reflect great credit upon himself and the United States Air Force.

Distinguished Flying Cross

Awarded for actions during the Gulf War 
The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 2, 1926, takes pleasure in presenting the Distinguished Flying Cross with Combat "V" to Captain William F. Andrews, United States Air Force, for heroism while participating in aerial flight during military operations against the armed forces of the Republic of Iraq, Baghdad, on 23 January 1991. On that date, while acting as the package commander of a composite force strike package targeted against the Fallujah SCUD surface-to-surface assembly missile plant and Habbaniyah Military Product Facility located 25 nautical miles southwest of Baghdad, Captain Andrews successfully coordinated and directed the package attack and employed his F-16 to destroy or heavily damage elements of this vital military industrial complex. With complete disregard for his personal safety, Captain Andrews attacked his assigned target which was defended by heavy anti-aircraft artillery fire as well as surface-to-air missiles. During the target area ingress no less than six surface-to-air missiles were launched at the strike package. This courageous attack reduced Iraq's capability to produce and launch SCUT surface-to-air missiles toward Israel and Saudi Arabia. The outstanding heroism and selfless devotion to duty displayed by Captain Andrews reflect great credit upon himself and the United States Air Force.

Awarded for actions during the Gulf War 
The President of the United States of America, authorized by Act of Congress, July 2, 1926, takes pleasure in presenting a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster in lieu of a Second Award of the Distinguished Flying Cross with Combat "V" to Captain William F. Andrews, United States Air Force, for heroism while participating in aerial flight during military operations against the armed forces of the Republic of Iraq, on 24 February 1991. On that date, while leading an F-16 flight that was diverted over 100 nautical miles to an emergency close air support mission, Captain Andrews successfully directed his flight and employed his F-16 to support a United States Army Special Forces team that had been detected while operating deep into enemy territory. With complete disregard for his own personal safety, Captain Andrews attacked the enemy force that had encircled the Special Forces Team despite heavy anti-aircraft fire. The mission was complicated by very low sun angles just prior to sunset and poor visibility from smoke and dust that made target and friendly identification very difficult. Despite these problems, Captain Andrews delivered his cluster bomb ordnance within 200 meters of the friendly position while coordinating with the Special Forces Team on the UHF emergency "GUARD" frequency. As a direct result of his action, the enemy force withdrew and the Special Forces Team was successfully extracted without casualties. The outstanding heroism and selfless devotion to duty displayed by Captain Andrews reflect credit upon himself and the United States Air Force.

John Ward has taken on the burden of searching for his brother George, who has made no contact with his family for many months. Not knowing whether George is dead or alive and little to go on, John gains employment on the Motor Vessel Hope Mount, and sets forth into a world he has never known.

On this journey, John demonstrates strength of mind and determination that earns him the respect of his superiors and all that know him. It is these traits that would later see him through one of the most turbulent periods of all time: World War II.

This story has been written as a reminder of the vast sacrifice made by the Merchant Navy and the crucial, yet largely forgotten, role they played.

"Writing Wrongs of WWII History" Righting a decades-old wrong has seen 85-year-old Bill Andrews put pen to paper to write a book. It is the story of Australia's Merchant Navy, the long unheralded, so-called "fourth branch of the armed forces without whom the Allied war effort would never have succeeded. Consisting of hundreds of civil ships and their crews enlisted into active service, the Merchant Navy lost more men than any other service, and Andrews; book is a tribute to the many mates who died in World War II. "Not one of their names is on the Cenotaph in Canberra, and my book Under the Southern Cross, is to ensure their legacy lives on forever," Andrews said. "If it hadn't been for the Merchant Navy, the war would never have been won". They carried the troops and all their equipment and armament but, classifield as civillans, they were never considered part of the armed forces, and untill last year, had not been recognised. "They were on... More > the ships laden with tanks and trucks and other heavy equipment, and when they were fired upon, would sink like a stone to the freezing bottom of the waters of the North Atlantic. "No sailor could survive long in thoses conditions." The great-grandfather took six long years to pen a part-fictional, part historic action packed adventure about a seaman who sets off in serch of his missing brother. The British-born battler said he grew up believing the Allied Merchant Navies and the Allied Navies were a brotherhood and should be held in the same regard. Andrews moved to Melbourne, where he spent years on the tugs, at Western-Port Bay in Victoria Australia. Working within the Maritime Union. Andrews,working with Ron Steve Wiley of Sydney, lobbied hard for decades for overdue recognition of 3rd September Merchant Navy Day. Andrews wrote to Kevin Rudd, when he was then Oppposition Leader, and Mr Rudd promised to help address the issue. "It had been more than 60 years since the end of WWII and still the Merchant Navy was ignored." But, true to his word, one of Mr Rudd's first acts soon after becoming Prime Minister was to declare 3rd September Merchant Navy day. 63 years after WWII. Remember "If it hadn't been for the Merchant Navy, the war would never have been won' Bill Andrews Author, Veteran of WWII MN.< Less

                                Remember our Merchant Navy of WW2, crewed by men from all over the world, many of whom died, not even recorded, because they were Lascars or some other nationality. The Merchant Navy was part and parcel of a floating fleet which, along with the men and ships of our Royal Navy, kept us free and fed throughout the longest battle in history, the Battle of the Atlantic 1939 - 1945. The Merchant Navy was not recognised as such simply because they were civilians. But these were civilians in the front line! Why were they not recognised for so long? When a civilian sailor had his ship blown up beneath him, and he was lucky enough to survive and be rescued, he would land on shore to find that his pay had been stopped from the moment he lost his ship! He would not get another penny until he signed on board another. Many of these surviving seamen would be rescued, only to be torpedoed again and find themselves back in the water, rescued again, and blown up again!! And no pay! Criminal!
