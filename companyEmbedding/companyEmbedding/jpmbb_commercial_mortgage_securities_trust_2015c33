Fitch to Rate JPMBB 2015-C33 Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust; Presale Issued | Business Wire


























































      Fitch to Rate JPMBB 2015-C33 Commercial Mortgage Securities Trust; 
      Presale Issued
    





November 09, 2015 01:21 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings has issued a presale report on JPMBB Commercial Mortgage 
      Securities Trust 2015-C33 commercial mortgage pass-through certificates.
    

      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Rating Outlooks as 
      follows:
    

      --$28,723,000 class A-1 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$44,092,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$135,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$286,963,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$38,471,000 class A-SB 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$40,946,000 class A-S 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$574,195,000ab class X-A 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$35,232,000 class B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$35,232,000ab class X-B 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$41,899,000 class C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$41,899,000ab class X-C 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$43,802,000a class D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$43,802,000ab class X-D 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$19,997,000a class E 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$8,570,000a class F 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      (a) Privately placed and pursuant to Rule 144A.
    

      (b) Notional amount and interest-only.
    

      The expected ratings are based on information provided by the issuer as 
      of Nov. 5, 2015. Fitch does not expect to rate the $15,236,000 class G 
      certificates and the $22,853,212 class NR certificates.
    

      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership interest in the 
      trust, primary assets of which are 64 loans secured by 89 commercial 
      properties having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $761.8 
      million as of the cut-off date. The loans were contributed to the trust 
      by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Barclays Bank plc, Ladder Capital Finance 
      LLC, and Redwood Commercial Mortgage Corporation.
    

      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 74.9% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis of 80.6%, and asset summary reviews on 80.6% of the pool.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Fitch Leverage: The transaction has higher leverage than other recent 
      Fitch-rated fixed-rate multiborrower transactions. The pool's Fitch debt 
      service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 1.14x is lower than both the YTD 2015 
      average of 1.19x and the 2014 average of 1.19x, and the pool's Fitch 
      loan-to-value (LTV) of 112.0% is higher than both the YTD 2015 average 
      of 109.6% and the 2014 average of 106.2%.
    

      Pool Concentration: The largest loan in the pool, 32 Avenue of the 
      Americas, represents 16.4% of the pool's balance, among the largest 
      single-loan concentrations in CMBS 2.0. However, the largest 10 loans 
      account for 48.8% of the total pool, which is in line with the YTD 2015 
      average of 48.1% and the 2014 average of 50.5%. This results in a loan 
      concentration index (LCI) of 473, which is higher than the YTD 2015 and 
      2014 averages of 349 and 331, respectively. Four loans in the top 20, 
      representing 14.2% of the pool balance, have the same sponsor. The 
      pool's sponsor concentration index (SCI) of 685 is higher than the YTD 
      2015 and 2015 averages of 384 and 419, respectively.
    

      Property Type Concentration: The pool's largest property type is 
      multifamily at 36.1%, followed by hotel at 19.7% and office at 18.9%. 
      Multifamily and hotel concentrations are above the YTD 2015 averages for 
      other Fitch-rated fixed-rate multiborrower transactions of 16.7% and 
      16.6%, respectively.
    

      Below-Average Amortization: Sixteen loans representing 41.6% of the pool 
      are interest-only, which is higher than the YTD 2015 average of 20% for 
      other Fitch-rated fixed-rate multiborrower transactions. There are nine 
      loans representing 18.1% of the pool that are partial interest-only. 
      Based on the scheduled balance at maturity, the pool is expected to pay 
      down by 9.0%, which is less than the YTD 2015 average of 12.4%.
    

      Dispersion of Property Quality: Five loans in the pool (26.4% by 
      balance) are secured by properties that received property quality grades 
      of 'B+' or better, including four of the largest 20 loans (25.0% of the 
      pool), while five loans representing 4.8% of the pool are secured by 
      properties that received Fitch property quality grades of 'C+' or lower, 
      including two of the top 20 loans (3.8% of the pool). The pool's overall 
      property quality was considered to be in line with recent transactions.
    

      Low Mortgage Coupons: The pool's weighted average mortgage coupon is 
      4.63%, below historical averages. Fitch accounted for increased 
      refinance risk in a higher interest rate environment by analyzing 
      sensitivity to increased interest rates.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 11.7% below the 
      most recent net operating income (NOI; for properties for which a recent 
      NOI was provided, excluding properties that were stabilizing during this 
      period). Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could 
      result in higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans, and 
      could result in potential rating actions on the certificates.
    

      Fitch evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to JPMBB 
      2015-C33 certificates and found that the transaction displays average 
      sensitivity to further declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF 
      declined a further 20% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the senior 
      'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB+sf' could result. In a more severe 
      scenario, in which NCF declined a further 30% from Fitch's NCF, a 
      downgrade of the senior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'BBB-sf' could result. 
      The presale report includes a detailed explanation of additional 
      stresses and sensitivities on pages 10-11.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with due diligence information from Ernst & Young 
      LLP. The due diligence focused on a comparison and re-computation of 
      certain characteristics with respect to each of the 64 mortgage loans. 
      Fitch considered this information in its analysis and the findings did 
      not have an impact on our analysis.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

This week, the National Retail Federation announced that back-to-school spending is expected to be down 9.3% in 2015. This news came on the heels of a report from the Commerce Department stating that retail sales declined 0.3%... 
US REITs Feeling Effects from Turmoil in Greece and ChinaInternational economic forces have taken center stage this week, affecting both US stock markets and REITs.

What Does Increased Construction Mean for Apartment REITs?REITs so far this year have raised $17.1 billion of capital through the sale of unsecured notes, bringing the total raised over the past two and a half years to just more than $75 billion.

A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this press release.KEY RATING DRIVERSThe affirmations are the result of overall stable pool performance, which reflects no material changes to pool metrics since issuance; therefore, the original rating analysis was considered in affirming the transaction. As of the October 2016 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been reduced by 0.6% to $757.5 million from $761.8 million at issuance. The pool has experienced no realized losses to date, and there have been no specially serviced loans since issuance. No loans are defeased. The Fitch debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) and loan to value (LTV) at issuance were 1.14x and 112.0%, respectively.Stable Performance with No Material Changes: All loans in the pool are current as of the October 2016 distribution with property level performance in line with issuance expectations and no material changes to pool metrics.Loan of Concern: Fitch has designated one loan (0.7% of the pool) as a Fitch Loan of Concern. The loan, which is secured by a 15,356 square foot unanchored retail center in Mansfield, MA, has been on the master servicer's watchlist since September 2016. The servicer is advancing on real estate tax payments for the loan.Pool Concentration: The largest loan in the pool, 32 Avenue of the Americas, represents 16.5% of the pool's balance, and is among the largest single loan concentrations in CMBS 2.0. However, the largest 10 loans account for 48.9% of the pool, which is in line with the year-to-date (YTD) November 2015 average of 48.1% and the 2014 average of 50.5%. It was also noted at issuance that the loan concentration index (LCI) and sponsor concentration index (SCI) were higher than average for this transaction.Property Type Concentration: The pool's largest property type is multifamily at 36.1%, followed by hotel at 19.5% and office at 19%. Multifamily and hotel concentrations are above the YTD November 2015 averages for other Fitch-rated fixed-rate multiborrower transactions of 16.7% and 16.6%, respectively.Below-Average Amortization: The pool is scheduled to amortize by 9% of the initial pool balance prior to maturity. Sixteen loans (41.9% of the pool) are interest-only for the full term. As of October 2016, all of the nine loans (18.2%) structured with a partial interest-only component at issuance have yet to convert to principal and interest payments.RATING SENSITIVITIESThe Rating Outlooks on all classes remain Stable. Fitch does not foresee positive or negative ratings migration until a material economic or asset-level event changes the transaction's overall portfolio-level metrics.USE OF THIRD-PARTY DUE DILIGENCE PURSUANT TO SEC RULE 17G-10No third-party due diligence was provided or reviewed in relation to this rating action.Fitch has affirmed the following classes:--$24.4 million class A-1 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$44.1 million class A-2 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$135 million class A-3 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$287 million class A-4 at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$38.5 million class A-SB at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$40.9 million class A-S at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$574.2 million class X-A* at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;--$35.2 million class B at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$35.2 million class X-B* at 'AA-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$41.9 million class C at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$41.9 million class X-C* at 'A-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$23.8 million class D-1** at 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;--$20 million class D-2** at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$43.8 million class D** at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$43.8 million class X-D* at 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$20 million class E at 'BB-sf'; Outlook Stable;--$8.6 million class F at 'B-sf'; Outlook Stable.*Notional amount and interest-only.**Class D-1 and D-2 certificates may be exchanged for class D certificates, and class D certificates may be exchanged for class D-1 and D-2 certificates.

In issuing and maintaining its ratings and in making other reports (including forecast information), Fitch relies on factual information it receives from issuers and underwriters and from other sources Fitch believes to be credible. Fitch conducts a reasonable investigation of the factual information relied upon by it in accordance with its ratings methodology, and obtains reasonable verification of that information from independent sources, to the extent such sources are available for a given security or in a given jurisdiction. The manner of Fitch's factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors. Users of Fitch's ratings and reports should understand that neither an enhanced factual investigation nor any third-party verification can ensure that all of the information Fitch relies on in connection with a rating or a report will be accurate and complete. Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts. As a result, despite any verification of current facts, ratings and forecasts can be affected by future events or conditions that were not anticipated at the time a rating or forecast was issued or affirmed.The information in this report is provided "as is" without any representation or warranty of any kind, and Fitch does not represent or warrant that the report or any of its contents will meet any of the requirements of a recipient of the report. A Fitch rating is an opinion as to the creditworthiness of a security. This opinion and reports made by Fitch are based on established criteria and methodologies that Fitch is continuously evaluating and updating. Therefore, ratings and reports are the collective work product of Fitch and no individual, or group of individuals, is solely responsible for a rating or a report. The rating does not address the risk of loss due to risks other than credit risk, unless such risk is specifically mentioned. Fitch is not engaged in the offer or sale of any security. All Fitch reports have shared authorship. Individuals identified in a Fitch report were involved in, but are not solely responsible for, the opinions stated therein. The individuals are named for contact purposes only. A report providing a Fitch rating is neither a prospectus nor a substitute for the information assembled, verified and presented to investors by the issuer and its agents in connection with the sale of the securities. Ratings may be changed or withdrawn at any time for any reason in the sole discretion of Fitch. Fitch does not provide investment advice of any sort. Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security. Ratings do not comment on the adequacy of market price, the suitability of any security for a particular investor, or the tax-exempt nature or taxability of payments made in respect to any security. Fitch receives fees from issuers, insurers, guarantors, other obligors, and underwriters for rating securities. Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent). The assignment, publication, or dissemination of a rating by Fitch shall not constitute a consent by Fitch to use its name as an expert in connection with any registration statement filed under the United States securities laws, the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 of the United Kingdom, or the securities laws of any particular jurisdiction. Due to the relative efficiency of electronic publishing and distribution, Fitch research may be available to electronic subscribers up to three days earlier than to print subscribers.For Australia, New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea only: Fitch Australia Pty Ltd holds an Australian financial services license (AFS license no. 337123) which authorizes it to provide credit ratings to wholesale clients only.
