SeaWell Networks Inc. secures $5 million in Series B investment




01 Feb 2012




facebookgoogletwitterlinkedin 




Toronto, February 1, 2012 – MaRS client SeaWell Networks Inc., a leader in multi platform video delivery software for network operators, announced that it has secured $5 million in Series B investment. Led by Northwater Intellectual Property Fund LP 2, with participation by BDC Venture Capital, the funding round will be used to support ongoing trials with customers, expand sales and distribution, and continue to augment the development of the company’s core product offering, Spectrum.
“SeaWell’s experienced team is well on their way to changing the video delivery industry,” said Krista Jones, Practice Lead in MaRS’ Information Technology, Communications and Entertainment (ICE) practice. “This financing round is demonstrative of the support for the team and their vision.”
Network operators have been scrambling to keep pace with the increasing demand for TV Everywhere products—subscriber video services that are capable of delivering online streaming video to multiple screens. Spectrum’s solution provides a superior user experience by enabling the delivery of adaptive bit rate (ABR) streams to multiple devices, while giving network operators unprecedented network and session control.
In addition, Spectrum provides new ways for network operators to monetize content, allowing them to dynamically insert unique ads into ABR streams based on the viewer’s session information and subscriber profile parameters, including device type and ZIP code.
“This is an important step for SeaWell and demonstrates continued support from our founding partners,” said Brian Collie, co-founder and CEO of SeaWell Networks. “As the industry continues to take huge strides toward broadband video, our vision of putting intelligence into the network comes into focus.”

PRESS RELEASE
SeaWell Networks Inc., a leader in multi-platform video delivery software for network operators, announced today that it has secured $5 million in Series B investment. The round is led by Northwater Intellectual Property Fund LP 2 and included participation by BDC Venture Capital. The additional funding will be used to support ongoing trials with lead customers, and to expand SeaWell’s sales and distribution capability while continuing to augment the development of the company’s core product offering, Spectrum.
The overwhelming demand for online streaming video has posed one of the greatest challenges for network operators. Spectrum’s solution provides a superior user experience by enabling the delivery of adaptive bit rate (ABR) streams to multiple devices, while giving network operators unprecedented network and session control. In addition, Spectrum provides new ways for network operators to monetize content, allowing them to dynamically insert unique ads into ABR streams based on the viewer’s session information and subscriber profile parameters, including device type and zip code. 





Colin Dixon of TDG Research noted that “the reality of subscriber video services today is that they must deliver to multiple screens. This fact will lead to an explosion of activity from network operators as they develop and deploy TV Everywhere products. With a solid management team and market-tested adaptive streaming products, SeaWell is well positioned to help them do it.”
“This is an important step for SeaWell and demonstrates continued support from our founding partners,” said Brian Collie, co-founder and CEO of SeaWell Networks. “As the industry continues to take huge strides toward broadband video, our vision of putting intelligence into the network comes into focus.”
About SeaWell Networks
SeaWell Networks Inc. provides software for service providers to manage and optimize the delivery of HTTP adaptive bit rate (ABR) streaming video to any device or platform. Our intelligent ABR management solution, Spectrum, simplifies the delivery of video while enabling new ways to monetize content. Spectrum combines ad insertion capabilities and on-the-fly repackaging for the most personalized video experience available.
