Zimmer Biomet Rides on Spine Business, Knee Challenges Stay


June 08, 2017, 09:19:00 AM EDT
By Zacks Equity Research, Zacks.com

 On Jun 6, we issued an updated research report on Warsaw, IN-based Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc. ZBH  . It is a leading musculoskeletal healthcare company that designs and distributes orthopedic reconstructive products, spine, bone healing, thoracic products; dental implants, and related surgical products. Over the last three months, Zimmer Biomet was trading below the Zacks categorized Medical Product  industry on factors like macroeconomic uncertainties, pricing pressure and unfavorable currency fluctuations. Despite a better-than-expected first-quarter 2017, the company's stock price further traded down, lowering its 2017 guidance. Per Zimmer Biomet, a lower-than-expected manufacturing output of certain legacy brands during first quarter has possibly led to declining product availability in second quarter. This in turn forced the company to reduce its full-year guidance. Besides, the still sluggish knee business on continued pricing pressure added to the woes. The stock till now has gained 5.7%, lower than the 7.4% gain of the broader industry.    Estimate revision trend for full-year 2016 also remains unfavorable with 15 estimates moving south with no revision in the opposite direction over past couple of months. Earnings estimates have also moved down by 7 cents over this period to $8.54 per share. On a positive note, we look forward to the expected synergy from the recently completed LDR Holding acquisition, which should broaden and complement the company's musculoskeletal offering. This is in line with the strategy to grow through inorganic means by focusing on mega acquisitions. Management is also striving to develop spine portfolio in order to cash in on the opportunities. Reportedly in the first quarter, Zimmer Biomet saw a 32.1% improvement in Spine and CMF segment. The company's spine offerings such as Mobi-C Cervical Disc prosthesis and Vitality Spinal Fixation System showed a considerable progress in performance. Zimmer Biomet has been of late working to strengthen its foothold in the emerging markets that provide long-term opportunities. The company's strategic investments in these regions over several quarters with a view to enhance operational and sales performance are yielding results. With winding up of Biomet's integration, the combined company has started to benefit from a strong presence in the emerging markets with an extended portfolio of both upper and lower joints.  Zacks Rank & Key Picks  Zimmer Biomet currently carries Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Few better-ranked medical stocks are Align Technology, Inc. ALGN  , Inogen, Inc. INGN  and Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc. AXDX  . Align Technology and Inogen sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Accelerate Diagnostics carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see   the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks   here.   Align Technology has an expected long-term adjusted earnings growth of almost 22.8%. The stock roughly added 44.1% over the last three months. Inogen has a long-term expected earnings growth rate of 17.5%. The stock has a solid one-year return of around 79.9%. Accelerate Diagnostics has an expected long-term adjusted earnings growth rate of 30%. The stock has added roughly 13.1% over last three months.  3 Top Picks to Ride the Hottest Tech Trend  Zacks just released a Special Report to guide you through a space that has already begun to transform our entire economy... Last year, it was generating $8 billion in global revenues. By 2020, it's predicted to blast through the roof to $47 billion. Famed investor Mark Cuban says it will produce "the world's first trillionaires," but that should still leave plenty of money for those who make the right trades early.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million
Updated: June 9, 2013
Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Zimmer is helping to restore lives worldwide


For more than 80 years, Zimmer has been a driving force in the rapid
  growth of the musculoskeletal health care industry. With an unwavering
  focus on the needs of patients and surgeons, Zimmer has become an
  industry leader.
Zimmer has been based in Warsaw since it was founded in 1927 by J.O.
  Zimmer.   A local salesman, Mr. Zimmer worked nights in his basement
  to develop his idea for a new aluminum splint design through which
  x-rays could easily pass to which enabled doctors to better assess
  healing progress.
Today, Zimmer has operations in more than 24 countries around the
  world and sells products in more than 100 countries.  The company is
  supported by the efforts of more than 8,500 employees worldwide.
Zimmer has additional primary manufacturing facilities in Ponce,
  Puerto Rico; Winterthur, Switzerland; northern New Jersey; Dover,
  Ohio; and Shannon, Ireland.  Other Zimmer locations include a
  Biologics Research facility in Austin, Texas; the Zimmer
  Spine division based in Minneapolis, Minnesota; and the Zimmer Dental division based
  in Carlsbad, California.



Our Purpose, Mission, and Guiding Principles/Values


Zimmer focuses on restoring mobility and improving the quality of

Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.  shares declined in the extended session Tuesday after the maker of orthopedic and spinal medical devices announced its chief executive was stepping down and said it expects second quarter earnings to be at the low end of its guidance.

Zimmer said CEO David Dvorak is stepping down effective immediately, and that Chief Financial Officer Daniel Florin will serve as interim CEO until a successor is named. In a separate statement, the company said it expects per-share earnings "to be at or near the bottom of its previously issued guidance range of $2.08 to $2.13". Analysts polled by FactSet expect $2.11 a share.

Zimmer Biomet Holdings Inc.  shares declined in the extended session Tuesday after the maker of orthopedic and spinal medical devices announced its chief executive was stepping down and said it expects second quarter earnings to be at the low end of its guidance.

Zimmer said CEO David Dvorak is stepping down effective immediately, and that Chief Financial Officer Daniel Florin will serve as interim CEO until a successor is named. In a separate statement, the company said it expects per-share earnings "to be at or near the bottom of its previously issued guidance range of $2.08 to $2.13". Analysts polled by FactSet expect $2.11 a share.
