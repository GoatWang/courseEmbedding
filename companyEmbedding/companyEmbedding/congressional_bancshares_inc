Congressional Bancshares to Merge with American Bank Holdings, Inc.
September 3, 2014
Congressional Bancshares to Merge with American Bank Holdings, Inc. and its Wholly-Owned Subsidiary American Bank
WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Congressional Bancshares, Inc. (“Congressional”) President and Chief Executive Officer, Jeffrey A. Lipson, announced the signing of a definitive merger agreement with American Bank Holdings, Inc. (“American”) which provides for the merger of American and its wholly-owned subsidiary, American Bank, with and into Congressional and Congressional Bank. The merger with American will provide Congressional with an enhanced franchise to expand its businesses, and add a large-scale residential mortgage business.
American, headquartered in Bethesda, MD had approximately $456 million of assets, $46 million of shareholder equity, five banking offices in the Washington, DC area, and a national mortgage lending platform with eight residential mortgage origination offices as of June 30, 2014. Congressional, also headquartered in Bethesda, MD, had approximately $428 million of assets, $38 million of shareholder equity, and four banking offices in the Washington, DC area, as of June 30, 2014.
Following the spinoff of certain American assets to a newly formed entity, the owners of which will be the shareholders of American, the shareholders of American will exchange their outstanding shares of American for shares of common stock of Congressional pursuant to an exchange ratio. The transaction has been unanimously approved by the respective Boards of Directors. The transaction is expected to close in the first quarter of 2015, subject to regulatory and shareholder approvals.
Mr. Lipson stated: “We are very excited about our merger with American Bank. The incremental liquidity from American ’s local franchise complements the asset strategy of Congressional. In addition, we are very enthusiastic about American’s well-run national mortgage platform. The merger will enhance our profitability, increase our ability to provide credit to Washington, DC area consumers and businesses, and allow us to expand our many community service activities.”
J.R. Schuble, Chairman and the largest shareholder of American, voiced similar enthusiasm: “We are delighted to be joining forces with such an outstanding franchise as Congressional. They share our strategic vision and our unwavering commitment to community. We anticipate that this merger will enable Congressional to deliver an enhanced level of community and mortgage banking products and services to our customers in the Washington, DC region and beyond. In addition, I believe the combined banks ’ employees and shareholders should benefit from opportunities that would not exist if we each remained independent. ” Mr. Schuble will be joining the Board of Directors of Congressional Bancshares as Vice Chairman.
John Lane will remain Vice Chairman of the Congressional Bank Board of Directors.
Sandler O ’Neill + Partners, L.P. served as financial advisor and Arent Fox LLP served as legal counsel to Congressional Bancshares, Inc.
Monacacy Financial Advisors, LLC served as financial advisor and Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton LLP served as legal counsel to American Bank Holding, Inc.

Available Now: Individual Bank Reports With Full Financials (Excel Format)
    
Includes Critical Information Not Found In Call Reports
Hi, I’m Nate Tobik, founder of Complete Bank Data.
Instant Download Reports Contain Over 8,000 Data Points Per Bank
As an investor, I struggled for years to find a good source of bank financial data to use for valuations and investment decisions.
The big companies that sell this information charge thousands a month -- a price point that only makes sense for large banks and funds.
So like most investors, my first stop was the FDIC’s website and the most recent call reports filed by the banks. If you’ve ever downloaded these before, you know they’re not exactly “user friendly.” Some of the issues include:



Difficult To Use Format. Call reports only contain aggregate year-to-date information. This makes it difficult to see trends and compare bank performance on a quarterly or annual basis. Even worse, the data is presented in PDF format so it must be re-entered into Excel before being processed, visualized, or used in any meaningful way.
        

Impossible to Compare and Search: The call report format makes it impossible to search and compare banks on key metrics like ROA, non-performing loans, etc. It would take hours of work to compare banks on a handful of metrics, or even to view one bank’s past performance on a single metric.
        

Missing Holding Company Data: Call reports for banks exclude information on their holding companies. This can hide assets and introduce serious errors to valuation models (For more on the pitfalls of call reports,
            read our whitepaper here)
        

In short, to get any kind of usable insights from FDIC call reports, you need to painstakingly enter them into Excel and disaggregate the data. This process can take days for each bank, and the time and cost requirements of doing this quickly add up to limit the number of banks you can analyze in a reasonable period of time.
Frustrated with spending endless hours on bank data entry, I created my own solution: a completely automated system for obtaining and processing bank financial data.

This makes it simple to see the bank’s historical performance for any metric.
        


Accurate: All data is sourced directly from filings to U.S. regulators, and entered into our system electronically, so there is no possibility of transcription error.
        

Up To Date: This data is posted by the FDIC and entered into our system well before quarterly earnings are released, giving our users a distinct informational edge.
        

Pre-Loaded Formulas: To save you time, our reports run the raw data through dozens of industry-standard banking formulas to calculate: X,Y,Z
        

To create these reports, we start by sourcing the raw data from filings submitted to the FDIC and Fed. We scan the PDF reports and compile the information into our secure database.

Safe and Sound Report


Questions? Call 1 866 591 8315
Available Now: Bank Safety and Soundness Reports
                
Includes Critical Information Not Found Elsewhere
Hi, I’m Nate Tobik, founder of CompleteBankData.
Determine If a Bank is Safe in Seconds
To outsiders banks are viewed as black boxes that take unknown and undue risk with depositor money.  Outsiders have trouble determining what a bank is doing, the risk it is taking, and if a bank will run into financial difficulties.  The last thing anyone involved with a bank from a depositor, to an investor, or a vendor wants is to be blindsided by a bank failure.  To outsiders it even seems like even regulators are even blindsided by failures.
But here’s the thing, it isn’t true, banking regulators know for months and sometimes even years that a bank is on the brink of failure.  The problem is they don’t make this information public because they fear it would cause panic and distress.  Bank regulators use a system called CAMELS, which stands for Capital, Assets, Management, Earnings, Liquidity and Sensitivity to evaluate the health of a bank.  The only parties who know CAMELS ratings are bank regulators and bank managements, and it’s not in a bank’s interest release these ratings to the public.
A number of companies that have attempted to reverse engineer the CAMELS ratings used by regulators.  But reverse engineering has pitfalls.  Any engineer will tell you that reverse engineering anything is filled with problems and hidden issues.  Would you rather drive a car that was designed from the ground up for safety? Or would you rather drive one where the safety features were reverse engineered?
If you wouldn’t get into a car with reverse engineered safety features why would you trust a company’s reverse engineered financial safety metrics?  I know I don’t trust reverse engineering so when we we set out to design a bank safety ratings we decided to design them from the ground up.
The bank regulator CAMELS ratings might be useful to bank regulators, but we’re not regulators and you’re not a regulator either.  We set out to design something useful to anyone concerned with the safety and financial soundness of a bank.
Whereas the CAMELS ratings rely on six metrics to assess the risk level of a bank we look at 22 separate metrics giving you a more comprehensive rating.  These aren’t just simple metrics either, we look at everything from a bank’s basic capital soundness to their asset quality trends.  After looking at an initial set of financial measure we then compare a bank to local peers to determine if a bank is taking excessive risk compared to their peers.
We created our Safety and Soundness report as a way for ANYONE to assess the financial safety of a bank.  You don’t have a be a regulator to use this report.
The report contains an overall safety rating right at the top in an easy to read font with color coding.  A bank is ranked Safe, Moderately Safe, High Risk, or Very Risky.
Beyond the initial safety rating we also include additional financial metrics that support the safety rating.  The metrics we include are just a portion of the metrics that are used to create our risk scores, but they’re vital in helping you assess the financial condition of a bank.
The report includes 14 specific metrics including:

Tier 1 Capital Ratio
Leverage Ratio
Non-Current Loans/Loans
Loan Loss Allowance/Loans
Earnings Coverage to Net Charge-Offs
Loan Loss Allowance/Non-Current Loans
Total Assets
Net Loans & Leases
Total Deposits
Yield on Earning Assets
Net Interest Margin
Return on Equity
Return on Assets

You can purchase the Safety and Soundness Report right now for $29.99 by following the steps listed below.
Individual reports are $29.99 each and come in the form of an instantly downloadable Excel file (.xlsx). Here’s how to order:

1) Visit the bank detail page for the bank you’d like to purchase a report for.  You can search for a bank by putting the bank name in the search box in the upper right hand corner of the web site.

Hi, I’m Nate Tobik, founder of Complete Bank Data.
Uncover a Bank’s Interest Rate Risk
You’re probably aware that a bank makes money by taking in short term deposits and then lending against those deposits on a long term basis.  Banks that don’t manage their interest rate risk well can find themselves in the FDIC’s cross hairs, or even worse, in receivership.
A bank needs to manage their risk profile by making sure they have an appropriate mix of both long term and short term loans, deposits, and investment securities.  This is information that bankers have at their finger tips, but for anyone else it takes hours of work transcribing FDIC call reports to determine a bank’s risk level.
We’ve simplified the process by creating the Maturity and Duration report.  We took the data from the FDIC call reports and pulled out the most important information related to interest rate risk.  We then put this details in an easy to use fully editable Excel report.
Unlike other vendors our reports aren’t locked down PDF formats that are only good for printing.  We offer customers fully customizable Excel reports.  You can take our reports and add in your own formulas and modifications all with a few clicks.
Our report doesn’t only show you how a bank stands regarding the interest rate risk they’re taking.  We also show you how they compare to peers.
The Maturity and Duration Report includes:

                
22 distinct and vital data fields
Investment duration for loans, deposits and investment securities
Durations shown in both absolute values (dollars) and percentages allowing easier analysis
Details that help you determine whether a bank is taking too much or too little interest rate risk.

You can purchase the Maturity and Duration Report right now for $29.99 by following the steps listed below.
