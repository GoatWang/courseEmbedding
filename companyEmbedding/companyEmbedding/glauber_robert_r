Robert R. Glauber, NASD Chairman And CEO, Will Retire From NASD On August 31 | FINRA.org

Robert R. Glauber, NASD Chairman And CEO, Will Retire From NASD On August 31




Washington, D.C. — At the NASD Board of Governors meeting July 20, Robert R. Glauber, who has served as Chairman and CEO for nearly six years, announced his intention to advance the date of his expected retirement from the end of this year to August 31. He will return to Harvard as a visiting professor in its Law School. Mr. Glauber had been a professor at the Harvard Business School and a lecturer at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government before becoming NASD's CEO in 2000 and its Chairman in 2001.As announced in January, Mr. Glauber will be succeeded by Mary L. Schapiro, NASD's Vice Chairman and President of its Regulatory Policy and Oversight Division."I came to NASD six years ago with the goal of transitioning the organization away from owning markets, and focusing it solely on its regulatory mission," Glauber said. "With NASD's recent sale of its last remaining stake in NASDAQ and with the SEC approval of NASDAQ's request to operate as an exchange beginning August 1, NASD has succeeded in making that transformation. Leaving now will allow me to join the Board of Directors of Freddie Mac, which I anticipate doing in September, consider a couple of other corporate board opportunities, and return to Harvard a bit sooner.""I am extremely proud of everything the NASD team has accomplished over the last six years, in particular NASD's vital role in rebuilding public confidence in the securities markets after the dramatic downturn in 2000. I know Mary will lead the organization to even greater heights during her tenure."Raymond ("Chip") Mason, chairman of the NASD Corporate Governance Committee and Chairman and CEO of Legg Mason, said, "The entire board is grateful for the job Bob has done. He steered NASD through a most critical time for securities regulators, leaving it with an unchallenged reputation for protecting investors and in the strongest financial condition. And, with its complete separation from owning for-profit markets, NASD is extremely well positioned to continue and build on its mission with energy and integrity. We understand his decision to leave a few months early and we thank him for his important service and wish him all the best in his future endeavors."Mr. Mason said the Board was especially proud of these accomplishments during Mr. Glauber's tenure:Built a strong regulatory record, reflected in important new rules and programs in areas such as analyst conflict issues, mutual fund breakpoints and variable annuities.
Oversaw vigorous enforcement actions to protect investors and restore confidence in the markets, capped by a record $134 million in fines last year.
Fully transformed NASD into an organization focused solely on regulation by divesting all Amex and NASDAQ ownership and achieving SEC approval of NASDAQ Exchange Registration.
Took steps to make NASD operate with private-sector efficiency and built a balance sheet to more than $2 billion through operating savings and proceeds of the NASDAQ sale. Because of the strong balance sheet, $150 million of rebates has been returned to member firms since 2000.
Created an Investment Committee to provide oversight and guidance of NASD's growing investment portfolio, with an income allocation strategy to help fund operating expenses. Portfolio income reduced fees to members by $75 million in 2005 and is expected to produce roughly the same support in the future.
Dramatically increased NASD's commitment to investor education by creating the NASD Investor Education Foundation, which funds innovative research and educational projects aimed at the investing public. The Foundation has a commitment of $85 million.
Launched Examiner University, which provides innovative and extensive training for all new NASD examiners. A one-year course of classroom and on-the-job training for all incoming NASD examiners is designed to ensure that they do their job effectively and without unnecessary burden on regulated firms.
Improved investor protection through enhanced market transparency, most recently through the NASD TRACE system, which provides corporate bond price data.
Harmonized sales protection rules between mutual funds and 529 plans. Led the effort to work with insurance regulators to bring sales practice rules for fixed and equity indexed annuities into line with those set by NASD for variable annuities.
Worked with the SEC to develop more effective disclosure for mutual fund sales using the Internet and a standardized summary document (Profile Plus) that contains information in simple form covering fund objective and performance, costs, and any conflicts the broker has in selling the fund.
Advocated for regulatory consolidation with the NYSE that would enhance investor protection, reduce duplication and drive out unnecessary costs and compliance requirements.Earlier in his career, Glauber served as Under Secretary of the Treasury for Finance from 1989 to 1992. In this capacity, he was the senior officer responsible for Treasury's domestic policy. Prior to joining Treasury, he was a professor at the Harvard Business School and after leaving Treasury, a lecturer at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. In 1987, Glauber served as Executive Director of the Task Force on Market Mechanisms ("Brady Commission"), appointed by President Reagan to study the 1987 stock market crash.NASD is the leading private-sector provider of financial regulatory services, dedicated to investor protection and market integrity through effective and efficient regulation and complementary compliance and technology-based services. NASD touches virtually every aspect of the securities business - from registering and educating all industry participants, to examining securities firms, enforcing both NASD rules and the federal securities laws, and administering the largest dispute resolution forum for investors and registered firms.

New York--The National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD®), today announced that its Board of Governors met and made the following executive management appointments:
Robert R. Glauber has been named the NASD new chief executive officer and president. Mr. Glauber has been actively involved with the NASD since 1996. He played a significant role in the fundamental restructuring of the NASD that is currently underway. His career (see below) has included leadership positions in both public and private sectors. Glauber will assume his position at NASD on November 1, 2000.
Richard G. Ketchum has been named president of The Nasdaq Stock Market® (Nasdaq®). In managing Nasdaq, he will continue the close working relationship with Pat Campbell, Nasdaq’s chief operating officer, and Al Berkeley. He will be a member of Nasdaq’s office of the chairman and is expected to be elected to Nasdaq’s Board. This appointment is effective immediately.
Alfred R. Berkeley, III, Nasdaq’s current president, will be vice chairman of the Nasdaq board of directors. He will be a member of Nasdaq’s senior management group and the office of the chairman. In this role, he will continue his long-standing and successful efforts to both build The Nasdaq Stock Market and to communicate its values and strategies to the leading existing and potential issuers. This appointment is effective immediately.
Frank G. Zarb will remain as NASD chairman and chairman and chief executive officer of Nasdaq, during a transition period.
Commenting on the moves, Frank Zarb said, "We are in the process of completing the restructuring of the NASD that its members approved so resoundingly in April. These appointments today set the stage for the future growth of both organizations, through outstanding leadership."
Management Backgrounds
Robert R. Glauber, 61, has been an active member of NASD’s board since he was elected in 1996. During the development of the NASD restructuring proposal, he chaired the board’s Fairness Committee, to provide an independent assessment of the restructuring proposal. The Fairness Committee carefully reviewed and considered the objectives and terms and conditions of the restructuring. The restructuring plans were modified in a number of important respects based on input from the Fairness Committee. In addition, he is chairman of the NASD Board of Governor’s Finance Committee.
Glauber is currently Adjunct Lecturer at the Center for Business and Government, Kennedy School, Harvard University. Mr. Glauber joined the Kennedy School faculty in 1992, after serving as Under Secretary of the U.S. Treasury for Finance from 1989 until 1992. Previously, he was a professor at Harvard Business School for 25 years. Mr. Glauber served as Executive Director of the task force (Brady Commission) appointed by President Reagan to study the 1987 stock market crash.
He serves as a director of XL Capital, Ltd. (Bermuda-based insurer), Dun & Bradstreet, Measurisk LLC (a private risk measurement applications service provider, for which he is chairman), and Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Mr. Glauber holds a B.A. from Harvard College in Economics and a doctorate in Finance from Harvard Business School.
Richard G. Ketchum, 49, was appointed President of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD®), in February 1998. Overseeing a broad range of NASD operations, he works closely with the association’s subsidiaries: The Nasdaq Stock Market, The American Stock Exchange®, and NASD Regulation, Inc., in the development and formulation of legal, regulatory and market policies, as well as international initiatives.
Ketchum joined the NASD as Executive Vice President in 1991 and was appointed Chief Operating Officer in 1993. Prior to joining the NASD, Ketchum was the Director of the Division of Market Regulation at the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The Division’s responsibilities included the oversight of all U.S. securities markets, the interpretation of the Commission’s rules regulating the secondary trading markets and facilitating the development of a nation market system.
Ketchum was associated with the law firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley and McCloy in New York from 1975 to 1977 before joining the staff of the SEC. He is a member of the adjunct faculty of the Georgetown School of Law and previously with the Washington School of Law at American University. He is a member of the bar in both New York and the District of Columbia. He earned his J.D. from the New York University School of Law in 1975 and his B.A. from Tufts University in 1972.
Alfred R. Berkeley, III, 55, was appointed President of The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc., in 1996. Prior to joining Nasdaq, he was a Managing Director and Senior Banker in the Corporate Finance Department of Alex. Brown & Sons Incorporated, financing computer software and electronic commerce companies.
Berkeley joined Alex, Brown & Sons Incorporated in 1972 as a research analyst. He became a general partner of Alex. Brown in 1983. From 1985 to 1987, he served as Head of Information Services for the firm. In that capacity, he was responsible for all corporate information services, including the firm’s back office and front office technology. Berkeley then moved on to Alex. Brown’s Merger and Acquisition department where, from 1987 to 1989, he developed the firm’s technology practice.
Berkeley served as a captain in the United States Air Force from 1968 to 1972. He is a graduate of The Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania (M.B.A., 1968) and the University of Virginia (B.A., 1966)
Frank G. Zarb, 65, is Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NASD, Inc. and The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. Prior to joining the NASD in 1997, Mr. Zarb was chairman, CEO and President of Alexander & Alexander Services, Inc., from June 1994 through January 1997. Before that, he was a Vice Chairman and Group Chief Executive of The Travelers, Inc. and Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Smith Barney, a Travelers’ subsidiary, which he joined in 1988. He was named Group Chief Executive in 1993. Mr. Zarb was elected a Vice Chairman of Travelers, Inc. in 1991. Before joining Smith Barney, he was a senior partner of Lazard Freres & Co. From 1978 until 1988.
From 1974 through 1977, Mr. Zarb was the senior official of all United States government energy-related activities, serving as Executive Director of the Cabinet-level Energy Resources Council, Administrator of the Federal Energy Administration, and Assistant to the President for Energy Affairs (the "Energy Czar"). Prior to those appointments, he had been Associate Director of the Office of Management and Budget from 1973 to 1974 and served as Assistant Secretary of Labor between 1971 and 1972.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

Data Format: CSV

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).
