                           This book marks a significantly different approach to the subject. It has been designed specifically to offer a simpler and
                              less sophisticated treatment of organic reaction mechanisms than that to be found in the Guidebook. It is based on three underlying
                              principles: that there are three types of reaction - substitution, addition and elimination; that there are three types of
                              reagent - nucleophiles, electrophiles and radicals; and that there are two effects - electronic and steric - through which
                              the behaviour of a particular atom or group can be influenced by the rest of the molecule of which it is a constituent part.
                              A Primer to Mechanism in Organic Chemistry is an essential resource for first- and second-year chemistry undergraduates and
                              particularly, though not exclusively, those not then proceeding to further chemical study. It is also a useful reference for
                              sixth-form students

                           Based on the Gospel of Luke, the film starts with the Birth of Christ and follows His journey through pivotal events such
                              as known miracles (healing, sharing of the fish), 40 days in the desert, conflict with government/religious leaders, and the
                              betrayal by Judas. Inevitably, the story leads to the Crucifixion, its impact on His disciples, and His miraculous rise thereafter

                              A village in the heart of Europe. Sickles harvest the corn and feet trample it. We are witnessing a world which ends happily,
                                 amidst some weeping and some melancholy, but above all with an insane self-confidence. It is a fascinating and sensuous village
                                 whose inhabitants are clothed in garments of the richest colours and textures, with ornamental hairstyles which are only to
                                 be seen in illustrations of ancient folklore or in books of fables. But this book of fables is plagued by war and modernity.
                                 Kaosmos's subtitle is "The Ritual of the Door", a door which remains closed to those who wait a lifetime to enter it. We therefore
                                 expect a performance about divisions, about insurmountable walls. But there are no divisions, distinctions, points of orientation.
                                 There is no inside and outside, no "us" and "them", no "these" and "those". There is the door which is mobile, and the actors
                                 move it around from place to place, laying it flat on the ground like a box or a coffin, dragging it on their shoulders like
                                 a cross or standing it upright on its frame, dividing nothing from nothing

Born in Manchester, a product of a doctor/nurse marriage, it was perhaps inevitable that I should follow in my father’s footsteps and enter the medical profession. After obtaining my university degree, I completed the compulsory 12 months as a resident ‘house officer’ in a large city centre hospital. It was an unforgettable experience. With a dozen of my contemporaries, I was ‘thrown in at the deep end’. We lived in the doctors ‘mess’, and were on duty for anything up to 100 hours a week. Like squaddies under the charge of a belligerent sergeant major, we survived thanks to a combination of dark humour and bloody minded perseverance! This compulsory year completed, I undertook surgical training then gained 25 years experience as a consultant surgeon. 
			    My desire to influence the effectiveness of clinical practice led me to undertake management training and to become the medical director of an NHS Trust – though I continued as a practising surgeon. 
			    When I finally hung up my scalpel, I took a post as a clinical advisor to the Healthcare Commission, reviewing the quality of surgical practice and learning the lessons when things went wrong.
Now retired, I pass my time pleasantly with ‘the three G’s’ -  Gardening, Golf and Grandchildren – together with the occasional Glass of Gin and, if I am to be completely honest, the odd Grumble that ‘things aren’t what they used to be’.

Modern Organ Music, Peter Sykes, Organist - [OAR-640]
$15.98















1999 Noack organ, Op. 135 in the Neskirkja
Reykjavik, Iceland


Inspired by the modernist architecture of Neskirkja and by the breadth
of its new organ's musical possibilities, this recording contains many
threads of connection within and between the chosen works. The idea
began with a specific request from Neskirkja's organist, Reynir
Jnasson, to include some Icelandic organ music; upon learning some of
these distinguished pieces, it became clear to me that clear musical
affinities could well be reflected in the inclusion of works by
Hindemith and Heiller. The remaining works of the recording reflect
contemporary composing activity from the region where this organ was
built (Boston) and where it now resides (Reykjavik) from
organist/composers of three generations, bridging worlds that have in
the end more similarities than differences.

Paul Hindemith 1895-1963:
Sonata I

Anton Heiller 1926-1979:
In Festo Corporis Christi

Jon Thorarinsson b. 1917:
Orgelmusik (Preludium, Chorale und Fuge über ein altes Thema)

Jon Asgeirsson b. 1928:
Passacaglia in g moll

Gunnar Reynir Sveinsson b. 1933:
Jesus, My Morning Star: Meditation for Organ on an Old Child's Hymn

Jon Nordal b. 1926:
A Prelude on a Hymn that was never sung

Daniel Pinkham b. 1923:
Four Epigrams: Flute Soliloquy, Interlude, Reminiscence, Acclamation

James Woodman b. 1957:
Prelude and Passacaglia (In Festo Pentecostes) 

Paul Hindemith's
musical language is uniquely suited to the organ. Although the total
number of works is small, they have earned a permanent place in the
repertoire (Daniel Pinkham said to me, as I discussed this program with
him, "Those works have stood up so well, haven't they") and have served
as inspiration to a generation of younger composers. Their gratefulness
for the medium may seem facile at first, but this is serious music
indeed, with heartfelt statement at the core. Sonate I, dating from
1937, combines an objective tonal language with a broad sweep of styles
and colors; the Phantaisie is Regeresque in its impassioned
outbursts, while the solemn dance of the closing movement is enlivened
by a jolly, whistled tune. Hindemith specified dynamic and pitch
levels, but not tone colors (much less specific stops) for
registration; this performance offers one solution inspired by an
orchestral outlook as well as the musical and registrational
possibilities of this organ.

Anton Heiller's
place in organ history of the twentieth century is likewise assured,
but his memorable performances and many recordings (especially of the
works of Bach) and his visionary teaching legacy have perhaps
overshadowed his compositions, which are worthy of study in their
subtlety and complexity. The suite In Festo Corporis Christi is
inscribed "Marie Claire Alain in herzlicher Verbundenheit gewidmet" and
dated S.D.G. (Soli Deo Gloria) 27 December 1959. In the four brief
movements, the chant tunes (I: Cibavit eos; II: Sacerdotes Dominum;
III: Quotres cumque; IV: Lauda Sion) are colorfully decorated and
polytonally harmonized as well as used in canon and motivic imitation.
Clearly intended for a modern tracker organ and with registrations
specifically noted (and followed as much as possible here), this work
reflects the energy and enthusiasm of the organ reform movement at its
best.

Jon Thorarinsson studied with Paul Hindemith at Yale University, and the musical influence of Hindemith in Praeludium, Choral und Fuge über ein altes Thema
is not difficult to recognize. The form of this attractive piece,
written in 1954, resembles Hindemith's organ sonatas; in three
movements, it is an extended chorale setting of "an old theme" much in
the manner of Hindemith's third sonata, although in this case the same
tune is used for all movements. The first movement sets the tune in
long notes in the bass, the second in the soprano, and the third in the
tenor amidst fugal episodes reminiscent of the last movement of
Hindemith's second organ sonata. The piece is dedicated to Dr. Pall
Isolfsson (1893-1974), Icelandic organist, titulaire of the
Hallgrimskirkja in Reykjavik and director of the Reykjavik Conservatory.

Jon Asgeirsson wrote the Passacaglia i g moll
in 1956 while studying at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music. The
basis for the passacaglia theme is the famous "Dido's Lament" (When I
am lain in earth) of Purcell; nineteen variations are presented,
including a fugue in which the theme is transposed into differing keys
and voices. The expressive tonal language of the piece bridges the late
nineteenth century into the twentieth, while the figural writing honors
the long tradition of organ passacaglias throughout history.

								
		The next two pieces come from a collection of organ music by Icelandic composers published in 1980. Jon Nordal's A Prelude on a Hymn that was never sung
is a truly modern conceptual piece; in three sections, its
improvisatory feeling and free atonality places it firmly in the second
half of the twentieth century.Gunnar Reynir Sveinsson's Jesus, my morning star
is a choral fantasy rather than a choral prelude; the tune is used as a
motivic basis for imitation, stretto, fugue and canon. The haunting
refrain's rhythm is particularly evocative.

Daniel Pinkham writes of Four Epigrams,
"Today, the term "Epigram" is generally used as a literary term to
refer to a short poem treating concisely and pointedly a single thought
or event. The same observation may be made in musical terms concerning
the four short pieces presented here. I. Flute Soliloquy: This opening
movement is a brief, free fantasia for a solo flute stop. Three soft
and distant chords begin, interrupt and conclude. II. Interlude: This
movement begins and ends with flutes in a high register. In the middle,
a long-breathed cantilena is played in the organ's lower registers,
suggestive of the classical French basse de trompette. III.
Reminiscence: After a hesitant beginning, a reposed and reflective aria
is heard in the organ's tenor register. IV. Acclamation: The finale is
an energetic, march-like rondo with two interrupting couplets. It
concludes brilliantly with full organ."

James Woodman writes, "Prelude and Passacaglia (In Festo Pentecostes)
received its first performance at the 1981 Contemporary Organ Music
Festival sponsored by the Boston Chapter of the American Guild of
Organists . . . The Prelude is a setting of "Veni Creator" constructed
over five complete statements of the passacaglia theme in the bass. The
Passacaglia itself then proceeds for fifteen continuous variations
during which the wind and fire imagery of Pentecost is made vivid to
the ear.
