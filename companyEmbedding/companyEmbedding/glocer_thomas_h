Glocer, Chief Executive of Thomson Reuters, Is Being Replaced


				By Amy Chozick			
December 1, 2011 6:08 pm
December 1, 2011 6:08 pm 

Mark Blinch/ReutersThomas Glocer
Thomson Reuters said Thursday that it was replacing its chief executive, Thomas H. Glocer, who had struggled to turn around the financial news and information service in an increasingly competitive market.
James C. Smith, Thomson Reuters’s chief operating officer, will replace Mr. Glocer beginning Jan. 1.
The switch comes at a tumultuous time for the company, which has a market capitalization of about $22 billion. In the struggling economy, fewer companies are willing to pay for the financial tools and market analysis that Reuters provides on expensive desktop terminals. Reuters also faces competition from rivals like Bloomberg L.P., FactSet Research System and Dow Jones, part of News Corporation.
Its markets division mainly serves banks and brokerage houses and accounts for 60 percent of overall revenue. The company was late to the market with its Eikon desktop product and, in the view of many clients, it was not up to the standards of competing technology from Bloomberg.
“Thomson Reuters has been losing the bake-off,” said Douglas B. Taylor, the managing director of Burton-Taylor International Consulting, a company that tracks the financial information business. Not only have Bloomberg and, to a smaller degree, other firms been taking customers away from Thomson Reuters, Mr. Taylor said, but the company has also been largely unsuccessful in attracting new clients.
In July, Thomson Reuters announced the departure of a half-dozen executives, including Devin N. Wenig, the market division’s chief executive.
Mr. Glocer, 56, subsequently assumed responsibility for the markets division.
“By the end of this year, the organizational, strategy and budget work I have been leading will be complete and the transition plan I launched last summer will have achieved its objectives,” Mr. Glocer said in a statement. Of his replacement, Mr. Glocer said: “Jim Smith is a very talented executive with whom I have worked closely over the past four years; he is ready to lead Thomson Reuters.”
The announcement came after the markets closed on Thursday.
In 2007, the Thomson Corporation agreed to pay $7 billion for Reuters. At the time many were surprised that Mr. Glocer was picked to lead the combined operation. Richard J. Harrington, Thomson’s chief at the time, retired as soon as the transaction closed.
The Thomson family, through its private holding company, Woodbridge, has a 55 percent stake in Thomson Reuters.
A former journalist, Mr. Smith, 52, joined the Thomson Newspaper group in 1987 and has held several positions, including leading the division that sells tax, legal and accounting products.
David Thomson, chairman of Thomson Reuters, said in a statement: “Tom successfully directed an extensive integration, expanded our business internationally, revitalized the Reuters news organization and championed talent across the entire business.”

Hi. This is my personal blog. I started it while Chief Executive of Reuters for the reasons I describe in the post "More Recursive Loops -- A Blog on Blogging." I found that I enjoyed writing on my own schedule and continued the practice during the last few years as CEO of Thomson Reuters.
 
Now that I have stepped down as Chief Executive of Thomson Reuters, there should be less confusion as to the purpose of these writings. For my part, I shall feel less constrained than while associated with the company to comment on items which Reuters journalists may be writing about or which might not live up to the requirements of independence and freedom from political affiliation imposed by the Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.
 
I'm going to continue to write about what interests me, such as the transition from analog to digital across various media, as well as wider issues in technology, economics and politics. I will also continue to write about the small delights and ironies in every day life such as marriage to an independently-minded Finn for over a quarter century and the joys of bringing up our two kids.
 
Above all my aim is to engage in an electronic dialog with whomever wants to comment on a post or otherwise share their views. The views I express are totally my own and do not represent the position of any organization with which I may be affiliated.
