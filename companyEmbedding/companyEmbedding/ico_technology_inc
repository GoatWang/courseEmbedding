Proto Labs Reaches Settlement With ICO Products On Quoting Technology






Business Wire




Apr 11, 2017 10:00 AM EDT













 
















































  Digital manufacturing company Proto Labs, Inc. (NYSE: PRLB) and ICO Products, an Ohio-based plastic injection molding manufacturer, have reached an agreement to settle an ongoing patent infringement dispute related to Proto Labs' proprietary quoting technology.  As a result of this settlement, Proto Labs received monetary compensation and an equity stake in ICO Products with a future option to take a larger stake in the company. Concurrent with the agreement, ICO Products enters into a license agreement with Proto Labs granting ICO Products rights to continued use of certain aspects of Proto Labs' proprietary technology in its quoting system.  Proto Labs founded its company in 1999 anchored by its automated quoting software that analyzes 3D CAD models to determine real-time pricing and provide interactive design for manufacturability feedback in less than 24 hours.  About Proto LabsProto Labs is the world's fastest digital manufacturing source for custom prototypes and low-volume production parts. The technology-enabled company uses advanced 3D printing, CNC machining and injection molding technologies to produce parts within days. The result is an unprecedented speed-to-market value for designers and engineers and an on-demand resource throughout a product's life cycle. Visit protolabs.com for more information.

History












History
Established in 2001, ICO Technologies has been continually innovating and growing over the years. From the very beginning, our company has been recognized for the ingeniousness of its tailor-made solutions designed specifically to address the needs of a broad range of clients. Within this context, ICO became securely positioned as an important player in the web solution design and hosting sector.
Since 2006, we have established a technological development platform based on Microsoft.NET technology called INNOVA. All of our software packages are developed from this framework, and therefore, derive benefits from its numerous functionalities. INNOVA translates into a huge advantage for our clients, since the platform enables us to develop customized and stable management solutions. Additionally, these are easily integrated into our clients' environment, and incorporate a number of advanced features (e.g. statistics and dashboards).
Thanks to the INNOVA platform, ICO Technologies went on to specialize in the development of software solutions aligned with the needs of the following areas:

Emergency
Security
Management

ICO Technologies is now recognized as a leader in its areas of expertise. The organization has hundreds of prestigious clients in the institutional, municipal and government markets, as well as in the small business sphere.
ICO Technologies is headquartered in Quebec, Canada, serving its domestic and international customer base. Our company has close to 50 employees entirely dedicated to the development of its software products and their commercialization.

Target Becomes BeeON
Building on the success of its range of TARGET products in Quebec, ICO Technologies has undertaken the implementation of a marketing strategy in 2015, with a view to expanding its national and international client base.

BeeON is now able to offer an extensive menu of products that comply with the strictest quality standards from demanding clients such as the Canadian Space Agency (CSA) and the Government of Quebec. The flexibility, interoperability and integration between modules are the key features that made our products famous. This competitive edge refers to a greater variability and an unmatched ability to meet your requirements.
