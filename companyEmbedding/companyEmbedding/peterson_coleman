Court Transcripts







The Court Transcripts 
 As  with all trials held in Michigan courts, a complete transcript was made of the  trial in the matter of the People versus Coleman Peterson on a charge of  murder, held during the September term of the 25th circuit court in  Marquette in 1952.. The transcript records the complete proceedings, including  those when the jury was excused and sent to the jury room while the attorneys  argued a point of procedure or the merits of an objection. The transcript was prepared by George  Gauthier of Marquette, the court reporter.
The  trial judge was Judge Charles O. Arch of Hillsdale, who is known as Judge  Weaver in the novel. As the session of  circuit court opens, Judge Weaver explains that he was assigned to preside at  that session because of the illness of the beloved Judge Maitland. Judge Maitland was, in reality, Judge Glenn  W. Jackson of Gladstone, judge of the 25th circuit, which at that  time included all of the central Upper Peninsula. Judge Jackson was seriously ill in the fall  of 1952 and unable to fulfill his duties.
Many  other characters in the novel have counterparts in the actual trial. Paul Biegler, the trout fishing defense  attorney, was John D. Voelker, the trout fishing defense attorney. Prosecuting Attorney Mitch Lodwick was really  Marquette County Prosecuting Attorney Edmund J. Thomas of Ishpeming, who was in  his second year on the job, having defeated Voelker in the 1950 election. As Lodwick was assisted by Assistant Attorney  General Claude Dancer, so Thomas was assisted by Assistant Attorney General  Irving Beattie of Marine City, a town on the St. Clair River smaller than  Ishpeming.
Three  excerpts of the trial transcript are presented here. The first is the testimony of Adrian Wentzel,  manager of the Lumberjack Tavern in Big Bay, who is known as bartender Alphonse  Paquette in the novel. The second  excerpt is the testimony of Lt. Coleman Peterson, known as Frederic Manion in  the novel. Peterson's wife Charlotte  became Laura Manion, and there really was a small dog that carried a lighted  flashlight in its mouth. The third  excerpt is the testimony of Army psychiatrist Thomas Petty, who becomes Army  psychiatrist Matthew Smith in the book.  This testimony revolves around a hypothetical question that was the  essential element of the defense strategy.

Really nice tent

Went to a National park campsite this past weekend and the tent did great. It did not rain so I cannot comment on the rain performance. I know it will need some seam sealer, but so do most of the tents on the market. The tent had plenty of room for two adults and two "full" size dogs. I really liked and enjoyed the screened in area, a nice place to set in the evenings. The built in light and the auto roll windows are a really neat feature. Some question why the screened in area has no floor... well, if it did have a floor and it rained what would happen with all the water collected on the floor? The way it is now it will drain into the ground.
I am very satisfied with the size and quality of this tent and look forward to many camping outings. Even my wife commented on how nice the tent is.

Would I recommend this to a friend or family member? 

                                                Yes
