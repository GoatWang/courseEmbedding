Find a Nationwide Insurance Agent in Hampton, Virginia
Nationwide auto insurance No matter how defensive your driving, there’s no accounting for the behavior of every motorist on the road, especially when you’re caught in the midst of the worst of the daily rush hour traffic. The advantages of the On Your Side® Claims Service are there whenever you need to make a claim, just one reason why Nationwide has earned a 95% member satisfaction rating. Whether you have a quick question about your chosen claim limits or you’ve heard about Nationwide’s Vanishing Deductible® program and want to know more, our Hampton auto insurance agents are an incredible resource for information and easy, personalized insurance tips. Nationwide homeowners insurance In a large city like Hampton, there are an endless combination of housing plans and household belongings that need the protection of a homeowner’s policy and personalized coverage with Nationwide. Some coverage protections are standard, but extra dwellings, liability, and flood insurance are just a few of the supplemental coverage options used by other local homeowners. From the city center to the most remote suburbs, our Hampton home insurance agents can help customize your coverage options.  Nationwide life insurance There’s a lot of life to live in a big city like Hampton. But when it comes to life insurance coverage, it really helps put the essentials into focus. You want to know that your loved ones are going to be cared for if something should happen to you. You want to know that there’s not going to be a huge financial burden if a family member is diagnosed with a chronic illness that requires daily, long—term care. You want to know that you have one more egg in the nest for retirement savings. Talk to one of our Hampton life insurance agents about the right policy for your household.  Nationwide business insurance The basic types of business insurance coverage parallel the ways in which the Hampton economy has evolved over the years. Since the city’s founding, local businesses have looked for ways to insure their building and other property assets. Liability coverage wasn’t far behind. Eventually, vehicle and fleet insurance became a common coverage need, while the potential causes of operating loss seem greater than ever before. No matter what types of risk your company faces, let one of our Hampton business insurance agents serve as your Nationwide risk management specialist.  Local Insurance Quotes and Personalized Coverage Use Nationwide’s online tool to get quotes for any number of personalized coverage solutions.

He rose to the rank of captain and for several terms served on the Board of Fire Commissioners for the department as well as a member of its Benevolent Association. He will long be remembered and admired for the wonderful job he did as the historian for the department. For more than 20 years he was employed by Suffolk County as a lock tender at the Shinnecock locks in Hampton Bays.Mr. Wilson is survived by his children, Thomas E. Wilson Jr., Ellen Reilley, William Wilson, Edward Wilson and his wife Geraldine Wilson and Sharon Hand, all of Hampton Bays; sister, Ellen Overton of North Carolina; grandchildren, Dawn Kurtz, James Reilley, Mark and Megan Wilson, Timothy and Patrick Wilson, George, Amber, Crystal and Carrie Hand; and nine great-grandchildren, Alicia, Brent and Courtney Kurtz, Hailey, James and Rebecca Reilley, and Cole, McKenzie and Abigal Wilson.

Ronald Scott Funeral Home on Sunday, April 10, for firematic services led by Chaplain Rev. Daniel Harris. A memorial service led by Rev. Harris took place Monday, April 11 at the funeral home. A full firematic procession led the funeral past the fire House and beneath the flag arches to Good Ground Cemetery where he was buried next to (his beloved “bride” as he always called her) Chickie.In lieu of flowers, memorial donations made to the American Cancer Society, cancer.org, and the Diabetes Foundation, diabetesfoundationinc.org, would be appreciated by the family.
