 R. Hewitt  Pate 



Hunton & Williams LLP, Washington, DC
Hewitt heads Hunton & Williams’ Global Competition Practice Group. His practice includes all aspects of competition law counseling and litigation including antitrust, business torts, and intellectual property. Before joining Hunton & Williams, Hewitt was DOJ Assistant Attorney General in charge of over 700 employees at the Antitrust Division and all aspects of the Division’s criminal and civil merger and non merger enforcement program. He successfully argued a landmark case limiting U.S. court jurisdiction over anticompetitive acts committed outside U.S. markets (F. Hoffman-LaRoche Ltd. v. Empagran S.A., 542 U.S. 155 (2004). He served as chair of the OECD Competition Committee Working Party 3 on international enforcement, and led the adoption of guidelines for international information sharing in cartel cases. He led the first U.S. delegation since the 1980’s to visit the People’s Republic of China for competition law discussions. Before joining DOJ, Hewitt was appellate counsel for finders of the largest sunken treasure ever recovered (Columbus-America Discovery Group v. Atlantic Mutual Insurance Co., 203 F.3d 291 (4th Cir. 2000). He served as law clerk to U.S. Supreme Court Justices Anthony M. Kennedy from 1989-90 and Lewis F. Powell, Jr. from 1988-89, as well as clerking for Hon. J. Harvie Wilkinson III of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals from 1987-88.

R. Hewitt Pate Named Vice President and General Counsel for Chevron







press release
R. Hewitt Pate Named Vice President and General Counsel for Chevron








SAN RAMON, Calif., July 29, 2009 - Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) today announced the appointment of R. Hewitt Pate as vice president and general counsel. Pate, 47, will succeed and report to Chevron's current general counsel, Charles A. James, who was named executive vice president earlier this year.
As Chevron's chief legal officer, Pate will direct the company's worldwide legal affairs and serve on the company's Executive Committee. He will join the company on Aug. 3.
"Hew's broad legal background and his proven leadership skills make him the ideal choice as general counsel," said David J. O'Reilly, Chevron chairman and chief executive officer. "He will add tremendous value to our company."
Pate, a long-time partner at Hunton & Williams in Washington, D.C., has headed the firm's Global Competition practice since 2005. Prior to rejoining Hunton & Williams in 2005, Pate served as the assistant attorney general for the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice. He also served as a deputy assistant attorney general in the Antitrust Division, responsible for energy, transportation, and other regulatory matters from 2001 to 2003. In 1999, Pate served as Ewald Distinguished Visiting Professor of Law at the University of Virginia. Earlier in his career, Pate served as a law clerk for U.S. Supreme Court Justice Anthony M. Kennedy, for former Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., and Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III.
"Having worked with Hew during my own tenure at the Justice Department, I can strongly attest to his superior legal acumen and personal integrity," said James. "He is one of our nation's most outstanding lawyers, with a proven track record of handling complex legal and policy issues." 
Pate earned his bachelor's degree from the University of North Carolina and his law degree from the University of Virginia. He is a member of the D.C. and Virginia bars.
Chevron Corporation is one of the world's leading integrated energy companies, with subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company's success is driven by the ingenuity and commitment of approximately 62,000 employees who operate across the energy spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes transportation fuels and other energy products; manufactures and sells petrochemical products; generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides energy efficiency solutions; and develops the energy resources of the future, including biofuels and other renewables. Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif. More information about Chevron is available at www.chevron.com.
