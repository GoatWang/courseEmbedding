The air vent is located on the frame instead of the cushion and disperses air gently downward more in line with natural breathing. Small, Lightweight, and Travel Friendly At 2.3 ounces, this mask will not weigh you down. It has one of the smallest footprints that covers less of the face. The pillows rest gently just under the nose.
 

Ultra-Quiet Almost twice as quiet than the original Swift and 71% quieter than the Swift II. The air vent is located on the frame instead of the cushion and disperses air gently downward more in line with natural breathing.
Small, Lightweight, and Travel Friendly At 2.3 ounces, this mask will not weigh you down. It has one of the smallest footprints that covers less of the face. The pillows rest gently just under the nose. The mask’s frame is half the size of both previous Mirage Swift designs. It folds up for easy travel. The minimal design creates comfort and helps users with better therapy effectiveness and allows for reading or watching TV at bedtime, even with glasses on.
Improved Pillows Pillows now come with a dual-wall design that provides improved stability and comfort. Along with an added flexible pillow base, the cushion allows for movement without breaking the seal. All pillow sizes are interchangeable with the mask frame.
Headgear Unlike any headgear before, the Swift LT uses a patented rotating barrel to adjust the pillow angle. The stability arms expand to accommodate most facial widths including narrow or wide faces.





Nasal Sleep Masks











Selecting the right CPAP Mask is integral in obtaining effective CPAP therapy. CPAP.com offers the largest variety of CPAP masks available on the market, including nasal pillow, nasal and full face masks. Nasal pillow masks feed air directly through your nasal passages and are great for CPAP users who easily become claustrophobic. Nasal masks are triangular in shape and cover the area from the bridge of your nose down to the upper lip.

Nasal pillow masks feed air directly through your nasal passages and are great for CPAP users who easily become claustrophobic. Nasal masks are triangular in shape and cover the area from the bridge of your nose down to the upper lip. Full face masks also extend from the bridge of the nose, but go down to your chin, making them a great option for people who breathe through their mouth while sleeping.
 
Selecting the perfect mask can be difficult. Our CPAP mask return insurance option allows customers to buy the ability to return a CPAP mask, no questions asked within 30 days of its purchase. Many others also like to take advantage of our CPAP mask compare charts which allow you to compare a variety of masks and their features side by side.
 




Sleep Apnea Masks











Sleep apnea (or sleep apnoea in British English;) is a sleep disorder characterized by abnormal pauses in breathing or instances of abnormally low breathing, during sleep. Each pause in breathing, called an apnea, can last from a few seconds to minutes, and may occur 5 to 30 times or more an hour. Similarly, each abnormally low breathing event is called a hypopnea.
 
Sleep apnea is diagnosed with an overnight sleep test called a polysomnogram, or “sleep study”.
There are three forms of sleep apnea: central (CSA), obstructive (OSA), and complex or mixed sleep apnea (i.e., a combination of central and obstructive) constituting 0.4%, 84% and 15% of cases respectively.  In CSA, breathing is interrupted by a lack of respiratory effort; in OSA, breathing is interrupted by a physical block to airflow despite respiratory effort, and snoring is common.
 
Regardless of type, an individual with sleep apnea is rarely aware of having difficulty breathing, even upon awakening.  Sleep apnea is recognized as a problem by others witnessing the individual during episodes or is suspected because of its effects on the body (sequelae). Symptoms may be present for years (or even decades) without identification, during which time the sufferer may become conditioned to the daytime sleepiness and fatigue associated with significant levels of sleep disturbance.
 




What is Sleep Apnea?











CPAP machines blow air at a pressure high enough to keep your airway open during sleep. Modern machines offer therapy tracking software, off grid power options and heated humidification. Machine type is determined by the complexity level of the machines air delivery algorithm. CPAP machines blow one pressure no matter what, APAP machines adjust in a breath by breath basis to your ideal pressure and BiPAP machines blow one inhale and one exhale.
 




CPAP Machine











The VPAP™ Adapt is an adaptive servo-ventilator specifically designed to treat central sleep apnea (CSA) in all its forms while providing quiet and comfortable therapy. The VPAP Adapt algorithm adapts to the patient’s ventilation needs on a breath-by-breath basis, and is synchronized to the patient’s own recent breathing rate and flow pattern to maximize comfort and compliance.
