Rating: 0 -  Write A Review 04585 Tillicum StreetBurnaby, BC V5J 5K9CanadaAbout Viscount Systems Inc.VSI’s MESH™ is a software platform designed for new EDGE, IP and intelligent door entry devices. Other physical security elements (alarm, asset tracking, intercom, sensors, video, elevator control) are also treated as IT appliances. MESH™ creates global networks of users with intelligent devices, managed as a single database and eliminates card access "controller" hardware. Up to 200 door readers connect to and are processed directly on a single server. Benefits include incredible savings on electronics but improved software management and reduced overall cost of ownership.MESH™ API's provide unparalleled flexibility and scalability in deploying large enterprise level systems and expand the scope of traditional card access control to potentially any currently or future available device, reader or sensor. As such, MESH™ is the first of a new generation of systems predicted to drastically alter the definition of what constitutes building security and begin the migration to a unified physical and IT security platform. MESH™ is expected to be the primary future growth driver and area of strategic focus for the Company.Competitors of Viscount Systems Inc.RFI Communications & Security SystemsRFI is a diversified multi-systems integrator since 1979 which has been providing integrated security and fire/life safety solutions.
