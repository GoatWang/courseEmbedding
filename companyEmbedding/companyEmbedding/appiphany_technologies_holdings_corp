IP Risk Control Technologies Unveils Latest Micro Technology Forensics to North America
Jun 6 17
IP Risk Control announced the latest generation of forensic particle used to secure printed products for immediate availability. IP Risk Control has produced print test runs with its dedicated security print partner to confirm the effectiveness of the new forensic particle with all forms of print products and material substrates. This new-generation of forensic particle may be incorporated into the manufacturing process of clear coatings on myriad items which act as a sealer over printed material. Forensic particles are commonly used to tag, track and trace usually high value items throughout a supply chain. Usually, they are not visible to the naked eye and offer survivability to different environmental conditions. IP Risk Controls' forensic particles vary in size depending on application, but are usually between 15 microns in thickness and 75 microns in diameter shaped in a disc-like fashion. For comparison, the width of a human hair is 75 microns and a human blood cell is 5 microns. The solution provided by IP Risk Control offers the ability to print on both sides of the particle which offers the customer significant flexibility customizable to their specific business requirements. One potential use case is printing of a logo on and a PO number on opposing sides of the particle. Detection of the particle is afforded via the aided eye - under a very cost effective small power microscope. The technology can be deployed on any print material such as hangtags, fashion labels, shipping labels or even bulk product source labels.

“When I first saw the ARALOC product and reviewed its architecture with the team, I knew we had a technology winner.  Knowing that it has over 400 active clients and has almost a decade of sales and operations behind it – further validates the market acceptance of the product line,”  states IP Risk Control’s President Jason Remillard.  “Indeed, when multi-billion dollar global organizations rely on it for secure content distribution for their most critical information – renewing their service for years now – we are honored to continue those relationships, build and augment the product functionality and enhance its offerings ongoing.”   “The IP Risk Control team is building an incredible and on-target technology stack that is relevant and highly-required for today's information security requirements,” added Modevity, LLC President and co-Founder Jim Coyne. “Combining ARALOC with functions such as ClassiDocs and other enhancements signifies both a deep understanding of the market and a continued leading data governance and storage management platform which is able to be deeply integrated to the rest of enterprise – for both cloud and hybrid-cloud applications.”

About APHD:
NTEGRATED BRAND PROTECTION
PRIVATE ENTERPRISE AND GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS

IP Risk Control (IPRC) provides private enterprise and governments with total, 
integrated brand protection solutions to prevent revenue loss from 
counterfeiting, product diversion and gray market activities at any and all 
points in the supply chain. IPRC specializes in developing custom solutions 
based on its integrated Digital Forensic Marker™ and Track N’ Trace technologies 
with applications in brand authentication, anti-counterfeiting, loss prevention 
and secure supply chain management.

IPRC principals have more than 15 years collective experience in brand 
protection and supply chain security and have quickly earned an industry 
reputation for innovation in technology integration. With a deep knowledge base, 
robust R&D program and industry leading partners, IPRC has the technological 
resources and financial strength to revolutionize the way corporations protect 
product brands, supply chains and revenues. IPRC’s extensive employee education 
and consumer awareness programs support the effectiveness of the custom 
solutions developed and deployed for clients around the world.

Digital Forensic Markers™ Technology
Validate a product’s brand integrity

IP Risk Control’s (IPRC) brand authentication platform is based on its 
proprietary Digital Forensic Markers™ technology. Brand authentication is the 
science-based process of validating a product’s brand integrity. It 
unequivocally answers the question, genuine or counterfeit? IPRC’s uniquely 
coded Digital Forensic Markers™ provide indisputable proof of authenticity

The Problem
Lost Revenue Streams

Every year, producers of branded fashion, apparel and footwear lose an estimated 
$500 billion in revenues when consumers buy knock off items instead of their 
branded merchandise. Furthermore genuine items diverted and sold in the gray 
market cause even larger revenue losses than knock-offs. When authentic 
merchandise is diverted, brand producers can often end up paying twice.

The Solution
Integrated Authentication


IP Risk Control’s (IPRC) integrated solutions protect producers of branded 
fashion, apparel and footwear every step of the way from the factory floor to 
the retail store. IPRC can provide each item (and its packaging) with a unique 
combination of customized Digital Forensic Markers™ and multi-layer Track ‘N 
Trace technology involving mass serialization coding unique to that specific 
unit to safeguard it at every point in the supply chain.

IPRC’s tamper-proof Digital Forensic Markers™ are invisible and undetectable and 
can be applied to any of the following fashion, apparel and footwear items with 
no impact to either appearance or performance

The Result
Recaptured Revenue Streams

The end result is that producers receive ALL revenue generated by the legitimate 
sale of their branded fashion, apparel

and 
footwear. They are able to authenticate and track merchandise through a secure 
supply chain, denying gray marketers the opportunity to sell authentic products 
on a fraudulent basis.

As anyone in product management will attest to – you tend to follow the news of your competitors. I come across my information via public means mind you, but I do read what Google Alerts tells me.   I was rightly surprised (but inside delighted) to see that in April 2017 Varonis Systems, Inc. (Nasdaq:VRNS) initiated an app in conjunction with the great ecosystem provided by Splunk Inc. (NASDAQ: SPLK).   As I have been within corporate security and their related ecosystems for many years – I never understood why those same ‘security vendors’ didn’t integrate to the rest of the ecosystem. In my opinion, if you are not helping the CISO, CIO, CTO ‘sweat their existing assets’ more and more – you are just yet another bolt on solution that does little other than perhaps deliver on your functionality and create yet another stove pipe silo of information.   That’s why when I started ClassiDocs in 2016 we purpose-built the integration for ANY SIEM to consume our data feeds on a live and ongoing basis – the information is just that valuable to IT and orchestration systems. Indeed, I couldn’t see building anything today that didn’t tie into other (de facto) standards that every customer would have – it really would be negligent as a product in my opinion.   So, I welcome this and other players to the current generation of Security Operations – exposing the largest set of information risks a business has (unstructured datasets) to the platforms that can directly respond and otherwise action the problem – SIEMs in general – IBM, HP, Splunk, AlienVault and others.   I just wonder who will be next to add ransomware detection alerting to SIEM platforms, or governance exceptions to orchestration platforms directly, or structured data classifications, or data at rest performance calculations, or dynamic classifications based on artificial intelligence and end user feedback/training. We’ve been doing all of that and more – since day one.
