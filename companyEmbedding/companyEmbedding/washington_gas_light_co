Their website may just well be the worst on the internet.  My guess is it was designed in 1997.  Its slow, and the bill pay service is archaic. Good luck getting anything of substance from the site.  I have signed up for auto-pay and budget billing multiple times but it never goes into effect.  In addition, I schedule payments and they don't show on the website (although I receive emails stating the payment has been scheduled).  

But with that said, I have had no problems with their service, hence the 2 stars.







Washington Gas,
Your payment options are unbelievably torturous. Your website never works! And your telephone assistance is sub-par, repetitive, annoying, and unproductive. It takes 20 mins to make a payment if you're lucky and don't get hung up on for one mistaken number entered. Please upgrade your services.

                                                   Sincerely.
                                     At my wits end with you!







Why am I not surprised that this terrible company has 1 star?

For the past, two years since I've had WG, every few months they contact me saying they have not received payments. I then have to log on to my account and send screen shots. This is the third time it is happening. Seriously guys, maybe update your technology or get a staff has a brain. #1 reason can't wait to move out of the area so never have to deal with them.







Another one star review! What a horrible company. 

1. The website. Was down for almost a year and then sporadically works. 
2. You cannot autopay you must send a check
3. Phone service... wait on hold and then listen to this lady prattle on about what the company will not or cannot do in a sing song voice over and over again 
4. Moving out: you have to send them PROOF of moving out or they will send you a bill to your NEW address for your OLD address. Does that make any sense whatsoever???

Terrible company!







Literally everyone I have talked to in customer service here had been rude and short tempered. At one point I was literally told that I had missed my appointment because I wasn't home when I in fact took the whole day off to stay at home just for them. The man whom came out to actually turn on my gas was very pleasant though.







Yelp needs a negative star rating... 

Washington Gas customer support people are utterly useless.  Both from calling their support number and e-mailing customersupport@washgas.com.  Took me over a month to finally resolve a billing issue, where the home builder's bill was on my account.  

Over the course of a month, I spoke with several customer support reps and maybe one or two were truly helpful. E-mailing customersupport@washgas.com is even worse. All they do is copy and paste pre-written bullshit and then write some bullshit saying your clarification request is still being processed. Nothing I received by e-mail was ever helpful. 

So pretty much their customer support is useless, cause they have a back office that actually solves the issues. It would seem like issues get lost in translation from customer support to their back office. 

The problem was that someone on the Wash Gas end screwed up when I called before closing to have the account transfer to my name on my requested effective date, which caused the builder's bill to show up in my account. 

Whatever, finally got it resolved. Try to hire some smarter people for your customer support.







Rating systems need to have negative stars for "messed up" circumstances.

When calling for service you have to wait the entire day because they do not give time windows.  If they don't show up then oh, well try again another day.  They are very good at turning your gas off.  Not so much with getting it turned back on.  Some techs call but most don't.  One showed up about two to three days after I called (at a time when no one would be home).  I am literally at the complaining to third parties stage.  Seriously consider going all electric if you have the funds.  I even received a gas delivery charge when my house currently has no gas for about a month.







I haven't even moved into the apartment that requires a Washington Gas account yet, and I can already see that the next year or more of dealing with this is going to be pure, unmitigated hell.

As everyone else has already said, their website is a complete abomination. It astounds me that this company can provide service to such a large area and have zero regard for the necessity of a functional website. To begin with, it is impossible to create the online profile that is required to set up autopay. You can try, as I did, multiple times on multiple days for multiple weeks, and you will continuously get an error message. I emailed their help desk and their response was essentially, "Yes, sorry about that, we've been having technical difficulties. Bye." I responded with something along the lines of, "Ok so I just... don't make an online profile then?" No response.

That was just the beginning.

We just had service started to this apartment (which we haven't actually moved into yet), so I suspected we would have a service initiation fee of some sort. But, strangely enough, when I checked my balance online, it said $0. When I called and tried to pay my balance through the automated system, it also said it was $0. Since we don't live in the apartment yet, we haven't been getting the mail there, so I can't verify whether or not they sent a paper bill. That shouldn't matter, though, because it's 2017 and every establishment in existence is expected to have some type of virtual payment method that prevents you from having to rely on paper statements and send physical checks.

Once I speak to a human, he confirms that I do indeed owe a $15 fee due in six days. Mhm. I ask him how I am supposed to go about paying that seeing as both the website and automated phone payment system think my balance is $0. After informing me that "The problem is not us, ma'am, the problem is the internet," he redirects me to... the same automated number that won't let me pay because it thinks my account balance is $0. Thanks, man!

So I call again. I speak to a second person and explain the issue I'm having. She casually tells me that it's showing up as a $0 balance because I don't have an actual gas bill added to it yet.

"But the $15 is still due on the 13th... and I have to pay it by the 13th?"

"Yes ma'am."

"Can I go ahead and do that then?"

"Hold on while I redirect you to someone who can help you with that." 

BACK TO THE AUTOMATED PAYMENT LINE. 

I call a third time. I speak to a third person. I explain that this is my third time calling and that I have no way to pay the $15 balance I wouldn't even have known about if I hadn't called to ask. She tries to direct me to the automated payment line again. NOPE. NO. ABSOLUTELY NO. THAT'S NOT WORKING. "I'm sorry for the technical issues, ma'am, and I suggest you try the line again in a few hours." NO. DEFINITELY NOT. Reluctantly, she finally tells me she can accept a check over the phone and takes my bank account/routing numbers, which I'm assuming worked because she gave me a confirmation number (only after having me wait and sharing that she, too, was having "technical difficulties.") 

I'm 90% sure she also called me "dude" at some point during this conversation, but I can only hope I misheard her. 

So we're done now. I'm ready to hang up. I have supposedly (we'll find out) paid my balance. Right before saying goodbye, she chimes to me, "Remember that in the future, you can always review your balance and pay your bill online!"

"Well obviously I can't, because it doesn't work-"

"Have a nice day, ma'am, and let me direct you to our quick customer service survey."  

Kill me.







Since no one in customer service seems to be listening to me I have had to go to social media to see if I can get help. I have been waiting over two months to get gas installed in my house. I am converting my oven, water heater and fireplace. I am waiting at my house for the fourth time for someone to install the meter. First and second time no one showed up. Third time they showed up but I need to Airflow to add a piece of equipment. This has been installed so I called and setup an appointment. I called Washington Gas yesterday and got confirmation someone was coming today and I called this morning and they confirmed again. I am now on the phone and have been told that they are not coming. Four days out of work and my window was 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Now my husband will have to be at the house on Friday from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. This is ridiculous. If there was another gas company I could use I would be out of here. Someone high up needs to know that there is no communication with customers, customer service, dispatch and contractors. This is only the tip of the iceberg of what I have been through.







Washington Gas turned off the gas to my house because they were fixing a leak in their system at the street. They left a note on the door at 4 am on Thursday 6/29 saying they had turned off the gas. I don't use the door where they left the note, so I saw it Sat morning 7/1 and called to have the gas turned back on, but was told that Washington Gas doesn't work on weekends so it would be Monday at the earliest that they could turn the gas back on. 

Unbelievable. They can't turn the gas on because Washington Gas technicians don't work weekends. I have been paying my bill on time at this address for 31 years. Now I'm stuck with no hot water or gas to cook with for at least the weekend. Terrible customer service. Especially for a utility that the public depends on.







Without question the worst customer service of any utility or customer focused organization that I have ever dealt with.  You cannot talk to anyone who makes a decision or schedules people.  

Having problems with your meter, they tell you to plan to wait all day.

Want a meter moved, they contract that out to someone and do not plan to get it ever scheduled.

Want to talk to a scheduler for either.  They are not available and the customer service line will tell you they are not allowed to talk to them

When they came to move the meter, they told me I needed a new line from the meter to the street.  This is an expense they need to incur, I have never heard back from them.

Without question, the CEO of Washington Gas should be the next CEO of United Airlines, because they would be my all stars for pathetic approaches to customers.







This place would be a negative if yelp allowed it. As is evidenced by the reviews, wash gas should be investigated by the attorney generals of all three jurisdictions







I hardly ever write reviews but was compelled to add my warnings to the many others about Washington Gas.

METICULOUSLY REVIEW YOUR BILLS!  After my first bill their auto-pay system failed to draft my bank account for the second and subsequent bills.  Since I have never experienced issues before in 17 years of using auto-pay for utilities, I didn't look at the bills posted on my Washington Gas account online.  It wasn't until Washington Gas physically mailed me a disconnect warning that I signed into my account to see what was going on and saw that auto-draft was not working.  My mistake for not assuming they might be incompetent.  Then they added a $65 deposit charge to my next bill since my payment had been considered "late" even though the lateness was due to their auto-pay system failure.  Fine, whatever.

Thereafter, I opted out of auto-pay and manually paid each bill online each month.  Interestingly, the first payment manually made online was reflected in the account payment history and the next bill as expected; but subsequent payments for subsequent bills were not credited to the bills even though they are listed in the account payment history.  They took my money but never credited my account. 

I called Customer Service for an explanation; the representative agreed that she saw the payments but I wasn't getting credited in the bills.  She forwarded the matter to the billing department where they should investigate the issue and have a resolution in 14 days.  I asked why doesn't she just transfer me to that department while I was on the phone so we could resolve it immediately and she responded that they have to follow a process, which takes two weeks to complete.  Wow.

I am moving out of the country in about a week so I imagine that it will be a source of unneeded frustration to collect the $65 deposit and get a resolution to their billing issues while I'm overseas.

I'll leave you with one positive; the Customer Service representatives are courteous and professional despite working with a problematic computer system.  When scheduling a stop date for my service, it literally took the representative over five minutes before she could access my account and over 10 minutes more just to setup the stop service date and forwarding address.  They must be using Tandy computers leftover from 1984 with 300 baud modems to connect to the internet!







The worst company in the world. Put it this way, once they make a mistake on their end, all hell breaks lose. You'll find yourself in stressful situations from constant emails and calls that will get you absolutely nowhere. Managers that say they will help, and nothing happens. Lies and deceitful 'back office' that doesn't communicate with one another. Just a complete nightmare.







Common Sense, where are you?  After being told a technician would be here today between 8 a.m and 1 pm, I called WG at 2;30 to ask where they were.  No one has called, no one has come.  I was told by two different "supervisors" that "Our dispatchers have no way of reaching our technicians once they are out in the field."

Seriously?  I asked, "what if there was an emergency and you had to contact them?"  Again, came the response, "Our dispatchers have NO WAY to reach our technicians once they are out in the field."

Please be on the watch for WG Technicians bouncing about in impenetrable bubbles as they float randomly from place to place.  Catch one if you can.







Based on my experience and those of my neighbors in Georgetown,  Washington Gas is not accountable, transparent, or communicative when it comes to repairing gas lines and related infrastructure above and below our streets.







reported a possible gas leak at 2:30pm and upon follow up at 4:30pm there was no record of the call. After some research found the report. No time estimate possible...
Called back at 8:30pm... no record of call .... submitted another call for leak inspection... 
Again no time estimate possible.... said just call back in 2 hours if no show.... 

Would give no star if possible.....







Their customer services is does not exist.  Their website gives you a phone number, which you them have a computer direct you through recorded answers and it is hard to get someone on the phone.  I had ended my service when I moved out of my apartment, but recently discovered that I was still being charged. I sent in information for a refund and I'm here a month later with no response besides, allow sufficient time for an investigation. A month should be enough time with all the documentation I provided.. still out over $200 of a refund.

and after speaking with someone and letting them know i moved out.. i just got charged again.. this is RIDICULOUS







I would give them zero stars if i could. Worst customer service. 
Ive had the worst experience dealing with washington gas. They took a deposit from me that was supposed to be refunded to me in December 2016. Six months and 20 calls later, I still have not received my deposit.  WG should not be a monopoly. We should be able to choose our gas company!







Literally the worst company I have had the displeasure of trying to work with. I tried to turn on gas in my new house and they said it would take 5 days from the day I called to make that happen. I accepted that and suffered through cold showers and not cooking for the time being. Then comes my Monday appointment, of which they gave me the time frame of 7am-5pm!! I quite literally had to cancel anything I had scheduled for the day, and well yes surprise surprise they did not show up!!! They finally agreed to come out and said it would be around midnight?! Are you joking?? What kind of company is this!! And so alas, I am with no gas going for a week now and still unsure if they will come tomorrow. They can't guarantee a single thing. WORST COMPANY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Their website may just well be the worst on the internet.  My guess is it was designed in 1997.  Its slow, and the bill pay service is archaic. Good luck getting anything of substance from the site.  I have signed up for auto-pay and budget billing multiple times but it never goes into effect.  In addition, I schedule payments and they don't show on the website (although I receive emails stating the payment has been scheduled).  But with that said, I have had no problems with their service, hence the 2 stars.

Washington Gas,Your payment options are unbelievably torturous. Your website never works! And your telephone assistance is sub-par, repetitive, annoying, and unproductive. It takes 20 mins to make a payment if you're lucky and don't get hung up on for one mistaken number entered. Please upgrade your services.                                                   Sincerely.                                     At my wits end with you!

Why am I not surprised that this terrible company has 1 star?For the past, two years since I've had WG, every few months they contact me saying they have not received payments. I then have to log on to my account and send screen shots. This is the third time it is happening. Seriously guys, maybe update your technology or get a staff has a brain. #1 reason can't wait to move out of the area so never have to deal with them.

Another one star review! What a horrible company. 1. The website. Was down for almost a year and then sporadically works. 2. You cannot autopay you must send a check3. Phone service... wait on hold and then listen to this lady prattle on about what the company will not or cannot do in a sing song voice over and over again 4. Moving out: you have to send them PROOF of moving out or they will send you a bill to your NEW address for your OLD address. Does that make any sense whatsoever???Terrible company!

Literally everyone I have talked to in customer service here had been rude and short tempered. At one point I was literally told that I had missed my appointment because I wasn't home when I in fact took the whole day off to stay at home just for them. The man whom came out to actually turn on my gas was very pleasant though.

Yelp needs a negative star rating... Washington Gas customer support people are utterly useless.  Both from calling their support number and e-mailing customersupport@washgas.….  Took me over a month to finally resolve a billing issue, where the home builder's bill was on my account.  Over the course of a month, I spoke with several customer support reps and maybe one or two were truly helpful. E-mailing customersupport@washgas.… is even worse. All they do is copy and paste pre-written bullshit and then write some bullshit saying your clarification request is still being processed. Nothing I received by e-mail was ever helpful. So pretty much their customer support is useless, cause they have a back office that actually solves the issues. It would seem like issues get lost in translation from customer support to their back office. The problem was that someone on the Wash Gas end screwed up when I called before closing to have the account transfer to my name on my requested effective date, which caused the builder's bill to show up in my account. Whatever, finally got it resolved. Try to hire some smarter people for your customer support.

Rating systems need to have negative stars for "messed up" circumstances.When calling for service you have to wait the entire day because they do not give time windows.  If they don't show up then oh, well try again another day.  They are very good at turning your gas off.  Not so much with getting it turned back on.  Some techs call but most don't.  One showed up about two to three days after I called (at a time when no one would be home).  I am literally at the complaining to third parties stage.  Seriously consider going all electric if you have the funds.  I even received a gas delivery charge when my house currently has no gas for about a month.

I haven't even moved into the apartment that requires a Washington Gas account yet, and I can already see that the next year or more of dealing with this is going to be pure, unmitigated hell.As everyone else has already said, their website is a complete abomination. It astounds me that this company can provide service to such a large area and have zero regard for the necessity of a functional website. To begin with, it is impossible to create the online profile that is required to set up autopay. You can try, as I did, multiple times on multiple days for multiple weeks, and you will continuously get an error message. I emailed their help desk and their response was essentially, "Yes, sorry about that, we've been having technical difficulties. Bye." I responded with something along the lines of, "Ok so I just... don't make an online profile then?" No response.That was just the beginning.We just had service started to this apartment (which we haven't actually moved into yet), so I suspected we would have a service initiation fee of some sort. But, strangely enough, when I checked my balance online, it said $0. When I called and tried to pay my balance through the automated system, it also said it was $0. Since we don't live in the apartment yet, we haven't been getting the mail there, so I can't verify whether or not they sent a paper bill. That shouldn't matter, though, because it's 2017 and every establishment in existence is expected to have some type of virtual payment method that prevents you from having to rely on paper statements and send physical checks.Once I speak to a human, he confirms that I do indeed owe a $15 fee due in six days. Mhm. I ask him how I am supposed to go about paying that seeing as both the website and automated phone payment system think my balance is $0. After informing me that "The problem is not us, ma'am, the problem is the internet," he redirects me to... the same automated number that won't let me pay because it thinks my account balance is $0. Thanks, man!So I call again. I speak to a second person and explain the issue I'm having. She casually tells me that it's showing up as a $0 balance because I don't have an actual gas bill added to it yet."But the $15 is still due on the 13th... and I have to pay it by the 13th?""Yes ma'am.""Can I go ahead and do that then?""Hold on while I redirect you to someone who can help you with that." BACK TO THE AUTOMATED PAYMENT LINE. I call a third time. I speak to a third person. I explain that this is my third time calling and that I have no way to pay the $15 balance I wouldn't even have known about if I hadn't called to ask. She tries to direct me to the automated payment line again. NOPE. NO. ABSOLUTELY NO. THAT'S NOT WORKING. "I'm sorry for the technical issues, ma'am, and I suggest you try the line again in a few hours." NO. DEFINITELY NOT. Reluctantly, she finally tells me she can accept a check over the phone and takes my bank account/routing numbers, which I'm assuming worked because she gave me a confirmation number (only after having me wait and sharing that she, too, was having "technical difficulties.") I'm 90% sure she also called me "dude" at some point during this conversation, but I can only hope I misheard her. So we're done now. I'm ready to hang up. I have supposedly (we'll find out) paid my balance. Right before saying goodbye, she chimes to me, "Remember that in the future, you can always review your balance and pay your bill online!""Well obviously I can't, because it doesn't work-""Have a nice day, ma'am, and let me direct you to our quick customer service survey."  Kill me.

Since no one in customer service seems to be listening to me I have had to go to social media to see if I can get help. I have been waiting over two months to get gas installed in my house. I am converting my oven, water heater and fireplace. I am waiting at my house for the fourth time for someone to install the meter. First and second time no one showed up. Third time they showed up but I need to Airflow to add a piece of equipment. This has been installed so I called and setup an appointment. I called Washington Gas yesterday and got confirmation someone was coming today and I called this morning and they confirmed again. I am now on the phone and have been told that they are not coming. Four days out of work and my window was 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Now my husband will have to be at the house on Friday from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. This is ridiculous. If there was another gas company I could use I would be out of here. Someone high up needs to know that there is no communication with customers, customer service, dispatch and contractors. This is only the tip of the iceberg of what I have been through.

Washington Gas turned off the gas to my house because they were fixing a leak in their system at the street. They left a note on the door at 4 am on Thursday 6/29 saying they had turned off the gas. I don't use the door where they left the note, so I saw it Sat morning 7/1 and called to have the gas turned back on, but was told that Washington Gas doesn't work on weekends so it would be Monday at the earliest that they could turn the gas back on. Unbelievable. They can't turn the gas on because Washington Gas technicians don't work weekends. I have been paying my bill on time at this address for 31 years. Now I'm stuck with no hot water or gas to cook with for at least the weekend. Terrible customer service. Especially for a utility that the public depends on.

Without question the worst customer service of any utility or customer focused organization that I have ever dealt with.  You cannot talk to anyone who makes a decision or schedules people.  Having problems with your meter, they tell you to plan to wait all day.Want a meter moved, they contract that out to someone and do not plan to get it ever scheduled.Want to talk to a scheduler for either.  They are not available and the customer service line will tell you they are not allowed to talk to themWhen they came to move the meter, they told me I needed a new line from the meter to the street.  This is an expense they need to incur, I have never heard back from them.Without question, the CEO of Washington Gas should be the next CEO of United Airlines, because they would be my all stars for pathetic approaches to customers.

I hardly ever write reviews but was compelled to add my warnings to the many others about Washington Gas.METICULOUSLY REVIEW YOUR BILLS!  After my first bill their auto-pay system failed to draft my bank account for the second and subsequent bills.  Since I have never experienced issues before in 17 years of using auto-pay for utilities, I didn't look at the bills posted on my Washington Gas account online.  It wasn't until Washington Gas physically mailed me a disconnect warning that I signed into my account to see what was going on and saw that auto-draft was not working.  My mistake for not assuming they might be incompetent.  Then they added a $65 deposit charge to my next bill since my payment had been considered "late" even though the lateness was due to their auto-pay system failure.  Fine, whatever.Thereafter, I opted out of auto-pay and manually paid each bill online each month.  Interestingly, the first payment manually made online was reflected in the account payment history and the next bill as expected; but subsequent payments for subsequent bills were not credited to the bills even though they are listed in the account payment history.  They took my money but never credited my account. I called Customer Service for an explanation; the representative agreed that she saw the payments but I wasn't getting credited in the bills.  She forwarded the matter to the billing department where they should investigate the issue and have a resolution in 14 days.  I asked why doesn't she just transfer me to that department while I was on the phone so we could resolve it immediately and she responded that they have to follow a process, which takes two weeks to complete.  Wow.I am moving out of the country in about a week so I imagine that it will be a source of unneeded frustration to collect the $65 deposit and get a resolution to their billing issues while I'm overseas.I'll leave you with one positive; the Customer Service representatives are courteous and professional despite working with a problematic computer system.  When scheduling a stop date for my service, it literally took the representative over five minutes before she could access my account and over 10 minutes more just to setup the stop service date and forwarding address.  They must be using Tandy computers leftover from 1984 with 300 baud modems to connect to the internet!

You'll find yourself in stressful situations from constant emails and calls that will get you absolutely nowhere. Managers that say they will help, and nothing happens. Lies and deceitful 'back office' that doesn't communicate with one another. Just a complete nightmare.

Common Sense, where are you?  After being told a technician would be here today between 8 a.m and 1 pm, I called WG at 2;30 to ask where they were.  No one has called, no one has come.  I was told by two different "supervisors" that "Our dispatchers have no way of reaching our technicians once they are out in the field."Seriously?  I asked, "what if there was an emergency and you had to contact them?"  Again, came the response, "Our dispatchers have NO WAY to reach our technicians once they are out in the field."Please be on the watch for WG Technicians bouncing about in impenetrable bubbles as they float randomly from place to place.  Catch one if you can.

Based on my experience and those of my neighbors in Georgetown,  Washington Gas is not accountable, transparent, or communicative when it comes to repairing gas lines and related infrastructure above and below our streets.

reported a possible gas leak at 2:30pm and upon follow up at 4:30pm there was no record of the call. After some research found the report. No time estimate possible...Called back at 8:30pm... no record of call .... submitted another call for leak inspection... Again no time estimate possible.... said just call back in 2 hours if no show.... Would give no star if possible.....

Their customer services is does not exist.  Their website gives you a phone number, which you them have a computer direct you through recorded answers and it is hard to get someone on the phone.  I had ended my service when I moved out of my apartment, but recently discovered that I was still being charged. I sent in information for a refund and I'm here a month later with no response besides, allow sufficient time for an investigation. A month should be enough time with all the documentation I provided.. still out over $200 of a refund.and after speaking with someone and letting them know i moved out.. i just got charged again.. this is RIDICULOUS

I would give them zero stars if i could. Worst customer service. Ive had the worst experience dealing with washington gas. They took a deposit from me that was supposed to be refunded to me in December 2016. Six months and 20 calls later, I still have not received my deposit.  WG should not be a monopoly. We should be able to choose our gas company!

Literally the worst company I have had the displeasure of trying to work with. I tried to turn on gas in my new house and they said it would take 5 days from the day I called to make that happen. I accepted that and suffered through cold showers and not cooking for the time being. Then comes my Monday appointment, of which they gave me the time frame of 7am-5pm!! I quite literally had to cancel anything I had scheduled for the day, and well yes surprise surprise they did not show up!!! They finally agreed to come out and said it would be around midnight?! Are you joking?? What kind of company is this!! And so alas, I am with no gas going for a week now and still unsure if they will come tomorrow. They can't guarantee a single thing. WORST COMPANY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

History[edit]




Washington Gas logo


Genesis[edit]
Washington, D.C., was decades slower than some other eastern U.S. cities to move from candles or oil to gas for lighting. Baltimore was first, in 1816; New York City was partially lighted with gas in 1825.[citation needed] In 1840, when a gas company for Washington remained only a proposal, a U.S. Senate document argued for gas' salutary effect on the local economy: "fancy and other stores would introduce this light, and thus add to the cheerfulness of the public ways."[citation needed]
Among the early proponents of gas was James Crutchett, who bought a house north of the Capitol grounds and lit it with gas. This drew the attention of Congress, which voted him $17,500 to light up the Capitol and helped encourage public support for wider use of gas.
A supporter of Crutchett's ideas was Benjamin B. French, Chief Clerk of the House of Representatives, who helped attract other important supporters, including William A. Bradley, the city's postmaster and mayor; John F. Callan, a druggist; his brother Michael P. Callan, a Post Office clerk; hardware merchant William H. Harrover; William H. English, a Treasury clerk who became a Congressman from Indiana and later a Vice-Presidential candidate; and Jacob Bigelow, an attorney and abolitionist who later helped escaped slave Ann Maria Weems.[3]
Two petitions were sent to Congress in April 1848, and on July 8 of that year, lawmakers issued the first Congressional charter for a company that would extract gas from coal.[citation needed] At last, the nation's capital had its first gas company, the Washington Gas Light Company.[4] The company was established on the tenth street of the Foggy Bottom neighborhood, and eventually led to the area's urbanization.[citation needed]
1850-1900[edit]
George Washington Riggs became the president of the company in 1856. Two years later, the company began to build a new, more efficient factory, the West Station Works, between 26th and G Streets NW.
Meanwhile, a new plant was constructed in Foggy Bottom in 1858 at the intersection of New Hampshire and Virginia avenues NW. This location, at the head of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, gave it access to barges carrying coal from West Virginia and Pennsylvania.
These plants changed the neighborhood. Between 1830 and 1860, the percentage of "skilled laborers" in the Foggy Bottom neighborhood declined from 44% to 23%, while the percentage of "unskilled laborers" rose to 44%. [5]
During the American Civil War, coal and transportation grew scarce. “The cost of making gas increased one hundred and twenty-five percent, and another problem appeared when Congress reduced the gas rate seventeen percent.”[6] The company sought help from the Secretary of War and from President Abraham Lincoln, who he wrote to John W. Garrett, president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, asking him to “bring coal to the city and afford the continuation of the necessary gas lighting.”[7] Production levels for gas went down during the Civil War, they soon returned to normal.
In the 1870s, several large holding tanks (gasometers) were erected at the Foggy Bottom site.
In 1878, Thomas Edison introduced the incandescent lamp, a threat to the company.
In 1891, one of the gasometers exploded; the cause was attributed to a large storm.[8]
20th century[edit]
Gas furnaces began to appear in 1915; some remain in use today.[9]
In 1947, the industry expanded to 22 million customers.[10] [11]
The Foggy Bottom plant operated until the 1950s. In 1964, the Washington Gas Light Company sold development rights for the location in a deal that stipulated that the new structure would be supplied exclusively by the company. [12] The last building of the Watergate was completed in 1971.
In 1997, in response to newly deregulated gas and energy markets, Washington Gas formed Washington Gas Resources Corp to serve as a holding company for non-utility subsidiaries. Also in 1997, the company created an unregulated energy company, Washington Gas Energy Services, as a subsidiary of that holding company.[13] Washington Gas Energy Services started with just a handful of customers and as of 2014 had grown into an $8.0 million company. [14]
Present day[edit]
Nineteenth-century traces of the gas company include the Civil War-era aqueduct across Rock Creek Park between the Georgetown and Foggy Bottom neighborhoods.
Gas and electric streetlamps installed by the company can still be found in Georgetown, on the main streets near Virginia and New Hampshire Avenues, and even past Foggy Bottom.
In 2013, the company rebranded itself as WGL with the goal of "being a new kind of energy company: answer-oriented, technology and data driven, responsive and built for the complex energy markets of today and tomorrow".[15] This rebrand included the renaming of Washington Gas Energy Services to WGL Energy and the inclusion of the term "a WGL Company" under the traditional Washington Gas logo.[citation needed] WGL's stock rose 26% over 2016.[16] On January 25, 2017, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Canadian natural gas company AltaGas Ltd. had agreed to acquire WGL Holdings Inc. for $6.4 billion. The deal, subject to various approvals, is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2018.[16]

                     Frequently Asked Questions

                     Answers to common questions. Choose a topic from below:



Who is XOOM Energy?


Read 






XOOM Energy is an independent energy retailer who, through its wholly owned subsidiaries, supplies natural gas, electricity, and renewable energy to residential and commercial customers in deregulated energy markets (product offerings vary by state).









Where does XOOM Energy offer service in the U.S.?


Read 






XOOM Energy has wholly owned subsidiaries offering natural gas and electricity service in 18 states across the U.S. Totaling 80+ utilities – making XOOM Energy one of the largest energy retailers in the country.









Is my electricity or natural gas service ever at risk by enrolling with XOOM Energy?


Read 






No.  You are never at risk of not having service by enrolling with XOOM Energy.  XOOM Energy is required to post collateral with each utility, and in the unlikely event XOOM Energy was not able to service your account, the utility would procure and deliver energy to your home or business on XOOM Energy's behalf.









What is an energy supplier?


Read 






An energy supplier is a company that acquires its electricity, renewable energy or natural gas supplies from the wholesale market and is licensed to sell it retail to homes and business.   Wholesale energy supply sources include much of the same source that the utility will use, such as electricity generators or the open market.  An energy supplier is not your local utility. The utility still operates the local distribution wires and pipes which carry electricity and natural gas through its territory and to homes or businesses. An energy supplier purchases and supplies energy, the local utility, delivers the energy to your home.









What utilities does XOOM Energy service in Maryland?


Read 






Currently, XOOM Energy Maryland, LLC supplies electricity and/or natural gas in the Baltimore Gas and Electric territories. XOOM Energy also supplies electricity in Pepco (excluding the DC area), First Energy Potomac Edison and the Delmarva territory, as well as natural gas service in the Washington Gas Light territory.









What is energy deregulation?


Read 






Energy deregulation has been around for more than two decades in certain states and is designed to ensure consumers have access to adequate and competitively priced energy supplies.  While your local utility is still responsible for maintaining the wires, pipes and infrastructure that make up the distribution system, reading your meter and responding to emergencies, the utility no longer holds a monopoly on the energy service. Customers have the ability to choose from multiple competitive retailers that offer various service plans at competing rates.









Will I be switching utilities?


Read 






No. Your local utility will remain the same and will continue to deliver energy to your home or business just like they did when you bought the energy supply from them.









What is the prevailing variable rate in my market?


Read 






XOOM Energy will post on its website your rate for your next billing period at least twelve days prior to the close of your billing period. You canaccess your rate for your next billing period by visiting the XOOM Energy Maryland website at: http://xoomenergy.com/en/maryland-variable-rates









Will my service be interrupted when I switch service suppliers?


Read 






No. You are never at risk for service disruptions for switching to XOOM Energy. In fact, you will see no difference in the service you are receiving. The only change will be in your billing, where you will be billed according to the service plan you selected.









Are there monthly fees?


Read 






All fees are outlined and explained in the Terms and Conditions that accompany each service plan.









What is the difference between fixed and variable rate plans?


Read 






A fixed rate plan provides you with stability and peace of mind. A fixed rate product may be higher or lower than utility rates, but, unlike utility rates, a fixed rate product will not change during the life of your contract. You are protected against unexpected and costly price increases and have greater control over the cost of your energy.   A variable rate plan allows you to purchase energy at market-based prices that change from month to month. While a variable rate is subject to monthly price increases or decreases, it may help you realize the lowest possible cost in the market. However, it also exposes you to possible price increases, and, unlike a fixed rate, a variable rate does not protect you against price volatility.  This may be higher or lower than the utility rate.









Why do I have to pay a cost recovery fee if I cancel?


Read 






For XOOM Energy to offer and fulfill its term obligation to you, we have to purchase energy in advance of usage to cover the entire length of your contract.  If you cancel your contract early, XOOM Energy needs to offset the cost of selling the unused portion of your energy to others. The cost recovery fee covers this cost and any other expenses we incur because of your cancellation.









When will my service become effective with XOOM Energy?


Read 






XOOM Energy service will typically commence on your meter read date immediately following your successful enrollment in our program, meaning it may take 30-45 days.









How will I be billed?


Read 






You will receive your bill directly from the utility.  XOOM Energy supply charges will appear along with your utility service and delivery charges.

Can I upgrade to a different program?


Read 






Some of XOOM Energy's service plan contracts, but not all, allow you to switch to another service plan contract within the term of the contract, so you need to read carefully and understand the service plan contract you select.









What is renewable energy?


Read 






Renewable energy is energy produced from sources that have less of a negative impact on the environment compared to fossil fuels.









What are the advantages of renewable energy?


Read 






Green energy can supply a significant proportion of the country’s energy needs, which has many benefits such as, environmental improvement, an increase of fuel diversity and regional economic development.

These disclosure labels are often limited to the system mix and for those enrolled in a renewable energy program, they may not include the additional, voluntary, renewable energy associated with your product.









Why does renewable energy cost more?

Renewable energy costs more than traditional energy due to limited resources and availability of renewable energy at this time.









What happens if I move?


Read 






If you plan to move to an area where XOOM Energy offers service, just contact us at least 15 days before your move, and we will attempt to transfer your service to your new location.

Read 






To offer you competitive rates XOOM Energy purchases its renewable energy from various energy vendors.









Can a customer switch from a Standard Product to a Renewable Energy Product?


Read 






Yes, customers can switch from a standard variable plan to a fixed renewable product, if offered.









How does XOOM Energy reduce my energy costs?


Read 






XOOM Energy cannot guarantee savings because each of our service plans offers a unique value proposition. Fixed rate service plans are an excellent way to lock in your rate in for the long haul and avoid price fluctuations. Your pricing remains steady, providing you with consistency and peace of mind. Variable rate plans are based on market conditions and priced on a monthly basis. If you're not looking for a long-term contract and enjoy the flexibility of market-based rates, this is the service plan for you.









What sets us apart from other energy suppliers?


Read 






We offer innovative plans at competitive rates, combined with excellent customer service. We keep it simple and straightforward. This all adds up to a great value.









How does XOOM Energy provide renewable energy above and beyond what is required by law?


Read 






XOOM Energy purchases Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) on behalf of our voluntary green customers.  An REC represents the property rights to the environmental, social, and other nonpower qualities of renewable electricity generation.  RECs provide flexibility in procuring green power across a diverse geographical area and applying the renewable attributes to the electricity use at a facility of choice.  This flexibility allows organizations to support renewable energy development and protect the environment when green power products are not locally available.  RECs can be generated from a variety of renewable sources, including but not limited to solar, wind and hydro.









What are Carbon Offsets (Carbon Free Energy)?


Read 






Carbon offsets are evidence that special actions have kept excess greenhouse gases out of the air. Offsets prove that real, quantifiable and beyond "business-as-usual" measures have in fact already reduced emissions by a specific amount. Used to counteract or "offset" the greenhouse gases that result from often unavoidable everyday activities, most carbon offsets are certified to meet high standards for environmental integrity as well as consumer protection.









How do carbon offsets make a difference?


Read 






Each offset means that one metric ton (about 2,200 pounds) of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases didn't escape into the air. Instead, specific actions have prevented, avoided or stored this metric ton of emissions.









How does using natural gas affect my carbon footprint?


Read 






Bundling your natural gas with U.S.-sourced carbon offsets that represent real improvements in air and water quality has an impact in reducing your carbon footprint.









Can a customer switch from a Standard Product to a Carbon Free Energy Product?


Read 






Yes, customers can switch from a variable standard plan to a variable carbon-free plan or a fixed carbon-free product, if offered.









Why is XOOM Energy only offering carbon-free products in certain markets?


Read 






XOOM Energy provides specific products offerings in each market based on customer demand and feedback.

Before HAYNSWORTH, Chief Judge, MURRAH, Senior Circuit Judge,* and CRAVEN, Circuit Judge.
CRAVEN, Circuit Judge:


1
This is an appeal from a decision of the district court holding certain practices of the Virginia Electric and Power Company (VEPCO) to be per se violations of Section I of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1, and also violations of Section 3 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 14. Two issues are presented to us either of which may be decisive of the appeal. One is whether the complained of practices by VEPCO are "state action" and therefore exempt from the purview of federal antitrust legislation. Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 63 S. Ct. 307, 87 L. Ed. 315 (1943). The other is whether VEPCO sold only one product, electricity, so as to take the case out of the tiein doctrine of Fortner Enterprises, Inc. v. United States Steel Corporation, 394 U.S. 495, 89 S. Ct. 1252, 22 L. Ed. 2d 495 (1969). We decide both issues in favor of VEPCO and reverse.

I.

2
VEPCO is a state regulated utility supplying electricity to areas of Virginia also served by the plaintiff gas utility, Washington Gas Light Company. Prior to 1960, practically all residences served by VEPCO obtained electrical power through overhead distribution lines. These lines were relatively inexpensive to install and were provided by VEPCO at no charge to new home builders. Early in the 1960's installation of underground service lines became increasingly popular. Until 1963, VEPCO agreed to install "underground residential distribution" (URD) lines instead of the common overhead variety if the builder agreed to pay the additional expenses involved, usually amounting to a sum around $280.


3
In 1963 VEPCO began the first in a series of all-electric house plans designed to make it more attractive for the builder to install electric appliances in their new homes to the exclusion of the competing utility — natural gas. Washington Gas Light Company complains that these programs violated the Sherman and Clayton Acts. The district court's findings reveal that the first plans offered URD installation free of charge if the builder went "all electric," or at a substantially reduced rate if he went all electric except for heating and provided his own trenching and backfilling.


4
The state legislature in 1966 by statutory amendment specifically required Virginia's utility regulatory body, the State Corporation Commission (SCC), to investigate the "promotional allowances and practices of public utilities and [to] * * * take such action as such investigation may indicate to be in the public interest."1 After the Commission's subsequent disapproval of the earlier VEPCO plans, new programs were instituted giving credit on URD installation based on anticipated electrical usage. The anticipated consumption was computed through tables listing annual kilowatt hours used by various home appliances. The larger the estimated usage, the larger the credit against URD installation charges. The practical effect of going all electric under the new plan was the same as under the old — the credit given for residences going "all electric" was usually sufficient to cover the entire cost of URD installation. Subsequently, VEPCO's base installation charges were considerably reduced and remained in effect until March of 1970 when the lower court's prohibition became effective.2


5
The result of VEPCO's installation campaign was that significant inroads were made into areas previously dominated by the use of natural gas — home heating, water heating, and cooking.


6
The district court found the VEPCO plans per se violations of Section I of the Sherman Act as illegal "tying arrangements" and also violations of Section 3 of the Clayton Act as exclusive dealing arrangements without consideration of the Parker, supra, exemption. It is urged upon us that since the district court did not consider the application of Parker, neither should we. Desert Palace, Inc. v. Salisbury, 401 F.2d 320, 323-324 (7th Cir. 1968). We think the rigid application of such a rule of procedure is inappropriate where the record provides an adequate basis for consideration on the merits. As the Supreme Court stated in Hormel v. Helvering, 312 U.S. 552, 557, 61 S. Ct. 719, 721, 85 L. Ed. 1037 (1941):


7
Rules of practice and procedure are devised to promote the ends of justice, not to defeat them. A rigid and undeviating judicially declared practice under which courts of review would invariably and under all circumstances decline to consider all questions which had not previously been specifically urged would be out of harmony with this policy. Orderly rules of procedure do not require sacrifice of the rules of fundamental justice.


8
Accord, Dudley v. Inland Mutual Insurance Co., 299 F.2d 637 (4th Cir. 1962). Indeed, if deemed necessary to reach the correct result, an appellate court may sua sponte consider points not presented to the district court and not even raised on appeal by any party. See, e. g., United States v. Continental Can Co., 378 U.S. 441, 457, 470, 84 S. Ct. 1738, 12 L. Ed. 2d 953 (1964). In Parker the Court held a 1940 California raisin marketing program conducted by a state commission permissible even assuming the action would have been violative of the antitrust laws had the same plan been adopted by private individuals operating outside the state's direction.


9
We find nothing in the language of the Sherman Act or in its history which suggests that its purpose was to restrain a state or its officers or agents from activities directed by its legislature. * * * [I]t is the state, acting through the Commission, which adopts the program and which enforces it with penal sanctions, in the execution of a governmental policy.


10
317 U.S. at 350-352, 63 S.Ct. at 313-314.


11
To find shelter under Parker, the acts complained of must be the result of state action, either by state officials or by private individuals "under the active supervision" of the state, Allstate Insurance Company v. Lanier, 361 F.2d 870, 872 (4th Cir. 1966),3 although proposals may originate privately if their execution depends on state regulation or actual state implementation. Parker, supra, 317 U.S. at 352, 63 S.Ct. at 307.


12
The teaching of Parker v. Brown is that the antitrust laws are directed against individual and not state action. When a state has a public policy against free competition in an industry important to it, the state may regulate that industry in order to control or, in a proper case, to eliminate competition therein. It may even permit persons subject to such control to participate in the regulation, provided their activities are adequately supervised by independent state officials.


13
Asheville Tobacco Board of Trade, Inc. v. FTC, 263 F.2d 502, 509 (4th Cir. 1959).


14
If the exemption is to be applied to a regulated industry, such as a state utility, then it can extend only to those activities which fall under state supervision. See Wainwright v. National Dairy Products, Corp., 304 F. Supp. 567, 574-575 (N.D.Ga.1969). The regulatory agency must be a creature of the state and not one whose activities are governed by private agreement without any real state control. Sun Valley Disposal Co. v. Silver State Disposal Co., 420 F.2d 341, 342 (9th Cir. 1969); E. W. Wiggins Airways, Inc. v. Massachusetts Port Authority, 362 F.2d 52, 55 (1st Cir. 1966); Allstate Insurance Co. v. Lanier, supra.


15
The Virginia State Corporation Commission is without question a proper state agency to qualify under Parker. Section 155 of the Virginia State Constitution makes explicit provision for the SCC giving it the power, among other things, to prescribe utility rates and, subject to the authority of the state legislature, to regulate other non-specified corporate utility activities. Sections of the Virginia Code provide a detailed system of regulatory powers and procedures whereby administrative action may be taken and reviewed with respect to "rates, tolls, charges, schedules," etc.4


16
There can be no doubt, and in fact Washington Gas Light does not argue to the contrary, that the SCC is a regulatory arm of the state, possessing both the authority and powers necessary to qualify under Parker. Instead, the gas company argues that even though the SCC was aware of VEPCO's URD activities before 1966, it made no investigations and gave no affirmative approval (or disapproval) of the VEPCO plans, and that VEPCO's conduct was therefore "individual" and not "state" action. The argument is not without merit but the conclusion is not inevitable unless one equates administrative silence with abandonment of administrative duty. It is just as sensible to infer that silence means consent, i. e., approval. Indeed, the latter inference seems the more likely one when we remember that even the gas company concedes that the SCC possessed adequate regulatory powers to stop VEPCO if it chose to do so, and that eventually SCC spoke affirmatively and first modified and finally ended the promotional practices upon which the suit was based. The antitrust laws are a poor substitute, we think, for plaintiff's failure to promptly protest to the SCC and to seek the administrative remedy ultimately shown to have been available and effective. We think VEPCO's promotional practices were at all times within the ambit of regulation and under the control of SCC, and we hold these practices exempt from the application of the laws of antitrust under the Parker doctrine.

II.

17
"There is, at the outset of every tie-in case, including the familiar cases involving physical goods, the problem of determining whether two separate products are in fact involved." Fortner Enterprises v. United States Steel Corporation, 394 U.S. 495, 507, 89 S. Ct. 1252, 1260, 22 L. Ed. 2d 495 (1969).


18
Alternatively, we rest our decision upon the very difficult determination of this ultimate question of fact. In Fortner five members of the Supreme Court concluded that the extension of credit on favorable terms for the purchase of real property in an amount totaling over two million dollars by a wholly owned subsidiary of the United States Steel Corporation was a separate tying product resulting in compulsion to buy prefabricated buildings (to be erected on the purchased property) from United States Steel. Although the Court did not lay down any general test for finding two products in a given case, it did discuss various factors which may have entered into the decision, including these:


19
1. The credit offered and the prefabricated buildings were each supplied by a separate corporation.5


20
2. The tied product (prefabricated buildings) were sold at an artificially high price — some $400 more than a competitive product of similar quality.


21
3. The credit obtained was in excess of that needed to purchase the desired real property, and included enough to finance the artificially inflated cost of prefabricated houses.


22
4. The loans totaling over two million dollars could not be obtained on any terms unless the prefabricated homes were bought exclusively from United States Steel Corporation.


23
5. The price of the tied product, prefabricated buildings, was not a regulated price, and United States Steel was as free to further its market penetration by price reduction as by offering uniquely advantageous credit.


24
It seems to us that VEPCO sold only one product — electricity. The delivery of that product has always been an ancillary and necessary part of the business of producing and selling electrical power. This was simply a new method of delivery but paid for in the old way, i. e., "free" to the customer. There was no separate market for the installation of underground wiring as there was a separate market for credit in Fortner. That there are not dual markets strongly suggests there are not separate products. See Times-Picayune Publishing Co. v. United States, 345 U.S. 594, 614, 73 S. Ct. 872, 97 L. Ed. 1277 (1953).


25
Even in Fortner, four members of the Court thought that United States Steel was selling one product, namely prefabricated buildings, and that the provision of credit on a large scale to finance the purchase of land (not just the buildings) was simply an ancillary service in connection with making the sale. The dissenters noted that


26
[a]lmost all modern selling involves providing some ancillary services in connection with making the sale — delivery, installation, supplying fixtures, servicing, * * *. Customarily — indeed almost invariably — the seller offers these ancillary services only in connection with the sale of his own products, and they are often offered without cost or at bargain rates.


27
394 U.S. at 525, 89 S.Ct. at 1270. (Emphasis added.)


28
Unlike United States Steel's inflated price of the tied product (prefabricated homes) VEPCO's rates for home heating and consumption of electricity, although higher than the rates for gas which would do the same job, were not arbitrarily inflated but had been approved by the Corporation Commission. There was nothing "artificial" about the price of electricity as there was with respect to the price of the prefabricated homes.


29
Finally, the ultimate effect of the Fortner type monopoly was to sell the tied prefabricated homes at an artificial inflated price in a market where the same identical prefabricated houses of similar quality could have been obtained by the consumer at a cost $400 cheaper. Washington Gas' competing product is not identical or even necessarily of the same quality in the subjective sense. Some consumers may prefer electricity despite the greater heating efficiency of gas. Some may not want to be bothered with two monthly bills from two different companies and two problems of maintenance and repair of two different systems. Electricity is simply different from gas and may be subjectively preferred by a consumer despite its higher cost and the latter's greater efficiency. Whether such a preference, if it exists, is a permissible one in our economy can better be determined by the expertise of a regulatory agency than random application of antitrust laws.


30
In Gas Light Co. of Columbus v. Georgia Power Co., 313 F. Supp. 860, 869 (M.D.Ga.1970), Judge Elliott considered and discussed the decision below in this case:


31
The curious thing about the opinion is the Court's assumption that underground residential distribution and electricity are two separate products, so that one can be tied to the other as computer cards were tied to IBM machines in International Business Machines Corp. v. United States, 298 U.S. 131, 56 S. Ct. 701, 80 L. Ed. 1085 (1936). To my mind, Underground Residential Distribution is merely a method by which a product — electricity — is delivered to the consumer. It might be compared to a department store's delivery of merchandise bought by a customer living fifteen miles out in the country — if that customer bought a single necktie it is doubtful the store would treat the delivery the same way it would if the customer bought a wardrobe. Underground Residential Distribution is ancillary to both the seller and buyer of the product, in much the same way as a free meal given to an airline passenger is ancillary to the sale of an airline ticket. Therefore, it is difficult to see how there could be a separate tying product in the commercial sense, or how such a case could be fit within the tying clause concept.


32
With the greatest respect for the decision of the district judge, we nevertheless think that his ultimate finding of fact that there were two separate products was clearly erroneous and mistaken.


33
We suggest that the rationale and underlying purpose of both the Sherman and Clayton Acts is to prevent monopoly where it is not in the public interest. It has long since been established that both gas and electricity can best be produced and distributed (and the public benefited) by monopoly under state regulation. The problem here is not one of preventing monopoly as in Fortner, but of making lawful monopoly work best in the public interest. Doubtless, we think, SCC can do a better job than private piecemeal application of laws aimed against monopoly.


34
Reversed.

 Va.Code Ann. § 56-247 (1969)


2
 In April of 1970 the SCC issued an order prohibiting all promotional allowances of utilities, but allowed commitments made under prior plans to be fulfilled. Thus our decision is of no great consequence for the future. Presumably VEPCO has discontinued the practices which are the basis for this suit

 § 56-235. When Commission may fix rates, schedules, etc. — If upon investigation the rates, tolls, charges, schedules, or joint rates of any public utility operating in this State shall be found to be unjust, unreasonable, insufficient or unjustly discriminatory or to be preferential or otherwise in violation of any of the provisions of law, the State Corporation Commission shall have power to fix and order substituted therefor such rate or rates, tolls, charges or schedules as shall be just and reasonable. (Code 1919, § 4071.)
§ 56-236. Public utilities required to file, etc., schedules of rates and charges; rules and regulations. — Every public utility shall be required to file with the Commission and to keep open to public inspection schedules showing rates and charges, either for itself, or joint rates and charges between itself and any other public utility. Every public utility shall file with, and as a part of, such schedules, copies of all rules and regulations that in any manner affect the rates charged or to be charged.

§ 56-247. Commission may change regulations, measurements, practices, services, or acts. — If upon investigation it shall be found that any regulation, measurement, practice, act or service of any public utility complained of is unjust, unreasonable, insufficient, preferential, unjustly discriminatory or otherwise in violation of law or if it be found that any service is inadequate or that any reasonable service cannot be obtained, the Commission may substitute therefor such other regulations, measurements, practices, service or acts and make such order respecting, and such changes in, such regulations, measurements, practices, service or acts as shall be just and reasonable.
The Commission shall investigate the promotional allowances and practices of public utilities and shall take such action as such investigation may indicate to be in the public interest. (Code 1919, § 4072; 1966, c. 552.)


5
 394 U.S. at 507, 89 S. Ct. 1252
The Court recognized that in some situations a credit offer may be legitimately connected with the sale of a product as "an inseparable part" of the transaction. But it distinguished the Fortner transaction as clearly involving two products because of two facts: the loan and the tied goods were sold by separate corporations, and the loan was for an amount larger than that needed to pay the seller of the tied product.

Their website may just well be the worst on the internet.  My guess is it was designed in 1997.  Its slow, and the bill pay service is archaic. Good luck getting anything of substance from the site.  I have signed up for auto-pay and budget billing multiple times but it never goes into effect.  In addition, I schedule payments and they don't show on the website (although I receive emails stating the payment has been scheduled).  

But with that said, I have had no problems with their service, hence the 2 stars.







Washington Gas,
Your payment options are unbelievably torturous. Your website never works! And your telephone assistance is sub-par, repetitive, annoying, and unproductive. It takes 20 mins to make a payment if you're lucky and don't get hung up on for one mistaken number entered. Please upgrade your services.

                                                   Sincerely.
                                     At my wits end with you!







Why am I not surprised that this terrible company has 1 star?

For the past, two years since I've had WG, every few months they contact me saying they have not received payments. I then have to log on to my account and send screen shots. This is the third time it is happening. Seriously guys, maybe update your technology or get a staff has a brain. #1 reason can't wait to move out of the area so never have to deal with them.







Another one star review! What a horrible company. 

1. The website. Was down for almost a year and then sporadically works. 
2. You cannot autopay you must send a check
3. Phone service... wait on hold and then listen to this lady prattle on about what the company will not or cannot do in a sing song voice over and over again 
4. Moving out: you have to send them PROOF of moving out or they will send you a bill to your NEW address for your OLD address. Does that make any sense whatsoever???

Terrible company!







Literally everyone I have talked to in customer service here had been rude and short tempered. At one point I was literally told that I had missed my appointment because I wasn't home when I in fact took the whole day off to stay at home just for them. The man whom came out to actually turn on my gas was very pleasant though.







Yelp needs a negative star rating... 

Washington Gas customer support people are utterly useless.  Both from calling their support number and e-mailing customersupport@washgas.com.  Took me over a month to finally resolve a billing issue, where the home builder's bill was on my account.  

Over the course of a month, I spoke with several customer support reps and maybe one or two were truly helpful. E-mailing customersupport@washgas.com is even worse. All they do is copy and paste pre-written bullshit and then write some bullshit saying your clarification request is still being processed. Nothing I received by e-mail was ever helpful. 

So pretty much their customer support is useless, cause they have a back office that actually solves the issues. It would seem like issues get lost in translation from customer support to their back office. 

The problem was that someone on the Wash Gas end screwed up when I called before closing to have the account transfer to my name on my requested effective date, which caused the builder's bill to show up in my account. 

Whatever, finally got it resolved. Try to hire some smarter people for your customer support.







Rating systems need to have negative stars for "messed up" circumstances.

When calling for service you have to wait the entire day because they do not give time windows.  If they don't show up then oh, well try again another day.  They are very good at turning your gas off.  Not so much with getting it turned back on.  Some techs call but most don't.  One showed up about two to three days after I called (at a time when no one would be home).  I am literally at the complaining to third parties stage.  Seriously consider going all electric if you have the funds.  I even received a gas delivery charge when my house currently has no gas for about a month.







I haven't even moved into the apartment that requires a Washington Gas account yet, and I can already see that the next year or more of dealing with this is going to be pure, unmitigated hell.

As everyone else has already said, their website is a complete abomination. It astounds me that this company can provide service to such a large area and have zero regard for the necessity of a functional website. To begin with, it is impossible to create the online profile that is required to set up autopay. You can try, as I did, multiple times on multiple days for multiple weeks, and you will continuously get an error message. I emailed their help desk and their response was essentially, "Yes, sorry about that, we've been having technical difficulties. Bye." I responded with something along the lines of, "Ok so I just... don't make an online profile then?" No response.

That was just the beginning.

We just had service started to this apartment (which we haven't actually moved into yet), so I suspected we would have a service initiation fee of some sort. But, strangely enough, when I checked my balance online, it said $0. When I called and tried to pay my balance through the automated system, it also said it was $0. Since we don't live in the apartment yet, we haven't been getting the mail there, so I can't verify whether or not they sent a paper bill. That shouldn't matter, though, because it's 2017 and every establishment in existence is expected to have some type of virtual payment method that prevents you from having to rely on paper statements and send physical checks.

Once I speak to a human, he confirms that I do indeed owe a $15 fee due in six days. Mhm. I ask him how I am supposed to go about paying that seeing as both the website and automated phone payment system think my balance is $0. After informing me that "The problem is not us, ma'am, the problem is the internet," he redirects me to... the same automated number that won't let me pay because it thinks my account balance is $0. Thanks, man!

So I call again. I speak to a second person and explain the issue I'm having. She casually tells me that it's showing up as a $0 balance because I don't have an actual gas bill added to it yet.

"But the $15 is still due on the 13th... and I have to pay it by the 13th?"

"Yes ma'am."

"Can I go ahead and do that then?"

"Hold on while I redirect you to someone who can help you with that." 

BACK TO THE AUTOMATED PAYMENT LINE. 

I call a third time. I speak to a third person. I explain that this is my third time calling and that I have no way to pay the $15 balance I wouldn't even have known about if I hadn't called to ask. She tries to direct me to the automated payment line again. NOPE. NO. ABSOLUTELY NO. THAT'S NOT WORKING. "I'm sorry for the technical issues, ma'am, and I suggest you try the line again in a few hours." NO. DEFINITELY NOT. Reluctantly, she finally tells me she can accept a check over the phone and takes my bank account/routing numbers, which I'm assuming worked because she gave me a confirmation number (only after having me wait and sharing that she, too, was having "technical difficulties.") 

I'm 90% sure she also called me "dude" at some point during this conversation, but I can only hope I misheard her. 

So we're done now. I'm ready to hang up. I have supposedly (we'll find out) paid my balance. Right before saying goodbye, she chimes to me, "Remember that in the future, you can always review your balance and pay your bill online!"

"Well obviously I can't, because it doesn't work-"

"Have a nice day, ma'am, and let me direct you to our quick customer service survey."  

Kill me.







Since no one in customer service seems to be listening to me I have had to go to social media to see if I can get help. I have been waiting over two months to get gas installed in my house. I am converting my oven, water heater and fireplace. I am waiting at my house for the fourth time for someone to install the meter. First and second time no one showed up. Third time they showed up but I need to Airflow to add a piece of equipment. This has been installed so I called and setup an appointment. I called Washington Gas yesterday and got confirmation someone was coming today and I called this morning and they confirmed again. I am now on the phone and have been told that they are not coming. Four days out of work and my window was 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Now my husband will have to be at the house on Friday from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. This is ridiculous. If there was another gas company I could use I would be out of here. Someone high up needs to know that there is no communication with customers, customer service, dispatch and contractors. This is only the tip of the iceberg of what I have been through.







Washington Gas turned off the gas to my house because they were fixing a leak in their system at the street. They left a note on the door at 4 am on Thursday 6/29 saying they had turned off the gas. I don't use the door where they left the note, so I saw it Sat morning 7/1 and called to have the gas turned back on, but was told that Washington Gas doesn't work on weekends so it would be Monday at the earliest that they could turn the gas back on. 

Unbelievable. They can't turn the gas on because Washington Gas technicians don't work weekends. I have been paying my bill on time at this address for 31 years. Now I'm stuck with no hot water or gas to cook with for at least the weekend. Terrible customer service. Especially for a utility that the public depends on.







Without question the worst customer service of any utility or customer focused organization that I have ever dealt with.  You cannot talk to anyone who makes a decision or schedules people.  

Having problems with your meter, they tell you to plan to wait all day.

Want a meter moved, they contract that out to someone and do not plan to get it ever scheduled.

Want to talk to a scheduler for either.  They are not available and the customer service line will tell you they are not allowed to talk to them

When they came to move the meter, they told me I needed a new line from the meter to the street.  This is an expense they need to incur, I have never heard back from them.

Without question, the CEO of Washington Gas should be the next CEO of United Airlines, because they would be my all stars for pathetic approaches to customers.







This place would be a negative if yelp allowed it. As is evidenced by the reviews, wash gas should be investigated by the attorney generals of all three jurisdictions







I hardly ever write reviews but was compelled to add my warnings to the many others about Washington Gas.

METICULOUSLY REVIEW YOUR BILLS!  After my first bill their auto-pay system failed to draft my bank account for the second and subsequent bills.  Since I have never experienced issues before in 17 years of using auto-pay for utilities, I didn't look at the bills posted on my Washington Gas account online.  It wasn't until Washington Gas physically mailed me a disconnect warning that I signed into my account to see what was going on and saw that auto-draft was not working.  My mistake for not assuming they might be incompetent.  Then they added a $65 deposit charge to my next bill since my payment had been considered "late" even though the lateness was due to their auto-pay system failure.  Fine, whatever.

Thereafter, I opted out of auto-pay and manually paid each bill online each month.  Interestingly, the first payment manually made online was reflected in the account payment history and the next bill as expected; but subsequent payments for subsequent bills were not credited to the bills even though they are listed in the account payment history.  They took my money but never credited my account. 

I called Customer Service for an explanation; the representative agreed that she saw the payments but I wasn't getting credited in the bills.  She forwarded the matter to the billing department where they should investigate the issue and have a resolution in 14 days.  I asked why doesn't she just transfer me to that department while I was on the phone so we could resolve it immediately and she responded that they have to follow a process, which takes two weeks to complete.  Wow.

I am moving out of the country in about a week so I imagine that it will be a source of unneeded frustration to collect the $65 deposit and get a resolution to their billing issues while I'm overseas.

I'll leave you with one positive; the Customer Service representatives are courteous and professional despite working with a problematic computer system.  When scheduling a stop date for my service, it literally took the representative over five minutes before she could access my account and over 10 minutes more just to setup the stop service date and forwarding address.  They must be using Tandy computers leftover from 1984 with 300 baud modems to connect to the internet!







The worst company in the world. Put it this way, once they make a mistake on their end, all hell breaks lose. You'll find yourself in stressful situations from constant emails and calls that will get you absolutely nowhere. Managers that say they will help, and nothing happens. Lies and deceitful 'back office' that doesn't communicate with one another. Just a complete nightmare.







Common Sense, where are you?  After being told a technician would be here today between 8 a.m and 1 pm, I called WG at 2;30 to ask where they were.  No one has called, no one has come.  I was told by two different "supervisors" that "Our dispatchers have no way of reaching our technicians once they are out in the field."

Seriously?  I asked, "what if there was an emergency and you had to contact them?"  Again, came the response, "Our dispatchers have NO WAY to reach our technicians once they are out in the field."

Please be on the watch for WG Technicians bouncing about in impenetrable bubbles as they float randomly from place to place.  Catch one if you can.







Based on my experience and those of my neighbors in Georgetown,  Washington Gas is not accountable, transparent, or communicative when it comes to repairing gas lines and related infrastructure above and below our streets.







reported a possible gas leak at 2:30pm and upon follow up at 4:30pm there was no record of the call. After some research found the report. No time estimate possible...
Called back at 8:30pm... no record of call .... submitted another call for leak inspection... 
Again no time estimate possible.... said just call back in 2 hours if no show.... 

Would give no star if possible.....







Their customer services is does not exist.  Their website gives you a phone number, which you them have a computer direct you through recorded answers and it is hard to get someone on the phone.  I had ended my service when I moved out of my apartment, but recently discovered that I was still being charged. I sent in information for a refund and I'm here a month later with no response besides, allow sufficient time for an investigation. A month should be enough time with all the documentation I provided.. still out over $200 of a refund.

and after speaking with someone and letting them know i moved out.. i just got charged again.. this is RIDICULOUS







I would give them zero stars if i could. Worst customer service. 
Ive had the worst experience dealing with washington gas. They took a deposit from me that was supposed to be refunded to me in December 2016. Six months and 20 calls later, I still have not received my deposit.  WG should not be a monopoly. We should be able to choose our gas company!







Literally the worst company I have had the displeasure of trying to work with. I tried to turn on gas in my new house and they said it would take 5 days from the day I called to make that happen. I accepted that and suffered through cold showers and not cooking for the time being. Then comes my Monday appointment, of which they gave me the time frame of 7am-5pm!! I quite literally had to cancel anything I had scheduled for the day, and well yes surprise surprise they did not show up!!! They finally agreed to come out and said it would be around midnight?! Are you joking?? What kind of company is this!! And so alas, I am with no gas going for a week now and still unsure if they will come tomorrow. They can't guarantee a single thing. WORST COMPANY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Rating systems need to have negative stars for "messed up" circumstances.When calling for service you have to wait the entire day because they do not give time windows.  If they don't show up then oh, well try again another day.  They are very good at turning your gas off.  Not so much with getting it turned back on.  Some techs call but most don't.  One showed up about two to three days after I called (at a time when no one would be home).  I am literally at the complaining to third parties stage.  Seriously consider going all electric if you have the funds.  I even received a gas delivery charge when my house currently has no gas for about a month.

I haven't even moved into the apartment that requires a Washington Gas account yet, and I can already see that the next year or more of dealing with this is going to be pure, unmitigated hell.As everyone else has already said, their website is a complete abomination. It astounds me that this company can provide service to such a large area and have zero regard for the necessity of a functional website. To begin with, it is impossible to create the online profile that is required to set up autopay. You can try, as I did, multiple times on multiple days for multiple weeks, and you will continuously get an error message. I emailed their help desk and their response was essentially, "Yes, sorry about that, we've been having technical difficulties. Bye." I responded with something along the lines of, "Ok so I just... don't make an online profile then?" No response.That was just the beginning.We just had service started to this apartment (which we haven't actually moved into yet), so I suspected we would have a service initiation fee of some sort. But, strangely enough, when I checked my balance online, it said $0. When I called and tried to pay my balance through the automated system, it also said it was $0. Since we don't live in the apartment yet, we haven't been getting the mail there, so I can't verify whether or not they sent a paper bill. That shouldn't matter, though, because it's 2017 and every establishment in existence is expected to have some type of virtual payment method that prevents you from having to rely on paper statements and send physical checks.Once I speak to a human, he confirms that I do indeed owe a $15 fee due in six days. Mhm. I ask him how I am supposed to go about paying that seeing as both the website and automated phone payment system think my balance is $0. After informing me that "The problem is not us, ma'am, the problem is the internet," he redirects me to... the same automated number that won't let me pay because it thinks my account balance is $0. Thanks, man!So I call again. I speak to a second person and explain the issue I'm having. She casually tells me that it's showing up as a $0 balance because I don't have an actual gas bill added to it yet."But the $15 is still due on the 13th... and I have to pay it by the 13th?""Yes ma'am.""Can I go ahead and do that then?""Hold on while I redirect you to someone who can help you with that." BACK TO THE AUTOMATED PAYMENT LINE. I call a third time. I speak to a third person. I explain that this is my third time calling and that I have no way to pay the $15 balance I wouldn't even have known about if I hadn't called to ask. She tries to direct me to the automated payment line again. NOPE. NO. ABSOLUTELY NO. THAT'S NOT WORKING. "I'm sorry for the technical issues, ma'am, and I suggest you try the line again in a few hours." NO. DEFINITELY NOT. Reluctantly, she finally tells me she can accept a check over the phone and takes my bank account/routing numbers, which I'm assuming worked because she gave me a confirmation number (only after having me wait and sharing that she, too, was having "technical difficulties.") I'm 90% sure she also called me "dude" at some point during this conversation, but I can only hope I misheard her. So we're done now. I'm ready to hang up. I have supposedly (we'll find out) paid my balance. Right before saying goodbye, she chimes to me, "Remember that in the future, you can always review your balance and pay your bill online!""Well obviously I can't, because it doesn't work-""Have a nice day, ma'am, and let me direct you to our quick customer service survey."  Kill me.

Since no one in customer service seems to be listening to me I have had to go to social media to see if I can get help. I have been waiting over two months to get gas installed in my house. I am converting my oven, water heater and fireplace. I am waiting at my house for the fourth time for someone to install the meter. First and second time no one showed up. Third time they showed up but I need to Airflow to add a piece of equipment. This has been installed so I called and setup an appointment. I called Washington Gas yesterday and got confirmation someone was coming today and I called this morning and they confirmed again. I am now on the phone and have been told that they are not coming. Four days out of work and my window was 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Now my husband will have to be at the house on Friday from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. This is ridiculous. If there was another gas company I could use I would be out of here. Someone high up needs to know that there is no communication with customers, customer service, dispatch and contractors. This is only the tip of the iceberg of what I have been through.

Washington Gas turned off the gas to my house because they were fixing a leak in their system at the street. They left a note on the door at 4 am on Thursday 6/29 saying they had turned off the gas. I don't use the door where they left the note, so I saw it Sat morning 7/1 and called to have the gas turned back on, but was told that Washington Gas doesn't work on weekends so it would be Monday at the earliest that they could turn the gas back on. Unbelievable. They can't turn the gas on because Washington Gas technicians don't work weekends. I have been paying my bill on time at this address for 31 years. Now I'm stuck with no hot water or gas to cook with for at least the weekend. Terrible customer service. Especially for a utility that the public depends on.

Without question the worst customer service of any utility or customer focused organization that I have ever dealt with.  You cannot talk to anyone who makes a decision or schedules people.  Having problems with your meter, they tell you to plan to wait all day.Want a meter moved, they contract that out to someone and do not plan to get it ever scheduled.Want to talk to a scheduler for either.  They are not available and the customer service line will tell you they are not allowed to talk to themWhen they came to move the meter, they told me I needed a new line from the meter to the street.  This is an expense they need to incur, I have never heard back from them.Without question, the CEO of Washington Gas should be the next CEO of United Airlines, because they would be my all stars for pathetic approaches to customers.

I hardly ever write reviews but was compelled to add my warnings to the many others about Washington Gas.METICULOUSLY REVIEW YOUR BILLS!  After my first bill their auto-pay system failed to draft my bank account for the second and subsequent bills.  Since I have never experienced issues before in 17 years of using auto-pay for utilities, I didn't look at the bills posted on my Washington Gas account online.  It wasn't until Washington Gas physically mailed me a disconnect warning that I signed into my account to see what was going on and saw that auto-draft was not working.  My mistake for not assuming they might be incompetent.  Then they added a $65 deposit charge to my next bill since my payment had been considered "late" even though the lateness was due to their auto-pay system failure.  Fine, whatever.Thereafter, I opted out of auto-pay and manually paid each bill online each month.  Interestingly, the first payment manually made online was reflected in the account payment history and the next bill as expected; but subsequent payments for subsequent bills were not credited to the bills even though they are listed in the account payment history.  They took my money but never credited my account. I called Customer Service for an explanation; the representative agreed that she saw the payments but I wasn't getting credited in the bills.  She forwarded the matter to the billing department where they should investigate the issue and have a resolution in 14 days.  I asked why doesn't she just transfer me to that department while I was on the phone so we could resolve it immediately and she responded that they have to follow a process, which takes two weeks to complete.  Wow.I am moving out of the country in about a week so I imagine that it will be a source of unneeded frustration to collect the $65 deposit and get a resolution to their billing issues while I'm overseas.I'll leave you with one positive; the Customer Service representatives are courteous and professional despite working with a problematic computer system.  When scheduling a stop date for my service, it literally took the representative over five minutes before she could access my account and over 10 minutes more just to setup the stop service date and forwarding address.  They must be using Tandy computers leftover from 1984 with 300 baud modems to connect to the internet!

The worst company in the world. Put it this way, once they make a mistake on their end, all hell breaks lose. You'll find yourself in stressful situations from constant emails and calls that will get you absolutely nowhere. Managers that say they will help, and nothing happens. Lies and deceitful 'back office' that doesn't communicate with one another. Just a complete nightmare.

Common Sense, where are you?  After being told a technician would be here today between 8 a.m and 1 pm, I called WG at 2;30 to ask where they were.  No one has called, no one has come.  I was told by two different "supervisors" that "Our dispatchers have no way of reaching our technicians once they are out in the field."Seriously?  I asked, "what if there was an emergency and you had to contact them?"  Again, came the response, "Our dispatchers have NO WAY to reach our technicians once they are out in the field."Please be on the watch for WG Technicians bouncing about in impenetrable bubbles as they float randomly from place to place.  Catch one if you can.

Based on my experience and those of my neighbors in Georgetown,  Washington Gas is not accountable, transparent, or communicative when it comes to repairing gas lines and related infrastructure above and below our streets.

reported a possible gas leak at 2:30pm and upon follow up at 4:30pm there was no record of the call. After some research found the report. No time estimate possible...Called back at 8:30pm... no record of call .... submitted another call for leak inspection... Again no time estimate possible.... said just call back in 2 hours if no show.... Would give no star if possible.....

Their customer services is does not exist.  Their website gives you a phone number, which you them have a computer direct you through recorded answers and it is hard to get someone on the phone.  I had ended my service when I moved out of my apartment, but recently discovered that I was still being charged. I sent in information for a refund and I'm here a month later with no response besides, allow sufficient time for an investigation. A month should be enough time with all the documentation I provided.. still out over $200 of a refund.and after speaking with someone and letting them know i moved out.. i just got charged again.. this is RIDICULOUS

I would give them zero stars if i could. Worst customer service. Ive had the worst experience dealing with washington gas. They took a deposit from me that was supposed to be refunded to me in December 2016. Six months and 20 calls later, I still have not received my deposit.  WG should not be a monopoly. We should be able to choose our gas company!

Literally the worst company I have had the displeasure of trying to work with. I tried to turn on gas in my new house and they said it would take 5 days from the day I called to make that happen. I accepted that and suffered through cold showers and not cooking for the time being. Then comes my Monday appointment, of which they gave me the time frame of 7am-5pm!! I quite literally had to cancel anything I had scheduled for the day, and well yes surprise surprise they did not show up!!! They finally agreed to come out and said it would be around midnight?! Are you joking?? What kind of company is this!! And so alas, I am with no gas going for a week now and still unsure if they will come tomorrow. They can't guarantee a single thing. WORST COMPANY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Their website may just well be the worst on the internet.  My guess is it was designed in 1997.  Its slow, and the bill pay service is archaic. Good luck getting anything of substance from the site.  I have signed up for auto-pay and budget billing multiple times but it never goes into effect.  In addition, I schedule payments and they don't show on the website (although I receive emails stating the payment has been scheduled).  

But with that said, I have had no problems with their service, hence the 2 stars.







Washington Gas,
Your payment options are unbelievably torturous. Your website never works! And your telephone assistance is sub-par, repetitive, annoying, and unproductive. It takes 20 mins to make a payment if you're lucky and don't get hung up on for one mistaken number entered. Please upgrade your services.

                                                   Sincerely.
                                     At my wits end with you!







Why am I not surprised that this terrible company has 1 star?

For the past, two years since I've had WG, every few months they contact me saying they have not received payments. I then have to log on to my account and send screen shots. This is the third time it is happening. Seriously guys, maybe update your technology or get a staff has a brain. #1 reason can't wait to move out of the area so never have to deal with them.







Another one star review! What a horrible company. 

1. The website. Was down for almost a year and then sporadically works. 
2. You cannot autopay you must send a check
3. Phone service... wait on hold and then listen to this lady prattle on about what the company will not or cannot do in a sing song voice over and over again 
4. Moving out: you have to send them PROOF of moving out or they will send you a bill to your NEW address for your OLD address. Does that make any sense whatsoever???

Terrible company!







Literally everyone I have talked to in customer service here had been rude and short tempered. At one point I was literally told that I had missed my appointment because I wasn't home when I in fact took the whole day off to stay at home just for them. The man whom came out to actually turn on my gas was very pleasant though.







Yelp needs a negative star rating... 

Washington Gas customer support people are utterly useless.  Both from calling their support number and e-mailing customersupport@washgas.com.  Took me over a month to finally resolve a billing issue, where the home builder's bill was on my account.  

Over the course of a month, I spoke with several customer support reps and maybe one or two were truly helpful. E-mailing customersupport@washgas.com is even worse. All they do is copy and paste pre-written bullshit and then write some bullshit saying your clarification request is still being processed. Nothing I received by e-mail was ever helpful. 

So pretty much their customer support is useless, cause they have a back office that actually solves the issues. It would seem like issues get lost in translation from customer support to their back office. 

The problem was that someone on the Wash Gas end screwed up when I called before closing to have the account transfer to my name on my requested effective date, which caused the builder's bill to show up in my account. 

Whatever, finally got it resolved. Try to hire some smarter people for your customer support.







Rating systems need to have negative stars for "messed up" circumstances.

When calling for service you have to wait the entire day because they do not give time windows.  If they don't show up then oh, well try again another day.  They are very good at turning your gas off.  Not so much with getting it turned back on.  Some techs call but most don't.  One showed up about two to three days after I called (at a time when no one would be home).  I am literally at the complaining to third parties stage.  Seriously consider going all electric if you have the funds.  I even received a gas delivery charge when my house currently has no gas for about a month.







I haven't even moved into the apartment that requires a Washington Gas account yet, and I can already see that the next year or more of dealing with this is going to be pure, unmitigated hell.

As everyone else has already said, their website is a complete abomination. It astounds me that this company can provide service to such a large area and have zero regard for the necessity of a functional website. To begin with, it is impossible to create the online profile that is required to set up autopay. You can try, as I did, multiple times on multiple days for multiple weeks, and you will continuously get an error message. I emailed their help desk and their response was essentially, "Yes, sorry about that, we've been having technical difficulties. Bye." I responded with something along the lines of, "Ok so I just... don't make an online profile then?" No response.

That was just the beginning.

We just had service started to this apartment (which we haven't actually moved into yet), so I suspected we would have a service initiation fee of some sort. But, strangely enough, when I checked my balance online, it said $0. When I called and tried to pay my balance through the automated system, it also said it was $0. Since we don't live in the apartment yet, we haven't been getting the mail there, so I can't verify whether or not they sent a paper bill. That shouldn't matter, though, because it's 2017 and every establishment in existence is expected to have some type of virtual payment method that prevents you from having to rely on paper statements and send physical checks.

Once I speak to a human, he confirms that I do indeed owe a $15 fee due in six days. Mhm. I ask him how I am supposed to go about paying that seeing as both the website and automated phone payment system think my balance is $0. After informing me that "The problem is not us, ma'am, the problem is the internet," he redirects me to... the same automated number that won't let me pay because it thinks my account balance is $0. Thanks, man!

So I call again. I speak to a second person and explain the issue I'm having. She casually tells me that it's showing up as a $0 balance because I don't have an actual gas bill added to it yet.

"But the $15 is still due on the 13th... and I have to pay it by the 13th?"

"Yes ma'am."

"Can I go ahead and do that then?"

"Hold on while I redirect you to someone who can help you with that." 

BACK TO THE AUTOMATED PAYMENT LINE. 

I call a third time. I speak to a third person. I explain that this is my third time calling and that I have no way to pay the $15 balance I wouldn't even have known about if I hadn't called to ask. She tries to direct me to the automated payment line again. NOPE. NO. ABSOLUTELY NO. THAT'S NOT WORKING. "I'm sorry for the technical issues, ma'am, and I suggest you try the line again in a few hours." NO. DEFINITELY NOT. Reluctantly, she finally tells me she can accept a check over the phone and takes my bank account/routing numbers, which I'm assuming worked because she gave me a confirmation number (only after having me wait and sharing that she, too, was having "technical difficulties.") 

I'm 90% sure she also called me "dude" at some point during this conversation, but I can only hope I misheard her. 

So we're done now. I'm ready to hang up. I have supposedly (we'll find out) paid my balance. Right before saying goodbye, she chimes to me, "Remember that in the future, you can always review your balance and pay your bill online!"

"Well obviously I can't, because it doesn't work-"

"Have a nice day, ma'am, and let me direct you to our quick customer service survey."  

Kill me.







Since no one in customer service seems to be listening to me I have had to go to social media to see if I can get help. I have been waiting over two months to get gas installed in my house. I am converting my oven, water heater and fireplace. I am waiting at my house for the fourth time for someone to install the meter. First and second time no one showed up. Third time they showed up but I need to Airflow to add a piece of equipment. This has been installed so I called and setup an appointment. I called Washington Gas yesterday and got confirmation someone was coming today and I called this morning and they confirmed again. I am now on the phone and have been told that they are not coming. Four days out of work and my window was 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Now my husband will have to be at the house on Friday from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. This is ridiculous. If there was another gas company I could use I would be out of here. Someone high up needs to know that there is no communication with customers, customer service, dispatch and contractors. This is only the tip of the iceberg of what I have been through.







Washington Gas turned off the gas to my house because they were fixing a leak in their system at the street. They left a note on the door at 4 am on Thursday 6/29 saying they had turned off the gas. I don't use the door where they left the note, so I saw it Sat morning 7/1 and called to have the gas turned back on, but was told that Washington Gas doesn't work on weekends so it would be Monday at the earliest that they could turn the gas back on. 

Unbelievable. They can't turn the gas on because Washington Gas technicians don't work weekends. I have been paying my bill on time at this address for 31 years. Now I'm stuck with no hot water or gas to cook with for at least the weekend. Terrible customer service. Especially for a utility that the public depends on.







Without question the worst customer service of any utility or customer focused organization that I have ever dealt with.  You cannot talk to anyone who makes a decision or schedules people.  

Having problems with your meter, they tell you to plan to wait all day.

Want a meter moved, they contract that out to someone and do not plan to get it ever scheduled.

Want to talk to a scheduler for either.  They are not available and the customer service line will tell you they are not allowed to talk to them

When they came to move the meter, they told me I needed a new line from the meter to the street.  This is an expense they need to incur, I have never heard back from them.

Without question, the CEO of Washington Gas should be the next CEO of United Airlines, because they would be my all stars for pathetic approaches to customers.







This place would be a negative if yelp allowed it. As is evidenced by the reviews, wash gas should be investigated by the attorney generals of all three jurisdictions







I hardly ever write reviews but was compelled to add my warnings to the many others about Washington Gas.

METICULOUSLY REVIEW YOUR BILLS!  After my first bill their auto-pay system failed to draft my bank account for the second and subsequent bills.  Since I have never experienced issues before in 17 years of using auto-pay for utilities, I didn't look at the bills posted on my Washington Gas account online.  It wasn't until Washington Gas physically mailed me a disconnect warning that I signed into my account to see what was going on and saw that auto-draft was not working.  My mistake for not assuming they might be incompetent.  Then they added a $65 deposit charge to my next bill since my payment had been considered "late" even though the lateness was due to their auto-pay system failure.  Fine, whatever.

Thereafter, I opted out of auto-pay and manually paid each bill online each month.  Interestingly, the first payment manually made online was reflected in the account payment history and the next bill as expected; but subsequent payments for subsequent bills were not credited to the bills even though they are listed in the account payment history.  They took my money but never credited my account. 

I called Customer Service for an explanation; the representative agreed that she saw the payments but I wasn't getting credited in the bills.  She forwarded the matter to the billing department where they should investigate the issue and have a resolution in 14 days.  I asked why doesn't she just transfer me to that department while I was on the phone so we could resolve it immediately and she responded that they have to follow a process, which takes two weeks to complete.  Wow.

I am moving out of the country in about a week so I imagine that it will be a source of unneeded frustration to collect the $65 deposit and get a resolution to their billing issues while I'm overseas.

I'll leave you with one positive; the Customer Service representatives are courteous and professional despite working with a problematic computer system.  When scheduling a stop date for my service, it literally took the representative over five minutes before she could access my account and over 10 minutes more just to setup the stop service date and forwarding address.  They must be using Tandy computers leftover from 1984 with 300 baud modems to connect to the internet!







The worst company in the world. Put it this way, once they make a mistake on their end, all hell breaks lose. You'll find yourself in stressful situations from constant emails and calls that will get you absolutely nowhere. Managers that say they will help, and nothing happens. Lies and deceitful 'back office' that doesn't communicate with one another. Just a complete nightmare.







Common Sense, where are you?  After being told a technician would be here today between 8 a.m and 1 pm, I called WG at 2;30 to ask where they were.  No one has called, no one has come.  I was told by two different "supervisors" that "Our dispatchers have no way of reaching our technicians once they are out in the field."

Seriously?  I asked, "what if there was an emergency and you had to contact them?"  Again, came the response, "Our dispatchers have NO WAY to reach our technicians once they are out in the field."

Please be on the watch for WG Technicians bouncing about in impenetrable bubbles as they float randomly from place to place.  Catch one if you can.







Based on my experience and those of my neighbors in Georgetown,  Washington Gas is not accountable, transparent, or communicative when it comes to repairing gas lines and related infrastructure above and below our streets.







reported a possible gas leak at 2:30pm and upon follow up at 4:30pm there was no record of the call. After some research found the report. No time estimate possible...
Called back at 8:30pm... no record of call .... submitted another call for leak inspection... 
Again no time estimate possible.... said just call back in 2 hours if no show.... 

Would give no star if possible.....







Their customer services is does not exist.  Their website gives you a phone number, which you them have a computer direct you through recorded answers and it is hard to get someone on the phone.  I had ended my service when I moved out of my apartment, but recently discovered that I was still being charged. I sent in information for a refund and I'm here a month later with no response besides, allow sufficient time for an investigation. A month should be enough time with all the documentation I provided.. still out over $200 of a refund.

and after speaking with someone and letting them know i moved out.. i just got charged again.. this is RIDICULOUS







I would give them zero stars if i could. Worst customer service. 
Ive had the worst experience dealing with washington gas. They took a deposit from me that was supposed to be refunded to me in December 2016. Six months and 20 calls later, I still have not received my deposit.  WG should not be a monopoly. We should be able to choose our gas company!







Literally the worst company I have had the displeasure of trying to work with. I tried to turn on gas in my new house and they said it would take 5 days from the day I called to make that happen. I accepted that and suffered through cold showers and not cooking for the time being. Then comes my Monday appointment, of which they gave me the time frame of 7am-5pm!! I quite literally had to cancel anything I had scheduled for the day, and well yes surprise surprise they did not show up!!! They finally agreed to come out and said it would be around midnight?! Are you joking?? What kind of company is this!! And so alas, I am with no gas going for a week now and still unsure if they will come tomorrow. They can't guarantee a single thing. WORST COMPANY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Their website may just well be the worst on the internet.  My guess is it was designed in 1997.  Its slow, and the bill pay service is archaic. Good luck getting anything of substance from the site.  I have signed up for auto-pay and budget billing multiple times but it never goes into effect.  In addition, I schedule payments and they don't show on the website (although I receive emails stating the payment has been scheduled).  But with that said, I have had no problems with their service, hence the 2 stars.

Washington Gas,Your payment options are unbelievably torturous. Your website never works! And your telephone assistance is sub-par, repetitive, annoying, and unproductive. It takes 20 mins to make a payment if you're lucky and don't get hung up on for one mistaken number entered. Please upgrade your services.                                                   Sincerely.                                     At my wits end with you!

Why am I not surprised that this terrible company has 1 star?For the past, two years since I've had WG, every few months they contact me saying they have not received payments. I then have to log on to my account and send screen shots. This is the third time it is happening. Seriously guys, maybe update your technology or get a staff has a brain. #1 reason can't wait to move out of the area so never have to deal with them.

Another one star review! What a horrible company. 1. The website. Was down for almost a year and then sporadically works. 2. You cannot autopay you must send a check3. Phone service... wait on hold and then listen to this lady prattle on about what the company will not or cannot do in a sing song voice over and over again 4. Moving out: you have to send them PROOF of moving out or they will send you a bill to your NEW address for your OLD address. Does that make any sense whatsoever???Terrible company!

Literally everyone I have talked to in customer service here had been rude and short tempered. At one point I was literally told that I had missed my appointment because I wasn't home when I in fact took the whole day off to stay at home just for them. The man whom came out to actually turn on my gas was very pleasant though.

Yelp needs a negative star rating... Washington Gas customer support people are utterly useless.  Both from calling their support number and e-mailing customersupport@washgas.….  Took me over a month to finally resolve a billing issue, where the home builder's bill was on my account.  Over the course of a month, I spoke with several customer support reps and maybe one or two were truly helpful. E-mailing customersupport@washgas.… is even worse. All they do is copy and paste pre-written bullshit and then write some bullshit saying your clarification request is still being processed. Nothing I received by e-mail was ever helpful. So pretty much their customer support is useless, cause they have a back office that actually solves the issues. It would seem like issues get lost in translation from customer support to their back office. The problem was that someone on the Wash Gas end screwed up when I called before closing to have the account transfer to my name on my requested effective date, which caused the builder's bill to show up in my account. Whatever, finally got it resolved. Try to hire some smarter people for your customer support.

Rating systems need to have negative stars for "messed up" circumstances.When calling for service you have to wait the entire day because they do not give time windows.  If they don't show up then oh, well try again another day.  They are very good at turning your gas off.  Not so much with getting it turned back on.  Some techs call but most don't.  One showed up about two to three days after I called (at a time when no one would be home).  I am literally at the complaining to third parties stage.  Seriously consider going all electric if you have the funds.  I even received a gas delivery charge when my house currently has no gas for about a month.

I haven't even moved into the apartment that requires a Washington Gas account yet, and I can already see that the next year or more of dealing with this is going to be pure, unmitigated hell.As everyone else has already said, their website is a complete abomination. It astounds me that this company can provide service to such a large area and have zero regard for the necessity of a functional website. To begin with, it is impossible to create the online profile that is required to set up autopay. You can try, as I did, multiple times on multiple days for multiple weeks, and you will continuously get an error message. I emailed their help desk and their response was essentially, "Yes, sorry about that, we've been having technical difficulties. Bye." I responded with something along the lines of, "Ok so I just... don't make an online profile then?" No response.That was just the beginning.We just had service started to this apartment (which we haven't actually moved into yet), so I suspected we would have a service initiation fee of some sort. But, strangely enough, when I checked my balance online, it said $0. When I called and tried to pay my balance through the automated system, it also said it was $0. Since we don't live in the apartment yet, we haven't been getting the mail there, so I can't verify whether or not they sent a paper bill. That shouldn't matter, though, because it's 2017 and every establishment in existence is expected to have some type of virtual payment method that prevents you from having to rely on paper statements and send physical checks.Once I speak to a human, he confirms that I do indeed owe a $15 fee due in six days. Mhm. I ask him how I am supposed to go about paying that seeing as both the website and automated phone payment system think my balance is $0. After informing me that "The problem is not us, ma'am, the problem is the internet," he redirects me to... the same automated number that won't let me pay because it thinks my account balance is $0. Thanks, man!So I call again. I speak to a second person and explain the issue I'm having. She casually tells me that it's showing up as a $0 balance because I don't have an actual gas bill added to it yet."But the $15 is still due on the 13th... and I have to pay it by the 13th?""Yes ma'am.""Can I go ahead and do that then?""Hold on while I redirect you to someone who can help you with that." BACK TO THE AUTOMATED PAYMENT LINE. I call a third time. I speak to a third person. I explain that this is my third time calling and that I have no way to pay the $15 balance I wouldn't even have known about if I hadn't called to ask. She tries to direct me to the automated payment line again. NOPE. NO. ABSOLUTELY NO. THAT'S NOT WORKING. "I'm sorry for the technical issues, ma'am, and I suggest you try the line again in a few hours." NO. DEFINITELY NOT. Reluctantly, she finally tells me she can accept a check over the phone and takes my bank account/routing numbers, which I'm assuming worked because she gave me a confirmation number (only after having me wait and sharing that she, too, was having "technical difficulties.") I'm 90% sure she also called me "dude" at some point during this conversation, but I can only hope I misheard her. So we're done now. I'm ready to hang up. I have supposedly (we'll find out) paid my balance. Right before saying goodbye, she chimes to me, "Remember that in the future, you can always review your balance and pay your bill online!""Well obviously I can't, because it doesn't work-""Have a nice day, ma'am, and let me direct you to our quick customer service survey."  Kill me.

Since no one in customer service seems to be listening to me I have had to go to social media to see if I can get help. I have been waiting over two months to get gas installed in my house. I am converting my oven, water heater and fireplace. I am waiting at my house for the fourth time for someone to install the meter. First and second time no one showed up. Third time they showed up but I need to Airflow to add a piece of equipment. This has been installed so I called and setup an appointment. I called Washington Gas yesterday and got confirmation someone was coming today and I called this morning and they confirmed again. I am now on the phone and have been told that they are not coming. Four days out of work and my window was 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Now my husband will have to be at the house on Friday from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. This is ridiculous. If there was another gas company I could use I would be out of here. Someone high up needs to know that there is no communication with customers, customer service, dispatch and contractors. This is only the tip of the iceberg of what I have been through.

Washington Gas turned off the gas to my house because they were fixing a leak in their system at the street. They left a note on the door at 4 am on Thursday 6/29 saying they had turned off the gas. I don't use the door where they left the note, so I saw it Sat morning 7/1 and called to have the gas turned back on, but was told that Washington Gas doesn't work on weekends so it would be Monday at the earliest that they could turn the gas back on. Unbelievable. They can't turn the gas on because Washington Gas technicians don't work weekends. I have been paying my bill on time at this address for 31 years. Now I'm stuck with no hot water or gas to cook with for at least the weekend. Terrible customer service. Especially for a utility that the public depends on.

Without question the worst customer service of any utility or customer focused organization that I have ever dealt with.  You cannot talk to anyone who makes a decision or schedules people.  Having problems with your meter, they tell you to plan to wait all day.Want a meter moved, they contract that out to someone and do not plan to get it ever scheduled.Want to talk to a scheduler for either.  They are not available and the customer service line will tell you they are not allowed to talk to themWhen they came to move the meter, they told me I needed a new line from the meter to the street.  This is an expense they need to incur, I have never heard back from them.Without question, the CEO of Washington Gas should be the next CEO of United Airlines, because they would be my all stars for pathetic approaches to customers.

I hardly ever write reviews but was compelled to add my warnings to the many others about Washington Gas.METICULOUSLY REVIEW YOUR BILLS!  After my first bill their auto-pay system failed to draft my bank account for the second and subsequent bills.  Since I have never experienced issues before in 17 years of using auto-pay for utilities, I didn't look at the bills posted on my Washington Gas account online.  It wasn't until Washington Gas physically mailed me a disconnect warning that I signed into my account to see what was going on and saw that auto-draft was not working.  My mistake for not assuming they might be incompetent.  Then they added a $65 deposit charge to my next bill since my payment had been considered "late" even though the lateness was due to their auto-pay system failure.  Fine, whatever.Thereafter, I opted out of auto-pay and manually paid each bill online each month.  Interestingly, the first payment manually made online was reflected in the account payment history and the next bill as expected; but subsequent payments for subsequent bills were not credited to the bills even though they are listed in the account payment history.  They took my money but never credited my account. I called Customer Service for an explanation; the representative agreed that she saw the payments but I wasn't getting credited in the bills.  She forwarded the matter to the billing department where they should investigate the issue and have a resolution in 14 days.  I asked why doesn't she just transfer me to that department while I was on the phone so we could resolve it immediately and she responded that they have to follow a process, which takes two weeks to complete.  Wow.I am moving out of the country in about a week so I imagine that it will be a source of unneeded frustration to collect the $65 deposit and get a resolution to their billing issues while I'm overseas.I'll leave you with one positive; the Customer Service representatives are courteous and professional despite working with a problematic computer system.  When scheduling a stop date for my service, it literally took the representative over five minutes before she could access my account and over 10 minutes more just to setup the stop service date and forwarding address.  They must be using Tandy computers leftover from 1984 with 300 baud modems to connect to the internet!

The worst company in the world. Put it this way, once they make a mistake on their end, all hell breaks lose. You'll find yourself in stressful situations from constant emails and calls that will get you absolutely nowhere. Managers that say they will help, and nothing happens. Lies and deceitful 'back office' that doesn't communicate with one another. Just a complete nightmare.

Common Sense, where are you?  After being told a technician would be here today between 8 a.m and 1 pm, I called WG at 2;30 to ask where they were.  No one has called, no one has come.  I was told by two different "supervisors" that "Our dispatchers have no way of reaching our technicians once they are out in the field."Seriously?  I asked, "what if there was an emergency and you had to contact them?"  Again, came the response, "Our dispatchers have NO WAY to reach our technicians once they are out in the field."Please be on the watch for WG Technicians bouncing about in impenetrable bubbles as they float randomly from place to place.  Catch one if you can.

Based on my experience and those of my neighbors in Georgetown,  Washington Gas is not accountable, transparent, or communicative when it comes to repairing gas lines and related infrastructure above and below our streets.

reported a possible gas leak at 2:30pm and upon follow up at 4:30pm there was no record of the call. After some research found the report. No time estimate possible...Called back at 8:30pm... no record of call .... submitted another call for leak inspection... Again no time estimate possible.... said just call back in 2 hours if no show.... Would give no star if possible.....

Their customer services is does not exist.  Their website gives you a phone number, which you them have a computer direct you through recorded answers and it is hard to get someone on the phone.  I had ended my service when I moved out of my apartment, but recently discovered that I was still being charged. I sent in information for a refund and I'm here a month later with no response besides, allow sufficient time for an investigation. A month should be enough time with all the documentation I provided.. still out over $200 of a refund.and after speaking with someone and letting them know i moved out.. i just got charged again.. this is RIDICULOUS

I would give them zero stars if i could. Worst customer service. Ive had the worst experience dealing with washington gas. They took a deposit from me that was supposed to be refunded to me in December 2016. Six months and 20 calls later, I still have not received my deposit.  WG should not be a monopoly. We should be able to choose our gas company!

Literally the worst company I have had the displeasure of trying to work with. I tried to turn on gas in my new house and they said it would take 5 days from the day I called to make that happen. I accepted that and suffered through cold showers and not cooking for the time being. Then comes my Monday appointment, of which they gave me the time frame of 7am-5pm!! I quite literally had to cancel anything I had scheduled for the day, and well yes surprise surprise they did not show up!!! They finally agreed to come out and said it would be around midnight?! Are you joking?? What kind of company is this!! And so alas, I am with no gas going for a week now and still unsure if they will come tomorrow. They can't guarantee a single thing. WORST COMPANY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I want to thank the man from your company at 13504 Hillendale Dr. Woodbridge, Va. I didn't get his name but I was so pleased with his service at my home. He took his time to investigated why I smelled gas. Found the problem and it ended up with a easy fix from a month ago. He listened to what I had back then and found my problem that otherwise he would have to shut my gas off. He took care of it simple fix. I am asking to have him commended for his time and his patience. Thank you.







Much to my surprise, the late night Washington Gas customer service is fantastic.  I called Washington Gas at 9:05 pm to report a non-emergency problem and a technician came to my house and completely resolved the issue by 11:30 pm.  Both the technician and phone operator were shockingly competent and nice.  The technician even voluntarily helped change my a/c filter.







Their website may just well be the worst on the internet.  My guess is it was designed in 1997.  Its slow, and the bill pay service is archaic. Good luck getting anything of substance from the site.  I have signed up for auto-pay and budget billing multiple times but it never goes into effect.  In addition, I schedule payments and they don't show on the website (although I receive emails stating the payment has been scheduled).  

But with that said, I have had no problems with their service, hence the 2 stars.







The physical washington gas location has very pleasant employees, I even had to call the emergency line once because of my carbon monoxide alarms going off. Despite it being around 2 am they had someone at my house in about 20 minutes to check everything. As far as paying bills or getting ahold of someone on the phone it would be hard to give this company even 2 stars, everything is outsouced to the Philippines I believe. The bill pay area of Their website is a mess, its so bad now I just go pay my bill at their office despite the inconvenience.







HORRIBLE experience with their phone customer service on multiple instances.  The only reason I am giving two stars is because when I HAD to go to a center in person, the woman there was helpful and apologetic.  I was trying to start service from out of state and my apartment complex was very clear that I couldn't get the keys until I gave them utility account numbers.  I spent at least an hour and a half on hold total during all of my calls, they couldn't transfer service over the phone and asked me if I lived in Vermont (I was moving from RI to VA), told me to fax or email two forms of ID and my lease agreement (which I did), and after speaking to numerous people, I was told I had to set it up in person.  I lived 7 hours away!  Luckily, my complex worked with me and I went after I had moved in.  As I said, the woman who helped me was able to set up my account in MINUTES and had no idea why they wouldn't do it over the phone, apologizing to me.  And THEN, two weeks later, I get a letter in the mail saying that they received my email with my lease agreement but need two forms of ID, had mis-typed my email address, AND clearly, I already have service.  I don't think I've ever dealt with such incompetent customer service.  Hopefully I won't have to deal with them again until I move out!







This service via the phone is absolutely horrible. I am a new customer and they gave me a 5 hour window for the time to wait. A little long but I requested they come first thing in the morning. I have done this with every other utility company and they usually come earlier in the morning rather than later. They said I would receive a confirmation call. No confirmation call the day before so I called to confirm. There are still nothing in the notes as requested to ask the technician to come earlier in the morning. I request them to add it in the notes again. Well the morning is progressing so I call to see if they are still coming. Even though I called in twice, there is still nothing in the notes and they cannot call the technician to verify because guess what, they are in the Phillipines. I have to spell out every single word because their first language is not English. Seriously! This is an excellent reason why they should not outsource jobs to foreign countries. Washington gas you need to bring the call center back to the U.S. so customers dont need to call in 50 times to attempt to get a question answered. It is a shame that washington gas is a monopoly.

The only reason they get two stars is because the technican was very professional and did the job quickly. I didnt feel the slightest bit uncomfortable with him as a female in the home alone. If I was reviewing the technician at the home, it would be a 5. But, I will likely interact an idiotic customer service much more than the technician.







The gas works, but I've had several billing problems already in the first 2 months. The website is terrible. They haven't responded to customer service online submissions, and good luck finding someone on the phone who speaks English well.







Literally everyone I have talked to in customer service here had been rude and short tempered. At one point I was literally told that I had missed my appointment because I wasn't home when I in fact took the whole day off to stay at home just for them. The man whom came out to actually turn on my gas was very pleasant though.







Washington Gas,
Your payment options are unbelievably torturous. Your website never works! And your telephone assistance is sub-par, repetitive, annoying, and unproductive. It takes 20 mins to make a payment if you're lucky and don't get hung up on for one mistaken number entered. Please upgrade your services.

                                                   Sincerely.
                                     At my wits end with you!







Rating systems need to have negative stars for "messed up" circumstances.

When calling for service you have to wait the entire day because they do not give time windows.  If they don't show up then oh, well try again another day.  They are very good at turning your gas off.  Not so much with getting it turned back on.  Some techs call but most don't.  One showed up about two to three days after I called (at a time when no one would be home).  I am literally at the complaining to third parties stage.  Seriously consider going all electric if you have the funds.  I even received a gas delivery charge when my house currently has no gas for about a month.







Since no one in customer service seems to be listening to me I have had to go to social media to see if I can get help. I have been waiting over two months to get gas installed in my house. I am converting my oven, water heater and fireplace. I am waiting at my house for the fourth time for someone to install the meter. First and second time no one showed up. Third time they showed up but I need to Airflow to add a piece of equipment. This has been installed so I called and setup an appointment. I called Washington Gas yesterday and got confirmation someone was coming today and I called this morning and they confirmed again. I am now on the phone and have been told that they are not coming. Four days out of work and my window was 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Now my husband will have to be at the house on Friday from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. This is ridiculous. If there was another gas company I could use I would be out of here. Someone high up needs to know that there is no communication with customers, customer service, dispatch and contractors. This is only the tip of the iceberg of what I have been through.







Washington Gas turned off the gas to my house because they were fixing a leak in their system at the street. They left a note on the door at 4 am on Thursday 6/29 saying they had turned off the gas. I don't use the door where they left the note, so I saw it Sat morning 7/1 and called to have the gas turned back on, but was told that Washington Gas doesn't work on weekends so it would be Monday at the earliest that they could turn the gas back on. 

Unbelievable. They can't turn the gas on because Washington Gas technicians don't work weekends. I have been paying my bill on time at this address for 31 years. Now I'm stuck with no hot water or gas to cook with for at least the weekend. Terrible customer service. Especially for a utility that the public depends on.







Literally the worst company I have had the displeasure of trying to work with. I tried to turn on gas in my new house and they said it would take 5 days from the day I called to make that happen. I accepted that and suffered through cold showers and not cooking for the time being. Then comes my Monday appointment, of which they gave me the time frame of 7am-5pm!! I quite literally had to cancel anything I had scheduled for the day, and well yes surprise surprise they did not show up!!! They finally agreed to come out and said it would be around midnight?! Are you joking?? What kind of company is this!! And so alas, I am with no gas going for a week now and still unsure if they will come tomorrow. They can't guarantee a single thing. WORST COMPANY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!







This place would be a negative if yelp allowed it. As is evidenced by the reviews, wash gas should be investigated by the attorney generals of all three jurisdictions







Washington Gas is the worst utility company EVER! In anticipation for a May 30th move to Hyattsville, MD, I called on May 15 to have the gas turned on and placed n my name. When I moved in on the 30th, there was no Gas Service. I called and they said there was perhaps an issue with the gas line. They scheduled a technician to arrive some time on Friday, June 2nd. Mind you, they can't give you an ETA or time of day for the technician, so you have to be home all day. This doesn't work out if you have a job that doesn't allow you to take off with short notice. I called the morning of June 2nd to confirm the appointment. The customer service rep said it looked like I had no contract! So she set up a contract and then confirmed that a tech would be out to service the line. I waited all day and the tech was a NO SHOW! I called first thing Monday (today) and the rep said they had too many emergency calls to get to my order on Friday. She promised someone would be out today. The tech showed up about an hour later, however he was ACROSS THE STREET! I had to wave him down. He came by and asked my name. According to his tablet, my name was placed on the account for the vacant house across the street. And he told me he couldn't service my gas line because the order was made for the other house and its meter number. So I had to call the Washington Gas AGAIN to walk them through the process of associating my name with the correct address. Thankfully the rep I worked with was willing to take things slow, confirm the information, and had it reviewed by her manager. Although she said it could take up to 3 days to get someone out, she promised someone would be out today. My fingers are crossed. Washington Gas, shame on you for treating your customers like they don't matter because of the monopoly you have on the D.C. Area!!!!







Why am I not surprised that this terrible company has 1 star?

For the past, two years since I've had WG, every few months they contact me saying they have not received payments. I then have to log on to my account and send screen shots. This is the third time it is happening. Seriously guys, maybe update your technology or get a staff has a brain. #1 reason can't wait to move out of the area so never have to deal with them.







Another one star review! What a horrible company. 

1. The website. Was down for almost a year and then sporadically works. 
2. You cannot autopay you must send a check
3. Phone service... wait on hold and then listen to this lady prattle on about what the company will not or cannot do in a sing song voice over and over again 
4. Moving out: you have to send them PROOF of moving out or they will send you a bill to your NEW address for your OLD address. Does that make any sense whatsoever???

Terrible company!







The worst company in the world. Put it this way, once they make a mistake on their end, all hell breaks lose. You'll find yourself in stressful situations from constant emails and calls that will get you absolutely nowhere. Managers that say they will help, and nothing happens. Lies and deceitful 'back office' that doesn't communicate with one another. Just a complete nightmare.







Not sure I have a single positive thing to say about this business. It's frustrating that there aren't any other options. When I moved into my apartment, the former landlord (who is also a moron) told me my gas was taken care of. Trusting him, I never tried to sign up for an account. The gas was working just fine and continued to work for the next year and two months. One day, I notice it stops working so I call the landlord (at this point, it's a new landlord). He calls the gas company, and they tell me that it's been turned off because no one has paid the bill. What? They say I need to call so I do. I get this completely rude and ignorant person on the phone, who tells me it's my fault and that I was "naive" to think I could just get free gas. I tell her, no, my landlord told me it was included but that also if it hadn't been paid they should have sent notice. She said they don't send notices, as it's the customers responsibility to know when they haven't paid a bill. I ask her why after FIFTEEN months of unpaid service, they wouldn't notify a single person. She begins to get angry and say it's my fault, basically tells me I don't understand how utility payments work, and that I have to pay an outstanding balance of $370 in order to regain service. She also told me I would have to bring a copy of my lease to the office in DC in order to pay these bills. I tell her I don't really have time do to all that and she says that's my problem, too bad. After talking to several different people, I finally managed to get a very sweet woman on the phone, who said the other woman was only trying to make things hard for me. I eventually had the situation resolved with this nice woman, but holy crap. This company knows it has you trapped so it doesn't care if it provides horrible service.







Based on my experience and those of my neighbors in Georgetown,  Washington Gas is not accountable, transparent, or communicative when it comes to repairing gas lines and related infrastructure above and below our streets.

I want to thank the man from your company at 13504 Hillendale Dr. Woodbridge, Va. I didn't get his name but I was so pleased with his service at my home. He took his time to investigated why I smelled gas. Found the problem and it ended up with a easy fix from a month ago. He listened to what I had back then and found my problem that otherwise he would have to shut my gas off. He took care of it simple fix. I am asking to have him commended for his time and his patience. Thank you.

Much to my surprise, the late night Washington Gas customer service is fantastic.  I called Washington Gas at 9:05 pm to report a non-emergency problem and a technician came to my house and completely resolved the issue by 11:30 pm.  Both the technician and phone operator were shockingly competent and nice.  The technician even voluntarily helped change my a/c filter.

Their website may just well be the worst on the internet.  My guess is it was designed in 1997.  Its slow, and the bill pay service is archaic. Good luck getting anything of substance from the site.  I have signed up for auto-pay and budget billing multiple times but it never goes into effect.  In addition, I schedule payments and they don't show on the website (although I receive emails stating the payment has been scheduled).  But with that said, I have had no problems with their service, hence the 2 stars.

The physical washington gas location has very pleasant employees, I even had to call the emergency line once because of my carbon monoxide alarms going off. Despite it being around 2 am they had someone at my house in about 20 minutes to check everything. As far as paying bills or getting ahold of someone on the phone it would be hard to give this company even 2 stars, everything is outsouced to the Philippines I believe. The bill pay area of Their website is a mess, its so bad now I just go pay my bill at their office despite the inconvenience.

HORRIBLE experience with their phone customer service on multiple instances.  The only reason I am giving two stars is because when I HAD to go to a center in person, the woman there was helpful and apologetic.  I was trying to start service from out of state and my apartment complex was very clear that I couldn't get the keys until I gave them utility account numbers.  I spent at least an hour and a half on hold total during all of my calls, they couldn't transfer service over the phone and asked me if I lived in Vermont (I was moving from RI to VA), told me to fax or email two forms of ID and my lease agreement (which I did), and after speaking to numerous people, I was told I had to set it up in person.  I lived 7 hours away!  Luckily, my complex worked with me and I went after I had moved in.  As I said, the woman who helped me was able to set up my account in MINUTES and had no idea why they wouldn't do it over the phone, apologizing to me.  And THEN, two weeks later, I get a letter in the mail saying that they received my email with my lease agreement but need two forms of ID, had mis-typed my email address, AND clearly, I already have service.  I don't think I've ever dealt with such incompetent customer service.  Hopefully I won't have to deal with them again until I move out!

This service via the phone is absolutely horrible. I am a new customer and they gave me a 5 hour window for the time to wait. A little long but I requested they come first thing in the morning. I have done this with every other utility company and they usually come earlier in the morning rather than later. They said I would receive a confirmation call. No confirmation call the day before so I called to confirm. There are still nothing in the notes as requested to ask the technician to come earlier in the morning. I request them to add it in the notes again. Well the morning is progressing so I call to see if they are still coming. Even though I called in twice, there is still nothing in the notes and they cannot call the technician to verify because guess what, they are in the Phillipines.

Since no one in customer service seems to be listening to me I have had to go to social media to see if I can get help. I have been waiting over two months to get gas installed in my house. I am converting my oven, water heater and fireplace. I am waiting at my house for the fourth time for someone to install the meter. First and second time no one showed up. Third time they showed up but I need to Airflow to add a piece of equipment. This has been installed so I called and setup an appointment. I called Washington Gas yesterday and got confirmation someone was coming today and I called this morning and they confirmed again. I am now on the phone and have been told that they are not coming. Four days out of work and my window was 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Now my husband will have to be at the house on Friday from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. This is ridiculous. If there was another gas company I could use I would be out of here. Someone high up needs to know that there is no communication with customers, customer service, dispatch and contractors. This is only the tip of the iceberg of what I have been through.

Washington Gas turned off the gas to my house because they were fixing a leak in their system at the street. They left a note on the door at 4 am on Thursday 6/29 saying they had turned off the gas. I don't use the door where they left the note, so I saw it Sat morning 7/1 and called to have the gas turned back on, but was told that Washington Gas doesn't work on weekends so it would be Monday at the earliest that they could turn the gas back on. Unbelievable. They can't turn the gas on because Washington Gas technicians don't work weekends. I have been paying my bill on time at this address for 31 years. Now I'm stuck with no hot water or gas to cook with for at least the weekend. Terrible customer service. Especially for a utility that the public depends on.

Literally the worst company I have had the displeasure of trying to work with. I tried to turn on gas in my new house and they said it would take 5 days from the day I called to make that happen. I accepted that and suffered through cold showers and not cooking for the time being. Then comes my Monday appointment, of which they gave me the time frame of 7am-5pm!! I quite literally had to cancel anything I had scheduled for the day, and well yes surprise surprise they did not show up!!! They finally agreed to come out and said it would be around midnight?! Are you joking?? What kind of company is this!! And so alas, I am with no gas going for a week now and still unsure if they will come tomorrow. They can't guarantee a single thing. WORST COMPANY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This place would be a negative if yelp allowed it. As is evidenced by the reviews, wash gas should be investigated by the attorney generals of all three jurisdictions

Washington Gas is the worst utility company EVER! In anticipation for a May 30th move to Hyattsville, MD, I called on May 15 to have the gas turned on and placed n my name. When I moved in on the 30th, there was no Gas Service. I called and they said there was perhaps an issue with the gas line. They scheduled a technician to arrive some time on Friday, June 2nd. Mind you, they can't give you an ETA or time of day for the technician, so you have to be home all day. This doesn't work out if you have a job that doesn't allow you to take off with short notice. I called the morning of June 2nd to confirm the appointment. The customer service rep said it looked like I had no contract! So she set up a contract and then confirmed that a tech would be out to service the line. I waited all day and the tech was a NO SHOW! I called first thing Monday (today) and the rep said they had too many emergency calls to get to my order on Friday. She promised someone would be out today. The tech showed up about an hour later, however he was ACROSS THE STREET! I had to wave him down. He came by and asked my name. According to his tablet, my name was placed on the account for the vacant house across the street. And he told me he couldn't service my gas line because the order was made for the other house and its meter number. So I had to call the Washington Gas AGAIN to walk them through the process of associating my name with the correct address. Thankfully the rep I worked with was willing to take things slow, confirm the information, and had it reviewed by her manager. Although she said it could take up to 3 days to get someone out, she promised someone would be out today. My fingers are crossed. Washington Gas, shame on you for treating your customers like they don't matter because of the monopoly you have on the D.C. Area!!!!

Why am I not surprised that this terrible company has 1 star?For the past, two years since I've had WG, every few months they contact me saying they have not received payments. I then have to log on to my account and send screen shots. This is the third time it is happening. Seriously guys, maybe update your technology or get a staff has a brain. #1 reason can't wait to move out of the area so never have to deal with them.

Another one star review! What a horrible company. 1. The website. Was down for almost a year and then sporadically works. 2. You cannot autopay you must send a check3. Phone service... wait on hold and then listen to this lady prattle on about what the company will not or cannot do in a sing song voice over and over again 4. Moving out: you have to send them PROOF of moving out or they will send you a bill to your NEW address for your OLD address. Does that make any sense whatsoever???Terrible company!

The worst company in the world. Put it this way, once they make a mistake on their end, all hell breaks lose. You'll find yourself in stressful situations from constant emails and calls that will get you absolutely nowhere. Managers that say they will help, and nothing happens. Lies and deceitful 'back office' that doesn't communicate with one another. Just a complete nightmare.

Not sure I have a single positive thing to say about this business. It's frustrating that there aren't any other options. When I moved into my apartment, the former landlord (who is also a moron) told me my gas was taken care of. Trusting him, I never tried to sign up for an account. The gas was working just fine and continued to work for the next year and two months. One day, I notice it stops working so I call the landlord (at this point, it's a new landlord). He calls the gas company, and they tell me that it's been turned off because no one has paid the bill. What? They say I need to call so I do. I get this completely rude and ignorant person on the phone, who tells me it's my fault and that I was "naive" to think I could just get free gas. I tell her, no, my landlord told me it was included but that also if it hadn't been paid they should have sent notice. She said they don't send notices, as it's the customers responsibility to know when they haven't paid a bill. I ask her why after FIFTEEN months of unpaid service, they wouldn't notify a single person. She begins to get angry and say it's my fault, basically tells me I don't understand how utility payments work, and that I have to pay an outstanding balance of $370 in order to regain service. She also told me I would have to bring a copy of my lease to the office in DC in order to pay these bills. I tell her I don't really have time do to all that and she says that's my problem, too bad. After talking to several different people, I finally managed to get a very sweet woman on the phone, who said the other woman was only trying to make things hard for me. I eventually had the situation resolved with this nice woman, but holy crap. This company knows it has you trapped so it doesn't care if it provides horrible service.

Based on my experience and those of my neighbors in Georgetown,  Washington Gas is not accountable, transparent, or communicative when it comes to repairing gas lines and related infrastructure above and below our streets.

Literally everyone I have talked to in customer service here had been rude and short tempered. At one point I was literally told that I had missed my appointment because I wasn't home when I in fact took the whole day off to stay at home just for them. The man whom came out to actually turn on my gas was very pleasant though.







Washington Gas,
Your payment options are unbelievably torturous. Your website never works! And your telephone assistance is sub-par, repetitive, annoying, and unproductive. It takes 20 mins to make a payment if you're lucky and don't get hung up on for one mistaken number entered. Please upgrade your services.

                                                   Sincerely.
                                     At my wits end with you!







Rating systems need to have negative stars for "messed up" circumstances.

When calling for service you have to wait the entire day because they do not give time windows.  If they don't show up then oh, well try again another day.  They are very good at turning your gas off.  Not so much with getting it turned back on.  Some techs call but most don't.  One showed up about two to three days after I called (at a time when no one would be home).  I am literally at the complaining to third parties stage.  Seriously consider going all electric if you have the funds.  I even received a gas delivery charge when my house currently has no gas for about a month.







Since no one in customer service seems to be listening to me I have had to go to social media to see if I can get help. I have been waiting over two months to get gas installed in my house. I am converting my oven, water heater and fireplace. I am waiting at my house for the fourth time for someone to install the meter. First and second time no one showed up. Third time they showed up but I need to Airflow to add a piece of equipment. This has been installed so I called and setup an appointment. I called Washington Gas yesterday and got confirmation someone was coming today and I called this morning and they confirmed again. I am now on the phone and have been told that they are not coming. Four days out of work and my window was 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Now my husband will have to be at the house on Friday from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. This is ridiculous. If there was another gas company I could use I would be out of here. Someone high up needs to know that there is no communication with customers, customer service, dispatch and contractors. This is only the tip of the iceberg of what I have been through.







Washington Gas turned off the gas to my house because they were fixing a leak in their system at the street. They left a note on the door at 4 am on Thursday 6/29 saying they had turned off the gas. I don't use the door where they left the note, so I saw it Sat morning 7/1 and called to have the gas turned back on, but was told that Washington Gas doesn't work on weekends so it would be Monday at the earliest that they could turn the gas back on. 

Unbelievable. They can't turn the gas on because Washington Gas technicians don't work weekends. I have been paying my bill on time at this address for 31 years. Now I'm stuck with no hot water or gas to cook with for at least the weekend. Terrible customer service. Especially for a utility that the public depends on.







Literally the worst company I have had the displeasure of trying to work with. I tried to turn on gas in my new house and they said it would take 5 days from the day I called to make that happen. I accepted that and suffered through cold showers and not cooking for the time being. Then comes my Monday appointment, of which they gave me the time frame of 7am-5pm!! I quite literally had to cancel anything I had scheduled for the day, and well yes surprise surprise they did not show up!!! They finally agreed to come out and said it would be around midnight?! Are you joking?? What kind of company is this!! And so alas, I am with no gas going for a week now and still unsure if they will come tomorrow. They can't guarantee a single thing. WORST COMPANY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!







This place would be a negative if yelp allowed it. As is evidenced by the reviews, wash gas should be investigated by the attorney generals of all three jurisdictions







Washington Gas is the worst utility company EVER! In anticipation for a May 30th move to Hyattsville, MD, I called on May 15 to have the gas turned on and placed n my name. When I moved in on the 30th, there was no Gas Service. I called and they said there was perhaps an issue with the gas line. They scheduled a technician to arrive some time on Friday, June 2nd. Mind you, they can't give you an ETA or time of day for the technician, so you have to be home all day. This doesn't work out if you have a job that doesn't allow you to take off with short notice. I called the morning of June 2nd to confirm the appointment. The customer service rep said it looked like I had no contract! So she set up a contract and then confirmed that a tech would be out to service the line. I waited all day and the tech was a NO SHOW! I called first thing Monday (today) and the rep said they had too many emergency calls to get to my order on Friday. She promised someone would be out today. The tech showed up about an hour later, however he was ACROSS THE STREET! I had to wave him down. He came by and asked my name. According to his tablet, my name was placed on the account for the vacant house across the street. And he told me he couldn't service my gas line because the order was made for the other house and its meter number. So I had to call the Washington Gas AGAIN to walk them through the process of associating my name with the correct address. Thankfully the rep I worked with was willing to take things slow, confirm the information, and had it reviewed by her manager. Although she said it could take up to 3 days to get someone out, she promised someone would be out today. My fingers are crossed. Washington Gas, shame on you for treating your customers like they don't matter because of the monopoly you have on the D.C. Area!!!!







Why am I not surprised that this terrible company has 1 star?

For the past, two years since I've had WG, every few months they contact me saying they have not received payments. I then have to log on to my account and send screen shots. This is the third time it is happening. Seriously guys, maybe update your technology or get a staff has a brain. #1 reason can't wait to move out of the area so never have to deal with them.







Another one star review! What a horrible company. 

1. The website. Was down for almost a year and then sporadically works. 
2. You cannot autopay you must send a check
3. Phone service... wait on hold and then listen to this lady prattle on about what the company will not or cannot do in a sing song voice over and over again 
4. Moving out: you have to send them PROOF of moving out or they will send you a bill to your NEW address for your OLD address. Does that make any sense whatsoever???

Terrible company!







The worst company in the world. Put it this way, once they make a mistake on their end, all hell breaks lose. You'll find yourself in stressful situations from constant emails and calls that will get you absolutely nowhere. Managers that say they will help, and nothing happens. Lies and deceitful 'back office' that doesn't communicate with one another. Just a complete nightmare.







Not sure I have a single positive thing to say about this business. It's frustrating that there aren't any other options. When I moved into my apartment, the former landlord (who is also a moron) told me my gas was taken care of. Trusting him, I never tried to sign up for an account. The gas was working just fine and continued to work for the next year and two months. One day, I notice it stops working so I call the landlord (at this point, it's a new landlord). He calls the gas company, and they tell me that it's been turned off because no one has paid the bill. What? They say I need to call so I do. I get this completely rude and ignorant person on the phone, who tells me it's my fault and that I was "naive" to think I could just get free gas. I tell her, no, my landlord told me it was included but that also if it hadn't been paid they should have sent notice. She said they don't send notices, as it's the customers responsibility to know when they haven't paid a bill. I ask her why after FIFTEEN months of unpaid service, they wouldn't notify a single person. She begins to get angry and say it's my fault, basically tells me I don't understand how utility payments work, and that I have to pay an outstanding balance of $370 in order to regain service. She also told me I would have to bring a copy of my lease to the office in DC in order to pay these bills. I tell her I don't really have time do to all that and she says that's my problem, too bad. After talking to several different people, I finally managed to get a very sweet woman on the phone, who said the other woman was only trying to make things hard for me. I eventually had the situation resolved with this nice woman, but holy crap. This company knows it has you trapped so it doesn't care if it provides horrible service.







Based on my experience and those of my neighbors in Georgetown,  Washington Gas is not accountable, transparent, or communicative when it comes to repairing gas lines and related infrastructure above and below our streets.







Their customer services is does not exist.  Their website gives you a phone number, which you them have a computer direct you through recorded answers and it is hard to get someone on the phone.  I had ended my service when I moved out of my apartment, but recently discovered that I was still being charged. I sent in information for a refund and I'm here a month later with no response besides, allow sufficient time for an investigation. A month should be enough time with all the documentation I provided.. still out over $200 of a refund.

and after speaking with someone and letting them know i moved out.. i just got charged again.. this is RIDICULOUS







Yelp needs a negative star rating... 

Washington Gas customer support people are utterly useless.  Both from calling their support number and e-mailing customersupport@washgas.com.  Took me over a month to finally resolve a billing issue, where the home builder's bill was on my account.  

Over the course of a month, I spoke with several customer support reps and maybe one or two were truly helpful. E-mailing customersupport@washgas.com is even worse. All they do is copy and paste pre-written bullshit and then write some bullshit saying your clarification request is still being processed. Nothing I received by e-mail was ever helpful. 

So pretty much their customer support is useless, cause they have a back office that actually solves the issues. It would seem like issues get lost in translation from customer support to their back office. 

The problem was that someone on the Wash Gas end screwed up when I called before closing to have the account transfer to my name on my requested effective date, which caused the builder's bill to show up in my account. 

Whatever, finally got it resolved. Try to hire some smarter people for your customer support.







Without question the worst customer service of any utility or customer focused organization that I have ever dealt with.  You cannot talk to anyone who makes a decision or schedules people.  

Having problems with your meter, they tell you to plan to wait all day.

Want a meter moved, they contract that out to someone and do not plan to get it ever scheduled.

Want to talk to a scheduler for either.  They are not available and the customer service line will tell you they are not allowed to talk to them

When they came to move the meter, they told me I needed a new line from the meter to the street.  This is an expense they need to incur, I have never heard back from them.

Without question, the CEO of Washington Gas should be the next CEO of United Airlines, because they would be my all stars for pathetic approaches to customers.







I would give them zero stars if i could. Worst customer service. 
Ive had the worst experience dealing with washington gas. They took a deposit from me that was supposed to be refunded to me in December 2016. Six months and 20 calls later, I still have not received my deposit.  WG should not be a monopoly. We should be able to choose our gas company!







This is the worst company I have ever dealt with in my life. Not only did I have to call repeatedly to be CHARGED for my bill (never received a bill in the mail or online), but they never even read my meter! Then, I was nervous that my roommates would move out and they would charge me a huge backed-up bill b/c they never sent it, and this is exactly what happened which left me stuck with the bill. I have zero idea how this company operates, but the people in charge need to be held accountable for this completely terrible service. I still have yet to receive a bill even after I called to give THEM my money. Absurd!!! They also overcharged me on the one bill that they did send!







This utility has the worst customer "service" I have ever encountered!  Huge problem on my bill (their fault) and they refused to explain it to me.  Refused!  I wish I had an alternative.  I would like to give them negative stars!  Website is the worst!







If it was possible to get zero stars that would be my preference.  It is currently below freezing in DC, just moved here and setting up service. The apt I am renting has no heat or hot water turned on when I moved in, which is normal. I have asthma (haven't had an attack in years) that is triggered by the cold and have already used by breathing machine 2x this weekend and had to get a hotel sunday night.  I had a service window from 7am-5pm Monday. The guy called at 3:15 and said he was on his way. Called the gas company at 5pm and he was pulled onto another job... they weren't going to call or reschedule.  I asked them to please come out, my asthma was really bad from being in the cold apt all day and I was having serious trouble breathing at this point, and having difficulty even getting my words out to the technician.  I called 8x (8x) to express that I am in an emergency situation, have no where to go in a new city and can't afford another hotel bc they cannot honor their commitment... I put my health in jeopardy to honor the time slot they provided but they didn't seem to care. I was told over and over again... this is not an emergency for them and if I want to go to the hospital that is my choice.  My husband then called and pleaded for the supervisor to have some sympathy for an asthmatic that is having an attack bc they didn't honor their commitment.  They said a technician would be here by midnight. I just received another call (it's 11pm)... they are hoping someone will get here by 1am!!!  So let just pretend they will show up tonight, I would have been waiting here for 18 hours. I am currently attached to my breathing machine, which I haven't used in years. The people at Washington gas have no humanity.  One woman I spoke to told me her son has asthma and she knows how scary and painful an attack is... but she still can't help me. If I were you, I would expect the least from this company and then you may end up having a satisfactory experience.

It looks like we don't have a specific address for Washington Gas, which makes giving directions tricky. This business might not have an official storefront, or it might move to multiple locations throughout the day.
Give me directions anyway...

Washington Gas turned off the gas to my house because they were fixing a leak in their system at the street. They left a note on the door at 4 am on Thursday 6/29 saying they had turned off the gas. I don't use the door where they left the note, so I saw it Sat morning 7/1 and called to have the gas turned back on, but was told that Washington Gas doesn't work on weekends so it would be Monday at the earliest that they could turn the gas back on. Unbelievable. They can't turn the gas on because Washington Gas technicians don't work weekends. I have been paying my bill on time at this address for 31 years. Now I'm stuck with no hot water or gas to cook with for at least the weekend. Terrible customer service. Especially for a utility that the public depends on.

Literally the worst company I have had the displeasure of trying to work with. I tried to turn on gas in my new house and they said it would take 5 days from the day I called to make that happen. I accepted that and suffered through cold showers and not cooking for the time being. Then comes my Monday appointment, of which they gave me the time frame of 7am-5pm!! I quite literally had to cancel anything I had scheduled for the day, and well yes surprise surprise they did not show up!!! They finally agreed to come out and said it would be around midnight?! Are you joking?? What kind of company is this!! And so alas, I am with no gas going for a week now and still unsure if they will come tomorrow. They can't guarantee a single thing. WORST COMPANY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

This place would be a negative if yelp allowed it. As is evidenced by the reviews, wash gas should be investigated by the attorney generals of all three jurisdictions

Washington Gas is the worst utility company EVER! In anticipation for a May 30th move to Hyattsville, MD, I called on May 15 to have the gas turned on and placed n my name. When I moved in on the 30th, there was no Gas Service. I called and they said there was perhaps an issue with the gas line. They scheduled a technician to arrive some time on Friday, June 2nd. Mind you, they can't give you an ETA or time of day for the technician, so you have to be home all day. This doesn't work out if you have a job that doesn't allow you to take off with short notice. I called the morning of June 2nd to confirm the appointment. The customer service rep said it looked like I had no contract! So she set up a contract and then confirmed that a tech would be out to service the line. I waited all day and the tech was a NO SHOW! I called first thing Monday (today) and the rep said they had too many emergency calls to get to my order on Friday. She promised someone would be out today. The tech showed up about an hour later, however he was ACROSS THE STREET! I had to wave him down. He came by and asked my name. According to his tablet, my name was placed on the account for the vacant house across the street. And he told me he couldn't service my gas line because the order was made for the other house and its meter number. So I had to call the Washington Gas AGAIN to walk them through the process of associating my name with the correct address. Thankfully the rep I worked with was willing to take things slow, confirm the information, and had it reviewed by her manager. Although she said it could take up to 3 days to get someone out, she promised someone would be out today. My fingers are crossed. Washington Gas, shame on you for treating your customers like they don't matter because of the monopoly you have on the D.C. Area!!!!

Why am I not surprised that this terrible company has 1 star?For the past, two years since I've had WG, every few months they contact me saying they have not received payments. I then have to log on to my account and send screen shots. This is the third time it is happening. Seriously guys, maybe update your technology or get a staff has a brain. #1 reason can't wait to move out of the area so never have to deal with them.

Another one star review! What a horrible company. 1. The website. Was down for almost a year and then sporadically works. 2. You cannot autopay you must send a check3. Phone service... wait on hold and then listen to this lady prattle on about what the company will not or cannot do in a sing song voice over and over again 4. Moving out: you have to send them PROOF of moving out or they will send you a bill to your NEW address for your OLD address. Does that make any sense whatsoever???Terrible company!

The worst company in the world. Put it this way, once they make a mistake on their end, all hell breaks lose. You'll find yourself in stressful situations from constant emails and calls that will get you absolutely nowhere. Managers that say they will help, and nothing happens. Lies and deceitful 'back office' that doesn't communicate with one another. Just a complete nightmare.

Not sure I have a single positive thing to say about this business. It's frustrating that there aren't any other options. When I moved into my apartment, the former landlord (who is also a moron) told me my gas was taken care of. Trusting him, I never tried to sign up for an account. The gas was working just fine and continued to work for the next year and two months. One day, I notice it stops working so I call the landlord (at this point, it's a new landlord). He calls the gas company, and they tell me that it's been turned off because no one has paid the bill. What? They say I need to call so I do. I get this completely rude and ignorant person on the phone, who tells me it's my fault and that I was "naive" to think I could just get free gas. I tell her, no, my landlord told me it was included but that also if it hadn't been paid they should have sent notice. She said they don't send notices, as it's the customers responsibility to know when they haven't paid a bill. I ask her why after FIFTEEN months of unpaid service, they wouldn't notify a single person. She begins to get angry and say it's my fault, basically tells me I don't understand how utility payments work, and that I have to pay an outstanding balance of $370 in order to regain service. She also told me I would have to bring a copy of my lease to the office in DC in order to pay these bills. I tell her I don't really have time do to all that and she says that's my problem, too bad. After talking to several different people, I finally managed to get a very sweet woman on the phone, who said the other woman was only trying to make things hard for me. I eventually had the situation resolved with this nice woman, but holy crap. This company knows it has you trapped so it doesn't care if it provides horrible service.

Based on my experience and those of my neighbors in Georgetown,  Washington Gas is not accountable, transparent, or communicative when it comes to repairing gas lines and related infrastructure above and below our streets.

Their customer services is does not exist.  Their website gives you a phone number, which you them have a computer direct you through recorded answers and it is hard to get someone on the phone.  I had ended my service when I moved out of my apartment, but recently discovered that I was still being charged. I sent in information for a refund and I'm here a month later with no response besides, allow sufficient time for an investigation. A month should be enough time with all the documentation I provided.. still out over $200 of a refund.and after speaking with someone and letting them know i moved out.. i just got charged again.. this is RIDICULOUS

Yelp needs a negative star rating... Washington Gas customer support people are utterly useless.  Both from calling their support number and e-mailing customersupport@washgas.….  Took me over a month to finally resolve a billing issue, where the home builder's bill was on my account.  Over the course of a month, I spoke with several customer support reps and maybe one or two were truly helpful. E-mailing customersupport@washgas.… is even worse. All they do is copy and paste pre-written bullshit and then write some bullshit saying your clarification request is still being processed. Nothing I received by e-mail was ever helpful. So pretty much their customer support is useless, cause they have a back office that actually solves the issues. It would seem like issues get lost in translation from customer support to their back office. The problem was that someone on the Wash Gas end screwed up when I called before closing to have the account transfer to my name on my requested effective date, which caused the builder's bill to show up in my account. Whatever, finally got it resolved. Try to hire some smarter people for your customer support.

Without question the worst customer service of any utility or customer focused organization that I have ever dealt with.  You cannot talk to anyone who makes a decision or schedules people.  Having problems with your meter, they tell you to plan to wait all day.Want a meter moved, they contract that out to someone and do not plan to get it ever scheduled.Want to talk to a scheduler for either.  They are not available and the customer service line will tell you they are not allowed to talk to themWhen they came to move the meter, they told me I needed a new line from the meter to the street.  This is an expense they need to incur, I have never heard back from them.Without question, the CEO of Washington Gas should be the next CEO of United Airlines, because they would be my all stars for pathetic approaches to customers.

I would give them zero stars if i could. Worst customer service. Ive had the worst experience dealing with washington gas. They took a deposit from me that was supposed to be refunded to me in December 2016. Six months and 20 calls later, I still have not received my deposit.  WG should not be a monopoly. We should be able to choose our gas company!

This is the worst company I have ever dealt with in my life. Not only did I have to call repeatedly to be CHARGED for my bill (never received a bill in the mail or online), but they never even read my meter! Then, I was nervous that my roommates would move out and they would charge me a huge backed-up bill b/c they never sent it, and this is exactly what happened which left me stuck with the bill. I have zero idea how this company operates, but the people in charge need to be held accountable for this completely terrible service. I still have yet to receive a bill even after I called to give THEM my money. Absurd!!! They also overcharged me on the one bill that they did send!

If it was possible to get zero stars that would be my preference.  It is currently below freezing in DC, just moved here and setting up service. The apt I am renting has no heat or hot water turned on when I moved in, which is normal. I have asthma (haven't had an attack in years) that is triggered by the cold and have already used by breathing machine 2x this weekend and had to get a hotel sunday night.  I had a service window from 7am-5pm Monday. The guy called at 3:15 and said he was on his way. Called the gas company at 5pm and he was pulled onto another job... they weren't going to call or reschedule.  I asked them to please come out, my asthma was really bad from being in the cold apt all day and I was having serious trouble breathing at this point, and having difficulty even getting my words out to the technician.  I called 8x (8x) to express that I am in an emergency situation, have no where to go in a new city and can't afford another hotel bc they cannot honor their commitment... I put my health in jeopardy to honor the time slot they provided but they didn't seem to care. I was told over and over again... this is not an emergency for them and if I want to go to the hospital that is my choice.  My husband then called and pleaded for the supervisor to have some sympathy for an asthmatic that is having an attack bc they didn't honor their commitment.  They said a technician would be here by midnight. I just received another call (it's 11pm)... they are hoping someone will get here by 1am!!!  So let just pretend they will show up tonight, I would have been waiting here for 18 hours. I am currently attached to my breathing machine, which I haven't used in years. The people at Washington gas have no humanity.  One woman I spoke to told me her son has asthma and she knows how scary and painful an attack is... but she still can't help me. If I were you, I would expect the least from this company and then you may end up having a satisfactory experience.

Their website may just well be the worst on the internet.  My guess is it was designed in 1997.  Its slow, and the bill pay service is archaic. Good luck getting anything of substance from the site.  I have signed up for auto-pay and budget billing multiple times but it never goes into effect.  In addition, I schedule payments and they don't show on the website (although I receive emails stating the payment has been scheduled).  

But with that said, I have had no problems with their service, hence the 2 stars.







Washington Gas,
Your payment options are unbelievably torturous. Your website never works! And your telephone assistance is sub-par, repetitive, annoying, and unproductive. It takes 20 mins to make a payment if you're lucky and don't get hung up on for one mistaken number entered. Please upgrade your services.

                                                   Sincerely.
                                     At my wits end with you!







Why am I not surprised that this terrible company has 1 star?

For the past, two years since I've had WG, every few months they contact me saying they have not received payments. I then have to log on to my account and send screen shots. This is the third time it is happening. Seriously guys, maybe update your technology or get a staff has a brain. #1 reason can't wait to move out of the area so never have to deal with them.







Another one star review! What a horrible company. 

1. The website. Was down for almost a year and then sporadically works. 
2. You cannot autopay you must send a check
3. Phone service... wait on hold and then listen to this lady prattle on about what the company will not or cannot do in a sing song voice over and over again 
4. Moving out: you have to send them PROOF of moving out or they will send you a bill to your NEW address for your OLD address. Does that make any sense whatsoever???

Terrible company!







Yelp needs a negative star rating... 

Washington Gas customer support people are utterly useless.  Both from calling their support number and e-mailing customersupport@washgas.com.  Took me over a month to finally resolve a billing issue, where the home builder's bill was on my account.  

Over the course of a month, I spoke with several customer support reps and maybe one or two were truly helpful. E-mailing customersupport@washgas.com is even worse. All they do is copy and paste pre-written bullshit and then write some bullshit saying your clarification request is still being processed. Nothing I received by e-mail was ever helpful. 

So pretty much their customer support is useless, cause they have a back office that actually solves the issues. It would seem like issues get lost in translation from customer support to their back office. 

The problem was that someone on the Wash Gas end screwed up when I called before closing to have the account transfer to my name on my requested effective date, which caused the builder's bill to show up in my account. 

Whatever, finally got it resolved. Try to hire some smarter people for your customer support.







Rating systems need to have negative stars for "messed up" circumstances.

When calling for service you have to wait the entire day because they do not give time windows.  If they don't show up then oh, well try again another day.  They are very good at turning your gas off.  Not so much with getting it turned back on.  Some techs call but most don't.  One showed up about two to three days after I called (at a time when no one would be home).  I am literally at the complaining to third parties stage.  Seriously consider going all electric if you have the funds.  I even received a gas delivery charge when my house currently has no gas for about a month.







I haven't even moved into the apartment that requires a Washington Gas account yet, and I can already see that the next year or more of dealing with this is going to be pure, unmitigated hell.

As everyone else has already said, their website is a complete abomination. It astounds me that this company can provide service to such a large area and have zero regard for the necessity of a functional website. To begin with, it is impossible to create the online profile that is required to set up autopay. You can try, as I did, multiple times on multiple days for multiple weeks, and you will continuously get an error message. I emailed their help desk and their response was essentially, "Yes, sorry about that, we've been having technical difficulties. Bye." I responded with something along the lines of, "Ok so I just... don't make an online profile then?" No response.

That was just the beginning.

We just had service started to this apartment (which we haven't actually moved into yet), so I suspected we would have a service initiation fee of some sort. But, strangely enough, when I checked my balance online, it said $0. When I called and tried to pay my balance through the automated system, it also said it was $0. Since we don't live in the apartment yet, we haven't been getting the mail there, so I can't verify whether or not they sent a paper bill. That shouldn't matter, though, because it's 2017 and every establishment in existence is expected to have some type of virtual payment method that prevents you from having to rely on paper statements and send physical checks.

Once I speak to a human, he confirms that I do indeed owe a $15 fee due in six days. Mhm. I ask him how I am supposed to go about paying that seeing as both the website and automated phone payment system think my balance is $0. After informing me that "The problem is not us, ma'am, the problem is the internet," he redirects me to... the same automated number that won't let me pay because it thinks my account balance is $0. Thanks, man!

So I call again. I speak to a second person and explain the issue I'm having. She casually tells me that it's showing up as a $0 balance because I don't have an actual gas bill added to it yet.

"But the $15 is still due on the 13th... and I have to pay it by the 13th?"

"Yes ma'am."

"Can I go ahead and do that then?"

"Hold on while I redirect you to someone who can help you with that." 

BACK TO THE AUTOMATED PAYMENT LINE. 

I call a third time. I speak to a third person. I explain that this is my third time calling and that I have no way to pay the $15 balance I wouldn't even have known about if I hadn't called to ask. She tries to direct me to the automated payment line again. NOPE. NO. ABSOLUTELY NO. THAT'S NOT WORKING. "I'm sorry for the technical issues, ma'am, and I suggest you try the line again in a few hours." NO. DEFINITELY NOT. Reluctantly, she finally tells me she can accept a check over the phone and takes my bank account/routing numbers, which I'm assuming worked because she gave me a confirmation number (only after having me wait and sharing that she, too, was having "technical difficulties.") 

I'm 90% sure she also called me "dude" at some point during this conversation, but I can only hope I misheard her. 

So we're done now. I'm ready to hang up. I have supposedly (we'll find out) paid my balance. Right before saying goodbye, she chimes to me, "Remember that in the future, you can always review your balance and pay your bill online!"

"Well obviously I can't, because it doesn't work-"

"Have a nice day, ma'am, and let me direct you to our quick customer service survey."  

Kill me.







Since no one in customer service seems to be listening to me I have had to go to social media to see if I can get help. I have been waiting over two months to get gas installed in my house. I am converting my oven, water heater and fireplace. I am waiting at my house for the fourth time for someone to install the meter. First and second time no one showed up. Third time they showed up but I need to Airflow to add a piece of equipment. This has been installed so I called and setup an appointment. I called Washington Gas yesterday and got confirmation someone was coming today and I called this morning and they confirmed again. I am now on the phone and have been told that they are not coming. Four days out of work and my window was 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Now my husband will have to be at the house on Friday from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. This is ridiculous. If there was another gas company I could use I would be out of here. Someone high up needs to know that there is no communication with customers, customer service, dispatch and contractors. This is only the tip of the iceberg of what I have been through.







Washington Gas turned off the gas to my house because they were fixing a leak in their system at the street. They left a note on the door at 4 am on Thursday 6/29 saying they had turned off the gas. I don't use the door where they left the note, so I saw it Sat morning 7/1 and called to have the gas turned back on, but was told that Washington Gas doesn't work on weekends so it would be Monday at the earliest that they could turn the gas back on. 

Unbelievable. They can't turn the gas on because Washington Gas technicians don't work weekends. I have been paying my bill on time at this address for 31 years. Now I'm stuck with no hot water or gas to cook with for at least the weekend. Terrible customer service. Especially for a utility that the public depends on.







Without question the worst customer service of any utility or customer focused organization that I have ever dealt with.  You cannot talk to anyone who makes a decision or schedules people.  

Having problems with your meter, they tell you to plan to wait all day.

Want a meter moved, they contract that out to someone and do not plan to get it ever scheduled.

Want to talk to a scheduler for either.  They are not available and the customer service line will tell you they are not allowed to talk to them

When they came to move the meter, they told me I needed a new line from the meter to the street.  This is an expense they need to incur, I have never heard back from them.

Without question, the CEO of Washington Gas should be the next CEO of United Airlines, because they would be my all stars for pathetic approaches to customers.







This place would be a negative if yelp allowed it. As is evidenced by the reviews, wash gas should be investigated by the attorney generals of all three jurisdictions







I hardly ever write reviews but was compelled to add my warnings to the many others about Washington Gas.

METICULOUSLY REVIEW YOUR BILLS!  After my first bill their auto-pay system failed to draft my bank account for the second and subsequent bills.  Since I have never experienced issues before in 17 years of using auto-pay for utilities, I didn't look at the bills posted on my Washington Gas account online.  It wasn't until Washington Gas physically mailed me a disconnect warning that I signed into my account to see what was going on and saw that auto-draft was not working.  My mistake for not assuming they might be incompetent.  Then they added a $65 deposit charge to my next bill since my payment had been considered "late" even though the lateness was due to their auto-pay system failure.  Fine, whatever.

Thereafter, I opted out of auto-pay and manually paid each bill online each month.  Interestingly, the first payment manually made online was reflected in the account payment history and the next bill as expected; but subsequent payments for subsequent bills were not credited to the bills even though they are listed in the account payment history.  They took my money but never credited my account. 

I called Customer Service for an explanation; the representative agreed that she saw the payments but I wasn't getting credited in the bills.  She forwarded the matter to the billing department where they should investigate the issue and have a resolution in 14 days.  I asked why doesn't she just transfer me to that department while I was on the phone so we could resolve it immediately and she responded that they have to follow a process, which takes two weeks to complete.  Wow.

I am moving out of the country in about a week so I imagine that it will be a source of unneeded frustration to collect the $65 deposit and get a resolution to their billing issues while I'm overseas.

I'll leave you with one positive; the Customer Service representatives are courteous and professional despite working with a problematic computer system.  When scheduling a stop date for my service, it literally took the representative over five minutes before she could access my account and over 10 minutes more just to setup the stop service date and forwarding address.  They must be using Tandy computers leftover from 1984 with 300 baud modems to connect to the internet!







The worst company in the world. Put it this way, once they make a mistake on their end, all hell breaks lose. You'll find yourself in stressful situations from constant emails and calls that will get you absolutely nowhere. Managers that say they will help, and nothing happens. Lies and deceitful 'back office' that doesn't communicate with one another. Just a complete nightmare.







Common Sense, where are you?  After being told a technician would be here today between 8 a.m and 1 pm, I called WG at 2;30 to ask where they were.  No one has called, no one has come.  I was told by two different "supervisors" that "Our dispatchers have no way of reaching our technicians once they are out in the field."

Seriously?  I asked, "what if there was an emergency and you had to contact them?"  Again, came the response, "Our dispatchers have NO WAY to reach our technicians once they are out in the field."

Please be on the watch for WG Technicians bouncing about in impenetrable bubbles as they float randomly from place to place.  Catch one if you can.







Based on my experience and those of my neighbors in Georgetown,  Washington Gas is not accountable, transparent, or communicative when it comes to repairing gas lines and related infrastructure above and below our streets.







reported a possible gas leak at 2:30pm and upon follow up at 4:30pm there was no record of the call. After some research found the report. No time estimate possible...
Called back at 8:30pm... no record of call .... submitted another call for leak inspection... 
Again no time estimate possible.... said just call back in 2 hours if no show.... 

Would give no star if possible.....







Their customer services is does not exist.  Their website gives you a phone number, which you them have a computer direct you through recorded answers and it is hard to get someone on the phone.  I had ended my service when I moved out of my apartment, but recently discovered that I was still being charged. I sent in information for a refund and I'm here a month later with no response besides, allow sufficient time for an investigation. A month should be enough time with all the documentation I provided.. still out over $200 of a refund.

and after speaking with someone and letting them know i moved out.. i just got charged again.. this is RIDICULOUS







I would give them zero stars if i could. Worst customer service. 
Ive had the worst experience dealing with washington gas. They took a deposit from me that was supposed to be refunded to me in December 2016. Six months and 20 calls later, I still have not received my deposit.  WG should not be a monopoly. We should be able to choose our gas company!







Literally the worst company I have had the displeasure of trying to work with. I tried to turn on gas in my new house and they said it would take 5 days from the day I called to make that happen. I accepted that and suffered through cold showers and not cooking for the time being. Then comes my Monday appointment, of which they gave me the time frame of 7am-5pm!! I quite literally had to cancel anything I had scheduled for the day, and well yes surprise surprise they did not show up!!! They finally agreed to come out and said it would be around midnight?! Are you joking?? What kind of company is this!! And so alas, I am with no gas going for a week now and still unsure if they will come tomorrow. They can't guarantee a single thing. WORST COMPANY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It looks like we don't have a specific address for Washington Gas, which makes giving directions tricky. This business might not have an official storefront, or it might move to multiple locations throughout the day.

Literally everyone I have talked to in customer service here had been rude and short tempered. At one point I was literally told that I had missed my appointment because I wasn't home when I in fact took the whole day off to stay at home just for them. The man whom came out to actually turn on my gas was very pleasant though.

Their website may just well be the worst on the internet.  My guess is it was designed in 1997.  Its slow, and the bill pay service is archaic. Good luck getting anything of substance from the site.  I have signed up for auto-pay and budget billing multiple times but it never goes into effect.  In addition, I schedule payments and they don't show on the website (although I receive emails stating the payment has been scheduled).  But with that said, I have had no problems with their service, hence the 2 stars.

Washington Gas,Your payment options are unbelievably torturous. Your website never works! And your telephone assistance is sub-par, repetitive, annoying, and unproductive. It takes 20 mins to make a payment if you're lucky and don't get hung up on for one mistaken number entered. Please upgrade your services.                                                   Sincerely.                                     At my wits end with you!

Why am I not surprised that this terrible company has 1 star?For the past, two years since I've had WG, every few months they contact me saying they have not received payments. I then have to log on to my account and send screen shots. This is the third time it is happening. Seriously guys, maybe update your technology or get a staff has a brain. #1 reason can't wait to move out of the area so never have to deal with them.

Another one star review! What a horrible company. 1. The website. Was down for almost a year and then sporadically works. 2. You cannot autopay you must send a check3. Phone service... wait on hold and then listen to this lady prattle on about what the company will not or cannot do in a sing song voice over and over again 4. Moving out: you have to send them PROOF of moving out or they will send you a bill to your NEW address for your OLD address. Does that make any sense whatsoever???Terrible company!

Yelp needs a negative star rating... Washington Gas customer support people are utterly useless.  Both from calling their support number and e-mailing customersupport@washgas.….  Took me over a month to finally resolve a billing issue, where the home builder's bill was on my account.  Over the course of a month, I spoke with several customer support reps and maybe one or two were truly helpful. E-mailing customersupport@washgas.… is even worse. All they do is copy and paste pre-written bullshit and then write some bullshit saying your clarification request is still being processed. Nothing I received by e-mail was ever helpful. So pretty much their customer support is useless, cause they have a back office that actually solves the issues. It would seem like issues get lost in translation from customer support to their back office. The problem was that someone on the Wash Gas end screwed up when I called before closing to have the account transfer to my name on my requested effective date, which caused the builder's bill to show up in my account. Whatever, finally got it resolved. Try to hire some smarter people for your customer support.

Rating systems need to have negative stars for "messed up" circumstances.When calling for service you have to wait the entire day because they do not give time windows.  If they don't show up then oh, well try again another day.  They are very good at turning your gas off.  Not so much with getting it turned back on.  Some techs call but most don't.  One showed up about two to three days after I called (at a time when no one would be home).  I am literally at the complaining to third parties stage.  Seriously consider going all electric if you have the funds.  I even received a gas delivery charge when my house currently has no gas for about a month.

I haven't even moved into the apartment that requires a Washington Gas account yet, and I can already see that the next year or more of dealing with this is going to be pure, unmitigated hell.As everyone else has already said, their website is a complete abomination. It astounds me that this company can provide service to such a large area and have zero regard for the necessity of a functional website. To begin with, it is impossible to create the online profile that is required to set up autopay. You can try, as I did, multiple times on multiple days for multiple weeks, and you will continuously get an error message. I emailed their help desk and their response was essentially, "Yes, sorry about that, we've been having technical difficulties. Bye." I responded with something along the lines of, "Ok so I just... don't make an online profile then?" No response.That was just the beginning.We just had service started to this apartment (which we haven't actually moved into yet), so I suspected we would have a service initiation fee of some sort. But, strangely enough, when I checked my balance online, it said $0. When I called and tried to pay my balance through the automated system, it also said it was $0. Since we don't live in the apartment yet, we haven't been getting the mail there, so I can't verify whether or not they sent a paper bill. That shouldn't matter, though, because it's 2017 and every establishment in existence is expected to have some type of virtual payment method that prevents you from having to rely on paper statements and send physical checks.Once I speak to a human, he confirms that I do indeed owe a $15 fee due in six days. Mhm. I ask him how I am supposed to go about paying that seeing as both the website and automated phone payment system think my balance is $0. After informing me that "The problem is not us, ma'am, the problem is the internet," he redirects me to... the same automated number that won't let me pay because it thinks my account balance is $0. Thanks, man!So I call again. I speak to a second person and explain the issue I'm having. She casually tells me that it's showing up as a $0 balance because I don't have an actual gas bill added to it yet."But the $15 is still due on the 13th... and I have to pay it by the 13th?""Yes ma'am.""Can I go ahead and do that then?""Hold on while I redirect you to someone who can help you with that." BACK TO THE AUTOMATED PAYMENT LINE. I call a third time. I speak to a third person. I explain that this is my third time calling and that I have no way to pay the $15 balance I wouldn't even have known about if I hadn't called to ask. She tries to direct me to the automated payment line again. NOPE. NO. ABSOLUTELY NO. THAT'S NOT WORKING. "I'm sorry for the technical issues, ma'am, and I suggest you try the line again in a few hours." NO. DEFINITELY NOT. Reluctantly, she finally tells me she can accept a check over the phone and takes my bank account/routing numbers, which I'm assuming worked because she gave me a confirmation number (only after having me wait and sharing that she, too, was having "technical difficulties.") I'm 90% sure she also called me "dude" at some point during this conversation, but I can only hope I misheard her. So we're done now. I'm ready to hang up. I have supposedly (we'll find out) paid my balance. Right before saying goodbye, she chimes to me, "Remember that in the future, you can always review your balance and pay your bill online!""Well obviously I can't, because it doesn't work-""Have a nice day, ma'am, and let me direct you to our quick customer service survey."  Kill me.

Since no one in customer service seems to be listening to me I have had to go to social media to see if I can get help. I have been waiting over two months to get gas installed in my house. I am converting my oven, water heater and fireplace. I am waiting at my house for the fourth time for someone to install the meter. First and second time no one showed up. Third time they showed up but I need to Airflow to add a piece of equipment. This has been installed so I called and setup an appointment. I called Washington Gas yesterday and got confirmation someone was coming today and I called this morning and they confirmed again. I am now on the phone and have been told that they are not coming. Four days out of work and my window was 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Now my husband will have to be at the house on Friday from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. This is ridiculous. If there was another gas company I could use I would be out of here. Someone high up needs to know that there is no communication with customers, customer service, dispatch and contractors. This is only the tip of the iceberg of what I have been through.

Washington Gas turned off the gas to my house because they were fixing a leak in their system at the street. They left a note on the door at 4 am on Thursday 6/29 saying they had turned off the gas. I don't use the door where they left the note, so I saw it Sat morning 7/1 and called to have the gas turned back on, but was told that Washington Gas doesn't work on weekends so it would be Monday at the earliest that they could turn the gas back on. Unbelievable. They can't turn the gas on because Washington Gas technicians don't work weekends. I have been paying my bill on time at this address for 31 years. Now I'm stuck with no hot water or gas to cook with for at least the weekend. Terrible customer service. Especially for a utility that the public depends on.

Without question the worst customer service of any utility or customer focused organization that I have ever dealt with.  You cannot talk to anyone who makes a decision or schedules people.  Having problems with your meter, they tell you to plan to wait all day.Want a meter moved, they contract that out to someone and do not plan to get it ever scheduled.Want to talk to a scheduler for either.  They are not available and the customer service line will tell you they are not allowed to talk to themWhen they came to move the meter, they told me I needed a new line from the meter to the street.  This is an expense they need to incur, I have never heard back from them.Without question, the CEO of Washington Gas should be the next CEO of United Airlines, because they would be my all stars for pathetic approaches to customers.

I hardly ever write reviews but was compelled to add my warnings to the many others about Washington Gas.METICULOUSLY REVIEW YOUR BILLS!  After my first bill their auto-pay system failed to draft my bank account for the second and subsequent bills.  Since I have never experienced issues before in 17 years of using auto-pay for utilities, I didn't look at the bills posted on my Washington Gas account online.  It wasn't until Washington Gas physically mailed me a disconnect warning that I signed into my account to see what was going on and saw that auto-draft was not working.  My mistake for not assuming they might be incompetent.  Then they added a $65 deposit charge to my next bill since my payment had been considered "late" even though the lateness was due to their auto-pay system failure.  Fine, whatever.Thereafter, I opted out of auto-pay and manually paid each bill online each month.  Interestingly, the first payment manually made online was reflected in the account payment history and the next bill as expected; but subsequent payments for subsequent bills were not credited to the bills even though they are listed in the account payment history.  They took my money but never credited my account. I called Customer Service for an explanation; the representative agreed that she saw the payments but I wasn't getting credited in the bills.  She forwarded the matter to the billing department where they should investigate the issue and have a resolution in 14 days.  I asked why doesn't she just transfer me to that department while I was on the phone so we could resolve it immediately and she responded that they have to follow a process, which takes two weeks to complete.  Wow.I am moving out of the country in about a week so I imagine that it will be a source of unneeded frustration to collect the $65 deposit and get a resolution to their billing issues while I'm overseas.I'll leave you with one positive; the Customer Service representatives are courteous and professional despite working with a problematic computer system.  When scheduling a stop date for my service, it literally took the representative over five minutes before she could access my account and over 10 minutes more just to setup the stop service date and forwarding address.  They must be using Tandy computers leftover from 1984 with 300 baud modems to connect to the internet!

The worst company in the world. Put it this way, once they make a mistake on their end, all hell breaks lose. You'll find yourself in stressful situations from constant emails and calls that will get you absolutely nowhere. Managers that say they will help, and nothing happens. Lies and deceitful 'back office' that doesn't communicate with one another. Just a complete nightmare.

Common Sense, where are you?  After being told a technician would be here today between 8 a.m and 1 pm, I called WG at 2;30 to ask where they were.  No one has called, no one has come.  I was told by two different "supervisors" that "Our dispatchers have no way of reaching our technicians once they are out in the field."Seriously?  I asked, "what if there was an emergency and you had to contact them?"  Again, came the response, "Our dispatchers have NO WAY to reach our technicians once they are out in the field."Please be on the watch for WG Technicians bouncing about in impenetrable bubbles as they float randomly from place to place.  Catch one if you can.

Based on my experience and those of my neighbors in Georgetown,  Washington Gas is not accountable, transparent, or communicative when it comes to repairing gas lines and related infrastructure above and below our streets.

reported a possible gas leak at 2:30pm and upon follow up at 4:30pm there was no record of the call. After some research found the report. No time estimate possible...Called back at 8:30pm... no record of call .... submitted another call for leak inspection... Again no time estimate possible.... said just call back in 2 hours if no show.... Would give no star if possible.....

Their customer services is does not exist.  Their website gives you a phone number, which you them have a computer direct you through recorded answers and it is hard to get someone on the phone.  I had ended my service when I moved out of my apartment, but recently discovered that I was still being charged. I sent in information for a refund and I'm here a month later with no response besides, allow sufficient time for an investigation. A month should be enough time with all the documentation I provided.. still out over $200 of a refund.and after speaking with someone and letting them know i moved out.. i just got charged again.. this is RIDICULOUS

I would give them zero stars if i could. Worst customer service. Ive had the worst experience dealing with washington gas. They took a deposit from me that was supposed to be refunded to me in December 2016. Six months and 20 calls later, I still have not received my deposit.  WG should not be a monopoly. We should be able to choose our gas company!

Literally the worst company I have had the displeasure of trying to work with. I tried to turn on gas in my new house and they said it would take 5 days from the day I called to make that happen. I accepted that and suffered through cold showers and not cooking for the time being. Then comes my Monday appointment, of which they gave me the time frame of 7am-5pm!! I quite literally had to cancel anything I had scheduled for the day, and well yes surprise surprise they did not show up!!! They finally agreed to come out and said it would be around midnight?! Are you joking?? What kind of company is this!! And so alas, I am with no gas going for a week now and still unsure if they will come tomorrow. They can't guarantee a single thing. WORST COMPANY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Their website may just well be the worst on the internet.  My guess is it was designed in 1997.  Its slow, and the bill pay service is archaic. Good luck getting anything of substance from the site.  I have signed up for auto-pay and budget billing multiple times but it never goes into effect.  In addition, I schedule payments and they don't show on the website (although I receive emails stating the payment has been scheduled).  

But with that said, I have had no problems with their service, hence the 2 stars.







Why am I not surprised that this terrible company has 1 star?

For the past, two years since I've had WG, every few months they contact me saying they have not received payments. I then have to log on to my account and send screen shots. This is the third time it is happening. Seriously guys, maybe update your technology or get a staff has a brain. #1 reason can't wait to move out of the area so never have to deal with them.







Another one star review! What a horrible company. 

1. The website. Was down for almost a year and then sporadically works. 
2. You cannot autopay you must send a check
3. Phone service... wait on hold and then listen to this lady prattle on about what the company will not or cannot do in a sing song voice over and over again 
4. Moving out: you have to send them PROOF of moving out or they will send you a bill to your NEW address for your OLD address. Does that make any sense whatsoever???

Terrible company!







Literally everyone I have talked to in customer service here had been rude and short tempered. At one point I was literally told that I had missed my appointment because I wasn't home when I in fact took the whole day off to stay at home just for them. The man whom came out to actually turn on my gas was very pleasant though.







Yelp needs a negative star rating... 

Washington Gas customer support people are utterly useless.  Both from calling their support number and e-mailing customersupport@washgas.com.  Took me over a month to finally resolve a billing issue, where the home builder's bill was on my account.  

Over the course of a month, I spoke with several customer support reps and maybe one or two were truly helpful. E-mailing customersupport@washgas.com is even worse. All they do is copy and paste pre-written bullshit and then write some bullshit saying your clarification request is still being processed. Nothing I received by e-mail was ever helpful. 

So pretty much their customer support is useless, cause they have a back office that actually solves the issues. It would seem like issues get lost in translation from customer support to their back office. 

The problem was that someone on the Wash Gas end screwed up when I called before closing to have the account transfer to my name on my requested effective date, which caused the builder's bill to show up in my account. 

Whatever, finally got it resolved. Try to hire some smarter people for your customer support.







Rating systems need to have negative stars for "messed up" circumstances.

When calling for service you have to wait the entire day because they do not give time windows.  If they don't show up then oh, well try again another day.  They are very good at turning your gas off.  Not so much with getting it turned back on.  Some techs call but most don't.  One showed up about two to three days after I called (at a time when no one would be home).  I am literally at the complaining to third parties stage.  Seriously consider going all electric if you have the funds.  I even received a gas delivery charge when my house currently has no gas for about a month.







I haven't even moved into the apartment that requires a Washington Gas account yet, and I can already see that the next year or more of dealing with this is going to be pure, unmitigated hell.

As everyone else has already said, their website is a complete abomination. It astounds me that this company can provide service to such a large area and have zero regard for the necessity of a functional website. To begin with, it is impossible to create the online profile that is required to set up autopay. You can try, as I did, multiple times on multiple days for multiple weeks, and you will continuously get an error message. I emailed their help desk and their response was essentially, "Yes, sorry about that, we've been having technical difficulties. Bye." I responded with something along the lines of, "Ok so I just... don't make an online profile then?" No response.

That was just the beginning.

We just had service started to this apartment (which we haven't actually moved into yet), so I suspected we would have a service initiation fee of some sort. But, strangely enough, when I checked my balance online, it said $0. When I called and tried to pay my balance through the automated system, it also said it was $0. Since we don't live in the apartment yet, we haven't been getting the mail there, so I can't verify whether or not they sent a paper bill. That shouldn't matter, though, because it's 2017 and every establishment in existence is expected to have some type of virtual payment method that prevents you from having to rely on paper statements and send physical checks.

Once I speak to a human, he confirms that I do indeed owe a $15 fee due in six days. Mhm. I ask him how I am supposed to go about paying that seeing as both the website and automated phone payment system think my balance is $0. After informing me that "The problem is not us, ma'am, the problem is the internet," he redirects me to... the same automated number that won't let me pay because it thinks my account balance is $0. Thanks, man!

So I call again. I speak to a second person and explain the issue I'm having. She casually tells me that it's showing up as a $0 balance because I don't have an actual gas bill added to it yet.

"But the $15 is still due on the 13th... and I have to pay it by the 13th?"

"Yes ma'am."

"Can I go ahead and do that then?"

"Hold on while I redirect you to someone who can help you with that." 

BACK TO THE AUTOMATED PAYMENT LINE. 

I call a third time. I speak to a third person. I explain that this is my third time calling and that I have no way to pay the $15 balance I wouldn't even have known about if I hadn't called to ask. She tries to direct me to the automated payment line again. NOPE. NO. ABSOLUTELY NO. THAT'S NOT WORKING. "I'm sorry for the technical issues, ma'am, and I suggest you try the line again in a few hours." NO. DEFINITELY NOT. Reluctantly, she finally tells me she can accept a check over the phone and takes my bank account/routing numbers, which I'm assuming worked because she gave me a confirmation number (only after having me wait and sharing that she, too, was having "technical difficulties.") 

I'm 90% sure she also called me "dude" at some point during this conversation, but I can only hope I misheard her. 

So we're done now. I'm ready to hang up. I have supposedly (we'll find out) paid my balance. Right before saying goodbye, she chimes to me, "Remember that in the future, you can always review your balance and pay your bill online!"

"Well obviously I can't, because it doesn't work-"

"Have a nice day, ma'am, and let me direct you to our quick customer service survey."  

Kill me.







Since no one in customer service seems to be listening to me I have had to go to social media to see if I can get help. I have been waiting over two months to get gas installed in my house. I am converting my oven, water heater and fireplace. I am waiting at my house for the fourth time for someone to install the meter. First and second time no one showed up. Third time they showed up but I need to Airflow to add a piece of equipment. This has been installed so I called and setup an appointment. I called Washington Gas yesterday and got confirmation someone was coming today and I called this morning and they confirmed again. I am now on the phone and have been told that they are not coming. Four days out of work and my window was 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Now my husband will have to be at the house on Friday from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. This is ridiculous. If there was another gas company I could use I would be out of here. Someone high up needs to know that there is no communication with customers, customer service, dispatch and contractors. This is only the tip of the iceberg of what I have been through.







Washington Gas turned off the gas to my house because they were fixing a leak in their system at the street. They left a note on the door at 4 am on Thursday 6/29 saying they had turned off the gas. I don't use the door where they left the note, so I saw it Sat morning 7/1 and called to have the gas turned back on, but was told that Washington Gas doesn't work on weekends so it would be Monday at the earliest that they could turn the gas back on. 

Unbelievable. They can't turn the gas on because Washington Gas technicians don't work weekends. I have been paying my bill on time at this address for 31 years. Now I'm stuck with no hot water or gas to cook with for at least the weekend. Terrible customer service. Especially for a utility that the public depends on.







Without question the worst customer service of any utility or customer focused organization that I have ever dealt with.  You cannot talk to anyone who makes a decision or schedules people.  

Having problems with your meter, they tell you to plan to wait all day.

Want a meter moved, they contract that out to someone and do not plan to get it ever scheduled.

Want to talk to a scheduler for either.  They are not available and the customer service line will tell you they are not allowed to talk to them

When they came to move the meter, they told me I needed a new line from the meter to the street.  This is an expense they need to incur, I have never heard back from them.

Without question, the CEO of Washington Gas should be the next CEO of United Airlines, because they would be my all stars for pathetic approaches to customers.







This place would be a negative if yelp allowed it. As is evidenced by the reviews, wash gas should be investigated by the attorney generals of all three jurisdictions







I hardly ever write reviews but was compelled to add my warnings to the many others about Washington Gas.

METICULOUSLY REVIEW YOUR BILLS!  After my first bill their auto-pay system failed to draft my bank account for the second and subsequent bills.  Since I have never experienced issues before in 17 years of using auto-pay for utilities, I didn't look at the bills posted on my Washington Gas account online.  It wasn't until Washington Gas physically mailed me a disconnect warning that I signed into my account to see what was going on and saw that auto-draft was not working.  My mistake for not assuming they might be incompetent.  Then they added a $65 deposit charge to my next bill since my payment had been considered "late" even though the lateness was due to their auto-pay system failure.  Fine, whatever.

Thereafter, I opted out of auto-pay and manually paid each bill online each month.  Interestingly, the first payment manually made online was reflected in the account payment history and the next bill as expected; but subsequent payments for subsequent bills were not credited to the bills even though they are listed in the account payment history.  They took my money but never credited my account. 

I called Customer Service for an explanation; the representative agreed that she saw the payments but I wasn't getting credited in the bills.  She forwarded the matter to the billing department where they should investigate the issue and have a resolution in 14 days.  I asked why doesn't she just transfer me to that department while I was on the phone so we could resolve it immediately and she responded that they have to follow a process, which takes two weeks to complete.  Wow.

I am moving out of the country in about a week so I imagine that it will be a source of unneeded frustration to collect the $65 deposit and get a resolution to their billing issues while I'm overseas.

I'll leave you with one positive; the Customer Service representatives are courteous and professional despite working with a problematic computer system.  When scheduling a stop date for my service, it literally took the representative over five minutes before she could access my account and over 10 minutes more just to setup the stop service date and forwarding address.  They must be using Tandy computers leftover from 1984 with 300 baud modems to connect to the internet!







The worst company in the world. Put it this way, once they make a mistake on their end, all hell breaks lose. You'll find yourself in stressful situations from constant emails and calls that will get you absolutely nowhere. Managers that say they will help, and nothing happens. Lies and deceitful 'back office' that doesn't communicate with one another. Just a complete nightmare.







Common Sense, where are you?  After being told a technician would be here today between 8 a.m and 1 pm, I called WG at 2;30 to ask where they were.  No one has called, no one has come.  I was told by two different "supervisors" that "Our dispatchers have no way of reaching our technicians once they are out in the field."

Seriously?  I asked, "what if there was an emergency and you had to contact them?"  Again, came the response, "Our dispatchers have NO WAY to reach our technicians once they are out in the field."

Please be on the watch for WG Technicians bouncing about in impenetrable bubbles as they float randomly from place to place.  Catch one if you can.







Based on my experience and those of my neighbors in Georgetown,  Washington Gas is not accountable, transparent, or communicative when it comes to repairing gas lines and related infrastructure above and below our streets.







reported a possible gas leak at 2:30pm and upon follow up at 4:30pm there was no record of the call. After some research found the report. No time estimate possible...
Called back at 8:30pm... no record of call .... submitted another call for leak inspection... 
Again no time estimate possible.... said just call back in 2 hours if no show.... 

Would give no star if possible.....







Their customer services is does not exist.  Their website gives you a phone number, which you them have a computer direct you through recorded answers and it is hard to get someone on the phone.  I had ended my service when I moved out of my apartment, but recently discovered that I was still being charged. I sent in information for a refund and I'm here a month later with no response besides, allow sufficient time for an investigation. A month should be enough time with all the documentation I provided.. still out over $200 of a refund.

and after speaking with someone and letting them know i moved out.. i just got charged again.. this is RIDICULOUS







I would give them zero stars if i could. Worst customer service. 
Ive had the worst experience dealing with washington gas. They took a deposit from me that was supposed to be refunded to me in December 2016. Six months and 20 calls later, I still have not received my deposit.  WG should not be a monopoly. We should be able to choose our gas company!







Literally the worst company I have had the displeasure of trying to work with. I tried to turn on gas in my new house and they said it would take 5 days from the day I called to make that happen. I accepted that and suffered through cold showers and not cooking for the time being. Then comes my Monday appointment, of which they gave me the time frame of 7am-5pm!! I quite literally had to cancel anything I had scheduled for the day, and well yes surprise surprise they did not show up!!! They finally agreed to come out and said it would be around midnight?! Are you joking?? What kind of company is this!! And so alas, I am with no gas going for a week now and still unsure if they will come tomorrow. They can't guarantee a single thing. WORST COMPANY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Washington Gas,Your payment options are unbelievably torturous. Your website never works! And your telephone assistance is sub-par, repetitive, annoying, and unproductive. It takes 20 mins to make a payment if you're lucky and don't get hung up on for one mistaken number entered. Please upgrade your services.                                                   Sincerely.                                     At my wits end with you!

Their website may just well be the worst on the internet.  My guess is it was designed in 1997.  Its slow, and the bill pay service is archaic. Good luck getting anything of substance from the site.  I have signed up for auto-pay and budget billing multiple times but it never goes into effect.  In addition, I schedule payments and they don't show on the website (although I receive emails stating the payment has been scheduled).  But with that said, I have had no problems with their service, hence the 2 stars.

Why am I not surprised that this terrible company has 1 star?For the past, two years since I've had WG, every few months they contact me saying they have not received payments. I then have to log on to my account and send screen shots. This is the third time it is happening. Seriously guys, maybe update your technology or get a staff has a brain. #1 reason can't wait to move out of the area so never have to deal with them.

Rating systems need to have negative stars for "messed up" circumstances.When calling for service you have to wait the entire day because they do not give time windows.  If they don't show up then oh, well try again another day.  They are very good at turning your gas off.  Not so much with getting it turned back on.  Some techs call but most don't.  One showed up about two to three days after I called (at a time when no one would be home).  I am literally at the complaining to third parties stage.  Seriously consider going all electric if you have the funds.  I even received a gas delivery charge when my house currently has no gas for about a month.

I haven't even moved into the apartment that requires a Washington Gas account yet, and I can already see that the next year or more of dealing with this is going to be pure, unmitigated hell.As everyone else has already said, their website is a complete abomination. It astounds me that this company can provide service to such a large area and have zero regard for the necessity of a functional website.

Mhm. I ask him how I am supposed to go about paying that seeing as both the website and automated phone payment system think my balance is $0. After informing me that "The problem is not us, ma'am, the problem is the internet," he redirects me to... the same automated number that won't let me pay because it thinks my account balance is $0. Thanks, man!So I call again. I speak to a second person and explain the issue I'm having. She casually tells me that it's showing up as a $0 balance because I don't have an actual gas bill added to it yet."But the $15 is still due on the 13th... and I have to pay it by the 13th?""Yes ma'am.""Can I go ahead and do that then?""Hold on while I redirect you to someone who can help you with that." BACK TO THE AUTOMATED PAYMENT LINE. I call a third time. I speak to a third person. I explain that this is my third time calling and that I have no way to pay the $15 balance I wouldn't even have known about if I hadn't called to ask. She tries to direct me to the automated payment line again. NOPE. NO. ABSOLUTELY NO. THAT'S NOT WORKING. "I'm sorry for the technical issues, ma'am, and I suggest you try the line again in a few hours." NO. DEFINITELY NOT. Reluctantly, she finally tells me she can accept a check over the phone and takes my bank account/routing numbers, which I'm assuming worked because she gave me a confirmation number (only after having me wait and sharing that she, too, was having "technical difficulties.") I'm 90% sure she also called me "dude" at some point during this conversation, but I can only hope I misheard her. So we're done now. I'm ready to hang up. I have supposedly (we'll find out) paid my balance. Right before saying goodbye, she chimes to me, "Remember that in the future, you can always review your balance and pay your bill online!""Well obviously I can't, because it doesn't work-""Have a nice day, ma'am, and let me direct you to our quick customer service survey."  Kill me.

Since no one in customer service seems to be listening to me I have had to go to social media to see if I can get help. I have been waiting over two months to get gas installed in my house. I am converting my oven, water heater and fireplace. I am waiting at my house for the fourth time for someone to install the meter. First and second time no one showed up. Third time they showed up but I need to Airflow to add a piece of equipment. This has been installed so I called and setup an appointment. I called Washington Gas yesterday and got confirmation someone was coming today and I called this morning and they confirmed again. I am now on the phone and have been told that they are not coming. Four days out of work and my window was 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Now my husband will have to be at the house on Friday from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. This is ridiculous. If there was another gas company I could use I would be out of here. Someone high up needs to know that there is no communication with customers, customer service, dispatch and contractors. This is only the tip of the iceberg of what I have been through.

Washington Gas turned off the gas to my house because they were fixing a leak in their system at the street. They left a note on the door at 4 am on Thursday 6/29 saying they had turned off the gas. I don't use the door where they left the note, so I saw it Sat morning 7/1 and called to have the gas turned back on, but was told that Washington Gas doesn't work on weekends so it would be Monday at the earliest that they could turn the gas back on. Unbelievable. They can't turn the gas on because Washington Gas technicians don't work weekends. I have been paying my bill on time at this address for 31 years. Now I'm stuck with no hot water or gas to cook with for at least the weekend. Terrible customer service. Especially for a utility that the public depends on.

Without question the worst customer service of any utility or customer focused organization that I have ever dealt with.  You cannot talk to anyone who makes a decision or schedules people.  Having problems with your meter, they tell you to plan to wait all day.Want a meter moved, they contract that out to someone and do not plan to get it ever scheduled.Want to talk to a scheduler for either.  They are not available and the customer service line will tell you they are not allowed to talk to themWhen they came to move the meter, they told me I needed a new line from the meter to the street.  This is an expense they need to incur, I have never heard back from them.Without question, the CEO of Washington Gas should be the next CEO of United Airlines, because they would be my all stars for pathetic approaches to customers.

This place would be a negative if yelp allowed it. As is evidenced by the reviews, wash gas should be investigated by the attorney generals of all three jurisdictions

I hardly ever write reviews but was compelled to add my warnings to the many others about Washington Gas.METICULOUSLY REVIEW YOUR BILLS!  After my first bill their auto-pay system failed to draft my bank account for the second and subsequent bills.  Since I have never experienced issues before in 17 years of using auto-pay for utilities, I didn't look at the bills posted on my Washington Gas account online.  It wasn't until Washington Gas physically mailed me a disconnect warning that I signed into my account to see what was going on and saw that auto-draft was not working.  My mistake for not assuming they might be incompetent.  Then they added a $65 deposit charge to my next bill since my payment had been considered "late" even though the lateness was due to their auto-pay system failure.  Fine, whatever.Thereafter, I opted out of auto-pay and manually paid each bill online each month.  Interestingly, the first payment manually made online was reflected in the account payment history and the next bill as expected; but subsequent payments for subsequent bills were not credited to the bills even though they are listed in the account payment history.  They took my money but never credited my account. I called Customer Service for an explanation; the representative agreed that she saw the payments but I wasn't getting credited in the bills.  She forwarded the matter to the billing department where they should investigate the issue and have a resolution in 14 days.  I asked why doesn't she just transfer me to that department while I was on the phone so we could resolve it immediately and she responded that they have to follow a process, which takes two weeks to complete.  Wow.I am moving out of the country in about a week so I imagine that it will be a source of unneeded frustration to collect the $65 deposit and get a resolution to their billing issues while I'm overseas.I'll leave you with one positive; the Customer Service representatives are courteous and professional despite working with a problematic computer system.  When scheduling a stop date for my service, it literally took the representative over five minutes before she could access my account and over 10 minutes more just to setup the stop service date and forwarding address.  They must be using Tandy computers leftover from 1984 with 300 baud modems to connect to the internet!

The worst company in the world. Put it this way, once they make a mistake on their end, all hell breaks lose. You'll find yourself in stressful situations from constant emails and calls that will get you absolutely nowhere. Managers that say they will help, and nothing happens. Lies and deceitful 'back office' that doesn't communicate with one another. Just a complete nightmare.

Common Sense, where are you?  After being told a technician would be here today between 8 a.m and 1 pm, I called WG at 2;30 to ask where they were.  No one has called, no one has come.  I was told by two different "supervisors" that "Our dispatchers have no way of reaching our technicians once they are out in the field."Seriously?  I asked, "what if there was an emergency and you had to contact them?"  Again, came the response, "Our dispatchers have NO WAY to reach our technicians once they are out in the field."Please be on the watch for WG Technicians bouncing about in impenetrable bubbles as they float randomly from place to place.  Catch one if you can.

Based on my experience and those of my neighbors in Georgetown,  Washington Gas is not accountable, transparent, or communicative when it comes to repairing gas lines and related infrastructure above and below our streets.

reported a possible gas leak at 2:30pm and upon follow up at 4:30pm there was no record of the call. After some research found the report. No time estimate possible...Called back at 8:30pm... no record of call .... submitted another call for leak inspection... Again no time estimate possible.... said just call back in 2 hours if no show.... Would give no star if possible.....

Their customer services is does not exist.  Their website gives you a phone number, which you them have a computer direct you through recorded answers and it is hard to get someone on the phone.  I had ended my service when I moved out of my apartment, but recently discovered that I was still being charged. I sent in information for a refund and I'm here a month later with no response besides, allow sufficient time for an investigation. A month should be enough time with all the documentation I provided.. still out over $200 of a refund.and after speaking with someone and letting them know i moved out.. i just got charged again.. this is RIDICULOUS

I would give them zero stars if i could. Worst customer service. Ive had the worst experience dealing with washington gas. They took a deposit from me that was supposed to be refunded to me in December 2016. Six months and 20 calls later, I still have not received my deposit.  WG should not be a monopoly. We should be able to choose our gas company!

Literally the worst company I have had the displeasure of trying to work with. I tried to turn on gas in my new house and they said it would take 5 days from the day I called to make that happen. I accepted that and suffered through cold showers and not cooking for the time being. Then comes my Monday appointment, of which they gave me the time frame of 7am-5pm!! I quite literally had to cancel anything I had scheduled for the day, and well yes surprise surprise they did not show up!!! They finally agreed to come out and said it would be around midnight?! Are you joking?? What kind of company is this!! And so alas, I am with no gas going for a week now and still unsure if they will come tomorrow. They can't guarantee a single thing. WORST COMPANY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Their website may just well be the worst on the internet.  My guess is it was designed in 1997.  Its slow, and the bill pay service is archaic. Good luck getting anything of substance from the site.  I have signed up for auto-pay and budget billing multiple times but it never goes into effect.  In addition, I schedule payments and they don't show on the website (although I receive emails stating the payment has been scheduled).  

But with that said, I have had no problems with their service, hence the 2 stars.







Washington Gas,
Your payment options are unbelievably torturous. Your website never works! And your telephone assistance is sub-par, repetitive, annoying, and unproductive. It takes 20 mins to make a payment if you're lucky and don't get hung up on for one mistaken number entered. Please upgrade your services.

                                                   Sincerely.
                                     At my wits end with you!







Why am I not surprised that this terrible company has 1 star?

For the past, two years since I've had WG, every few months they contact me saying they have not received payments. I then have to log on to my account and send screen shots. This is the third time it is happening. Seriously guys, maybe update your technology or get a staff has a brain. #1 reason can't wait to move out of the area so never have to deal with them.







Another one star review! What a horrible company. 

1. The website. Was down for almost a year and then sporadically works. 
2. You cannot autopay you must send a check
3. Phone service... wait on hold and then listen to this lady prattle on about what the company will not or cannot do in a sing song voice over and over again 
4. Moving out: you have to send them PROOF of moving out or they will send you a bill to your NEW address for your OLD address. Does that make any sense whatsoever???

Terrible company!







Literally everyone I have talked to in customer service here had been rude and short tempered. At one point I was literally told that I had missed my appointment because I wasn't home when I in fact took the whole day off to stay at home just for them. The man whom came out to actually turn on my gas was very pleasant though.







Yelp needs a negative star rating... 

Washington Gas customer support people are utterly useless.  Both from calling their support number and e-mailing customersupport@washgas.com.  Took me over a month to finally resolve a billing issue, where the home builder's bill was on my account.  

Over the course of a month, I spoke with several customer support reps and maybe one or two were truly helpful. E-mailing customersupport@washgas.com is even worse. All they do is copy and paste pre-written bullshit and then write some bullshit saying your clarification request is still being processed. Nothing I received by e-mail was ever helpful. 

So pretty much their customer support is useless, cause they have a back office that actually solves the issues. It would seem like issues get lost in translation from customer support to their back office. 

The problem was that someone on the Wash Gas end screwed up when I called before closing to have the account transfer to my name on my requested effective date, which caused the builder's bill to show up in my account. 

Whatever, finally got it resolved. Try to hire some smarter people for your customer support.







I haven't even moved into the apartment that requires a Washington Gas account yet, and I can already see that the next year or more of dealing with this is going to be pure, unmitigated hell.

As everyone else has already said, their website is a complete abomination. It astounds me that this company can provide service to such a large area and have zero regard for the necessity of a functional website. To begin with, it is impossible to create the online profile that is required to set up autopay. You can try, as I did, multiple times on multiple days for multiple weeks, and you will continuously get an error message. I emailed their help desk and their response was essentially, "Yes, sorry about that, we've been having technical difficulties. Bye." I responded with something along the lines of, "Ok so I just... don't make an online profile then?" No response.

That was just the beginning.

We just had service started to this apartment (which we haven't actually moved into yet), so I suspected we would have a service initiation fee of some sort. But, strangely enough, when I checked my balance online, it said $0. When I called and tried to pay my balance through the automated system, it also said it was $0. Since we don't live in the apartment yet, we haven't been getting the mail there, so I can't verify whether or not they sent a paper bill. That shouldn't matter, though, because it's 2017 and every establishment in existence is expected to have some type of virtual payment method that prevents you from having to rely on paper statements and send physical checks.

Once I speak to a human, he confirms that I do indeed owe a $15 fee due in six days. Mhm. I ask him how I am supposed to go about paying that seeing as both the website and automated phone payment system think my balance is $0. After informing me that "The problem is not us, ma'am, the problem is the internet," he redirects me to... the same automated number that won't let me pay because it thinks my account balance is $0. Thanks, man!

So I call again. I speak to a second person and explain the issue I'm having. She casually tells me that it's showing up as a $0 balance because I don't have an actual gas bill added to it yet.

"But the $15 is still due on the 13th... and I have to pay it by the 13th?"

"Yes ma'am."

"Can I go ahead and do that then?"

"Hold on while I redirect you to someone who can help you with that." 

BACK TO THE AUTOMATED PAYMENT LINE. 

I call a third time. I speak to a third person. I explain that this is my third time calling and that I have no way to pay the $15 balance I wouldn't even have known about if I hadn't called to ask. She tries to direct me to the automated payment line again. NOPE. NO. ABSOLUTELY NO. THAT'S NOT WORKING. "I'm sorry for the technical issues, ma'am, and I suggest you try the line again in a few hours." NO. DEFINITELY NOT. Reluctantly, she finally tells me she can accept a check over the phone and takes my bank account/routing numbers, which I'm assuming worked because she gave me a confirmation number (only after having me wait and sharing that she, too, was having "technical difficulties.") 

I'm 90% sure she also called me "dude" at some point during this conversation, but I can only hope I misheard her. 

So we're done now. I'm ready to hang up. I have supposedly (we'll find out) paid my balance. Right before saying goodbye, she chimes to me, "Remember that in the future, you can always review your balance and pay your bill online!"

"Well obviously I can't, because it doesn't work-"

"Have a nice day, ma'am, and let me direct you to our quick customer service survey."  

Kill me.







Since no one in customer service seems to be listening to me I have had to go to social media to see if I can get help. I have been waiting over two months to get gas installed in my house. I am converting my oven, water heater and fireplace. I am waiting at my house for the fourth time for someone to install the meter. First and second time no one showed up. Third time they showed up but I need to Airflow to add a piece of equipment. This has been installed so I called and setup an appointment. I called Washington Gas yesterday and got confirmation someone was coming today and I called this morning and they confirmed again. I am now on the phone and have been told that they are not coming. Four days out of work and my window was 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Now my husband will have to be at the house on Friday from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. This is ridiculous. If there was another gas company I could use I would be out of here. Someone high up needs to know that there is no communication with customers, customer service, dispatch and contractors. This is only the tip of the iceberg of what I have been through.







Washington Gas turned off the gas to my house because they were fixing a leak in their system at the street. They left a note on the door at 4 am on Thursday 6/29 saying they had turned off the gas. I don't use the door where they left the note, so I saw it Sat morning 7/1 and called to have the gas turned back on, but was told that Washington Gas doesn't work on weekends so it would be Monday at the earliest that they could turn the gas back on. 

Unbelievable. They can't turn the gas on because Washington Gas technicians don't work weekends. I have been paying my bill on time at this address for 31 years. Now I'm stuck with no hot water or gas to cook with for at least the weekend. Terrible customer service. Especially for a utility that the public depends on.







Without question the worst customer service of any utility or customer focused organization that I have ever dealt with.  You cannot talk to anyone who makes a decision or schedules people.  

Having problems with your meter, they tell you to plan to wait all day.

Want a meter moved, they contract that out to someone and do not plan to get it ever scheduled.

Want to talk to a scheduler for either.  They are not available and the customer service line will tell you they are not allowed to talk to them

When they came to move the meter, they told me I needed a new line from the meter to the street.  This is an expense they need to incur, I have never heard back from them.

Without question, the CEO of Washington Gas should be the next CEO of United Airlines, because they would be my all stars for pathetic approaches to customers.







This place would be a negative if yelp allowed it. As is evidenced by the reviews, wash gas should be investigated by the attorney generals of all three jurisdictions







I hardly ever write reviews but was compelled to add my warnings to the many others about Washington Gas.

METICULOUSLY REVIEW YOUR BILLS!  After my first bill their auto-pay system failed to draft my bank account for the second and subsequent bills.  Since I have never experienced issues before in 17 years of using auto-pay for utilities, I didn't look at the bills posted on my Washington Gas account online.  It wasn't until Washington Gas physically mailed me a disconnect warning that I signed into my account to see what was going on and saw that auto-draft was not working.  My mistake for not assuming they might be incompetent.  Then they added a $65 deposit charge to my next bill since my payment had been considered "late" even though the lateness was due to their auto-pay system failure.  Fine, whatever.

Thereafter, I opted out of auto-pay and manually paid each bill online each month.  Interestingly, the first payment manually made online was reflected in the account payment history and the next bill as expected; but subsequent payments for subsequent bills were not credited to the bills even though they are listed in the account payment history.  They took my money but never credited my account. 

I called Customer Service for an explanation; the representative agreed that she saw the payments but I wasn't getting credited in the bills.  She forwarded the matter to the billing department where they should investigate the issue and have a resolution in 14 days.  I asked why doesn't she just transfer me to that department while I was on the phone so we could resolve it immediately and she responded that they have to follow a process, which takes two weeks to complete.  Wow.

I am moving out of the country in about a week so I imagine that it will be a source of unneeded frustration to collect the $65 deposit and get a resolution to their billing issues while I'm overseas.

I'll leave you with one positive; the Customer Service representatives are courteous and professional despite working with a problematic computer system.  When scheduling a stop date for my service, it literally took the representative over five minutes before she could access my account and over 10 minutes more just to setup the stop service date and forwarding address.  They must be using Tandy computers leftover from 1984 with 300 baud modems to connect to the internet!







The worst company in the world. Put it this way, once they make a mistake on their end, all hell breaks lose. You'll find yourself in stressful situations from constant emails and calls that will get you absolutely nowhere. Managers that say they will help, and nothing happens. Lies and deceitful 'back office' that doesn't communicate with one another. Just a complete nightmare.







Common Sense, where are you?  After being told a technician would be here today between 8 a.m and 1 pm, I called WG at 2;30 to ask where they were.  No one has called, no one has come.  I was told by two different "supervisors" that "Our dispatchers have no way of reaching our technicians once they are out in the field."

Seriously?  I asked, "what if there was an emergency and you had to contact them?"  Again, came the response, "Our dispatchers have NO WAY to reach our technicians once they are out in the field."

Please be on the watch for WG Technicians bouncing about in impenetrable bubbles as they float randomly from place to place.  Catch one if you can.







Based on my experience and those of my neighbors in Georgetown,  Washington Gas is not accountable, transparent, or communicative when it comes to repairing gas lines and related infrastructure above and below our streets.







reported a possible gas leak at 2:30pm and upon follow up at 4:30pm there was no record of the call. After some research found the report. No time estimate possible...
Called back at 8:30pm... no record of call .... submitted another call for leak inspection... 
Again no time estimate possible.... said just call back in 2 hours if no show.... 

Would give no star if possible.....







Their customer services is does not exist.  Their website gives you a phone number, which you them have a computer direct you through recorded answers and it is hard to get someone on the phone.  I had ended my service when I moved out of my apartment, but recently discovered that I was still being charged. I sent in information for a refund and I'm here a month later with no response besides, allow sufficient time for an investigation. A month should be enough time with all the documentation I provided.. still out over $200 of a refund.

and after speaking with someone and letting them know i moved out.. i just got charged again.. this is RIDICULOUS







I would give them zero stars if i could. Worst customer service. 
Ive had the worst experience dealing with washington gas. They took a deposit from me that was supposed to be refunded to me in December 2016. Six months and 20 calls later, I still have not received my deposit.  WG should not be a monopoly. We should be able to choose our gas company!







Literally the worst company I have had the displeasure of trying to work with. I tried to turn on gas in my new house and they said it would take 5 days from the day I called to make that happen. I accepted that and suffered through cold showers and not cooking for the time being. Then comes my Monday appointment, of which they gave me the time frame of 7am-5pm!! I quite literally had to cancel anything I had scheduled for the day, and well yes surprise surprise they did not show up!!! They finally agreed to come out and said it would be around midnight?! Are you joking?? What kind of company is this!! And so alas, I am with no gas going for a week now and still unsure if they will come tomorrow. They can't guarantee a single thing. WORST COMPANY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It looks like we don't have a specific address for Washington Gas, which makes giving directions tricky. This business might not have an official storefront, or it might move to multiple locations throughout the day.
Give me directions anyway...

Rating systems need to have negative stars for "messed up" circumstances.When calling for service you have to wait the entire day because they do not give time windows.  If they don't show up then oh, well try again another day.  They are very good at turning your gas off.  Not so much with getting it turned back on.  Some techs call but most don't.  One showed up about two to three days after I called (at a time when no one would be home).  I am literally at the complaining to third parties stage.  Seriously consider going all electric if you have the funds.  I even received a gas delivery charge when my house currently has no gas for about a month.

Their website may just well be the worst on the internet.  My guess is it was designed in 1997.  Its slow, and the bill pay service is archaic. Good luck getting anything of substance from the site.  I have signed up for auto-pay and budget billing multiple times but it never goes into effect.  In addition, I schedule payments and they don't show on the website (although I receive emails stating the payment has been scheduled).  But with that said, I have had no problems with their service, hence the 2 stars.

Washington Gas,Your payment options are unbelievably torturous. Your website never works! And your telephone assistance is sub-par, repetitive, annoying, and unproductive. It takes 20 mins to make a payment if you're lucky and don't get hung up on for one mistaken number entered. Please upgrade your services.                                                   Sincerely.                                     At my wits end with you!

Why am I not surprised that this terrible company has 1 star?For the past, two years since I've had WG, every few months they contact me saying they have not received payments. I then have to log on to my account and send screen shots. This is the third time it is happening. Seriously guys, maybe update your technology or get a staff has a brain. #1 reason can't wait to move out of the area so never have to deal with them.

Another one star review! What a horrible company. 1. The website. Was down for almost a year and then sporadically works. 2. You cannot autopay you must send a check3. Phone service... wait on hold and then listen to this lady prattle on about what the company will not or cannot do in a sing song voice over and over again 4. Moving out: you have to send them PROOF of moving out or they will send you a bill to your NEW address for your OLD address. Does that make any sense whatsoever???Terrible company!

Literally everyone I have talked to in customer service here had been rude and short tempered. At one point I was literally told that I had missed my appointment because I wasn't home when I in fact took the whole day off to stay at home just for them. The man whom came out to actually turn on my gas was very pleasant though.

Yelp needs a negative star rating... Washington Gas customer support people are utterly useless.  Both from calling their support number and e-mailing customersupport@washgas.….  Took me over a month to finally resolve a billing issue, where the home builder's bill was on my account.  Over the course of a month, I spoke with several customer support reps and maybe one or two were truly helpful. E-mailing customersupport@washgas.… is even worse. All they do is copy and paste pre-written bullshit and then write some bullshit saying your clarification request is still being processed. Nothing I received by e-mail was ever helpful. So pretty much their customer support is useless, cause they have a back office that actually solves the issues. It would seem like issues get lost in translation from customer support to their back office. The problem was that someone on the Wash Gas end screwed up when I called before closing to have the account transfer to my name on my requested effective date, which caused the builder's bill to show up in my account. Whatever, finally got it resolved. Try to hire some smarter people for your customer support.

I haven't even moved into the apartment that requires a Washington Gas account yet, and I can already see that the next year or more of dealing with this is going to be pure, unmitigated hell.As everyone else has already said, their website is a complete abomination. It astounds me that this company can provide service to such a large area and have zero regard for the necessity of a functional website. To begin with, it is impossible to create the online profile that is required to set up autopay. You can try, as I did, multiple times on multiple days for multiple weeks, and you will continuously get an error message. I emailed their help desk and their response was essentially, "Yes, sorry about that, we've been having technical difficulties. Bye." I responded with something along the lines of, "Ok so I just... don't make an online profile then?" No response.That was just the beginning.We just had service started to this apartment (which we haven't actually moved into yet), so I suspected we would have a service initiation fee of some sort. But, strangely enough, when I checked my balance online, it said $0. When I called and tried to pay my balance through the automated system, it also said it was $0. Since we don't live in the apartment yet, we haven't been getting the mail there, so I can't verify whether or not they sent a paper bill. That shouldn't matter, though, because it's 2017 and every establishment in existence is expected to have some type of virtual payment method that prevents you from having to rely on paper statements and send physical checks.Once I speak to a human, he confirms that I do indeed owe a $15 fee due in six days. Mhm. I ask him how I am supposed to go about paying that seeing as both the website and automated phone payment system think my balance is $0. After informing me that "The problem is not us, ma'am, the problem is the internet," he redirects me to... the same automated number that won't let me pay because it thinks my account balance is $0. Thanks, man!So I call again. I speak to a second person and explain the issue I'm having. She casually tells me that it's showing up as a $0 balance because I don't have an actual gas bill added to it yet."But the $15 is still due on the 13th... and I have to pay it by the 13th?""Yes ma'am.""Can I go ahead and do that then?""Hold on while I redirect you to someone who can help you with that." BACK TO THE AUTOMATED PAYMENT LINE. I call a third time. I speak to a third person. I explain that this is my third time calling and that I have no way to pay the $15 balance I wouldn't even have known about if I hadn't called to ask. She tries to direct me to the automated payment line again. NOPE. NO. ABSOLUTELY NO. THAT'S NOT WORKING. "I'm sorry for the technical issues, ma'am, and I suggest you try the line again in a few hours." NO. DEFINITELY NOT. Reluctantly, she finally tells me she can accept a check over the phone and takes my bank account/routing numbers, which I'm assuming worked because she gave me a confirmation number (only after having me wait and sharing that she, too, was having "technical difficulties.") I'm 90% sure she also called me "dude" at some point during this conversation, but I can only hope I misheard her. So we're done now. I'm ready to hang up. I have supposedly (we'll find out) paid my balance. Right before saying goodbye, she chimes to me, "Remember that in the future, you can always review your balance and pay your bill online!""Well obviously I can't, because it doesn't work-""Have a nice day, ma'am, and let me direct you to our quick customer service survey."  Kill me.

Since no one in customer service seems to be listening to me I have had to go to social media to see if I can get help. I have been waiting over two months to get gas installed in my house. I am converting my oven, water heater and fireplace. I am waiting at my house for the fourth time for someone to install the meter. First and second time no one showed up. Third time they showed up but I need to Airflow to add a piece of equipment. This has been installed so I called and setup an appointment. I called Washington Gas yesterday and got confirmation someone was coming today and I called this morning and they confirmed again. I am now on the phone and have been told that they are not coming. Four days out of work and my window was 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Now my husband will have to be at the house on Friday from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. This is ridiculous. If there was another gas company I could use I would be out of here. Someone high up needs to know that there is no communication with customers, customer service, dispatch and contractors. This is only the tip of the iceberg of what I have been through.

Washington Gas turned off the gas to my house because they were fixing a leak in their system at the street. They left a note on the door at 4 am on Thursday 6/29 saying they had turned off the gas. I don't use the door where they left the note, so I saw it Sat morning 7/1 and called to have the gas turned back on, but was told that Washington Gas doesn't work on weekends so it would be Monday at the earliest that they could turn the gas back on. Unbelievable. They can't turn the gas on because Washington Gas technicians don't work weekends. I have been paying my bill on time at this address for 31 years. Now I'm stuck with no hot water or gas to cook with for at least the weekend. Terrible customer service. Especially for a utility that the public depends on.

Without question the worst customer service of any utility or customer focused organization that I have ever dealt with.  You cannot talk to anyone who makes a decision or schedules people.  Having problems with your meter, they tell you to plan to wait all day.Want a meter moved, they contract that out to someone and do not plan to get it ever scheduled.Want to talk to a scheduler for either.  They are not available and the customer service line will tell you they are not allowed to talk to themWhen they came to move the meter, they told me I needed a new line from the meter to the street.  This is an expense they need to incur, I have never heard back from them.Without question, the CEO of Washington Gas should be the next CEO of United Airlines, because they would be my all stars for pathetic approaches to customers.

I hardly ever write reviews but was compelled to add my warnings to the many others about Washington Gas.METICULOUSLY REVIEW YOUR BILLS!  After my first bill their auto-pay system failed to draft my bank account for the second and subsequent bills.  Since I have never experienced issues before in 17 years of using auto-pay for utilities, I didn't look at the bills posted on my Washington Gas account online.  It wasn't until Washington Gas physically mailed me a disconnect warning that I signed into my account to see what was going on and saw that auto-draft was not working.  My mistake for not assuming they might be incompetent.  Then they added a $65 deposit charge to my next bill since my payment had been considered "late" even though the lateness was due to their auto-pay system failure.  Fine, whatever.Thereafter, I opted out of auto-pay and manually paid each bill online each month.  Interestingly, the first payment manually made online was reflected in the account payment history and the next bill as expected; but subsequent payments for subsequent bills were not credited to the bills even though they are listed in the account payment history.  They took my money but never credited my account. I called Customer Service for an explanation; the representative agreed that she saw the payments but I wasn't getting credited in the bills.  She forwarded the matter to the billing department where they should investigate the issue and have a resolution in 14 days.  I asked why doesn't she just transfer me to that department while I was on the phone so we could resolve it immediately and she responded that they have to follow a process, which takes two weeks to complete.  Wow.I am moving out of the country in about a week so I imagine that it will be a source of unneeded frustration to collect the $65 deposit and get a resolution to their billing issues while I'm overseas.I'll leave you with one positive; the Customer Service representatives are courteous and professional despite working with a problematic computer system.  When scheduling a stop date for my service, it literally took the representative over five minutes before she could access my account and over 10 minutes more just to setup the stop service date and forwarding address.  They must be using Tandy computers leftover from 1984 with 300 baud modems to connect to the internet!

The worst company in the world. Put it this way, once they make a mistake on their end, all hell breaks lose. You'll find yourself in stressful situations from constant emails and calls that will get you absolutely nowhere. Managers that say they will help, and nothing happens. Lies and deceitful 'back office' that doesn't communicate with one another. Just a complete nightmare.

Common Sense, where are you?  After being told a technician would be here today between 8 a.m and 1 pm, I called WG at 2;30 to ask where they were.  No one has called, no one has come.  I was told by two different "supervisors" that "Our dispatchers have no way of reaching our technicians once they are out in the field."Seriously?  I asked, "what if there was an emergency and you had to contact them?"  Again, came the response, "Our dispatchers have NO WAY to reach our technicians once they are out in the field."Please be on the watch for WG Technicians bouncing about in impenetrable bubbles as they float randomly from place to place.  Catch one if you can.

reported a possible gas leak at 2:30pm and upon follow up at 4:30pm there was no record of the call. After some research found the report. No time estimate possible...Called back at 8:30pm... no record of call .... submitted another call for leak inspection... Again no time estimate possible.... said just call back in 2 hours if no show.... Would give no star if possible.....

Their customer services is does not exist.  Their website gives you a phone number, which you them have a computer direct you through recorded answers and it is hard to get someone on the phone.  I had ended my service when I moved out of my apartment, but recently discovered that I was still being charged. I sent in information for a refund and I'm here a month later with no response besides, allow sufficient time for an investigation. A month should be enough time with all the documentation I provided.. still out over $200 of a refund.and after speaking with someone and letting them know i moved out.. i just got charged again.. this is RIDICULOUS

I would give them zero stars if i could. Worst customer service. Ive had the worst experience dealing with washington gas. They took a deposit from me that was supposed to be refunded to me in December 2016. Six months and 20 calls later, I still have not received my deposit.  WG should not be a monopoly. We should be able to choose our gas company!

Literally the worst company I have had the displeasure of trying to work with. I tried to turn on gas in my new house and they said it would take 5 days from the day I called to make that happen. I accepted that and suffered through cold showers and not cooking for the time being. Then comes my Monday appointment, of which they gave me the time frame of 7am-5pm!! I quite literally had to cancel anything I had scheduled for the day, and well yes surprise surprise they did not show up!!! They finally agreed to come out and said it would be around midnight?! Are you joking?? What kind of company is this!! And so alas, I am with no gas going for a week now and still unsure if they will come tomorrow. They can't guarantee a single thing. WORST COMPANY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Their website may just well be the worst on the internet.  My guess is it was designed in 1997.  Its slow, and the bill pay service is archaic. Good luck getting anything of substance from the site.  I have signed up for auto-pay and budget billing multiple times but it never goes into effect.  In addition, I schedule payments and they don't show on the website (although I receive emails stating the payment has been scheduled).  

But with that said, I have had no problems with their service, hence the 2 stars.







Washington Gas,
Your payment options are unbelievably torturous. Your website never works! And your telephone assistance is sub-par, repetitive, annoying, and unproductive. It takes 20 mins to make a payment if you're lucky and don't get hung up on for one mistaken number entered. Please upgrade your services.

                                                   Sincerely.
                                     At my wits end with you!







Why am I not surprised that this terrible company has 1 star?

For the past, two years since I've had WG, every few months they contact me saying they have not received payments. I then have to log on to my account and send screen shots. This is the third time it is happening. Seriously guys, maybe update your technology or get a staff has a brain. #1 reason can't wait to move out of the area so never have to deal with them.







Another one star review! What a horrible company. 

1. The website. Was down for almost a year and then sporadically works. 
2. You cannot autopay you must send a check
3. Phone service... wait on hold and then listen to this lady prattle on about what the company will not or cannot do in a sing song voice over and over again 
4. Moving out: you have to send them PROOF of moving out or they will send you a bill to your NEW address for your OLD address. Does that make any sense whatsoever???

Terrible company!







Literally everyone I have talked to in customer service here had been rude and short tempered. At one point I was literally told that I had missed my appointment because I wasn't home when I in fact took the whole day off to stay at home just for them. The man whom came out to actually turn on my gas was very pleasant though.







Yelp needs a negative star rating... 

Washington Gas customer support people are utterly useless.  Both from calling their support number and e-mailing customersupport@washgas.com.  Took me over a month to finally resolve a billing issue, where the home builder's bill was on my account.  

Over the course of a month, I spoke with several customer support reps and maybe one or two were truly helpful. E-mailing customersupport@washgas.com is even worse. All they do is copy and paste pre-written bullshit and then write some bullshit saying your clarification request is still being processed. Nothing I received by e-mail was ever helpful. 

So pretty much their customer support is useless, cause they have a back office that actually solves the issues. It would seem like issues get lost in translation from customer support to their back office. 

The problem was that someone on the Wash Gas end screwed up when I called before closing to have the account transfer to my name on my requested effective date, which caused the builder's bill to show up in my account. 

Whatever, finally got it resolved. Try to hire some smarter people for your customer support.







Rating systems need to have negative stars for "messed up" circumstances.

When calling for service you have to wait the entire day because they do not give time windows.  If they don't show up then oh, well try again another day.  They are very good at turning your gas off.  Not so much with getting it turned back on.  Some techs call but most don't.  One showed up about two to three days after I called (at a time when no one would be home).  I am literally at the complaining to third parties stage.  Seriously consider going all electric if you have the funds.  I even received a gas delivery charge when my house currently has no gas for about a month.







I haven't even moved into the apartment that requires a Washington Gas account yet, and I can already see that the next year or more of dealing with this is going to be pure, unmitigated hell.

As everyone else has already said, their website is a complete abomination. It astounds me that this company can provide service to such a large area and have zero regard for the necessity of a functional website. To begin with, it is impossible to create the online profile that is required to set up autopay. You can try, as I did, multiple times on multiple days for multiple weeks, and you will continuously get an error message. I emailed their help desk and their response was essentially, "Yes, sorry about that, we've been having technical difficulties. Bye." I responded with something along the lines of, "Ok so I just... don't make an online profile then?" No response.

That was just the beginning.

We just had service started to this apartment (which we haven't actually moved into yet), so I suspected we would have a service initiation fee of some sort. But, strangely enough, when I checked my balance online, it said $0. When I called and tried to pay my balance through the automated system, it also said it was $0. Since we don't live in the apartment yet, we haven't been getting the mail there, so I can't verify whether or not they sent a paper bill. That shouldn't matter, though, because it's 2017 and every establishment in existence is expected to have some type of virtual payment method that prevents you from having to rely on paper statements and send physical checks.

Once I speak to a human, he confirms that I do indeed owe a $15 fee due in six days. Mhm. I ask him how I am supposed to go about paying that seeing as both the website and automated phone payment system think my balance is $0. After informing me that "The problem is not us, ma'am, the problem is the internet," he redirects me to... the same automated number that won't let me pay because it thinks my account balance is $0. Thanks, man!

So I call again. I speak to a second person and explain the issue I'm having. She casually tells me that it's showing up as a $0 balance because I don't have an actual gas bill added to it yet.

"But the $15 is still due on the 13th... and I have to pay it by the 13th?"

"Yes ma'am."

"Can I go ahead and do that then?"

"Hold on while I redirect you to someone who can help you with that." 

BACK TO THE AUTOMATED PAYMENT LINE. 

I call a third time. I speak to a third person. I explain that this is my third time calling and that I have no way to pay the $15 balance I wouldn't even have known about if I hadn't called to ask. She tries to direct me to the automated payment line again. NOPE. NO. ABSOLUTELY NO. THAT'S NOT WORKING. "I'm sorry for the technical issues, ma'am, and I suggest you try the line again in a few hours." NO. DEFINITELY NOT. Reluctantly, she finally tells me she can accept a check over the phone and takes my bank account/routing numbers, which I'm assuming worked because she gave me a confirmation number (only after having me wait and sharing that she, too, was having "technical difficulties.") 

I'm 90% sure she also called me "dude" at some point during this conversation, but I can only hope I misheard her. 

So we're done now. I'm ready to hang up. I have supposedly (we'll find out) paid my balance. Right before saying goodbye, she chimes to me, "Remember that in the future, you can always review your balance and pay your bill online!"

"Well obviously I can't, because it doesn't work-"

"Have a nice day, ma'am, and let me direct you to our quick customer service survey."  

Kill me.







Since no one in customer service seems to be listening to me I have had to go to social media to see if I can get help. I have been waiting over two months to get gas installed in my house. I am converting my oven, water heater and fireplace. I am waiting at my house for the fourth time for someone to install the meter. First and second time no one showed up. Third time they showed up but I need to Airflow to add a piece of equipment. This has been installed so I called and setup an appointment. I called Washington Gas yesterday and got confirmation someone was coming today and I called this morning and they confirmed again. I am now on the phone and have been told that they are not coming. Four days out of work and my window was 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Now my husband will have to be at the house on Friday from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. This is ridiculous. If there was another gas company I could use I would be out of here. Someone high up needs to know that there is no communication with customers, customer service, dispatch and contractors. This is only the tip of the iceberg of what I have been through.







Washington Gas turned off the gas to my house because they were fixing a leak in their system at the street. They left a note on the door at 4 am on Thursday 6/29 saying they had turned off the gas. I don't use the door where they left the note, so I saw it Sat morning 7/1 and called to have the gas turned back on, but was told that Washington Gas doesn't work on weekends so it would be Monday at the earliest that they could turn the gas back on. 

Unbelievable. They can't turn the gas on because Washington Gas technicians don't work weekends. I have been paying my bill on time at this address for 31 years. Now I'm stuck with no hot water or gas to cook with for at least the weekend. Terrible customer service. Especially for a utility that the public depends on.







Without question the worst customer service of any utility or customer focused organization that I have ever dealt with.  You cannot talk to anyone who makes a decision or schedules people.  

Having problems with your meter, they tell you to plan to wait all day.

Want a meter moved, they contract that out to someone and do not plan to get it ever scheduled.

Want to talk to a scheduler for either.  They are not available and the customer service line will tell you they are not allowed to talk to them

When they came to move the meter, they told me I needed a new line from the meter to the street.  This is an expense they need to incur, I have never heard back from them.

Without question, the CEO of Washington Gas should be the next CEO of United Airlines, because they would be my all stars for pathetic approaches to customers.







This place would be a negative if yelp allowed it. As is evidenced by the reviews, wash gas should be investigated by the attorney generals of all three jurisdictions







I hardly ever write reviews but was compelled to add my warnings to the many others about Washington Gas.

METICULOUSLY REVIEW YOUR BILLS!  After my first bill their auto-pay system failed to draft my bank account for the second and subsequent bills.  Since I have never experienced issues before in 17 years of using auto-pay for utilities, I didn't look at the bills posted on my Washington Gas account online.  It wasn't until Washington Gas physically mailed me a disconnect warning that I signed into my account to see what was going on and saw that auto-draft was not working.  My mistake for not assuming they might be incompetent.  Then they added a $65 deposit charge to my next bill since my payment had been considered "late" even though the lateness was due to their auto-pay system failure.  Fine, whatever.

Thereafter, I opted out of auto-pay and manually paid each bill online each month.  Interestingly, the first payment manually made online was reflected in the account payment history and the next bill as expected; but subsequent payments for subsequent bills were not credited to the bills even though they are listed in the account payment history.  They took my money but never credited my account. 

I called Customer Service for an explanation; the representative agreed that she saw the payments but I wasn't getting credited in the bills.  She forwarded the matter to the billing department where they should investigate the issue and have a resolution in 14 days.  I asked why doesn't she just transfer me to that department while I was on the phone so we could resolve it immediately and she responded that they have to follow a process, which takes two weeks to complete.  Wow.

I am moving out of the country in about a week so I imagine that it will be a source of unneeded frustration to collect the $65 deposit and get a resolution to their billing issues while I'm overseas.

I'll leave you with one positive; the Customer Service representatives are courteous and professional despite working with a problematic computer system.  When scheduling a stop date for my service, it literally took the representative over five minutes before she could access my account and over 10 minutes more just to setup the stop service date and forwarding address.  They must be using Tandy computers leftover from 1984 with 300 baud modems to connect to the internet!







The worst company in the world. Put it this way, once they make a mistake on their end, all hell breaks lose. You'll find yourself in stressful situations from constant emails and calls that will get you absolutely nowhere. Managers that say they will help, and nothing happens. Lies and deceitful 'back office' that doesn't communicate with one another. Just a complete nightmare.







Common Sense, where are you?  After being told a technician would be here today between 8 a.m and 1 pm, I called WG at 2;30 to ask where they were.  No one has called, no one has come.  I was told by two different "supervisors" that "Our dispatchers have no way of reaching our technicians once they are out in the field."

Seriously?  I asked, "what if there was an emergency and you had to contact them?"  Again, came the response, "Our dispatchers have NO WAY to reach our technicians once they are out in the field."

Please be on the watch for WG Technicians bouncing about in impenetrable bubbles as they float randomly from place to place.  Catch one if you can.







Based on my experience and those of my neighbors in Georgetown,  Washington Gas is not accountable, transparent, or communicative when it comes to repairing gas lines and related infrastructure above and below our streets.







reported a possible gas leak at 2:30pm and upon follow up at 4:30pm there was no record of the call. After some research found the report. No time estimate possible...
Called back at 8:30pm... no record of call .... submitted another call for leak inspection... 
Again no time estimate possible.... said just call back in 2 hours if no show.... 

Would give no star if possible.....







Their customer services is does not exist.  Their website gives you a phone number, which you them have a computer direct you through recorded answers and it is hard to get someone on the phone.  I had ended my service when I moved out of my apartment, but recently discovered that I was still being charged. I sent in information for a refund and I'm here a month later with no response besides, allow sufficient time for an investigation. A month should be enough time with all the documentation I provided.. still out over $200 of a refund.

and after speaking with someone and letting them know i moved out.. i just got charged again.. this is RIDICULOUS







I would give them zero stars if i could. Worst customer service. 
Ive had the worst experience dealing with washington gas. They took a deposit from me that was supposed to be refunded to me in December 2016. Six months and 20 calls later, I still have not received my deposit.  WG should not be a monopoly. We should be able to choose our gas company!







Literally the worst company I have had the displeasure of trying to work with. I tried to turn on gas in my new house and they said it would take 5 days from the day I called to make that happen. I accepted that and suffered through cold showers and not cooking for the time being. Then comes my Monday appointment, of which they gave me the time frame of 7am-5pm!! I quite literally had to cancel anything I had scheduled for the day, and well yes surprise surprise they did not show up!!! They finally agreed to come out and said it would be around midnight?! Are you joking?? What kind of company is this!! And so alas, I am with no gas going for a week now and still unsure if they will come tomorrow. They can't guarantee a single thing. WORST COMPANY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Their website may just well be the worst on the internet.  My guess is it was designed in 1997.  Its slow, and the bill pay service is archaic. Good luck getting anything of substance from the site.  I have signed up for auto-pay and budget billing multiple times but it never goes into effect.  In addition, I schedule payments and they don't show on the website (although I receive emails stating the payment has been scheduled).  But with that said, I have had no problems with their service, hence the 2 stars.

Washington Gas,Your payment options are unbelievably torturous. Your website never works! And your telephone assistance is sub-par, repetitive, annoying, and unproductive. It takes 20 mins to make a payment if you're lucky and don't get hung up on for one mistaken number entered. Please upgrade your services.                                                   Sincerely.                                     At my wits end with you!

Why am I not surprised that this terrible company has 1 star?For the past, two years since I've had WG, every few months they contact me saying they have not received payments. I then have to log on to my account and send screen shots. This is the third time it is happening. Seriously guys, maybe update your technology or get a staff has a brain. #1 reason can't wait to move out of the area so never have to deal with them.

Another one star review! What a horrible company. 1. The website. Was down for almost a year and then sporadically works. 2. You cannot autopay you must send a check3. Phone service... wait on hold and then listen to this lady prattle on about what the company will not or cannot do in a sing song voice over and over again 4. Moving out: you have to send them PROOF of moving out or they will send you a bill to your NEW address for your OLD address. Does that make any sense whatsoever???Terrible company!

Literally everyone I have talked to in customer service here had been rude and short tempered. At one point I was literally told that I had missed my appointment because I wasn't home when I in fact took the whole day off to stay at home just for them. The man whom came out to actually turn on my gas was very pleasant though.

Yelp needs a negative star rating... Washington Gas customer support people are utterly useless.  Both from calling their support number and e-mailing customersupport@washgas.….  Took me over a month to finally resolve a billing issue, where the home builder's bill was on my account.  Over the course of a month, I spoke with several customer support reps and maybe one or two were truly helpful. E-mailing customersupport@washgas.… is even worse. All they do is copy and paste pre-written bullshit and then write some bullshit saying your clarification request is still being processed. Nothing I received by e-mail was ever helpful. So pretty much their customer support is useless, cause they have a back office that actually solves the issues. It would seem like issues get lost in translation from customer support to their back office. The problem was that someone on the Wash Gas end screwed up when I called before closing to have the account transfer to my name on my requested effective date, which caused the builder's bill to show up in my account. Whatever, finally got it resolved. Try to hire some smarter people for your customer support.

Rating systems need to have negative stars for "messed up" circumstances.When calling for service you have to wait the entire day because they do not give time windows.  If they don't show up then oh, well try again another day.  They are very good at turning your gas off.  Not so much with getting it turned back on.  Some techs call but most don't.  One showed up about two to three days after I called (at a time when no one would be home).  I am literally at the complaining to third parties stage.  Seriously consider going all electric if you have the funds.  I even received a gas delivery charge when my house currently has no gas for about a month.

I haven't even moved into the apartment that requires a Washington Gas account yet, and I can already see that the next year or more of dealing with this is going to be pure, unmitigated hell.As everyone else has already said, their website is a complete abomination. It astounds me that this company can provide service to such a large area and have zero regard for the necessity of a functional website. To begin with, it is impossible to create the online profile that is required to set up autopay. You can try, as I did, multiple times on multiple days for multiple weeks, and you will continuously get an error message. I emailed their help desk and their response was essentially, "Yes, sorry about that, we've been having technical difficulties. Bye." I responded with something along the lines of, "Ok so I just... don't make an online profile then?" No response.That was just the beginning.We just had service started to this apartment (which we haven't actually moved into yet), so I suspected we would have a service initiation fee of some sort. But, strangely enough, when I checked my balance online, it said $0. When I called and tried to pay my balance through the automated system, it also said it was $0. Since we don't live in the apartment yet, we haven't been getting the mail there, so I can't verify whether or not they sent a paper bill. That shouldn't matter, though, because it's 2017 and every establishment in existence is expected to have some type of virtual payment method that prevents you from having to rely on paper statements and send physical checks.Once I speak to a human, he confirms that I do indeed owe a $15 fee due in six days. Mhm. I ask him how I am supposed to go about paying that seeing as both the website and automated phone payment system think my balance is $0. After informing me that "The problem is not us, ma'am, the problem is the internet," he redirects me to... the same automated number that won't let me pay because it thinks my account balance is $0. Thanks, man!So I call again. I speak to a second person and explain the issue I'm having. She casually tells me that it's showing up as a $0 balance because I don't have an actual gas bill added to it yet."But the $15 is still due on the 13th... and I have to pay it by the 13th?""Yes ma'am.""Can I go ahead and do that then?""Hold on while I redirect you to someone who can help you with that." BACK TO THE AUTOMATED PAYMENT LINE. I call a third time. I speak to a third person. I explain that this is my third time calling and that I have no way to pay the $15 balance I wouldn't even have known about if I hadn't called to ask. She tries to direct me to the automated payment line again. NOPE. NO. ABSOLUTELY NO. THAT'S NOT WORKING. "I'm sorry for the technical issues, ma'am, and I suggest you try the line again in a few hours." NO. DEFINITELY NOT. Reluctantly, she finally tells me she can accept a check over the phone and takes my bank account/routing numbers, which I'm assuming worked because she gave me a confirmation number (only after having me wait and sharing that she, too, was having "technical difficulties.") I'm 90% sure she also called me "dude" at some point during this conversation, but I can only hope I misheard her. So we're done now. I'm ready to hang up. I have supposedly (we'll find out) paid my balance. Right before saying goodbye, she chimes to me, "Remember that in the future, you can always review your balance and pay your bill online!""Well obviously I can't, because it doesn't work-""Have a nice day, ma'am, and let me direct you to our quick customer service survey."  Kill me.

Since no one in customer service seems to be listening to me I have had to go to social media to see if I can get help. I have been waiting over two months to get gas installed in my house. I am converting my oven, water heater and fireplace. I am waiting at my house for the fourth time for someone to install the meter. First and second time no one showed up. Third time they showed up but I need to Airflow to add a piece of equipment. This has been installed so I called and setup an appointment. I called Washington Gas yesterday and got confirmation someone was coming today and I called this morning and they confirmed again. I am now on the phone and have been told that they are not coming. Four days out of work and my window was 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Now my husband will have to be at the house on Friday from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. This is ridiculous. If there was another gas company I could use I would be out of here. Someone high up needs to know that there is no communication with customers, customer service, dispatch and contractors. This is only the tip of the iceberg of what I have been through.

Washington Gas turned off the gas to my house because they were fixing a leak in their system at the street. They left a note on the door at 4 am on Thursday 6/29 saying they had turned off the gas. I don't use the door where they left the note, so I saw it Sat morning 7/1 and called to have the gas turned back on, but was told that Washington Gas doesn't work on weekends so it would be Monday at the earliest that they could turn the gas back on. Unbelievable. They can't turn the gas on because Washington Gas technicians don't work weekends. I have been paying my bill on time at this address for 31 years. Now I'm stuck with no hot water or gas to cook with for at least the weekend. Terrible customer service. Especially for a utility that the public depends on.

Without question the worst customer service of any utility or customer focused organization that I have ever dealt with.  You cannot talk to anyone who makes a decision or schedules people.  Having problems with your meter, they tell you to plan to wait all day.Want a meter moved, they contract that out to someone and do not plan to get it ever scheduled.Want to talk to a scheduler for either.  They are not available and the customer service line will tell you they are not allowed to talk to themWhen they came to move the meter, they told me I needed a new line from the meter to the street.  This is an expense they need to incur, I have never heard back from them.Without question, the CEO of Washington Gas should be the next CEO of United Airlines, because they would be my all stars for pathetic approaches to customers.

This place would be a negative if yelp allowed it. As is evidenced by the reviews, wash gas should be investigated by the attorney generals of all three jurisdictions

I hardly ever write reviews but was compelled to add my warnings to the many others about Washington Gas.METICULOUSLY REVIEW YOUR BILLS!  After my first bill their auto-pay system failed to draft my bank account for the second and subsequent bills.  Since I have never experienced issues before in 17 years of using auto-pay for utilities, I didn't look at the bills posted on my Washington Gas account online.  It wasn't until Washington Gas physically mailed me a disconnect warning that I signed into my account to see what was going on and saw that auto-draft was not working.  My mistake for not assuming they might be incompetent.  Then they added a $65 deposit charge to my next bill since my payment had been considered "late" even though the lateness was due to their auto-pay system failure.  Fine, whatever.Thereafter, I opted out of auto-pay and manually paid each bill online each month.  Interestingly, the first payment manually made online was reflected in the account payment history and the next bill as expected; but subsequent payments for subsequent bills were not credited to the bills even though they are listed in the account payment history.  They took my money but never credited my account. I called Customer Service for an explanation; the representative agreed that she saw the payments but I wasn't getting credited in the bills.  She forwarded the matter to the billing department where they should investigate the issue and have a resolution in 14 days.  I asked why doesn't she just transfer me to that department while I was on the phone so we could resolve it immediately and she responded that they have to follow a process, which takes two weeks to complete.  Wow.I am moving out of the country in about a week so I imagine that it will be a source of unneeded frustration to collect the $65 deposit and get a resolution to their billing issues while I'm overseas.I'll leave you with one positive; the Customer Service representatives are courteous and professional despite working with a problematic computer system.  When scheduling a stop date for my service, it literally took the representative over five minutes before she could access my account and over 10 minutes more just to setup the stop service date and forwarding address.  They must be using Tandy computers leftover from 1984 with 300 baud modems to connect to the internet!

The worst company in the world. Put it this way, once they make a mistake on their end, all hell breaks lose. You'll find yourself in stressful situations from constant emails and calls that will get you absolutely nowhere. Managers that say they will help, and nothing happens. Lies and deceitful 'back office' that doesn't communicate with one another. Just a complete nightmare.

Common Sense, where are you?  After being told a technician would be here today between 8 a.m and 1 pm, I called WG at 2;30 to ask where they were.  No one has called, no one has come.  I was told by two different "supervisors" that "Our dispatchers have no way of reaching our technicians once they are out in the field."Seriously?  I asked, "what if there was an emergency and you had to contact them?"  Again, came the response, "Our dispatchers have NO WAY to reach our technicians once they are out in the field."Please be on the watch for WG Technicians bouncing about in impenetrable bubbles as they float randomly from place to place.  Catch one if you can.

Based on my experience and those of my neighbors in Georgetown,  Washington Gas is not accountable, transparent, or communicative when it comes to repairing gas lines and related infrastructure above and below our streets.

reported a possible gas leak at 2:30pm and upon follow up at 4:30pm there was no record of the call. After some research found the report. No time estimate possible...Called back at 8:30pm... no record of call .... submitted another call for leak inspection... Again no time estimate possible.... said just call back in 2 hours if no show.... Would give no star if possible.....

Their customer services is does not exist.  Their website gives you a phone number, which you them have a computer direct you through recorded answers and it is hard to get someone on the phone.  I had ended my service when I moved out of my apartment, but recently discovered that I was still being charged. I sent in information for a refund and I'm here a month later with no response besides, allow sufficient time for an investigation. A month should be enough time with all the documentation I provided.. still out over $200 of a refund.and after speaking with someone and letting them know i moved out.. i just got charged again.. this is RIDICULOUS

I would give them zero stars if i could. Worst customer service. Ive had the worst experience dealing with washington gas. They took a deposit from me that was supposed to be refunded to me in December 2016. Six months and 20 calls later, I still have not received my deposit.  WG should not be a monopoly. We should be able to choose our gas company!

Literally the worst company I have had the displeasure of trying to work with. I tried to turn on gas in my new house and they said it would take 5 days from the day I called to make that happen. I accepted that and suffered through cold showers and not cooking for the time being. Then comes my Monday appointment, of which they gave me the time frame of 7am-5pm!! I quite literally had to cancel anything I had scheduled for the day, and well yes surprise surprise they did not show up!!! They finally agreed to come out and said it would be around midnight?! Are you joking?? What kind of company is this!! And so alas, I am with no gas going for a week now and still unsure if they will come tomorrow. They can't guarantee a single thing. WORST COMPANY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Their website may just well be the worst on the internet.  My guess is it was designed in 1997.  Its slow, and the bill pay service is archaic. Good luck getting anything of substance from the site.  I have signed up for auto-pay and budget billing multiple times but it never goes into effect.  In addition, I schedule payments and they don't show on the website (although I receive emails stating the payment has been scheduled).  

But with that said, I have had no problems with their service, hence the 2 stars.







Washington Gas,
Your payment options are unbelievably torturous. Your website never works! And your telephone assistance is sub-par, repetitive, annoying, and unproductive. It takes 20 mins to make a payment if you're lucky and don't get hung up on for one mistaken number entered. Please upgrade your services.

                                                   Sincerely.
                                     At my wits end with you!







Why am I not surprised that this terrible company has 1 star?

For the past, two years since I've had WG, every few months they contact me saying they have not received payments. I then have to log on to my account and send screen shots. This is the third time it is happening. Seriously guys, maybe update your technology or get a staff has a brain. #1 reason can't wait to move out of the area so never have to deal with them.







Another one star review! What a horrible company. 

1. The website. Was down for almost a year and then sporadically works. 
2. You cannot autopay you must send a check
3. Phone service... wait on hold and then listen to this lady prattle on about what the company will not or cannot do in a sing song voice over and over again 
4. Moving out: you have to send them PROOF of moving out or they will send you a bill to your NEW address for your OLD address. Does that make any sense whatsoever???

Terrible company!







Literally everyone I have talked to in customer service here had been rude and short tempered. At one point I was literally told that I had missed my appointment because I wasn't home when I in fact took the whole day off to stay at home just for them. The man whom came out to actually turn on my gas was very pleasant though.







Yelp needs a negative star rating... 

Washington Gas customer support people are utterly useless.  Both from calling their support number and e-mailing customersupport@washgas.com.  Took me over a month to finally resolve a billing issue, where the home builder's bill was on my account.  

Over the course of a month, I spoke with several customer support reps and maybe one or two were truly helpful. E-mailing customersupport@washgas.com is even worse. All they do is copy and paste pre-written bullshit and then write some bullshit saying your clarification request is still being processed. Nothing I received by e-mail was ever helpful. 

So pretty much their customer support is useless, cause they have a back office that actually solves the issues. It would seem like issues get lost in translation from customer support to their back office. 

The problem was that someone on the Wash Gas end screwed up when I called before closing to have the account transfer to my name on my requested effective date, which caused the builder's bill to show up in my account. 

Whatever, finally got it resolved. Try to hire some smarter people for your customer support.







Rating systems need to have negative stars for "messed up" circumstances.

When calling for service you have to wait the entire day because they do not give time windows.  If they don't show up then oh, well try again another day.  They are very good at turning your gas off.  Not so much with getting it turned back on.  Some techs call but most don't.  One showed up about two to three days after I called (at a time when no one would be home).  I am literally at the complaining to third parties stage.  Seriously consider going all electric if you have the funds.  I even received a gas delivery charge when my house currently has no gas for about a month.







I haven't even moved into the apartment that requires a Washington Gas account yet, and I can already see that the next year or more of dealing with this is going to be pure, unmitigated hell.

As everyone else has already said, their website is a complete abomination. It astounds me that this company can provide service to such a large area and have zero regard for the necessity of a functional website. To begin with, it is impossible to create the online profile that is required to set up autopay. You can try, as I did, multiple times on multiple days for multiple weeks, and you will continuously get an error message. I emailed their help desk and their response was essentially, "Yes, sorry about that, we've been having technical difficulties. Bye." I responded with something along the lines of, "Ok so I just... don't make an online profile then?" No response.

That was just the beginning.

We just had service started to this apartment (which we haven't actually moved into yet), so I suspected we would have a service initiation fee of some sort. But, strangely enough, when I checked my balance online, it said $0. When I called and tried to pay my balance through the automated system, it also said it was $0. Since we don't live in the apartment yet, we haven't been getting the mail there, so I can't verify whether or not they sent a paper bill. That shouldn't matter, though, because it's 2017 and every establishment in existence is expected to have some type of virtual payment method that prevents you from having to rely on paper statements and send physical checks.

Once I speak to a human, he confirms that I do indeed owe a $15 fee due in six days. Mhm. I ask him how I am supposed to go about paying that seeing as both the website and automated phone payment system think my balance is $0. After informing me that "The problem is not us, ma'am, the problem is the internet," he redirects me to... the same automated number that won't let me pay because it thinks my account balance is $0. Thanks, man!

So I call again. I speak to a second person and explain the issue I'm having. She casually tells me that it's showing up as a $0 balance because I don't have an actual gas bill added to it yet.

"But the $15 is still due on the 13th... and I have to pay it by the 13th?"

"Yes ma'am."

"Can I go ahead and do that then?"

"Hold on while I redirect you to someone who can help you with that." 

BACK TO THE AUTOMATED PAYMENT LINE. 

I call a third time. I speak to a third person. I explain that this is my third time calling and that I have no way to pay the $15 balance I wouldn't even have known about if I hadn't called to ask. She tries to direct me to the automated payment line again. NOPE. NO. ABSOLUTELY NO. THAT'S NOT WORKING. "I'm sorry for the technical issues, ma'am, and I suggest you try the line again in a few hours." NO. DEFINITELY NOT. Reluctantly, she finally tells me she can accept a check over the phone and takes my bank account/routing numbers, which I'm assuming worked because she gave me a confirmation number (only after having me wait and sharing that she, too, was having "technical difficulties.") 

I'm 90% sure she also called me "dude" at some point during this conversation, but I can only hope I misheard her. 

So we're done now. I'm ready to hang up. I have supposedly (we'll find out) paid my balance. Right before saying goodbye, she chimes to me, "Remember that in the future, you can always review your balance and pay your bill online!"

"Well obviously I can't, because it doesn't work-"

"Have a nice day, ma'am, and let me direct you to our quick customer service survey."  

Kill me.







Since no one in customer service seems to be listening to me I have had to go to social media to see if I can get help. I have been waiting over two months to get gas installed in my house. I am converting my oven, water heater and fireplace. I am waiting at my house for the fourth time for someone to install the meter. First and second time no one showed up. Third time they showed up but I need to Airflow to add a piece of equipment. This has been installed so I called and setup an appointment. I called Washington Gas yesterday and got confirmation someone was coming today and I called this morning and they confirmed again. I am now on the phone and have been told that they are not coming. Four days out of work and my window was 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Now my husband will have to be at the house on Friday from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. This is ridiculous. If there was another gas company I could use I would be out of here. Someone high up needs to know that there is no communication with customers, customer service, dispatch and contractors. This is only the tip of the iceberg of what I have been through.







Washington Gas turned off the gas to my house because they were fixing a leak in their system at the street. They left a note on the door at 4 am on Thursday 6/29 saying they had turned off the gas. I don't use the door where they left the note, so I saw it Sat morning 7/1 and called to have the gas turned back on, but was told that Washington Gas doesn't work on weekends so it would be Monday at the earliest that they could turn the gas back on. 

Unbelievable. They can't turn the gas on because Washington Gas technicians don't work weekends. I have been paying my bill on time at this address for 31 years. Now I'm stuck with no hot water or gas to cook with for at least the weekend. Terrible customer service. Especially for a utility that the public depends on.







Without question the worst customer service of any utility or customer focused organization that I have ever dealt with.  You cannot talk to anyone who makes a decision or schedules people.  

Having problems with your meter, they tell you to plan to wait all day.

Want a meter moved, they contract that out to someone and do not plan to get it ever scheduled.

Want to talk to a scheduler for either.  They are not available and the customer service line will tell you they are not allowed to talk to them

When they came to move the meter, they told me I needed a new line from the meter to the street.  This is an expense they need to incur, I have never heard back from them.

Without question, the CEO of Washington Gas should be the next CEO of United Airlines, because they would be my all stars for pathetic approaches to customers.







This place would be a negative if yelp allowed it. As is evidenced by the reviews, wash gas should be investigated by the attorney generals of all three jurisdictions







I hardly ever write reviews but was compelled to add my warnings to the many others about Washington Gas.

METICULOUSLY REVIEW YOUR BILLS!  After my first bill their auto-pay system failed to draft my bank account for the second and subsequent bills.  Since I have never experienced issues before in 17 years of using auto-pay for utilities, I didn't look at the bills posted on my Washington Gas account online.  It wasn't until Washington Gas physically mailed me a disconnect warning that I signed into my account to see what was going on and saw that auto-draft was not working.  My mistake for not assuming they might be incompetent.  Then they added a $65 deposit charge to my next bill since my payment had been considered "late" even though the lateness was due to their auto-pay system failure.  Fine, whatever.

Thereafter, I opted out of auto-pay and manually paid each bill online each month.  Interestingly, the first payment manually made online was reflected in the account payment history and the next bill as expected; but subsequent payments for subsequent bills were not credited to the bills even though they are listed in the account payment history.  They took my money but never credited my account. 

I called Customer Service for an explanation; the representative agreed that she saw the payments but I wasn't getting credited in the bills.  She forwarded the matter to the billing department where they should investigate the issue and have a resolution in 14 days.  I asked why doesn't she just transfer me to that department while I was on the phone so we could resolve it immediately and she responded that they have to follow a process, which takes two weeks to complete.  Wow.

I am moving out of the country in about a week so I imagine that it will be a source of unneeded frustration to collect the $65 deposit and get a resolution to their billing issues while I'm overseas.

I'll leave you with one positive; the Customer Service representatives are courteous and professional despite working with a problematic computer system.  When scheduling a stop date for my service, it literally took the representative over five minutes before she could access my account and over 10 minutes more just to setup the stop service date and forwarding address.  They must be using Tandy computers leftover from 1984 with 300 baud modems to connect to the internet!







The worst company in the world. Put it this way, once they make a mistake on their end, all hell breaks lose. You'll find yourself in stressful situations from constant emails and calls that will get you absolutely nowhere. Managers that say they will help, and nothing happens. Lies and deceitful 'back office' that doesn't communicate with one another. Just a complete nightmare.







Common Sense, where are you?  After being told a technician would be here today between 8 a.m and 1 pm, I called WG at 2;30 to ask where they were.  No one has called, no one has come.  I was told by two different "supervisors" that "Our dispatchers have no way of reaching our technicians once they are out in the field."

Seriously?  I asked, "what if there was an emergency and you had to contact them?"  Again, came the response, "Our dispatchers have NO WAY to reach our technicians once they are out in the field."

Please be on the watch for WG Technicians bouncing about in impenetrable bubbles as they float randomly from place to place.  Catch one if you can.







Based on my experience and those of my neighbors in Georgetown,  Washington Gas is not accountable, transparent, or communicative when it comes to repairing gas lines and related infrastructure above and below our streets.







reported a possible gas leak at 2:30pm and upon follow up at 4:30pm there was no record of the call. After some research found the report. No time estimate possible...
Called back at 8:30pm... no record of call .... submitted another call for leak inspection... 
Again no time estimate possible.... said just call back in 2 hours if no show.... 

Would give no star if possible.....







Their customer services is does not exist.  Their website gives you a phone number, which you them have a computer direct you through recorded answers and it is hard to get someone on the phone.  I had ended my service when I moved out of my apartment, but recently discovered that I was still being charged. I sent in information for a refund and I'm here a month later with no response besides, allow sufficient time for an investigation. A month should be enough time with all the documentation I provided.. still out over $200 of a refund.

and after speaking with someone and letting them know i moved out.. i just got charged again.. this is RIDICULOUS







I would give them zero stars if i could. Worst customer service. 
Ive had the worst experience dealing with washington gas. They took a deposit from me that was supposed to be refunded to me in December 2016. Six months and 20 calls later, I still have not received my deposit.  WG should not be a monopoly. We should be able to choose our gas company!







Literally the worst company I have had the displeasure of trying to work with. I tried to turn on gas in my new house and they said it would take 5 days from the day I called to make that happen. I accepted that and suffered through cold showers and not cooking for the time being. Then comes my Monday appointment, of which they gave me the time frame of 7am-5pm!! I quite literally had to cancel anything I had scheduled for the day, and well yes surprise surprise they did not show up!!! They finally agreed to come out and said it would be around midnight?! Are you joking?? What kind of company is this!! And so alas, I am with no gas going for a week now and still unsure if they will come tomorrow. They can't guarantee a single thing. WORST COMPANY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

It looks like we don't have a specific address for Washington Gas, which makes giving directions tricky. This business might not have an official storefront, or it might move to multiple locations throughout the day.
Give me directions anyway...

Literally everyone I have talked to in customer service here had been rude and short tempered. At one point I was literally told that I had missed my appointment because I wasn't home when I in fact took the whole day off to stay at home just for them. The man whom came out to actually turn on my gas was very pleasant though.

Yelp needs a negative star rating... Washington Gas customer support people are utterly useless.  Both from calling their support number and e-mailing customersupport@washgas.….  Took me over a month to finally resolve a billing issue, where the home builder's bill was on my account.  Over the course of a month, I spoke with several customer support reps and maybe one or two were truly helpful. E-mailing customersupport@washgas.… is even worse. All they do is copy and paste pre-written bullshit and then write some bullshit saying your clarification request is still being processed. Nothing I received by e-mail was ever helpful. So pretty much their customer support is useless, cause they have a back office that actually solves the issues. It would seem like issues get lost in translation from customer support to their back office. The problem was that someone on the Wash Gas end screwed up when I called before closing to have the account transfer to my name on my requested effective date, which caused the builder's bill to show up in my account. Whatever, finally got it resolved. Try to hire some smarter people for your customer support.

Rating systems need to have negative stars for "messed up" circumstances.When calling for service you have to wait the entire day because they do not give time windows.  If they don't show up then oh, well try again another day.  They are very good at turning your gas off.  Not so much with getting it turned back on.  Some techs call but most don't.  One showed up about two to three days after I called (at a time when no one would be home).  I am literally at the complaining to third parties stage.  Seriously consider going all electric if you have the funds.  I even received a gas delivery charge when my house currently has no gas for about a month.

I haven't even moved into the apartment that requires a Washington Gas account yet, and I can already see that the next year or more of dealing with this is going to be pure, unmitigated hell.As everyone else has already said, their website is a complete abomination. It astounds me that this company can provide service to such a large area and have zero regard for the necessity of a functional website. To begin with, it is impossible to create the online profile that is required to set up autopay. You can try, as I did, multiple times on multiple days for multiple weeks, and you will continuously get an error message. I emailed their help desk and their response was essentially, "Yes, sorry about that, we've been having technical difficulties. Bye." I responded with something along the lines of, "Ok so I just... don't make an online profile then?" No response.That was just the beginning.We just had service started to this apartment (which we haven't actually moved into yet), so I suspected we would have a service initiation fee of some sort. But, strangely enough, when I checked my balance online, it said $0. When I called and tried to pay my balance through the automated system, it also said it was $0. Since we don't live in the apartment yet, we haven't been getting the mail there, so I can't verify whether or not they sent a paper bill. That shouldn't matter, though, because it's 2017 and every establishment in existence is expected to have some type of virtual payment method that prevents you from having to rely on paper statements and send physical checks.Once I speak to a human, he confirms that I do indeed owe a $15 fee due in six days. Mhm. I ask him how I am supposed to go about paying that seeing as both the website and automated phone payment system think my balance is $0. After informing me that "The problem is not us, ma'am, the problem is the internet," he redirects me to... the same automated number that won't let me pay because it thinks my account balance is $0. Thanks, man!So I call again. I speak to a second person and explain the issue I'm having. She casually tells me that it's showing up as a $0 balance because I don't have an actual gas bill added to it yet."But the $15 is still due on the 13th... and I have to pay it by the 13th?""Yes ma'am.""Can I go ahead and do that then?""Hold on while I redirect you to someone who can help you with that." BACK TO THE AUTOMATED PAYMENT LINE. I call a third time. I speak to a third person. I explain that this is my third time calling and that I have no way to pay the $15 balance I wouldn't even have known about if I hadn't called to ask. She tries to direct me to the automated payment line again. NOPE. NO. ABSOLUTELY NO. THAT'S NOT WORKING. "I'm sorry for the technical issues, ma'am, and I suggest you try the line again in a few hours." NO. DEFINITELY NOT. Reluctantly, she finally tells me she can accept a check over the phone and takes my bank account/routing numbers, which I'm assuming worked because she gave me a confirmation number (only after having me wait and sharing that she, too, was having "technical difficulties.") I'm 90% sure she also called me "dude" at some point during this conversation, but I can only hope I misheard her. So we're done now. I'm ready to hang up. I have supposedly (we'll find out) paid my balance. Right before saying goodbye, she chimes to me, "Remember that in the future, you can always review your balance and pay your bill online!""Well obviously I can't, because it doesn't work-""Have a nice day, ma'am, and let me direct you to our quick customer service survey."  Kill me.

Since no one in customer service seems to be listening to me I have had to go to social media to see if I can get help. I have been waiting over two months to get gas installed in my house. I am converting my oven, water heater and fireplace. I am waiting at my house for the fourth time for someone to install the meter. First and second time no one showed up. Third time they showed up but I need to Airflow to add a piece of equipment. This has been installed so I called and setup an appointment. I called Washington Gas yesterday and got confirmation someone was coming today and I called this morning and they confirmed again. I am now on the phone and have been told that they are not coming. Four days out of work and my window was 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Now my husband will have to be at the house on Friday from 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. This is ridiculous. If there was another gas company I could use I would be out of here. Someone high up needs to know that there is no communication with customers, customer service, dispatch and contractors. This is only the tip of the iceberg of what I have been through.

Washington Gas turned off the gas to my house because they were fixing a leak in their system at the street. They left a note on the door at 4 am on Thursday 6/29 saying they had turned off the gas. I don't use the door where they left the note, so I saw it Sat morning 7/1 and called to have the gas turned back on, but was told that Washington Gas doesn't work on weekends so it would be Monday at the earliest that they could turn the gas back on. Unbelievable. They can't turn the gas on because Washington Gas technicians don't work weekends. I have been paying my bill on time at this address for 31 years. Now I'm stuck with no hot water or gas to cook with for at least the weekend. Terrible customer service. Especially for a utility that the public depends on.

Without question the worst customer service of any utility or customer focused organization that I have ever dealt with.  You cannot talk to anyone who makes a decision or schedules people.  Having problems with your meter, they tell you to plan to wait all day.Want a meter moved, they contract that out to someone and do not plan to get it ever scheduled.Want to talk to a scheduler for either.  They are not available and the customer service line will tell you they are not allowed to talk to themWhen they came to move the meter, they told me I needed a new line from the meter to the street.  This is an expense they need to incur, I have never heard back from them.Without question, the CEO of Washington Gas should be the next CEO of United Airlines, because they would be my all stars for pathetic approaches to customers.

I hardly ever write reviews but was compelled to add my warnings to the many others about Washington Gas.METICULOUSLY REVIEW YOUR BILLS!  After my first bill their auto-pay system failed to draft my bank account for the second and subsequent bills.  Since I have never experienced issues before in 17 years of using auto-pay for utilities, I didn't look at the bills posted on my Washington Gas account online.  It wasn't until Washington Gas physically mailed me a disconnect warning that I signed into my account to see what was going on and saw that auto-draft was not working.  My mistake for not assuming they might be incompetent.  Then they added a $65 deposit charge to my next bill since my payment had been considered "late" even though the lateness was due to their auto-pay system failure.  Fine, whatever.Thereafter, I opted out of auto-pay and manually paid each bill online each month.  Interestingly, the first payment manually made online was reflected in the account payment history and the next bill as expected; but subsequent payments for subsequent bills were not credited to the bills even though they are listed in the account payment history.  They took my money but never credited my account. I called Customer Service for an explanation; the representative agreed that she saw the payments but I wasn't getting credited in the bills.  She forwarded the matter to the billing department where they should investigate the issue and have a resolution in 14 days.  I asked why doesn't she just transfer me to that department while I was on the phone so we could resolve it immediately and she responded that they have to follow a process, which takes two weeks to complete.  Wow.I am moving out of the country in about a week so I imagine that it will be a source of unneeded frustration to collect the $65 deposit and get a resolution to their billing issues while I'm overseas.I'll leave you with one positive; the Customer Service representatives are courteous and professional despite working with a problematic computer system.  When scheduling a stop date for my service, it literally took the representative over five minutes before she could access my account and over 10 minutes more just to setup the stop service date and forwarding address.  They must be using Tandy computers leftover from 1984 with 300 baud modems to connect to the internet!

The worst company in the world. Put it this way, once they make a mistake on their end, all hell breaks lose. You'll find yourself in stressful situations from constant emails and calls that will get you absolutely nowhere. Managers that say they will help, and nothing happens. Lies and deceitful 'back office' that doesn't communicate with one another. Just a complete nightmare.

Common Sense, where are you?  After being told a technician would be here today between 8 a.m and 1 pm, I called WG at 2;30 to ask where they were.  No one has called, no one has come.  I was told by two different "supervisors" that "Our dispatchers have no way of reaching our technicians once they are out in the field."Seriously?  I asked, "what if there was an emergency and you had to contact them?"  Again, came the response, "Our dispatchers have NO WAY to reach our technicians once they are out in the field."Please be on the watch for WG Technicians bouncing about in impenetrable bubbles as they float randomly from place to place.  Catch one if you can.

reported a possible gas leak at 2:30pm and upon follow up at 4:30pm there was no record of the call. After some research found the report. No time estimate possible...Called back at 8:30pm... no record of call .... submitted another call for leak inspection... Again no time estimate possible.... said just call back in 2 hours if no show.... Would give no star if possible.....

Their customer services is does not exist.  Their website gives you a phone number, which you them have a computer direct you through recorded answers and it is hard to get someone on the phone.  I had ended my service when I moved out of my apartment, but recently discovered that I was still being charged. I sent in information for a refund and I'm here a month later with no response besides, allow sufficient time for an investigation. A month should be enough time with all the documentation I provided.. still out over $200 of a refund.and after speaking with someone and letting them know i moved out.. i just got charged again.. this is RIDICULOUS

I would give them zero stars if i could. Worst customer service. Ive had the worst experience dealing with washington gas. They took a deposit from me that was supposed to be refunded to me in December 2016. Six months and 20 calls later, I still have not received my deposit.  WG should not be a monopoly. We should be able to choose our gas company!

Literally the worst company I have had the displeasure of trying to work with. I tried to turn on gas in my new house and they said it would take 5 days from the day I called to make that happen. I accepted that and suffered through cold showers and not cooking for the time being. Then comes my Monday appointment, of which they gave me the time frame of 7am-5pm!! I quite literally had to cancel anything I had scheduled for the day, and well yes surprise surprise they did not show up!!! They finally agreed to come out and said it would be around midnight?! Are you joking?? What kind of company is this!! And so alas, I am with no gas going for a week now and still unsure if they will come tomorrow. They can't guarantee a single thing. WORST COMPANY EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
