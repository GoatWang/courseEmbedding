PULLMAN, Wash.—Businesses built around award-winning ideas for walk-around computer keyboards, exotic wood flooring, location-sensitive car safety software and bonding for renter security deposits are in the planning stages at Washington State University.

These areas were the top-four winners in this month’s preliminary rounds of the second annual WSU Business Plan Competition for students and business partners.
“We had 15 teams competing, and the students and friends in every one of them made excellent presentations on their ideas for prospective new businesses,” said Jerman Rose, director of the Center for Entrepreneurial Studies in the College of Business and Economics, both of which hosted the event. “Many of the teams were interdisciplinary, with members from diverse disciplines of study.”

“For this year’s competition, it was especially rewarding to watch how they had learned to collaborate with each other to pull together some really excellent business plans,” said Joe Harris, CES business plan specialist who helped organize the competition for its second year.

The student groups were divided into four leagues of 3-4 teams each. Some had worked together since August to hone their business ideas and write detailed business plans.

First place winners from each of the four leagues and recipients of $300 per team include the following:
 

“Key-Wi,” with a portable cylindrical keyboard product, by team members Chris Strahl, a graduate student from Medford, Ore.; Chris Bloom and Reshad Kazimee, graduate students from Pullman; and Nina Morton, an animal science student from Gig Harbor; 
“MarbleWood,” with a composite wood flooring and countertop product, by team members and mechanical engineering students Lee Garth Green from Lynnwood and Eli Patten from Long Beach; 
“Adevno Surety Services,” with a plan to issue bonds to cover renters’ damage deposits, by Isaac Wells and Michael King, both finance students from Pullman; and 
“Data Stream Inc.,” with a novel on-board concept aimed at accident prevention, by team members Ralph Williams, a finance student from Spokane, and Peter Eichman, a political science student from Cedaredge, Colo. 

Second place winning teams and recipients of $200 per team include the following:


“J&B Industries,” a canine DNA sequencer product, with team members John M. Williams, a general studies student, and Ben Eastman, a real estate student, both of Pullman; 
“Sanford Software,” a software product for Internet searches, with team members Ben Ford and Eric Sandall, computer science students from Zillah and Deer Park, respectively; 
“Robot-X Inc.,” a hands-on software debugging project, with team members Derek Harris, an entrepreneurship student from Pullman, Han Tran, an electrical engineering student from Bothell, and Ian Ender, a computer engineering student from Billings, Mont.; and 
“Electronic Literary Solutions,” an online book agent product, with team members and entrepreneurship students Kevin Snyder of Spokane and Adam Christian of Bellingham.

Third-place teams and recipients of $100 per team include the following:

“Infinity Motor Sports,” with services for high performance cars. Team members are mechanical engineering students Jessica Pebles of Davenport, Jeremiah Smith of Oroville and Reid Henry of Spokane;
“Artificial Rain,” a sprinkler-system company, by business student Bret Dahmen of Pullman;
“Courthouse Coffee,” with plans for a drive-through espresso business. Team members are graduate students Lisa J. Meyer of Cheney and Nathaniel Bowie of Lewiston, Idaho; and
“Watchers Inc.,” a rear-end auto collision deterrent product, by entrepreneurship student Andres Narvaez of Pullman.

Other teams to compete included the following:

“Veritux Technologies,” with plans for a computer leasing service, a second entry in the competition by Ford and Sandall; “Securest Systems,” face recognition software, by computer science student Lucas Diaz of Pullman; and “Count On Us,” online electronics retailing, by entrepreneurship student Paul Counts of Prescott.

All teams mentioned and more are eligible to participate in the final round of the WSU Business Plan Competition held in Pullman during the university’s Academic Showcase weekend April 1, 2005. The first-, second- and third-place teams will receive a total of $9,000 in prize money. 

Judging the presentations at the December preliminary round were panels of regional business people and professors from the College of Business and Economics. 

Business community members included Doug Cox, commercial loan officer, AmericanWest Bank, Pullman; Carey Jonas, project manager, Strategic Initiative, Trend West Resorts Inc., Redmond; Gonzaga University Professor Norm Leatha and John Pariseau, directors of Delta Angel Group, Spokane; Bill Skavdahl, assistant vice president, Washington Mutual Bank, Pullman; Rich Smith, commercial loan officer, Bank of Whitman, Pullman; Marla Telin, vice president of  finance, World Wide Packets, Spokane Valley; and Liz Wilhite, commercialization director, SIRTI (Spokane Intercollegiate Research and Technology Institute), Spokane. WSU judges included Susan Barnes, doctoral candidate in management and operations; Val Miskin, management and operations professor; Richard Reed, professor and chair for management and operations; and Brett Rogers, assistant state director, Washington Small Business Development Center, Spokane.

The Doctoral Program of Endless Possibility



May 8, 2017

Cheryl Reed 



2017 Ph.D. graduate Mason Burley finds ways to improve mental health treatment
By Amir Gilmore
Graduate School Evening of Excellence event at the Banyan’s event center on Thursday, Feb. 18, 2016 in Pullman.
Imagine the endless research possibilities and complex problems you could solve in a flexible graduate program tailored to your individual interests. Spokane native and 2017 Ph.D. graduate Mason Burley realized the possibilities in WSU’s individual interdisciplinary doctoral degree program (IIDP), where he researched mental health treatment through the lens of epidemiology, biostatistics, health administration and policy, and public health.
“The IIDP allows students to draw upon the strengths and resources from three different departments,” says Mason. “We can ultimately address critical problems that may not be unique to a single discipline.”
 
Mason graduated May 5 at the Spokane campus commencement ceremony.
When considering a Ph.D program, Mason talked with Kenn Daratha associate professor in the College of Nursing and a 2004 WSU IIDP graduate, and decided the IIDP program would be a good fit for his research interests.
“The program is designed to be flexible,” says Mason. “There is a lot of balancing between engaging with your committee members and communicating your research goals— but that is the nature of interdisciplinary research.”
Mason’s interest was mental health treatment. He recognized that only about half of the individuals with mental health conditions were receiving psychiatric treatment, so he focused his dissertation research on improving acute in-patient psychiatric treatment by developing a risk profile for individuals who face recurrent psychiatric hospitalizations over a short period.
“I am interested in access and availability and engagement in mental health treatment,” says Mason.
In addition to the flexibility of the program, students also benefit from strong academic support from faculty that span the three disciplines. Mason’s mentor and committee chair, Kenn Daratha, advised him on scholarly research and authored several publications with him. John Roll, vice dean for research in the Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine, was a staunch supporter of Mason’s research, and Mel Haberman, professor in the College of Nursing, helped with grant development and research writing. Jae Kennedy, professor and Chair of Health Policy and Administration, gave Mason the opportunity to teach statistics to his graduate students. Graduate School Associate Dean Patricia Sturko and Associate Dean Lisa Gloss were essential in guiding Mason through interdisciplinary research and providing a space to cultivate ideas. With the support of his committee, Mason was the recipient of the 2015-16 Russ and Anne Fuller Fellowship.
“The IIDP gave me the opportunity and confidence to pursue research without any preconceived constraints,” says Mason. “During my time in the program, I really valued the expertise of my committee members and looked to their suggestions about how I could apply discipline-specific knowledge to address overarching issues affecting behavioral health policy and treatment access.”
Last December, Mason began working for Premier, Inc., a hospital-owned quality improvement organization based in Charlotte, North Carolina. He works specifically for a division of the company called Premier Research Institute, which interfaces with foundations, university researchers and federal agencies to complete health outcomes research.

From Las Vegas to Cuba: Studying Life History Theory and Immune Behaviors
By Cheryl Reed
When Tiffany Alvarez studied women’s health through the lens of life history theory as an undergraduate student and McNair Scholar at UNLV, she didn’t know how far it would eventually take her. Now a doctoral student at Washington State University in evolutionary anthropology, she is planning to study in Cuba next summer with her advisor, Edward Hagen. The two will be investigating the effects of acute immune activation on components of pregnant women’s behavioral and biological immunity—or life history.
Life history theory seeks to explain aspects of an organism’s anatomy and behavior in reference to the way its life histories have been shaped by natural selection. The theory depends on principles of evolutionary biology and ecology and is widely used in other areas of science.
Alvarez explained how recent discoveries show that immunity appears to have behavioral components, often referred to as sickness behaviors, which serve to reduce exposure to pathogens and conserve energy. The features that characterize immunity are uniquely distinguished by their relationship with biological processes and also environmental contexts ranging from the socio-political to cultural and ecological. An ecological immunity perspective acknowledges that culturally mediated, class- and sex-specific patterns of activity, resource access, and reproduction are sources of significant diversity that affect immune response. She also explained that pregnancy is a reproductive state of unique immunity and a period of dynamic changes to immuno-competence.
In Cuba, Alvarez and Hagen will collect baseline levels of biological and behavior immunity from a sample of 100 pregnant women. After the data is collected, the researchers will randomize it into treatment groups that will receive different vaccines. It is predicted that the treatment group who receives the influenza vaccine will report markedly higher behavioral immunity than the groups who received the placebo.
Alvarez’s and Hagen’s research will determine if acute immune activation alters the behaviors of pregnant women in ways predicted by life history theory. Specifically, whether or not acute changes in pregnant women’s health status trigger a suite of compensatory behaviors that contribute to pathogen avoidance and mitigate energetic immune costs. These findings will contribute to larger theoretical and empirical discussions regarding context-specific variation in host-pathogen interactions and behavioral sickness symptom expression.
Alvarez is a first-generation college student from Last Vegas, Nevada. She is now on a streamline track to earn a master’s and doctoral degree in 5 years. As a McNair Alumna and teaching assistant, Alvarez has the opportunity to spread her research passion to other students.
“My work is so exciting,” says Alvarez. “My advisor is training me to be a peer, and I find that to be so valuable.”
Washington State University’s graduate degree in evolutionary anthropology has a strong record of research funding, and students are regularly involved in research and teaching from their first semester. Most students gain research experience at field and laboratory sites early in their careers.

Establishing Residency



November 25, 2014

Cheryl Reed 







Establishing Residency




Because tuition is considerably less expensive for Washington residents than out-of-state students, you should establish residency right away after you arrive in Washington State. Residency policies are set by the State of Washington (RCW 28B.15) and applied uniformly throughout Washington’s public colleges and universities. For questions or assistance, contact Jenny Saligumba-Graham, saligum@wsu.edu.
Some of the required documentation will need to be acquired a year in advance of your residency application! It’s important to begin the process NOW.

Deadline
The Questionnaire and supporting documentation must be received by the Graduate School by the 30th day of classes of the term for which you are seeking residency. If you are seeking residency for the fall term, for example, your deadline would be the 30th day of classes for the fall semester. You can find the deadline on the WSU Academic Calendar.  Ensure you are viewing the calendar for the correct term. For summer, the deadline is the Monday following the 5th day of classes.
You will need to submit the Residency Questionnaire and supporting documentation (see below) to the Graduate School. Documentation may be mailed or submitted in person. We do not accept faxed questionnaires or documentation.

Interdisciplinary Degrees




The Graduate School administers three interdisciplinary degree programs, offering students an opportunity to tailor a unique program based on individual interests. Working with top-ranked research faculty at WSU, graduate students cross traditional boundaries and discover new insights to solve the world’s problems.
Individual Interdisciplinary Doctoral
This doctoral program is individually designed to meet the professional interests and research endeavors of each student. Although the program maintains a high degree of flexibility, it is rigorous and requires the involvement of the graduate school and several academic units on campus. Students in this program work with an advisor and committee who oversees the development of each unique degree program
For detailed information, and who to contact, visit here.
Molecular Plant Sciences
Considered one of the top programs of its kind in the world, this program incorporates plant physiology, biochemistry and molecular biology. Faculty in this program include three National Academy of Science members and some of the most influential plant science researchers in the world. All students in this program receive some form of financial assistance, such as training grants, individual research grants, predoctoral fellowships, or teaching assistantships. First-year students visit several different labs during their first weeks to help make an informed decision about pursuing the specific science that interests them.
For detailed information and who to contact, visit here.
Materials Science and Engineering
This collaborative, vibrant program is the largest interdisciplinary doctoral program in materials science and engineering in the Northwest. The program enables students to access a wide range of research facilities from mechanical, materials, civil, chemical and bioengineering as well as physics and chemistry. Several faculty members have collaborations with the high-ranked Life Sciences Programs at WSU, and more than 50% are fellows and leaders of their professional societies. MSEP students take advantage of WSU’s strong ties to the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory by  participating in a special research internship program that allows them to complete a portion of their research as a resident at the Environmental Molecular Sciences Laboratory at PNNL.
