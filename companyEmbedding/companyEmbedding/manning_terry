Manning’s photography is now being presented in Exhibitions across the US, as well as many world locations.In the mid 1980s Manning moved to London, and worked for a year out of Abbey Road Studios.1991 saw him founding Lucas Engineering, a boutique audio company which makes professional audio recording gear; this company expanded in 2008, adding microphones to their arsenal of products. Lucas Microphones, under Manning’s guidance, have since become amongst the top high end recording devices in the audio world.In 1992, Chris Blackwell of Island Records fame sought out Manning as a partner to revitalize Blackwell's famous Compass Point Studios in Nassau, Bahamas, which Manning operated successfully for over 20 years.Manning’s newest releases as an artist are the ECR Music Group/Lucky Seven Records release of Manning’s newest (January 2015) album “Heaven Knows,” an emotional look into human emotion, and “West Texas Skyline,” A Tribute To Bobby Fuller, released in October 2013.For a longer, more complete bio, click here.

Manning, Terry 
Home Sweet Home
4 Men With Beards
























TERRY MANNING is best known as an engineer and producer who spent the ‘60s and ‘70s in Memphis working for Ardent and Stax Studios on some of that city’s most important records, from Isaac Hayes to Big Star. In 1970 he cut the album Home Sweet Home and it was released on the Stax subsidiary, Enterprise. Originally intended as a joke project, Home Sweet Home is now a highly regarded and collectible LP, praised for its innovative studio trickery and Manning’s offbeat arrangements, especially the epic opening 10-minute version of George Harrison’s “Savoy Truffle.”

Early years[edit]
Terry Manning was born in Oklahoma City, and started in music in El Paso, Texas.[2] In high school Manning showed a talent for sports, and he ran track and was all-city quarterback on the football team. He attended Memphis State University (now University of Memphis), where he served as captain of the soccer team and played junior varsity basketball.[3] Manning began working in the music industry while he lived in El Paso, where he played guitar and sang with several local bands, including sitting in with Bobby Fuller and leading The Wild Ones.
Music career[edit]
After moving to Memphis, Tennessee, Manning worked for years at both Stax Records and Ardent Studios as an engineer and producer, recording and mixing. He was a principal part of Stax owner Al Bell's production team for The Staple Singers, responsible for such hit records as "Heavy Makes You Happy," "Respect Yourself," and "I'll Take You There."[3]
In 1970, Manning licensed release of his own solo album, Home Sweet Home, on Stax's Enterprise label, re-released with extra tracks by Sunbeam in 2006.[4] In the mid 1980s Manning moved to London, and worked for a year at EMI's Abbey Road Studios. In 1992, he moved to Nassau, Bahamas, to partner with Chris Blackwell in Compass Point Studios, which he operated for over twenty years.
Manning's newest releases as a music artist are the ECR Music Group/Lucky Seven Records releases of his albums, "West Texas Skyline," A Tribute To Bobby Fuller, released in October 2013, and his newest, "Heaven Knows," released in 2015.[5]
Photography career[edit]
Manning was interested and involved in photography almost as long as music. A close friend starting in the late 1960s was William Eggleston, who served as a mentor, as well as introducing young Manning to other photographers such as William Christenberry and Lee Friedlander. Although Manning's favorite work is his "evocative urban landscapes,[6]" he has also photographed Chuck Berry, Procol Harum, Steppenwolf, Terry Reid, Jimi Hendrix, Dusty Springfield, Lenny Kravitz, and many other musical artists of the rock music genre, as both an independent and as a writer/photographer for New Musical Express. He worked as a photojournalist for NME and was one of the last to photograph his acquaintance, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., on the day before the assassination.[7]
In August 2015, Manning's photography work began showing at art galleries in several cities. Two photography books were released Scientific Evidence Of Life On Earth During Two Millennia, and Cuba Despues Del Tiempo Especial, Antes De Los Americanos, and a number of photography books and new exhibits were planned.[6]
Personal life[edit]
Manning regularly competes in marathons, including two entries in The New York Marathon. He achieved a ranking of 19th nationally in racquetball, and worked as a racquetball instructor for several years. He is an instrument-rated pilot, and has completed Bachelor of Arts degrees in Political Science and History.[3]
In 2017 Manning and his wife Janet moved to The Bahamas where he worked with Compass Point Studios. Manning has a stepson named Cory and three children named Lucas, Michael, and Kari.[3]

Early years[edit]
Terry Manning was born in Oklahoma City, and started in music in El Paso, Texas.[2] In high school Manning showed a talent for sports, and he ran track and was all-city quarterback on the football team. He attended Memphis State University (now University of Memphis), where he served as captain of the soccer team and played junior varsity basketball.[3] Manning began working in the music industry while he lived in El Paso, where he played guitar and sang with several local bands, including sitting in with Bobby Fuller and leading The Wild Ones.
Music career[edit]
After moving to Memphis, Tennessee, Manning worked for years at both Stax Records and Ardent Studios as an engineer and producer, recording and mixing. He was a principal part of Stax owner Al Bell's production team for The Staple Singers, responsible for such hit records as "Heavy Makes You Happy," "Respect Yourself," and "I'll Take You There."[3]
In 1970, Manning licensed release of his own solo album, Home Sweet Home, on Stax's Enterprise label, re-released with extra tracks by Sunbeam in 2006.[4] In the mid 1980s Manning moved to London, and worked for a year at EMI's Abbey Road Studios. In 1992, he moved to Nassau, Bahamas, to partner with Chris Blackwell in Compass Point Studios, which he operated for over twenty years.
Manning's newest releases as a music artist are the ECR Music Group/Lucky Seven Records releases of his albums, "West Texas Skyline," A Tribute To Bobby Fuller, released in October 2013, and his newest, "Heaven Knows," released in 2015.[5]
Photography career[edit]
Manning was interested and involved in photography almost as long as music. A close friend starting in the late 1960s was William Eggleston, who served as a mentor, as well as introducing young Manning to other photographers such as William Christenberry and Lee Friedlander. Although Manning's favorite work is his "evocative urban landscapes,[6]" he has also photographed Chuck Berry, Procol Harum, Steppenwolf, Terry Reid, Jimi Hendrix, Dusty Springfield, Lenny Kravitz, and many other musical artists of the rock music genre, as both an independent and as a writer/photographer for New Musical Express. He worked as a photojournalist for NME and was one of the last to photograph his acquaintance, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., on the day before the assassination.[7]
In August 2015, Manning's photography work began showing at art galleries in several cities. Two photography books were released Scientific Evidence Of Life On Earth During Two Millennia, and Cuba Despues Del Tiempo Especial, Antes De Los Americanos, and a number of photography books and new exhibits were planned.[6]
Personal life[edit]
Manning regularly competes in marathons, including two entries in The New York Marathon. He achieved a ranking of 19th nationally in racquetball, and worked as a racquetball instructor for several years. He is an instrument-rated pilot, and has completed Bachelor of Arts degrees in Political Science and History.[3]
In 2017 Manning and his wife Janet moved to The Bahamas where he worked with Compass Point Studios. Manning has a stepson named Cory and three children named Lucas, Michael, and Kari.[3]
