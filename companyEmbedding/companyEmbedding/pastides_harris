President Harris Pastides


Harris Pastides


During the past decade, the University of South Carolina’s 28th president, Harris Pastides, has led USC’s flagship system of eight institutions in
                        19 geographic locations to higher achievements and unprecedented growth. “In our ongoing
                        push for excellence,” he says, “our chancellors, deans, faculty and staff continue
                        to move Carolina toward world-class status and global recognition.”
                     
Under Pastides’ tenure the university has seen the USC Honors College rise to the
                        No. 1 public honors college in the nation; celebrated continual top rankings in undergraduate
                        and graduate international business, public health, engineering, nursing and others;
                        rapidly increased research funding and surpassed a $1 billion capital campaign goal.
                     
An unwavering advocate for a superior student experience, Pastides encourages engagement
                        beyond the classroom through leadership, service learning, international experiences,
                        internships and undergraduate research. During his tenure, innovative programs like
                        Palmetto College, On Your Time Graduation, Gamecock Gateway, Gamecock Guarantee and
                        the Gamecock Student Athletic Promise provide greater access, flexibility and affordability
                        to South Carolinians seeking a higher education degree. To date, more than 90,000
                        degrees have been awarded systemwide during Pastides’ presidency.
                     
In 2016, Pastides became one of seven Fulbright alumni to receive the inaugural Global
                        Changemaker Award — given in recognition of his ongoing commitment to transform society
                        and humanity through his work. The son of Greek immigrants, Pastides also received
                        the 2017 prestigious Ellis Island Medal of Honor which pays homage to the immigrant
                        experience and the contributions made to our nation by immigrants and their children.
                     
Today, Pastides serves on many local, state, national and international boards including
                        the U.S. Council on Competitiveness, the Fulbright Program and the South Carolina
                        Governor’s School for the Arts and Humanities. He is a past chair of the NCAA Division
                        I Board of Directors and currently serves as the vice president of the Southeastern
                        Conference.
                     
Prior to joining the university’s faculty as dean of the Arnold School of Public Health,
                        then advancing to vice president for Research and Health Sciences, Pastides was a
                        professor of epidemiology and and chairman of the Department of Biostatistics and
                        Epidemiology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He received two masters’
                        degrees and a Ph.D. in Epidemiology from Yale University. President Pastides and the
                        first lady, Patricia Moore-Pastides, live on USC’s historic Horseshoe.

Early life and education[edit]
Pastides was born in New York City to immigrants from Cyprus. He was the first person in his family to attend college when he enrolled in the University at Albany where he obtained his B.S. in Biology. He received his master's in public health and his Ph.D. in epidemiology from Yale University.[2] His study on the heath effects of chemicals used by the US semiconductor industry led to its eventual outsourcing overseas.[3]
President of the University of South Carolina[edit]
His election by the board of trustees marks the first internal candidate for the presidency of the university in more than a half century. Previously, Pastides served as vice president for research and health sciences and dean of the Arnold School of Public Health.[4] He and his wife, Patricia, first came to the university in 1998.
Under his leadership, Carolina's student population has grown to record levels among the system's eight universities on 12 campuses. Knowing that degree attainment significantly affects the quality of life in South Carolina, Pastides has spearheaded nontraditional programs such as Palmetto College, Back to Carolina, Gamecock Gateway and Gamecock Guarantee to increase university access and affordability. In addition, he leads an unprecedented capital campaign to fund essential needs for knowledge, research, discovery and development.

Dr. Harris Pastides 
President, University of South Carolina

Harris Pastides was named the University of South Carolina's 28th president on Aug. 1, 2008, following a decade of service as a professor, dean, and vice president. 

Dr. Harris Pastides was the first internal candidate to be elected president of the University of South Carolina in more than half a century.
Under Pastides' leadership as vice president for research and health sciences, research funding and sponsored programs at South Carolina have increased 89 percent since 2002, reaching a record $206 million for fiscal year 2008. Pastides continues to take a leading role in the development of Innovista, the research innovation district he helped design and launch during his tenure.
With Focus Carolina, one of his first major initiatives as University president, Pastides has launched the most comprehensive strategic planning initiative in the University's history. The effort is expected to result in transformational goals that will steer a course for the University's long-term future.Among the major goals Pastides has identified are:
sustainabilityinnovationthe University's role in the development of a knowledge economymore access to education for South Caroliniansstronger cohesion among the University's eight campuses
To accomplish these goals, he has solicited ideas from the University community and all South Carolina citizens through Carolina's Ideas, a Web-based suggestion box that is yielding a bounty of good counsel.Before joining the South Carolina faculty, Pastides was a professor of epidemiology and chairman of the Department of Biostatistics and Epidemiology at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. He received his master's of public health and his Ph.D. in epidemiology from Yale University.
Harris Pastides and Patricia Moore were married April 27, 1980. They have two children: Katharine, an education specialist at the Getty Villa in Malibu, Calif.; and Andrew, an equity stage actor in New York City.

Early life and education[edit]
Pastides was born in New York City to immigrants from Cyprus. He was the first person in his family to attend college when he enrolled in the University at Albany where he obtained his B.S. in Biology. He received his master's in public health and his Ph.D. in epidemiology from Yale University.[2] His study on the heath effects of chemicals used by the US semiconductor industry led to its eventual outsourcing overseas.[3]
President of the University of South Carolina[edit]
His election by the board of trustees marks the first internal candidate for the presidency of the university in more than a half century. Previously, Pastides served as vice president for research and health sciences and dean of the Arnold School of Public Health.[4] He and his wife, Patricia, first came to the university in 1998.
Under his leadership, Carolina's student population has grown to record levels among the system's eight universities on 12 campuses. Knowing that degree attainment significantly affects the quality of life in South Carolina, Pastides has spearheaded nontraditional programs such as Palmetto College, Back to Carolina, Gamecock Gateway and Gamecock Guarantee to increase university access and affordability. In addition, he leads an unprecedented capital campaign to fund essential needs for knowledge, research, discovery and development.

Early life and education[edit]
Pastides was born in New York City to immigrants from Cyprus. He was the first person in his family to attend college when he enrolled in the University at Albany where he obtained his B.S. in Biology. He received his master's in public health and his Ph.D. in epidemiology from Yale University.[2] His study on the heath effects of chemicals used by the US semiconductor industry led to its eventual outsourcing overseas.[3]
President of the University of South Carolina[edit]
His election by the board of trustees marks the first internal candidate for the presidency of the university in more than a half century. Previously, Pastides served as vice president for research and health sciences and dean of the Arnold School of Public Health.[4] He and his wife, Patricia, first came to the university in 1998.
Under his leadership, Carolina's student population has grown to record levels among the system's eight universities on 12 campuses. Knowing that degree attainment significantly affects the quality of life in South Carolina, Pastides has spearheaded nontraditional programs such as Palmetto College, Back to Carolina, Gamecock Gateway and Gamecock Guarantee to increase university access and affordability. In addition, he leads an unprecedented capital campaign to fund essential needs for knowledge, research, discovery and development.

President Harris Pastides


Harris Pastides


During the past decade, the University of South Carolina’s 28th president, Harris Pastides, has led USC’s flagship system of eight institutions in
                        19 geographic locations to higher achievements and unprecedented growth. “In our ongoing
                        push for excellence,” he says, “our chancellors, deans, faculty and staff continue
                        to move Carolina toward world-class status and global recognition.”
                     
Under Pastides’ tenure the university has seen the USC Honors College rise to the
                        No. 1 public honors college in the nation; celebrated continual top rankings in undergraduate
                        and graduate international business, public health, engineering, nursing and others;
                        rapidly increased research funding and surpassed a $1 billion capital campaign goal.
                     
An unwavering advocate for a superior student experience, Pastides encourages engagement
                        beyond the classroom through leadership, service learning, international experiences,
                        internships and undergraduate research. During his tenure, innovative programs like
                        Palmetto College, On Your Time Graduation, Gamecock Gateway, Gamecock Guarantee and
                        the Gamecock Student Athletic Promise provide greater access, flexibility and affordability
                        to South Carolinians seeking a higher education degree. To date, more than 90,000
                        degrees have been awarded systemwide during Pastides’ presidency.
                     
In 2016, Pastides became one of seven Fulbright alumni to receive the inaugural Global
                        Changemaker Award — given in recognition of his ongoing commitment to transform society
                        and humanity through his work. The son of Greek immigrants, Pastides also received
                        the 2017 prestigious Ellis Island Medal of Honor which pays homage to the immigrant
                        experience and the contributions made to our nation by immigrants and their children.
                     
Today, Pastides serves on many local, state, national and international boards including
                        the U.S. Council on Competitiveness, the Fulbright Program and the South Carolina
                        Governor’s School for the Arts and Humanities. He is a past chair of the NCAA Division
                        I Board of Directors and currently serves as the vice president of the Southeastern
                        Conference.
                     
Prior to joining the university’s faculty as dean of the Arnold School of Public Health,
                        then advancing to vice president for Research and Health Sciences, Pastides was a
                        professor of epidemiology and and chairman of the Department of Biostatistics and
                        Epidemiology at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. He received two masters’
                        degrees and a Ph.D. in Epidemiology from Yale University. President Pastides and the
                        first lady, Patricia Moore-Pastides, live on USC’s historic Horseshoe.

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
