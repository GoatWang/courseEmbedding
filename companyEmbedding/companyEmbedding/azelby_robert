SEATTLE--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Juno Therapeutics (Nasdaq: JUNO), a biopharmaceutical company focused on 
      re-engaging the body's immune system to revolutionize the treatment of 
      cancer, announced the appointment of Robert Azelby as Executive Vice 
      President, Chief Commercial Officer, effective immediately. Prior to 
      joining Juno, Mr. Azelby was at Amgen, where he was Vice President and 
      General Manager of Amgen’s Oncology Business Unit.
    


      “Bob is a tremendous leader who will build a world-class commercial team 
      at Juno,” said Hans Bishop, Juno’s Chief Executive Officer and 
      President. “His experience in growing an impressive oncology business, 
      including planning commercial strategy and overseeing multiple launches, 
      will play a critical role in Juno’s next phase of growth.”
    

      At Amgen, Mr. Azelby was responsible for the Oncology Business Unit, 
      representing over $6 billion in annual revenue with over 600 sales and 
      marketing personnel. Since taking over leadership in May 2012, Bob grew 
      the business to be the second largest oncology division in the U.S.
    

      “I am excited to join Juno at a time when we have the opportunity to 
      shape commercial strategies for a new and innovative class of product 
      candidates that have the potential to benefit patients suffering with 
      cancer. I look forward to building and leading a top-tier organization 
      that will help bring these exciting medicines to patients,” said Mr. 
      Azelby.
    

      During his 15 year tenure at Amgen, Mr. Azelby was also the Vice 
      President of Amgen’s U.S. Oncology Sales team, which is one of the 
      largest oncology sales teams in the U.S. In addition, Bob has been the 
      Vice President of Amgen’s North American Commercial Effectiveness Unit, 
      responsible for sales and marketing functions, including market 
      research, forecasting, sales training, and sales operations. Bob 
      garnered international experience as Amgen’s General Manager, 
      Netherlands, responsible for all aspects of its commercial operations in 
      that country. Before then, Bob held numerous sales and marketing 
      positions, each with increasing responsibilities. Roles included project 
      management, business development, regional sales management, and 
      national marketing director. Mr. Azelby will report to Mr. Bishop.
    

      Mr. Azelby received his undergraduate degrees in Economics and Religious 
      Studies from the University of Virginia and his Master of Business 
      Administration from Harvard University.
    

About Juno Therapeutics, Inc.


      Juno Therapeutics is building a fully integrated biopharmaceutical 
      company focused on revolutionizing medicine by re-engaging the body's 
      immune system to treat cancer. Founded on the vision that the use of 
      human cells as therapeutic entities will drive one of the next important 
      phases in medicine, Juno is developing cell-based cancer immunotherapies 
      based on chimeric antigen receptor and high-affinity T cell receptor 
      technologies to genetically engineer T cells to recognize and kill 
      cancer. Juno is developing multiple cell-based product candidates to 
      treat a variety of B-cell malignancies as well as solid tumors. Several 
      product candidates have shown compelling evidence of tumor shrinkage in 
      the clinical trials in refractory leukemia and lymphoma conducted to 
      date. Juno's long-term aim is to improve and leverage its cell-based 
      platform to develop new product candidates that address a broader range 
      of cancers and human diseases. Juno brings together innovative 
      technologies from some of the world's leading research institutions, 
      including the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Memorial Sloan 
      Kettering Cancer Center, Seattle Children's Research Institute, and The 
      National Cancer Institute. Juno Therapeutics has an exclusive license to 
      the St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital patented technology for CD19 
      directed product candidates that use 4-1BB, which was developed by Dario 
      Campana, Chihaya Imai, and St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital.

About the Book 



A simple, engaging, and eminently practical guide to overcoming your weaknesses—your "Buts"—to achieve the career and personal relationships you want Imagine a workplace where all the employees are aware of the things they do—or fail to do—that prevent them from being more productive and valuable. Imagine a company where everyone speaks openly and honestly about his or her weaknesses and is committed to strengthening and overcoming them. Imagine an environment where colleagues help one another become more efficient and less disruptive by speaking the truth about what detracts from the team's efforts and objectives. Imagine a place where the firm's most talented employees know exactly what they need to do to attain a leadership position. This is no fantasy workplace: it can be your business if you listen to Joe Azelby and Bob Azelby, brothers and successful executives in their own right.Kiss Your BUT Good-Bye will help all professionals find their individual BUT—whether it's a lack of skills, a distracting behavior, or a personality quirk that interferes with achieving success. Using road-tested techniques, Kiss Your BUT Good-Bye helps you examine your BUT, understand it, manage it, cover it, and most important, shrink it. It also enables managers to help their employees discover personal weaknesses and to learn how to deliver the direct, honest feedback every worker needs and deserves.Finding your BUT can be tough medicine, but the Azelbys deliver it with a tasty spoonful of sugar. Get ready for success . . . get ready to Kiss Your BUT Good-Bye.
