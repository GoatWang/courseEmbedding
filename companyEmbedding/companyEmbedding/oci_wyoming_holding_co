OCI Enterprises Inc. Signs Definitive Agreement to Sell General 
      Partner and Limited Partner Interests in OCI Resources LP to Park 
      Holding A.S. of Ciner Group






July 20, 2015 09:00 AM Eastern Daylight Time



ATLANTA--(BUSINESS WIRE)--OCI Enterprises Inc., the North American subsidiary of OCI Company Ltd. 
      (“OCI”) of Seoul, Korea, has signed a definitive agreement to sell its 
      approximately 73% limited partner interest in OCI Resources LP (NYSE: 
      OCIR) (“OCI Resources” or the “Partnership”), as well as its 2% general 
      partner interest and related incentive distribution rights, to Park 
      Holding A.S., a subsidiary of Ciner Group of Istanbul, Turkey.
    


      Following the transaction, OCI Resources will continue to operate as a 
      publicly traded Master Limited Partnership with the current management 
      team remaining with the Partnership. The transaction does not involve 
      the sale or purchase of any OCI Resources common units held by the 
      public.
    

      The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and 
      regulatory approvals and is expected to close by the end of the third 
      quarter 2015.
    

      OCI Resources owns a controlling interest comprised of a 51% membership 
      interest in OCI Wyoming LLC (“OCI Wyoming”), one of the largest and 
      lowest-cost producers of natural soda ash in the world. Ciner Group, 
      through its subsidiary, Eti Soda, operates a natural soda ash production 
      facility in the world's second largest trona ore bed located in 
      Beypazarri, Turkey.
    

      “We are really excited about our new strategic relationship with Ciner 
      Group and their desire to help us expedite the growth of our MLP. We 
      think there will be numerous opportunities to leverage their expertise 
      to help us grow our cash flow,” said OCI Resources President and CEO 
      Kirk Milling.
    

      “Ciner Group is pleased to welcome OCI Resources to our family of 
      companies. With its position in markets that are complementary to ours, 
      OCI Resources brings solid operational and financial performance as well 
      as industry-leading safety performance,” said Turgay Ciner, Chairman, 
      Ciner Group.
    

      In June 2015, OCI Enterprises Inc. announced it was evaluating strategic 
      alternatives for its stake in OCI Resources.
    

      Citi acted as financial advisor, Dechert LLP served as legal advisor to 
      OCI Enterprises Inc. and White & Case LLP served as legal advisor to 
      Ciner Group with the assistance of Regnum Solicitors acting as in-house 
      legal advisor.
