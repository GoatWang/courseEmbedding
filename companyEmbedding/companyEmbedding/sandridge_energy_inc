History[edit]
SandRidge was founded in 2006 by Tom L. Ward by buying approximately 50% of Riata Energy of Amarillo, Texas. Ward previously co-founded Chesapeake Energy with Aubrey McClendon and was the chief operating officer of that company from 1989 until 1996.[2]
The company went public via an initial public offering on November 5, 2007, selling over 28 million common shares.[3]
On June 19, 2013, after a series of missteps, CEO Tom L. Ward was ousted by the board of the directors and James Bennett became President and CEO.[4] Bennett first joined the company in 2010 and previously worked at GSO Capital Partners.[5]
In 2014, the company sold its assets in the Gulf of Mexico for $750 million.[6]
In 2015, the company acquired Pinon Gathering Company, owner of 370 miles of gathering lines, which reduced Sandridge's lease operating and gathering expense.[7] It also acquired 136,000 net acres in the Niobara shale formation for $190 million in cash.[8] By then, the local fracking boom had largely played out and the economies of Harper, Sumner and adjacent southern Kansas and northern Oklahoma counties suffered under the impact.[9] Earthquakes, due to induced seismicity produced by injected wastes, had also substantially reduced in frequency and intensity, thanks to a Kansas Corporation Commission order mandating cutbacks in injection well volumes and pressures. SandRidge, which along with Chesapeake Energy was one of the two major producers in Southcentral Kansas, appealed the order, but soon went into bankruptcy.[10][11]
In 2016, the company went through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.[12]
Operations[edit]
In the third quarter of 2016, the company produced 49.6 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (303,000 GJ) per day.[1]
SandRidge owns oil properties in the Mid-Continent, which accounts for 93% of production. It also owns properties in the Permian Basin, West Texas and in the Niobrara Formation of Colorado.[1]
The company has formed 3 public royalty trusts:

Sandridge Permian Trust (NYSE: PER) - owner of royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties in the Central Basin Platform of the Permian Basin in Andrews County, Texas.
SandRidge Mississippian Trust I (NYSE: SDT) - owner of royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties in the Mississippian formation in Alfalfa, Garfield, Grant and Woods counties in Oklahoma.
SandRidge Mississippian Trust II (NYSE: SDR) - owner of royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties in the Mississippian formation in Alfalfa, Grant, Kay, Noble and Woods counties in northern Oklahoma and Barber, Comanche, Harper and Sumner counties in southern Kansas.

History[edit]
SandRidge was founded in 2006 by Tom L. Ward by buying approximately 50% of Riata Energy of Amarillo, Texas. Ward previously co-founded Chesapeake Energy with Aubrey McClendon and was the chief operating officer of that company from 1989 until 1996.[2]
The company went public via an initial public offering on November 5, 2007, selling over 28 million common shares.[3]
On June 19, 2013, after a series of missteps, CEO Tom L. Ward was ousted by the board of the directors and James Bennett became President and CEO.[4] Bennett first joined the company in 2010 and previously worked at GSO Capital Partners.[5]
In 2014, the company sold its assets in the Gulf of Mexico for $750 million.[6]
In 2015, the company acquired Pinon Gathering Company, owner of 370 miles of gathering lines, which reduced Sandridge's lease operating and gathering expense.[7] It also acquired 136,000 net acres in the Niobara shale formation for $190 million in cash.[8] By then, the local fracking boom had largely played out and the economies of Harper, Sumner and adjacent southern Kansas and northern Oklahoma counties suffered under the impact.[9] Earthquakes, due to induced seismicity produced by injected wastes, had also substantially reduced in frequency and intensity, thanks to a Kansas Corporation Commission order mandating cutbacks in injection well volumes and pressures. SandRidge, which along with Chesapeake Energy was one of the two major producers in Southcentral Kansas, appealed the order, but soon went into bankruptcy.[10][11]
In 2016, the company went through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.[12]
Operations[edit]
In the third quarter of 2016, the company produced 49.6 thousand barrels of oil equivalent (303,000 GJ) per day.[1]
SandRidge owns oil properties in the Mid-Continent, which accounts for 93% of production. It also owns properties in the Permian Basin, West Texas and in the Niobrara Formation of Colorado.[1]
The company has formed 3 public royalty trusts:

Sandridge Permian Trust (NYSE: PER) - owner of royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties in the Central Basin Platform of the Permian Basin in Andrews County, Texas.
SandRidge Mississippian Trust I (NYSE: SDT) - owner of royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties in the Mississippian formation in Alfalfa, Garfield, Grant and Woods counties in Oklahoma.
SandRidge Mississippian Trust II (NYSE: SDR) - owner of royalty interests in oil and natural gas properties in the Mississippian formation in Alfalfa, Grant, Kay, Noble and Woods counties in northern Oklahoma and Barber, Comanche, Harper and Sumner counties in southern Kansas.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

SandRidge Energy Inc:A class of oil and gas royalty owners has filed a civil antitrust lawsuit against Chesapeake Energy Corporation, SandRidge Energy Corp. and former SandRidge CEO Tom Ward - AP.The 14-page lawsuit, filed by attorneys with the Dallas-based law firm Burns Charest LLP, alleges that the defendants violated federal antitrust laws by rigging bids and limiting competition for oil and gas leases in northwest Oklahoma.The lawsuit states that the class could ultimately include thousands of affected royalty owners in the geological formation known as the Anadarko Basin Region."This case is about cleaning up the oil patch," says Burns Charest founder and co-managing partner Warren Burns, who represents the proposed class."In a rush to reap illegal profits, the defendants violated the trust and confidence of these royalty owners.Their actions demonstrate that they were willing to betray my clients and violate the law.
