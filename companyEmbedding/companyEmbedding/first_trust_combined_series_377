DESCRIPTION: The Sabrient Dividend UIT Series seeks above-average total returns through a combination of capital appreciation and dividend income. The stocks are selected by applying a seven-step investment strategy process developed by Sabrient. Among other criteria, stocks must have above-average dividend yield, a minimum of six consecutive dividends that were the same or better than the previous quarter, strong earnings growth potential, along with a market cap of $500 million or more and sufficient liquidity.
In addition, the Sabrient/Gradient Earnings Quality Rank (EQR Rank), a proprietary forensic accounting factor, is incorporated into the strategy to determine the relative safety of the dividends over the next two years.
 
 

 







UIT Process

Sabrient's stock selection process for  UITs combines the research methodology of both Sabrient and Gradient Analytics.
For each UIT series, a quantitative, series-specific strategy is developed by the Sabrient research team, led by Chief Market Strategist David Brown.
A critical element of all strategies is the Sabrient/Gradient Earnings Quality Rank (EQR Rank), a proprietary forensic accounting factor that measures the aggressiveness of a company's accounting practices.
Companies in the bottom quintile of the EQR rankings are eliminated from consideration. This helps us avoid the risk of companies that could be overstating reported growth.
For each portfolio in the series, a list of strong candidates is compiled based on the relevant quant strategy. Then the Sabrient team, led David Brown, qualitatively reviews the list of stocks to select the final candidates.
The final step in the process is a review by the Gradient Analytics team, led by Director of Research  Nicholas Yee, CPA.  This team further screens out any candidates that might not have been eliminated by the EQR rankings but that nevertheless demonstrate unique risks related to earnings quality, corporate governance, or insider trading.
