Vanguard money market funds


100% of our low-cost money market funds performed better than their peer-group averages over the past 10 years.*




Preserve your cash until you decide how to use it
Protect your cash from market risk

Park your money temporarily



Keep your cash in a money market fund for short-term needs or until you decide how to invest it.

Get easy access to your cash



Transfer money between your bank and your Vanguard accounts whenever you need to.

Settle brokerage trades



Your money market settlement fund is used to pay for and receive proceeds from brokerage transactions, including Vanguard ETFs®, in your Vanguard Brokerage Account. Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund is the only settlement fund available.

Frequently Asked Questions

What interest rates do my local banks and credit unions pay on savings?

The national average annual percentage yield for savings accounts is currently 0.06% as published in the FDIC Weekly National Rates and Rate Caps. Generally, most local credit unions and banks pay less than 0.10%. Many of them pay only 0.01%. Wouldn't you rather earn 16 times more interest than the average by taking 10 minutes to open up a new high yield savings account?

What exactly is an online bank?

Online banks are exactly the same as your local banks and credit unions, however they don't have tens, hundreds, or even thousands of locations around the country. This means they don't need to spend the money to keep up buildings, landscapes, parking lots, lots of employees and equipment, etc. This allows online banks to pay a much higher interest rate to their depositors. Online banks are just as safe and secure as your local banks and credit unions. You access all your account information- including making transfers and deposits- through your computer and/or smart phone. Many of the banks also have an app that allows you to take a photo of a check and deposit it into your checking or savings account.

Are Online Banks Convenient?

Yes! You can access all your account information easily through a safe and secure website and/or phone app (depending on the bank). Just connect your current bank with your new high yield online account and start earning 12 times more interest than the national average today! Many online savings accounts also allow you to use certain ATM's at no charge or reimburse you for a certain number of ATM withdrawals per month.

How do I deposit funds into an online bank?

It depends on the bank but most offer the ability to make deposits in the following ways:

Online Transfer (ACH) - You first need to link your current checking/savings account to your online bank account.
Mobile Deposit - Use the bank's app to take a photo of your check and submit it securely.
Wire Transfer
Check by Mail

Are these online banks safe? What does FDIC or NCUA mean?

All the banks or credit unions we advertise are FDIC or NCUA insured- meaning your money is backed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation of the United States Government up to $250,000 per depositor per bank for each ownership category. The FDIC sells insurance policies to banks which then insures the savings accounts, checking accounts, certain retirement accounts, trust accounts, and several other types of accounts against bank failure. The FDIC does not cover investment accounts such as mutual funds, life insurance, stocks, bonds, and annuities.


NCUA stands for the National Credit union Administration and it is an independent federal agency backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The NCUA insures savings accounts, checking accounts, certificates of deposit and money market accounts up to $250,000 (the same as the FDIC).

Do I have to close my current bank account?

No! It is actually very convenient to have a local bank you can go into to get cash, deposit checks, get cashiers checks etc. However, most local banks provide VERY LOW interest rates (0.01%- 0.08%). There's no reason for you to leave your savings sitting in account that makes almost zero interest. You can easily connect your existing local bank account with an online high yield savings or cd account and transfer your savings in just a few minutes and watch the interest $$ accumulate each month.

Is 1.05% APY really worth opening up a new savings account?

Yes! If you deposit $10,000 into your new high interest savings account you can make $10 each month without doing anything! It only took you 15 minutes to set up the account and transfer the money and then you enjoy $126 of new money each year (assuming daily compounding). You will still need to pay taxes on the interest at your current tax bracket. That money is credited into your account each month and then you start earning interest on your interest. In just a few years you've saved enough money to buy a brand new tablet! Pretty awesome for taking only 15 minutes of your time!

How quickly can my savings multiply at 1.00%?

If you put $10,000 into your high interest savings account and add $100 each month (you can even set up an automatic transfer each month to make it easy) - the first year you will have a balance increase of $1,307, by the second you've saved $2,625, and by the end of the third year you will have added a total $3,961 to your initial $10,000. Your monthly contributions add up to $3,600 and your earn $360.60 in interest (assuming daily compounding).

Traditional IRAs 























Top Savings & Money Market Rates 2016
 


Traditional IRAs
Purpose
In this article we would like to give insight into a small section of retirement planning. We will introduce what a traditional IRA is, along with how to get an IRA. There is also a section showing how retirement planning can be beneficial to an individual. Examples of deductions and possible outcome from contributing are also provided.
What is an IRA
There are different types of IRAs (Individual Retirement Account), rather than discussing them all we will focus on the Traditional IRA. A Traditional IRA is a tax shelter created by the government to help citizens plan and pay for retirement. The reason it is called an Individual Retirement Account is because the account is individually held, and one person is limited to one Traditional IRA. The money placed in a Traditional IRA is not taxable until withdrawal, which can only be made after the age of 59 ½. During the time the money is in the IRA, it can be invested in certificates of deposit, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, money market accounts, U.S. gold and silver coins, and real estate. The government also provides incentives for establishing an IRA by allowing for the contribution amount to be tax deductible. Not all contributions are tax deductible there are stipulations that regulate the deductibility. Below is information showing the qualifications for tax deductibility, which is determined by income bracket and if a company retirement plan (401k) is held by an individual. The information below is provided by www.etrade.com.
· If you or your spouse do not participate in a company retirement plan: 100% deductible
· If you participate in a retirement plan at work:





Tax Filing Status


Adjusted Gross Income 


You Can Deduct






Single


Up to $34,000


100% of your contribution




 


$34,000 – $44,000


Less than $3,000




Over $44,000


No deduction allowed




Married, filling jointly 


Up to $54,000


100% of your contribution




 


$54,000 – $64,000


Less than $3,000




Over $65,000


No deduction allowed





 
 
· If only your spouse participates in a retirement plan at work:




Adjusted Gross Income 


You Can Deduct




Up to $150,000


100% of your contribution




$150,000 – $160,000


Less than $3,000




Over $160,000


No deduction allowed




 
There are limits placed on the amount that a person or couple can contribute to an IRA. The current contribution limit is $3000 annually. To compensate for inflation, the government has scheduled increases in the contribution amount. The expected increases are presented below:




Tax Year


Regular Contribution Limit




2002


$ 3,000




2003


$ 3,000




2004


$ 3,000




2005


$ 4,000




2006


$ 4,000




2007


$ 4,000




2008


$ 5,000




2009


$ 5,000




Beginning 2009, contributions will increase in $ 500 increments. (information by www.investopedia.com)




 
Benefits of a Traditional IRA
Retirement is something that should be done while young because once you start getting older retirement is getting closer. Saving money over a longer period of time allows individuals the pleasure of using more of their income at retirement. There are many benefits that come from the Traditional IRA which include (provided by the website www.wachovia.com):

Contributions may be tax deductible (consult with a financial advisor).
Every one under the age of 70 ½ with earned income is eligible.
There is no income limit.
Taxes are paid when earnings are withdrawn at retirement.
By deferring tax a higher compounded growth may occur.
Variety of investment choices including: stocks, bonds, mutual funds along with protected certificate of deposits and money market accounts.
Withdraws start at age 59 ½.

A Traditional IRA should be considered if a higher income and tax rate is being paid, and a lower tax rate is expected at the time of retirement. Because many students are graduating and will be earning a higher income and will be taxed at a higher rate, a traditional IRA could be the answer. Also, the Traditional IRA allows for tax deferred growth along with a possible tax deduction. With a Traditional IRA taxes are paid at the time of retirement when a lower tax rate may be present, which will possibly lower the amount paid in taxes. The Traditional IRA may not be beneficial to everyone; an analysis by a qualified professional should be done in order to determine the best possible plan in regards to all personal finance issues as pointed out by the website www.finance.cch.com.
The description provided by www.finance.cch.com shows a possible outcome of a Traditional IRA. Starting at the age of 24 if a contribution of $3,000 is made annually, at an expected rate of return of 9%, until the age of retirement at 65 the Traditional IRA could be worth $1,207,584 before income taxes. The results are explained in more detail in the financial calculator results below:









Results Summary

Your IRA balance at retirement could be worth $1,207,584 before income taxes. With a retirement income tax rate of 15.00% this amount is $1,026,717 after taxes. An ordinary taxable account, after taxes, would be worth $488,968 at retirement. Total contributions by retirement will be $123,000. 





How to open a Traditional IRA
When opening an IRA you will need to choose where you would like to open an IRA. Any commercial bank or credit union will be able to open an IRA, but at a credit union you must be a member of their establishment. A new account representative will direct you through the account opening process. Before opening the IRA some initial questions should be asked:

Which tax year will the contribution be going towards?
Will the contribution be made in one lump sum or over the course of the year?

These questions are important to ask yourself before going into open the IRA. Knowing which tax year the contribution will be applied toward is very important because the contribution can be applied to last years taxes until April 15th of the next year. By knowing if the contribution will be made in one lump sum or in smaller payments over the course of the year this will determine what type of account designation can be used.
There is certain information that is needed in order for an IRA to be opened. The information that is needed is found on the banks application. The application that we will follow is from Zions Bank; please refer to the application if there are any questions on where a section is located. Here are some step by step instructions on how to fill out an application in order to get an IRA:
1. Fill out customer information as needed (name, social security number, demographics, etc.).
2. Mark the appropriate box of where the source of the IRA funds will be coming from.
3. Write the name of the beneficiary (ies). Including their address, relationship, social security number, date of birth, and the percentage of the IRA that they will receive in the event that something were to happen to you. (The percentages for all beneficiaries should equal to 100 percent.)
4. Write the name of the contingent beneficiary (ies). The contingent beneficiary is the beneficiary to the beneficiary.
5. Read the fine print under the section of the beneficiary designation.
6. If the money is going to be invested by a brokerage firm, write in the name of the brokerage company along with the address and telephone number.
7. Read the print in the agreement to participate section noting that it states that the information that has been given is true and accurate to your knowledge.
8. Verify the information making sure all areas are complete and accurate.
9. Sign the signature line that states “signature of participant”.
10. Ask any questions to the new account representative.
After the application is completed and the agreement to participate has been signed the account representative will give you a copy of everything you have signed. Along with information that states the account terms and the guidelines for the IRA.
Conclusion
An Individual Retirement Account is essential to all of us. Planning for our future is very important, especially when we want to be financially secure. Knowing that in your future you have money saved can eliminate the worries of how you will live at the time of retirement. Living off of social security is not the answer. Retirement is a very important time for all individuals and making sure that your retirement is secure is one of the best things that you can do, and the Traditional IRA can help to accomplish this security.
Retirement planning is essential to everyones future, and one of the best ways to put away money for your future is with an IRA. The Traditional IRA has many benefits that include: tax deductibility, tax-deferred growth, and no income limits. Saving for retirement is made easier with the Traditional IRA because taxes are paid at retirement and when a lower tax bracket could be present. Being able to put money into a Traditional IRA can help many individuals get a tax break, something most everyone would like. The Traditional IRA has many benefits that can help many individuals, but stipulations are present and not everyone is helped by a Traditional IRA. So for those without an Individual Retirement Account we recommend that you visit your bank of choice and start saving for your retirement today, and don’t forget the earlier you start the better prepared you will be for your future.

About Us 























Top Savings & Money Market Rates 2016
 


About Us
RateCatcher was built in March of 2004. The RateCatcher Team is a group of individuals who have a passion for banking, the stock market and investing. The inspiration for RateCatcher came after seeing the stress finances cause most people. Personally I have lost thousands of my own money testing strategies on futures and options. As we’ve seen with the latest economic downturn, the stock market shows no mercy to even well balanced portfolios and retirement accounts. The average 401k lost 27% in 2008. According Leuthold Group it takes an average of 2 1/2 years to regain what’s lost after an average bear market. 
What about a severe bear market? It took seven years to regain what was lost after the 1973-74 bear market. After the 86 percent drop in the market during the Great Depression, it took a whopping 20 years for the stock market to recover completely.
Are you willing to take the risk of having all your nest eggs in a typical 401k? You might end up like the millions of elderly seniors who now cannot afford to retire and who have no more time to save. Riskless investments such as CDs, rewards checking, money market accounts and savings accounts will help you sleep better at night and guarantee you will have some retirement money unless the U.S. Goverment goes belly up in which case everyone will be in trouble.

Money market reform: What you need to know
We've changed our money market fund lineup to comply with Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rules. We don't expect a significant impact on our management of these funds.
Highlighting money market reform










David Glocke and Justin Schwartz of Vanguard Fixed Income Group explain recent changes in the regulations governing money market funds.
Read the transcript



What's money market reform?








Money market reform is a set of SEC rule amendments meant to address any potential financial instability that could be caused by money market funds. The amendments took effect on October 14, 2016.Here are the key elements:

				Establishes 3 categories of money market funds—retail, government, and institutional.

				Restricts who can invest in retail money market funds.

				Continues to seek a stable $1 net asset value (NAV) for retail and government funds, but requires institutional funds to have floating NAVs like other mutual funds.

				Allows certain funds to impose liquidity fees and temporarily suspend withdrawals (known as gates) in certain circumstances.


What's behind the SEC rules

Money market reform and you








Retail (individual) investors can invest in the full range of our taxable and tax-exempt money market funds.

				Our Prime Money Market Fund* and 5 tax-exempt funds* (1 national and 4 state municipal money market funds) are retail funds that seek to maintain a stable $1 NAV.

				Our Federal Money Market Fund**—which also seeks to maintain a stable $1 NAV—is now the only fund that can be used to settle brokerage trades. The fund isn't subject to the liquidity fee or redemption gate requirements.


What does money market reform mean to me?

 

Will the rules affect your investment decisions?








Money market funds may play an important role in your investment plan, providing high-quality,† liquid investments. This role remains unchanged.

Layer opened.Liquidity fee







A fee (up to 2%) that may be charged by a money market fund when you sell fund shares. The fee is imposed at the discretion of the fund's board if weekly liquid assets drop below 30%. The fee is intended to help the stability of the fund during times of extreme market duress.

Layer opened.Gates







A money market fund's ability to temporarily suspend withdrawals during periods of financial instability for up to 10 business days in a 90-day period if weekly liquid assets drop below 30%.

Layer opened.Net asset value







The price of a fund share. It's calculated by dividing the total assets, minus liabilities, allocated to a specific share class by the number of shares outstanding for that class.

Layer opened.What's behind the SEC rules







The move for money market fund reform grew out of the 2007–2008 financial crisis.The Reserve Primary Fund, which invested in Lehman Brothers debt, "broke the buck," meaning its net asset value (NAV) dropped below $1 per share.This event prompted significant redemptions by institutional money market fund investors, putting the funds under severe stress.Although retail (individual) activity was less volatile, with purchases and redemptions largely offsetting each other, the SEC felt it had to address concerns that money market funds may contribute to financial instability.The final amendments to money market rules that were made in 2014 aim to protect shareholders from the impacts that a flood of redemptions could have on money market funds. The amendments are also intended to give fund managers time to respond to requests in a more thoughtful, prudent manner.

Layer opened.Understanding liquidity fees & gates







Liquidity fees and gates are tools to help money market fund managers keep the funds stable during times of extreme market duress. Under the rules:

				A fund may impose a fee of up to 2% on redemptions if a fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 30% of its total assets.



				A fund must impose a 1% fee on redemptions (with the option of imposing a fee of up to 2%) if a fund's weekly liquid assets fall below 10% of its total assets—unless the fund's board determines a fee would not be in the fund's best interest.



				A fund may impose a gate—that is, suspend redemptions—for up to 10 business days in a 90-day period.

The fees and gates rules only apply to retail and institutional funds, although government funds may voluntarily adopt them if the fees and gates are previously disclosed to investors.The boards of directors of Vanguard's government funds have decided to impose neither fees nor gates.

Layer opened.Transcript







Amy Chain: Hello, I'm Amy Chain. Welcome to today's discussion on money market funds. We'll discuss the changes in regulations of money market funds and how Vanguard investors are affected.And with us today are David Glocke and Justin Schwartz of Vanguard's Fixed Income Group, the group responsible for managing Vanguard's money market funds. Gentlemen, thanks for being here today.Justin Schwartz: Thank you.David Glocke: Thank you.Amy Chain: Justin, get us started. Tell us a little bit about some of the changes coming to money market funds.Justin Schwartz: I think the most important thing to note is that for most of our shareholders, not a lot is going to change, but we are happy to go through a couple of the key changes here today. And the first thing I'd like to get started on is enhanced disclosure.So our shareholders are going to have some increased transparency into the portfolios, and that's going to take place through the website. So we'll have daily website disclosure on our daily and weekly liquid assets that we hold in the portfolio. In addition, they'll be able to see a market-based value of the portfolio; something different from money market funds. This will be taken out to the fourth decimal place. It's important to note that this is not the share price that investors will be transacting at. We'll strive to maintain a stable $1 NAV in all of our money market funds.In addition to that, we'll be posting daily shareholder cash flows on the web page so shareholders will have a better insight into what's going on to the fund day in and day out.In addition to that, we do currently report holdings, detailed portfolio holdings to the SEC at the end of every month. Those are currently available on a 60-day lag and after April 14, our shareholders will be able to access those through the SEC's website. And, actually, there's a link on our website as well immediately after posting.David Glocke: In addition to that, a couple of things that investors are probably going to start hearing about is the SEC allowed the money market funds to not just offer the stable net asset value portfolios, which clients have gotten used to for the last 40 years, but to also go ahead and offer floating-rate net asset value type portfolios. And we've decided at Vanguard that's not really where we want to go. We just want to offer the stable NAV traditional-type money market funds that clients are used to. So those are the products that we'll offer.Also they'll hear something about fees and gates. So the SEC is going ahead and allowing boards of directors of portfolios to implement fees and gates, which we would expect would be implemented in times of extreme stress. The trigger mechanism for that is something that's going to be displayed on our website through the enhanced disclosure, which represents the amount of weekly liquidity in the fund.As long as the portfolio has at least 30% weekly liquidity in the portfolio, the board of directors won't have to consider whether they need to implement fees and gates. So what we've done is we've enhanced the amount of liquidity in our funds to around 40% in total assets. And we think that's going to give us enough of a buffer to go ahead and avoid the times where we might have to turn around and implement that.And in addition to the government funds that we offer, won't have fees and gates apply to them at all. The SEC allowed the board of directors to go ahead and opt out of that for government funds and Vanguard's board chose to do that.Amy Chain: How about from the perspective of managing our money market funds, do these regulatory changes bring any changes to the way we manage money?David Glocke: Really, I mean, on the taxable side, there's not a lot of changes other than enhancing the amount of liquidity. During the financial crisis, in particular during the Lehman period when things were really volatile, we lost less than 2% of our assets over the course of a week.* So having that additional buffer from 30 to 40% I think gives us a lot of comfort knowing that we can go ahead and deal with anything that comes up day to day.And certainly, as we did during the financial crisis, if we saw conditions eroding in the markets, we would turn around and enhance that to go ahead and make sure that we had an even larger buffer, again, similar to the way we managed the cash back in that time period.Amy Chain: Pause for a minute and tell me a little bit about why liquidity is important in a money market fund.David Glocke: Well, it's interesting. I mean, a money market fund allows investors to go ahead and transact in their portfolios all the time. We don't have any restrictions. And so, like a bank, we would have to have certain assets on hand to go ahead and meet redemptions, and we do that through maturities, assets that are coming due on a daily basis. And, also, our bank would go ahead and invest more long-term. Money market funds invest short-term. So we have average maturity that's determined by the SEC, which has to be 60 days or less.Amy Chain: So all of the securities within the money market portfolios have maturities of 60 days or less, or a large majority of them.David Glocke: Not necessarily. They'll have maturities that can go out a bit further but the average maturity of the overall portfolio has to be 60 days or less. So it's common for us to go out and buy six-month bank CDs and put that in the portfolio, but we'll have a large weight of short-term assets which offset that.And so there's always a constant flow of maturities coming due in the portfolio to meet redemptions. So on top of that, the SEC wants us to have more liquidity. And so for us in Prime Money Market, I go out and I buy U.S. Treasury securities or I might go out and buy an agency security, which are very highly liquid and also qualify as weekly liquidity for the SEC rules.Justin Schwartz: And on the municipal side, I'd say very little has changed in terms of how we manage the portfolios. The securities that are available for money market funds in the municipal market are actually structured such that they qualify for daily or weekly liquid assets. So traditionally, even dating back before the financial crisis, municipal money market funds ran about 70 to 80% in what today qualifies as weekly liquid assets.**Amy Chain: Certainly, we have many, many investors who are investors in our money market funds. Many of them through our brokerage accounts. Talk to me about how these policy changes impact our investors.Justin Schwartz: That's probably one of the biggest areas of change that our shareholders will see. So, as a result of the reform, Vanguard has decided to only offer the Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund as a settlement option and a brokerage account.As David mentioned before, government funds are not subject to fees and gates and they're open to all investors. So with Vanguard Brokerage thought that would be the best option for clients. It is important to note that they can continue to use all the Vanguard money market funds as they do today with the exception of settling brokerage trades.Amy Chain: So your settlement fund and your brokerage account has to be the Federal Money Market Fund; otherwise, any impacts to investors?David Glocke: Yes. I could go ahead and have a Federal Money Market account to handle any stock trades that I might want to do, but I can still have my cash in another account whether it's a tax-exempt money market fund or Prime Money Market. So I can continue to maintain that same investment profile, but then just transfer the money over as I need it to deal with brokerage trades.Justin Schwartz: It's a good opportunity for investors to think about what they value in their money market fund, whether it's tax-exempt income or, in the case of a prime fund, maybe a slightly higher yield than a government portfolio. So those are decisions and things that the clients may want to consider.Amy Chain: Are there any strategies that investors should be considering to minimize the impact of these changes?David Glocke: The strategies that we're hearing about and seeing people execute on, we know that Vanguard introduced an ultra-short bond fund recently. So it's positioned right between a money market fund and a short-term bond fund. It's a variable NAV fund very similar to a bond fund, but it buys shorter-duration assets. So that's where its maturity profile would be right between the two.And we've seen a lot of interest in that product, investors considering that, mostly though from investors who have money maybe in money market funds that recognize at this point that maybe it's time to take some of that cash that has traditionally been long-term cash in the money market fund and move it into something that offers a better opportunity for returns.Justin Schwartz: And we have a municipal product, Short-Term Tax-Exempt Fund, that has a similar maturity and duration profile to the ultra-short-term taxable fund that is available for clients as well who desire the tax-exempt income.David Glocke: In this low-yield environment that we finally are starting to move out of very slowly, a lot of clients were looking for a way to go ahead and get a higher return but yet not necessarily to go into the more traditional-type bond funds. So these products give investors who have that risk profile an opportunity to do something a bit different.Amy Chain: We've talked a little bit about N-A-V or NAV today. Can you define that for us? What does that mean and what do shareholders need to know about it?David Glocke: Really, I guess the net asset value of the portfolio is the level, the price of the fund that you're transacting in. So when you think of net asset value in the money market fund, it's traditionally been the dollar, a buck. And that's how a lot of times how we'll turn around and refer to it. Whereas the floating NAV or floating net asset value portfolios really price more like bond funds. On the money market side, they would be shorter-duration in nature and so they wouldn't have as much volatility, obviously, as a bond fund.But I think a lot of clients really prefer to go ahead and know that when they're transacting, it's $1 in, $1 out. It's never a guarantee. We can say that over and over and it's in all the prospectus. We have a long tradition of very conservative investment management and we feel very comfortable that our investment-style approach that Vanguard has will go ahead and keep us where we should be.Amy Chain: David, you also talked a little bit about fees and gates today. Can you define them for us?David Glocke: Sure. So the fees and gates are associated, again, with when you go ahead and drop below 30%. The board of directors at that point has the opportunity to decide if they want to go ahead and present a fee, a redemption fee, or gate, where they control the flow above the cash they go ahead and leave.Amy Chain: The idea would be if there is volatility in the market such that we're afraid there would be mass redemptions from a money market fund, these fees or gates would slow down the outflow to protect shareholders of the fund.Amy Chain: Let's sum up some of what we've talked about today. Any final thoughts to share?David Glocke: I think, really, for most Vanguard clients, there aren't a lot of changes that are going to impact the way that they use their money market funds today.Justin Schwartz: And as we talked a little bit about before for brokerage clients, the settlement fund change will happen. And when it does, they'll just need to make sure that when they do a brokerage transaction that they're funding that account to settle the trade. Other than that, they can continue to maintain their position in their prime or tax-exempt money market funds that they have today.Amy Chain: Gentlemen, thank you so much for sharing with us today. We covered a lot of information. For a deeper dive on some of the topics, terms, and concepts that we talked about, I encourage you to visit our money market reform overview page on vanguard.com.So from all of us here at Vanguard, we'd like to say thank you for joining us and we'll see you next time.

Get easy access to your cash



Transfer money between your bank and your Vanguard accounts whenever you need to.

Frequently Asked Questions

What interest rates do my local banks and credit unions pay on savings?

The national average annual percentage yield for savings accounts is currently 0.06% as published in the FDIC Weekly National Rates and Rate Caps. Generally, most local credit unions and banks pay less than 0.10%. Many of them pay only 0.01%. Wouldn't you rather earn 16 times more interest than the average by taking 10 minutes to open up a new high yield savings account?

What exactly is an online bank?

Online banks are exactly the same as your local banks and credit unions, however they don't have tens, hundreds, or even thousands of locations around the country. This means they don't need to spend the money to keep up buildings, landscapes, parking lots, lots of employees and equipment, etc. This allows online banks to pay a much higher interest rate to their depositors. Online banks are just as safe and secure as your local banks and credit unions. You access all your account information- including making transfers and deposits- through your computer and/or smart phone. Many of the banks also have an app that allows you to take a photo of a check and deposit it into your checking or savings account.

Are Online Banks Convenient?

Yes! You can access all your account information easily through a safe and secure website and/or phone app (depending on the bank). Just connect your current bank with your new high yield online account and start earning 12 times more interest than the national average today! Many online savings accounts also allow you to use certain ATM's at no charge or reimburse you for a certain number of ATM withdrawals per month.

How do I deposit funds into an online bank?

It depends on the bank but most offer the ability to make deposits in the following ways:

Online Transfer (ACH) - You first need to link your current checking/savings account to your online bank account.
Mobile Deposit - Use the bank's app to take a photo of your check and submit it securely.
Wire Transfer
Check by Mail

Are these online banks safe? What does FDIC or NCUA mean?

All the banks or credit unions we advertise are FDIC or NCUA insured- meaning your money is backed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation of the United States Government up to $250,000 per depositor per bank for each ownership category. The FDIC sells insurance policies to banks which then insures the savings accounts, checking accounts, certain retirement accounts, trust accounts, and several other types of accounts against bank failure. The FDIC does not cover investment accounts such as mutual funds, life insurance, stocks, bonds, and annuities.


NCUA stands for the National Credit union Administration and it is an independent federal agency backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. The NCUA insures savings accounts, checking accounts, certificates of deposit and money market accounts up to $250,000 (the same as the FDIC).

Do I have to close my current bank account?

No! It is actually very convenient to have a local bank you can go into to get cash, deposit checks, get cashiers checks etc. However, most local banks provide VERY LOW interest rates (0.01%- 0.08%). There's no reason for you to leave your savings sitting in account that makes almost zero interest. You can easily connect your existing local bank account with an online high yield savings or cd account and transfer your savings in just a few minutes and watch the interest $$ accumulate each month.

Is 1.05% APY really worth opening up a new savings account?

Yes! If you deposit $10,000 into your new high interest savings account you can make $10 each month without doing anything! It only took you 15 minutes to set up the account and transfer the money and then you enjoy $126 of new money each year (assuming daily compounding). You will still need to pay taxes on the interest at your current tax bracket. That money is credited into your account each month and then you start earning interest on your interest. In just a few years you've saved enough money to buy a brand new tablet! Pretty awesome for taking only 15 minutes of your time!

How quickly can my savings multiply at 1.00%?

If you put $10,000 into your high interest savings account and add $100 each month (you can even set up an automatic transfer each month to make it easy) - the first year you will have a balance increase of $1,307, by the second you've saved $2,625, and by the end of the third year you will have added a total $3,961 to your initial $10,000. Your monthly contributions add up to $3,600 and your earn $360.60 in interest (assuming daily compounding).

Traditional IRAs 























Top Savings & Money Market Rates 2016
 


Traditional IRAs
Purpose
In this article we would like to give insight into a small section of retirement planning. We will introduce what a traditional IRA is, along with how to get an IRA. There is also a section showing how retirement planning can be beneficial to an individual. Examples of deductions and possible outcome from contributing are also provided.
What is an IRA
There are different types of IRAs (Individual Retirement Account), rather than discussing them all we will focus on the Traditional IRA. A Traditional IRA is a tax shelter created by the government to help citizens plan and pay for retirement. The reason it is called an Individual Retirement Account is because the account is individually held, and one person is limited to one Traditional IRA. The money placed in a Traditional IRA is not taxable until withdrawal, which can only be made after the age of 59 ½. During the time the money is in the IRA, it can be invested in certificates of deposit, stocks, bonds, mutual funds, money market accounts, U.S. gold and silver coins, and real estate. The government also provides incentives for establishing an IRA by allowing for the contribution amount to be tax deductible. Not all contributions are tax deductible there are stipulations that regulate the deductibility. Below is information showing the qualifications for tax deductibility, which is determined by income bracket and if a company retirement plan (401k) is held by an individual. The information below is provided by www.etrade.com.
· If you or your spouse do not participate in a company retirement plan: 100% deductible
· If you participate in a retirement plan at work:





Tax Filing Status


Adjusted Gross Income 


You Can Deduct






Single


Up to $34,000


100% of your contribution




 


$34,000 – $44,000


Less than $3,000




Over $44,000


No deduction allowed




Married, filling jointly 


Up to $54,000


100% of your contribution




 


$54,000 – $64,000


Less than $3,000




Over $65,000


No deduction allowed





 
 
· If only your spouse participates in a retirement plan at work:




Adjusted Gross Income 


You Can Deduct




Up to $150,000


100% of your contribution




$150,000 – $160,000


Less than $3,000




Over $160,000


No deduction allowed




 
There are limits placed on the amount that a person or couple can contribute to an IRA. The current contribution limit is $3000 annually. To compensate for inflation, the government has scheduled increases in the contribution amount. The expected increases are presented below:




Tax Year


Regular Contribution Limit




2002


$ 3,000




2003


$ 3,000




2004


$ 3,000




2005


$ 4,000




2006


$ 4,000




2007


$ 4,000




2008


$ 5,000




2009


$ 5,000




Beginning 2009, contributions will increase in $ 500 increments. (information by www.investopedia.com)




 
Benefits of a Traditional IRA
Retirement is something that should be done while young because once you start getting older retirement is getting closer. Saving money over a longer period of time allows individuals the pleasure of using more of their income at retirement. There are many benefits that come from the Traditional IRA which include (provided by the website www.wachovia.com):

Contributions may be tax deductible (consult with a financial advisor).
Every one under the age of 70 ½ with earned income is eligible.
There is no income limit.
Taxes are paid when earnings are withdrawn at retirement.
By deferring tax a higher compounded growth may occur.
Variety of investment choices including: stocks, bonds, mutual funds along with protected certificate of deposits and money market accounts.
Withdraws start at age 59 ½.

A Traditional IRA should be considered if a higher income and tax rate is being paid, and a lower tax rate is expected at the time of retirement. Because many students are graduating and will be earning a higher income and will be taxed at a higher rate, a traditional IRA could be the answer. Also, the Traditional IRA allows for tax deferred growth along with a possible tax deduction. With a Traditional IRA taxes are paid at the time of retirement when a lower tax rate may be present, which will possibly lower the amount paid in taxes. The Traditional IRA may not be beneficial to everyone; an analysis by a qualified professional should be done in order to determine the best possible plan in regards to all personal finance issues as pointed out by the website www.finance.cch.com.
The description provided by www.finance.cch.com shows a possible outcome of a Traditional IRA. Starting at the age of 24 if a contribution of $3,000 is made annually, at an expected rate of return of 9%, until the age of retirement at 65 the Traditional IRA could be worth $1,207,584 before income taxes. The results are explained in more detail in the financial calculator results below:

Your IRA balance at retirement could be worth $1,207,584 before income taxes. With a retirement income tax rate of 15.00% this amount is $1,026,717 after taxes. An ordinary taxable account, after taxes, would be worth $488,968 at retirement. Total contributions by retirement will be $123,000. 





How to open a Traditional IRA
When opening an IRA you will need to choose where you would like to open an IRA. Any commercial bank or credit union will be able to open an IRA, but at a credit union you must be a member of their establishment. A new account representative will direct you through the account opening process. Before opening the IRA some initial questions should be asked:

Which tax year will the contribution be going towards?
Will the contribution be made in one lump sum or over the course of the year?

These questions are important to ask yourself before going into open the IRA. Knowing which tax year the contribution will be applied toward is very important because the contribution can be applied to last years taxes until April 15th of the next year. By knowing if the contribution will be made in one lump sum or in smaller payments over the course of the year this will determine what type of account designation can be used.
There is certain information that is needed in order for an IRA to be opened. The information that is needed is found on the banks application. The application that we will follow is from Zions Bank; please refer to the application if there are any questions on where a section is located. Here are some step by step instructions on how to fill out an application in order to get an IRA:
1. Fill out customer information as needed (name, social security number, demographics, etc.).
2. Mark the appropriate box of where the source of the IRA funds will be coming from.
3. Write the name of the beneficiary (ies). Including their address, relationship, social security number, date of birth, and the percentage of the IRA that they will receive in the event that something were to happen to you. (The percentages for all beneficiaries should equal to 100 percent.)
4. Write the name of the contingent beneficiary (ies). The contingent beneficiary is the beneficiary to the beneficiary.
5. Read the fine print under the section of the beneficiary designation.
6. If the money is going to be invested by a brokerage firm, write in the name of the brokerage company along with the address and telephone number.
7. Read the print in the agreement to participate section noting that it states that the information that has been given is true and accurate to your knowledge.
8. Verify the information making sure all areas are complete and accurate.
9. Sign the signature line that states “signature of participant”.
10. Ask any questions to the new account representative.
After the application is completed and the agreement to participate has been signed the account representative will give you a copy of everything you have signed. Along with information that states the account terms and the guidelines for the IRA.
Conclusion
An Individual Retirement Account is essential to all of us. Planning for our future is very important, especially when we want to be financially secure. Knowing that in your future you have money saved can eliminate the worries of how you will live at the time of retirement. Living off of social security is not the answer. Retirement is a very important time for all individuals and making sure that your retirement is secure is one of the best things that you can do, and the Traditional IRA can help to accomplish this security.
Retirement planning is essential to everyones future, and one of the best ways to put away money for your future is with an IRA. The Traditional IRA has many benefits that include: tax deductibility, tax-deferred growth, and no income limits. Saving for retirement is made easier with the Traditional IRA because taxes are paid at retirement and when a lower tax bracket could be present. Being able to put money into a Traditional IRA can help many individuals get a tax break, something most everyone would like. The Traditional IRA has many benefits that can help many individuals, but stipulations are present and not everyone is helped by a Traditional IRA. So for those without an Individual Retirement Account we recommend that you visit your bank of choice and start saving for your retirement today, and don’t forget the earlier you start the better prepared you will be for your future.

About Us 























Top Savings & Money Market Rates 2016
 


About Us
RateCatcher was built in March of 2004. The RateCatcher Team is a group of individuals who have a passion for banking, the stock market and investing. The inspiration for RateCatcher came after seeing the stress finances cause most people. Personally I have lost thousands of my own money testing strategies on futures and options. As we’ve seen with the latest economic downturn, the stock market shows no mercy to even well balanced portfolios and retirement accounts. The average 401k lost 27% in 2008. According Leuthold Group it takes an average of 2 1/2 years to regain what’s lost after an average bear market. 
What about a severe bear market? It took seven years to regain what was lost after the 1973-74 bear market. After the 86 percent drop in the market during the Great Depression, it took a whopping 20 years for the stock market to recover completely.
Are you willing to take the risk of having all your nest eggs in a typical 401k? You might end up like the millions of elderly seniors who now cannot afford to retire and who have no more time to save. Riskless investments such as CDs, rewards checking, money market accounts and savings accounts will help you sleep better at night and guarantee you will have some retirement money unless the U.S. Goverment goes belly up in which case everyone will be in trouble.
