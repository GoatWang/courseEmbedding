Autobytel Inc. Announced as Finalist for Innovatiove Product Award 
Irvine CA, April 27, 2006 - Autobytel Inc. (Nasdaq: ABTL) was announced Wednesday as a finalist for Innovative Product (2005) by the Orange County council of AeA—the largest technology trade association in the United States. 

Autobytel was recognized for the development of its advanced proprietary search engine marketing technology, named "Black Condor'", which plays an essential role in funneling in-market auto shoppers from Internet search engines to the company's nationwide network of auto dealers - at a fraction of the cost of traditional advertising. In 2005, the company's search engine marketing generated an estimated $1.4 billion in gross revenue for its member dealers, and twenty million Autobytel web pages were listed on major search engines in January 2006.

Search engine marketing has become a highly competitive market as search engines such as Google and Yahoo! conduct online auctions to sell popular search words (keywords) to businesses that want to present their ads and information to Internet searchers. Autobytel's search technology is capable of sorting through 500,000 of the most sought after automotive keywords on the major search engines, making bids for the keywords 1,600+ times an hour. Black Condor also creates dynamic landing pages with relevant make and model information for most of the 500,000 key words. 

According to the Pew Internet Life and American Project, nearly 60 million U.S. Internet searchers used search engines daily in 2005. J.D. Power & Associates, the global marketing information firm, reports that in 2005 ninety percent of all Internet new vehicle shoppers used a search engine during their shopping process. 

"We are extremely proud that our technology has been recognized by a prestigious organization like AeA," said Autobytel CEO and President James Riesenbach. "Black Condor has been instrumental in furthering our mission of efficiently connecting millions of in-market car shoppers to auto dealers across America, making the car shopping experience easier for consumers and car retailers alike."

Autobytel's technology was developed by Autobytel's Internet technology and marketing teams, led by Senior Director of Search Operations Zane Rathwick.

The winner will be announced May 18 at AeA’s 13th Annual High Tech Innovation Awards, which will be held at the Westin South Coast Plaza. Other awards categories include: Outstanding Company, Outstanding Public Company CEO, Outstanding Private Company CEO, Outstanding Woman in Technology, High Impact Person of the Year, Innovative Product of 2005, and the Greg Ross Community Service Award.  For the first time in the event’s history, education awards also will be given for District Leadership, Innovative School Program and High Impact Teacher of the Year (all in Science, Math and Technology).

The event will feature John Gage, Chief Researcher and Director of the Science Office for Sun Microsystems, Inc., as keynote speaker along with prominent leaders of Orange County technology companies as presenters. Messages from business, education, and political leaders will develop this year’s theme, “The Race to Innovate.”  Jonathan Lansner, business columnist for the Orange County Register, will serve as Master of Ceremonies.

The education awards, sponsored by Project Tomorrow—the nation’s leading non-profit group promoting science, math and technology in schools—reflect both organizations’ push for a more competitive U.S. workforce.

Autobytel Inc. (NASDAQ: ABTL) is an automotive media and marketing services company in the United States. Located in Irvine, California, U.S.A. Autobytel Inc. was founded in 1995 by Pete Ellis, a Southern California businessman well known for the high amount of television advertisements for his dealerships located in Southgate, California throughout the 1980s. Autobytel was the first Internet company to advertise during the Super Bowl in 1997.[4] On April 25, 2007 Autobytel was named one of California's 15 best technology innovators.[5] Currently, Autobytel owns and operates Autobytel.com, Car.com. AutoWeb.com, and UsedCars.com.
Through Autobytel’s marketing network, the company provides both automotive dealers and manufacturers with brand and product marketing opportunities.
Autobytel offers automotive dealers tools to manage their business. Specific products include: the Rapid Response program, designed to connect dealers to online customers via phone, as well as the Email Manager program, which manages long-term email campaigns on behalf of the dealership. Additionally, LeadCall, a live call program that sets in-dealership appointments and scores customer readiness to buy for auto dealers.
On Nov 15, 2004, Autobytel announced to restate results for the second, third, and fourth quarters of 2003, the full 2003 fiscal year, and the first and second quarters of 2004, due to its accounting problems covering a number of issues surfaced after the disclosure of a review by its audit committee. After further review, on March 15, 2005, the Company announced that it also expected to restate its financial statements for the full 2002 fiscal year and the first fiscal quarter of 2003.[6]
In 2004, a class action lawsuit was filed against Autobytel alleging that it violated Securities Exchange Act by disseminating false statements and inflating its financial results.[7]
The financial crisis of 2008 forced the company to reduce costs primarily by laying off a big portion of the workforce.[8] It also considered selling itself, but that plan was tabled in 2009.[8] The FY2012 results showed a small profit, suggesting the layoff strategy worked at keeping the business running until the economy recovered.
In late 2013 Autobytel purchased a portion of Autoweb.com, a targeted automotive advertising company[9] In early 2014, Autobytel purchased AutoUSA from AutoNation Inc. for $10 million in cash, a $1 million convertible note and other consideration.[10] In May 2015, Autobytel acquired Dealix Corporation and Autotegrity, Inc. (wholly owned subsidiaries of CDK Global, LLC), for $25 million.[11] On October 1, 2015, Autobytel acquired Autoweb, Inc. in an all-stock and warrant transaction.[12]

The Company sells Internally-Generated Leads and Non-Internally-Generated Leads directly to Dealers and indirectly to dealers through a wholesale market consisting of manufacturers and other third parties in the automotive Lead distribution industry. In conjunction with its Lead programs, the Company also offers dealers and manufacturers other products and services, including the iControl by Autobytel, WebLeads+, Email Marketing Manager, Payment Pro, and Lead Call products and services, to assist them in capturing online, in-market customers and selling more vehicles by improving conversion of Leads to sale transactions.Vehicle Lead ProgramsThe Company provides dealers and manufacturers with opportunities to market their vehicles to vehicle buyers.
