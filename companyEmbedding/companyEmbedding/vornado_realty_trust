History[edit]




1999 K Street, NW in Washington, D.C. was developed by Vornado Realty Trust and sold for $208M in 2009. It was designed by architect Helmut Jahn.






330 Madison Avenue, owned by Vornado


Two Guys[edit]
The origins of the company can be traced back to the Two Guys discount store chain, founded in 1947 by brothers Sidney and Herbert Hubschman.[2] In 1959, Two Guys acquired O. A. Sutton Corporation, manufacturers of the Vornado line of electric fans, and the company was renamed Vornado Inc.[2]
By 1964, the company operated over 200 stores.[3] In the 1970s, Vornado began divesting its retail operations. In 1978, the company sold 80 Two Guys locations in California.[2]
In 1980, Interstate Properties Inc., a real estate development company controlled by Steven Roth, acquired an 18% stake in Vornado, since Roth became interested in the company's real estate holdings.[2] In 1981, Interstate Properties took control of the firm after winning a proxy struggle against existing management and closed additional stores, reducing the number of stores in operation to 12.[4][5]
Acquisition of Alexander's (1986-1995)[edit]
In 1986, Interstate Properties and Donald Trump each bought approximately 20% of Alexander's, a failing retailer whose real estate holdings included a store that occupied the entire block between East 58th and 59th streets and Lexington and Third Avenues in Manhattan.[6]
In 1988, they each raised their stakes to 27% of the company, but Trump pledged his interest as collateral for a personal loan from Citicorp and in 1991, Trump was forced to turn over his holdings to Citibank.[7]
In 1992, Roth and Alexander's creditors forced Alexander's into bankruptcy.[8]
Alexander's emerged from bankruptcy in 1993 as a real estate investment trust. That same year, Vornado Inc. was converted into a REIT, Vornado Realty Trust. In 1995, Vornado bought Citicorp's interest in Alexander's.[9]
Vornado Air licensing deal (1989)[edit]
In 1989, the Vornado name was licensed to Vornado Air, LLC, a new company formed to manufacture heating and cooling equipment. Outside of the brand licensing agreement, the Trust has no relation to Vornado Air, LLC.
Acquisition of properties from Bernard H. Mendik (1997)[edit]
In April 1997, the company merged with a company owned by Bernard H. Mendik in a $654 million stock transaction that added a large portfolio of office buildings in Manhattan to Vornado's assets. Mendik became co-chairman of Vornado until his resignation in October 1998.[10]
World Trade Center lease (2001)[edit]
On February 15, 2001, the Port Authority announced that Vornado Realty Trust had won the bid for a 99-year lease for the World Trade Center, offering $3.25 billion.[11] Silverstein Properties was outbid by $30 million by Vornado. However, Vornado balked over lease terms and possible tax liabilities.[12] Silverstein signed a lease for the World Trade Center in April 2001.[13]
2001-present[edit]
In 2001, the company acquired Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty, owner of a portfolio of assets primarily in Arlington, Virginia, in a $1.58 billion transaction. Robert H. Smith and Robert P. Kogod were added to the board of directors of Vornado.[14]
In 2005, the company bought a 32.5% interest in Toys "R" Us.[15]
In 2013, Steven Roth replaced Michael D. Fascitelli as CEO of Vornado. Fascitelli had been CEO since 2009.[16]
In 2015, the company spun off its interest in Urban Edge Properties to its shareholders.[17]
In 2017, the company merged its Charles E. Smith Companies subsidiary into JBG Companies, and the merged company was spun off to shareholders.[18]

Vornado, Related and Skanska finalize deal to build $1.6B Moynihan Train Hall
Development team will kick in $630M

Rendering of the Moynihan Train Hall (Credit: SOM)
Vornado Realty Trust, Related Companies and Skanska have finalized a deal with the state to build a $1.6 billion train hall at James A. Farley Post Office, paving the way for construction to begin.
State officials announced the deal on Friday, roughly nine months after the companies were named the preferred design-build team for the project. The Empire State Development Corp., the state agency leading the development, inked a financial agreement with the team that requires $550 million from the state, $630 million from the developers and $420 million from Amtrak, the MTA and federal funds.
The financial breakdown differs slightly from what was announced in September, increasing the developers’ cut by $30 million and decreasing the state’s by $20 million. During a conference call held on Friday, officials explained the difference as a product of financing at a better rate than what was initially expected. Additional information was not immediately available.
Representatives for Related and Vornado declined to comment beyond a press release sent out by the governor’s office. Skanska didn’t immediately respond to messages seeking comment.
The new train hall will feature 700,000 square feet of office and retail space and a 255,000-square-foot train hall for both Amtrak and the Long Island Rail Road. The project is expected to be complete in 2022.
Friday’s announcement follows the opening of the train hall’s first phase, an Eighth Avenue entrance to the tracks below the post office. The news also comes as commuters brace themselves for a series of travel disruptions at Penn Station.
On Thursday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo called on the MTA to withhold annual rent from Amtrak since trains won’t be able to use the tracks during repairs. During Friday’s conference call, a reporter noted that Amtrak officials said withholding rent would disrupt its ability to complete repairs. Cuomo responded that Amtrak should already have that money at the ready.

History[edit]




1999 K Street, NW in Washington, D.C. was developed by Vornado Realty Trust and sold for $208M in 2009. It was designed by architect Helmut Jahn.






330 Madison Avenue, owned by Vornado


Two Guys[edit]
The origins of the company can be traced back to the Two Guys discount store chain, founded in 1947 by brothers Sidney and Herbert Hubschman.[2] In 1959, Two Guys acquired O. A. Sutton Corporation, manufacturers of the Vornado line of electric fans, and the company was renamed Vornado Inc.[2]
By 1964, the company operated over 200 stores.[3] In the 1970s, Vornado began divesting its retail operations. In 1978, the company sold 80 Two Guys locations in California.[2]
In 1980, Interstate Properties Inc., a real estate development company controlled by Steven Roth, acquired an 18% stake in Vornado, since Roth became interested in the company's real estate holdings.[2] In 1981, Interstate Properties took control of the firm after winning a proxy struggle against existing management and closed additional stores, reducing the number of stores in operation to 12.[4][5]
Acquisition of Alexander's (1986-1995)[edit]
In 1986, Interstate Properties and Donald Trump each bought approximately 20% of Alexander's, a failing retailer whose real estate holdings included a store that occupied the entire block between East 58th and 59th streets and Lexington and Third Avenues in Manhattan.[6]
In 1988, they each raised their stakes to 27% of the company, but Trump pledged his interest as collateral for a personal loan from Citicorp and in 1991, Trump was forced to turn over his holdings to Citibank.[7]
In 1992, Roth and Alexander's creditors forced Alexander's into bankruptcy.[8]
Alexander's emerged from bankruptcy in 1993 as a real estate investment trust. That same year, Vornado Inc. was converted into a REIT, Vornado Realty Trust. In 1995, Vornado bought Citicorp's interest in Alexander's.[9]
Vornado Air licensing deal (1989)[edit]
In 1989, the Vornado name was licensed to Vornado Air, LLC, a new company formed to manufacture heating and cooling equipment. Outside of the brand licensing agreement, the Trust has no relation to Vornado Air, LLC.
Acquisition of properties from Bernard H. Mendik (1997)[edit]
In April 1997, the company merged with a company owned by Bernard H. Mendik in a $654 million stock transaction that added a large portfolio of office buildings in Manhattan to Vornado's assets. Mendik became co-chairman of Vornado until his resignation in October 1998.[10]
World Trade Center lease (2001)[edit]
On February 15, 2001, the Port Authority announced that Vornado Realty Trust had won the bid for a 99-year lease for the World Trade Center, offering $3.25 billion.[11] Silverstein Properties was outbid by $30 million by Vornado. However, Vornado balked over lease terms and possible tax liabilities.[12] Silverstein signed a lease for the World Trade Center in April 2001.[13]
2001-present[edit]
In 2001, the company acquired Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty, owner of a portfolio of assets primarily in Arlington, Virginia, in a $1.58 billion transaction. Robert H. Smith and Robert P. Kogod were added to the board of directors of Vornado.[14]
In 2005, the company bought a 32.5% interest in Toys "R" Us.[15]
In 2013, Steven Roth replaced Michael D. Fascitelli as CEO of Vornado. Fascitelli had been CEO since 2009.[16]
In 2015, the company spun off its interest in Urban Edge Properties to its shareholders.[17]
In 2017, the company merged its Charles E. Smith Companies subsidiary into JBG Companies, and the merged company was spun off to shareholders.[18]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

History[edit]




1999 K Street, NW in Washington, D.C. was developed by Vornado Realty Trust and sold for $208M in 2009. It was designed by architect Helmut Jahn.






330 Madison Avenue, owned by Vornado


Two Guys[edit]
The origins of the company can be traced back to the Two Guys discount store chain, founded in 1947 by brothers Sidney and Herbert Hubschman.[2] In 1959, Two Guys acquired O. A. Sutton Corporation, manufacturers of the Vornado line of electric fans, and the company was renamed Vornado Inc.[2]
By 1964, the company operated over 200 stores.[3] In the 1970s, Vornado began divesting its retail operations. In 1978, the company sold 80 Two Guys locations in California.[2]
In 1980, Interstate Properties Inc., a real estate development company controlled by Steven Roth, acquired an 18% stake in Vornado, since Roth became interested in the company's real estate holdings.[2] In 1981, Interstate Properties took control of the firm after winning a proxy struggle against existing management and closed additional stores, reducing the number of stores in operation to 12.[4][5]
Acquisition of Alexander's (1986-1995)[edit]
In 1986, Interstate Properties and Donald Trump each bought approximately 20% of Alexander's, a failing retailer whose real estate holdings included a store that occupied the entire block between East 58th and 59th streets and Lexington and Third Avenues in Manhattan.[6]
In 1988, they each raised their stakes to 27% of the company, but Trump pledged his interest as collateral for a personal loan from Citicorp and in 1991, Trump was forced to turn over his holdings to Citibank.[7]
In 1992, Roth and Alexander's creditors forced Alexander's into bankruptcy.[8]
Alexander's emerged from bankruptcy in 1993 as a real estate investment trust. That same year, Vornado Inc. was converted into a REIT, Vornado Realty Trust. In 1995, Vornado bought Citicorp's interest in Alexander's.[9]
Vornado Air licensing deal (1989)[edit]
In 1989, the Vornado name was licensed to Vornado Air, LLC, a new company formed to manufacture heating and cooling equipment. Outside of the brand licensing agreement, the Trust has no relation to Vornado Air, LLC.
Acquisition of properties from Bernard H. Mendik (1997)[edit]
In April 1997, the company merged with a company owned by Bernard H. Mendik in a $654 million stock transaction that added a large portfolio of office buildings in Manhattan to Vornado's assets. Mendik became co-chairman of Vornado until his resignation in October 1998.[10]
World Trade Center lease (2001)[edit]
On February 15, 2001, the Port Authority announced that Vornado Realty Trust had won the bid for a 99-year lease for the World Trade Center, offering $3.25 billion.[11] Silverstein Properties was outbid by $30 million by Vornado. However, Vornado balked over lease terms and possible tax liabilities.[12] Silverstein signed a lease for the World Trade Center in April 2001.[13]
2001-present[edit]
In 2001, the company acquired Charles E. Smith Commercial Realty, owner of a portfolio of assets primarily in Arlington, Virginia, in a $1.58 billion transaction. Robert H. Smith and Robert P. Kogod were added to the board of directors of Vornado.[14]
In 2005, the company bought a 32.5% interest in Toys "R" Us.[15]
In 2013, Steven Roth replaced Michael D. Fascitelli as CEO of Vornado. Fascitelli had been CEO since 2009.[16]
In 2015, the company spun off its interest in Urban Edge Properties to its shareholders.[17]
In 2017, the company merged its Charles E. Smith Companies subsidiary into JBG Companies, and the merged company was spun off to shareholders.[18]

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Vornado pays Trump Organization millions each year
Company has 30% stakes in two of REIT's properties



















 February 16, 2017 09:33AM












1290 Sixth Avenue, Donald Trump and Steve Roth
As it vies for federal work and funds, Vornado Realty Trust pays the Trump Organization tens of millions of dollars each year for its stakes in two of the REIT’s office buildings.
The Trump Organization  owns 30 percent stakes in 1290 Sixth Avenue in Manhattan and 555 California Street in San Francisco. Interest in the former is worth $428.9 million and generates $14.7 million in annual cash flow for the Trump Organization, the Wall Street Journal reported. The stake in the California property is worth $322.6 million and generates $8 million annually, the Journal claims.
Vornado decides how much Trump’s company receives each year, while at the same time competing for government contracts. The company is currently bidding on building a new Federal Bureau of Investigation headquarters. Vornado is also waiting on federal funding for the $1.6 billion overhaul of the James A. Farley Building.
Last month, Donald Trump tapped Vornado’s founder, Steven Roth, and Richard LeFrak to head up a council that will monitor national infrastructure spending.
Vornado also has done business with Jared Kushner, having bought a 49.5 percent stake in 666 Fifth Avenue in 2011 and purchased retail space in the building for $710 million. [WSJ] — Kathryn Brenzel

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find companies that have recently seen positive earnings estimate revision activity. The idea is that more recent information is, generally speaking, more accurate and can be a better predictor of the future, which can give investors an advantage in earnings season.

Vornado Picks Chrome River to Automate Corporate Expense Workflow

Vornado Realty Trust
Case Study






Chrome River was able to automate the entire process start to finish, even allowing an export into Vornado’s proprietary accounting system. The system reduced data processing and scanning by 75%.

Saving Time and Resources with Automation
For nearly a decade, Vornado’s accounting processes had been paperless across the board—except for expenses. The manual expense process was cumbersome and time-consuming. Employees had to log into the company intranet, download the expense form and fill in each line item, which the document would then tally. Then, the employee had to print the expense form, attach receipts and manually give them to the approver or multiple approvers. Once the expense report was approved, AP would come in as the “cleanup crew”—validating that every receipt was accounted for by matching them to line items, and then entering the data into the system. Once in the system, the expense form was processed, a check was cut five days later, the auditor approved it, and the check was sent.
Chrome River was able to automate the entire expense management process start to finish, even allowing all expense report information to be exported out of Chrome River EXPENSE and into Vornado’s proprietary accounting system. Chrome River EXPENSE reduced data entry and scanning by 75%.




Overview
Vornado Realty Trust (NYSE: VNO) is a fully integrated real estate investment trust (REIT), with an enterprise value of $34.8 billion (asset value) and a market capitalization of $19.7 billion (equity). Vornado is one of the largest owners and managers of commercial real estate in the United States with a portfolio of over 100 million square feet, primarily located in the New York and Washington, D.C., areas. Vornado’s core businesses include New York; Washington, D.C.; and retail properties that are primarily in the Northeast, California and Puerto Rico.




Flexibility for a Complex Entity System
Vornado needed an expense management system that could scale to its very complex entity system. The company has divisions in New York, New Jersey and Washington D.C., as well as a mix of millions of square feet of commercial and retail properties. Each of the three divisions has its own rules and has its own version of Vornado’s proprietary internal accounting system. 
Through its flexible Business Rules Engine, Chrome River offered a platform that allowed for a complex expense and approval rules configuration. At first glance, Vornado’s team thought the transition would be straightforward, believing it would simply mean taking the current manual processes and moving them onto the Chrome River platform.
But adding some complexity to the transition was the fact that each division had its own rules and circumstances. In Washington, D.C., for instance, the accounting system didn’t support Automated Clearing House (ACH) payments. Chrome River was able to build the Business Rule Engine so that D.C.- based employees could not select ACH direct deposit as a reimbursement option. And, for each division, Chrome River built the Business Rules Engine specifically for that divisions’ rules.
As Vornado continued to learn the capabilities and flexibility of Chrome River, it began to ask more of the platform. According to Vornado, Chrome River “flipped the system on its side” at least three times to come up with unique configurations to support the company’s business goals. Vornado was assigned a very competent Chrome River project manager who was able to weed through its hierarchy issues and help the organization make many complex routing changes and rules. 

Thanks to Chrome River, employees were surprised to learn that expenses they had been attributing back to Vornado could instead be assigned to the tenant.





Goal
Replace its manual expense reporting workflow process with an automated workflow process that has built-in rules to ensure compliance by division and spend visibility across the organization.




Automated Rules Uncover Offline Cost Savings
Once it began using Chrome River EXPENSE, Vornado realized there were processing rules that should be in place to ensure greater cost savings and operational efficiency for the organization. 
For example, Vornado has employees in New York who manage tenants. Chrome River EXPENSE allowed expenses to be tagged as “tenant reimbursable,” which had never been an option before. Employees were surprised to learn that the expenses they had been attributing back to Vornado could instead be assigned to the tenant.
Chrome River created the opportunity to better educate employees on expense management best practices and save Vornado significant reimbursement costs. 




Why Chrome River
Reasonable cost, easy to use, capable of handling a complex entity system, and advanced tracking and reporting functions. 




Advanced Analytics for Increased Visibility 
Vornado’s accounting system could show, for example, that an employee had lunch; with Chrome River, Accounts Payable can see where, with whom and how many times they had lunch with that employee in a given period of time. With Chrome River, management has more visibility into employee spend.
Vornado is also able to catch multiple expense report submissions, for example, if an employee submits an expense, doesn’t get paid immediately and submits it again. At the same time, the system is allowing greater spend visibility as Vornado does budget forecasting for the next fiscal year. 
By implementing Chrome River's expense report software, Vornado met its goal of implementing an automated workflow process that has built-in rules to ensure compliance, spend visibility through reporting and cost reduction through operational efficiencies. 

The system is allowing greater spend visibility as Vornado does budget forecasting for the next fiscal year.





Benefits
Reduced costs by reducing data entry and scanning by 75%; ensured rules compliance via Chrome River’s Business Rules Engine.

Vornado Realty Trust                    








Vornado Realty Trust    




        New York City
            , United States    
    - 20 February 2014






        Vornado understands the importance of achieving the proper balance between visual aesthetics and economics to generate a high ROI on its advertising dollars. So, when they engaged experiential design firm The Barnycz Group for their expertise in high-impact outdoor displays, the company knew they would be dramatically boosting the impact of their building signage at critical retail traffic intersections in downtown Manhattan. The result: brilliant LED displays that not only light up the skyline with powerful messaging, but are expected to boost advertising revenue opportunities to the tune of millions of dollars.

 The new billboards are located at three key locations – with two displays actually facing each other across the street. The displays feature thousands of square feet of TF10 tiles with specially designed corner tiles and front-service mechanics, broadcasting millions of pixels of high-resolution imagery. Each is driven by Barco’s industry standard image processor, the DX-700, and runs Barco LiveDots’ network-based RMS software, featuring proprietary sensor technology enabling remote management of the entire display.
