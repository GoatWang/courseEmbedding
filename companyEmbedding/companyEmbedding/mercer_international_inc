NBSK Pulp



      All of Mercer's pulp mills produce Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft ("NBSK") - a premium pulp grade that is prized for its strength and reinforcing characteristics.
Production ProcessNBSK pulp is produced from slow growing and long fiber, northern softwood tree species. Typically, our wood is sourced from sawmill residuals and low grade pulp logs, the latter of which is debarked and chipped before beginning the pulping process. The process used to convert wood into NBSK pulp is a sulphate (kraft) cooking process. The woodchips are chemically cooked to separate the cellulose (the fibers) from the hemicellulose, lignin and extractives (the chemical compounds that hold the fibers together). Once the fibers are separated, they are washed, bleached, formed into sheets and dried. The sheets are packaged and shipped to customers around the world. 
Market FundamentalsToday's modern paper products are a selective mix of different types of fibers. The strength characteristics of NBSK make it an essential component in a number of these products that we use in our everyday lives, such as tissue, printing and writing paper, and specialty paper. NBSK's strength characteristics are valued by papermakers, and as a result NBSK commands premium prices when compared to other pulp grades. Because it is relatively more expensive than other pulp types, end product producers generally try to minimize the amount of NBSK that they use. Paper producers' profit maximizing tactics and market fundamentals over recent history lead us to believe that NBSK substitution for lower value fibers will be more difficult in the future. Globally, demand for NBSK-requiring paper goods - especially tissue, hygiene products, high-end printing and specialty paper - is increasing. This is due to improving global living standards in emerging countries, along with aging populations and growing demand for health and hygiene products. We believe that the NBSK pulp market shows strong long-term demand fundamentals.
Our PerformanceMercer is one of the largest NBSK market pulp producers in the world. We are constantly looking at ways to make our production process more efficient, and as a result our production capacities continue to increase.

Model 10 gpm - 30 gpm  (2 - 7 m3/h) - Above Ground Oil Water Separators






 
Our 'low flow' series offers an industrial-duty design in a compact size.  This separator series is ideally suited for smaller vehicle wash stations.  These separators are also well suited for wastewater from small sumps, small stormwater treatment applications, groundwater pump and treat systems, and various other applications.  Our 'low flow' series incorporates the same features in our standard sized separators that have helped...
 
 
 
 





 
 


Model 50 gpm - 100 gpm (10 - 25 m3/h) - Above Ground Oil Water Separators






 
A step above the 'low-flow' series, is our 50-100 gpm family of units.  This separator series features a true 'V-shaped' coalescer which incorporates a full-width Chimney-Zone (zero velocity solids settling area) designed to process solids down and out of the coalescer.  A coalescer design which processes the solids out of the coalescer, instead of simply filtering the solids through, will produce cleaner effluent and for much longer...
 
 
 
 





 
 


Model 150 gpm - 300 gpm  (35 - 70 m3/h) - Above Ground Oil Water Separators






 
This series bridges the gap between 'small' separators and 'large' separators.  It is with these 'in-between sized' separators that the materials of construction become an important consideration based on performance and price.  Whether it is an environmental engineer that understands the complexities when dealing with certain applications, or a concerned maintenance professional trying to avoid the past problems of corrosion,the choices are...
 
 
 
 





 
 


Highest Efficiency Oil/Water Separators-Eliminate Fouling






 
As flow rates become larger, the inherent design advantages of the Multi-Pack coalescer become vital for maintaining high efficiencies within reasonable maintenance intervals.  With oil water separators of this size, it quickly becomes apparent how the Multi-Pack flat-plate, herringbone design enhances performance.  Why is this important?  Simply stated, large units have large coalescers which are difficult to lift and maneuver for...
 
 
 
 





 
 


Model 750 gpm - 1000 gpm  (175 - 225 m3/h) - Above Ground Oil Water Separators






 
As the flow rates become larger, the importance of dedicated settling (solids) and rising (oil) zones become critical to obtain a truly non-fouling design. Not only do the Chimney Zones process oils and solids out of the coalescer, they naturally create an break in the coalescer plate, providing shorter plate widths in the flow direction. Shorter plate widths yield a lower 'equivalent diameter' which is a measure of how a coalescer plate configuration...
 
 
 
 





 
 


Model Over 1,000 gpm (225 m3/h) - Above Ground Oil Water Separators






 
Mercer supplies shop-fabricated units as large as can be shipped (up to 5,000 gpm or more). These are typically custom designed units with various sizes and shapes to best meet our client's field conditions. We also supply various flow configurations to maintain high efficiency and aide in maintenance procedures. Units in this size range are typically designed to have the wastewater internally split into two flows within the unit. Our 'split flow'...
 
 
 
 

Below Ground Oil Water Separators
Mercer supplies a line of high-performance cylindrical below-ground oil/water separators from 50-5,000 gpm (10-1,000 m3/h). Separators are available in carbon steel (single and double wall) with a variety of coatings including FRP and sti-P3. Mercer also offers a line of competitive below ground plastic units that are an ideal solution for blanket fleet installations, small wash bay needs, and anywhere competitive pricing is a concern.

Mercer International Inc. COMPLIANCE MASTER Oil Wa...
                    


Mercer International Inc. COMPLIANCE MASTER Oil Water SeparatorsListening to what our clients say is important as Mercer continues to develop its product lines. When it became apparent that the 'Status Quo' in oil/water separator design was no longer good enough for industry, we changed the 'rules' and simply designed a better mousetrap!Mercer's original designers had decades of experience as manufacturers reps in the oily wastewater treatment arena. They also understood the importance of ultimately supplying the real needs of their clients. As Mercer developed its line of high-performance Oil/Water Separators, the founders polled various end users extensively about what they liked, disliked, and what they really needed from their oil/water separators. The resulting innovative design is now a bench mark in the OWS industry. Mercer's new separator line incorporated many time-honored separator features (e.g. flat parallel coalescer plates) with some very unique innovations, making their design both high efficiency and low maintenance. A design that truly achieves both high-efficiency and low-maintenance is a very difficult proposition when solids are present in the wastewater. Mercer has elegantly accomplished this task: we introduce to you our innovative Multi-Pack™coalescer. When both high efficiency and low maintenance are achieved in one package, we call this a High-Performance separator.






(High) PerformanceMercer International is widely r...
                    


(High) PerformanceMercer International is widely recognized as being the highest performance coalescer separator available on the market. However, high efficiency is only one part of that equation. High performance is maintaining high efficiency for long stretches between required maintenance.Most separators designed for high efficiency require very high maintenance. Many manufactures add secondary mesh packs to help make up for a poorly designed coalescer—resulting in extremely high maintenance requirements. Conversely, separators designed for low maintenance greatly sacrifice performance, leaving the end user with compromised results. This is the 'tension' in coalescer design. Mercer International has mastered the primary coalescer design, allowing both high efficiency and low maintenance—plus the ability to customize in the field (translated: We Have Built a Better Mousetrap!). This is critical to end users that are committed to 'zero tolerance' in regard to exceeding their effluent limitations.At the heart of each Compliance Master™ oil water separator Mercer delivers to clients worldwide is theMulti-Pack Removable Plate Coalescer System - Learn More






ComplianceThe Compliance Master oil/water separato...
                    


ComplianceThe Compliance Master oil/water separator is Mercer International's flagship product line and is our most recognized development in the field of wastewater treatment. With the Clean Water Act of the 1970's in the U.S. came a new set of rules. The creation of oversight bodies and new benchmarks for acceptable wastewater effluent limits were long over due. With these new regulations came an enforcement body that drew its cross hairs around not only the biggest offenders, but those with the biggest purse strings as well.Mercer International was founded as a company to remove the gray area for its clients. 'Will it work?' was no longer a question that was accepted without significant review. It was about time a separator manufacturer brought the actual performance in parody with theoretical calculations. When the traditional tank manufactures failed to address the key design changes that needed to be made, Mercer designed and manufactured equipment to meet the new regulations instead of designing around another status quo unit. The result was 'piece of mind' for not only major utility, petro-chemical, and industrial companies and large transportation companies; but also piece of mind for the small automotive shops, and various small to medium industrial companies. Environmental consulting engineers often specify our oil/water separators because of its versatile design. Mercer builds standard units of all sizes (5-5,000 gpm) and of various configurations and styles. We sell to a wide array of clients in many industries.





                        Flexibility
                    


'We can do that', is what we like to say. Or you may hear us say 'No we don't think you need that. Have you considered this? . . . this is what we did for another client. . .'During the project review, flexibility means customization. Mercer has created many custom oil/water separators based on difficult wastewater applications, tight space limitations, and varied corrosive wastewater conditions, to name a few. Demanding applications demand custom solutions. Mercer carefully listens to (and on some occasions even challenges) the decision makers in the selection process from CEO, to engineer, to maintenance professional. Constantly seeking out and solving these technical problems has led Mercer to identify and incorporate certain design standards that are overlooked by the competition.Mercer Oil Water Separation Products»The Multi-Pack design allows flexibility that is impossible to obtain with other coalescer designs. For example, the plate gaps within the coalescer can be varied in order to fine-tune the separator to maximize efficiency. After the installation process, flexibility means the ability to handle unforeseen wastewater conditions, changes in effluent limitations, or a change in the amount of solids present in the wastewater. The Multi -Pack Removable Plate Coalescer System allows the end user to adjust to any 5/16' right angle gap, in the field, by simply adding or removing the smooth, flat coalescer plates. If a higher efficiency is required down the road, just add additional plates and maximize the efficiency of the coalscer by increasing plate surface area--without any modifications to the separator or the coalescer! Have an issue with solids fouling certain areas of the coalescer? Simply pull plates only in these areas and keep the higher efficiency throughout the rest of the pack. The Multi-Pack can be fine-tuned in the field to meet your effluent efficiency needs as well as the maintenance requirements.Another interesting way to utilize the adjustable plate feature is to keep tighter plate gaps toward to top of the coalescer pack, where there are typically fewer solids present, and larger plate gaps toward the bottom where solids concentrations are frequently higher.

This is critical to end users that are committed to 'zero tolerance' in regard to exceeding their effluent limitations.At the heart of each Compliance Master™ oil water separator Mercer delivers to clients worldwide is theMulti-Pack Removable Plate Coalescer System - Learn More






ComplianceThe Compliance Master oil/water separato...
                    


ComplianceThe Compliance Master oil/water separator is Mercer International's flagship product line and is our most recognized development in the field of wastewater treatment. With the Clean Water Act of the 1970's in the U.S. came a new set of rules. The creation of oversight bodies and new benchmarks for acceptable wastewater effluent limits were long over due. With these new regulations came an enforcement body that drew its cross hairs around not only the biggest offenders, but those with the biggest purse strings as well.Mercer International was founded as a company to remove the gray area for its clients. 'Will it work?' was no longer a question that was accepted without significant review. It was about time a separator manufacturer brought the actual performance in parody with theoretical calculations. When the traditional tank manufactures failed to address the key design changes that needed to be made, Mercer designed and manufactured equipment to meet the new regulations instead of designing around another status quo unit. The result was 'piece of mind' for not only major utility, petro-chemical, and industrial companies and large transportation companies; but also piece of mind for the small automotive shops, and various small to medium industrial companies. Environmental consulting engineers often specify our oil/water separators because of its versatile design. Mercer builds standard units of all sizes (5-5,000 gpm) and of various configurations and styles. We sell to a wide array of clients in many industries.





                        Flexibility
                    


'We can do that', is what we like to say. Or you may hear us say 'No we don't think you need that. Have you considered this? . . . this is what we did for another client. . .'During the project review, flexibility means customization. Mercer has created many custom oil/water separators based on difficult wastewater applications, tight space limitations, and varied corrosive wastewater conditions, to name a few. Demanding applications demand custom solutions. Mercer carefully listens to (and on some occasions even challenges) the decision makers in the selection process from CEO, to engineer, to maintenance professional. Constantly seeking out and solving these technical problems has led Mercer to identify and incorporate certain design standards that are overlooked by the competition.Mercer Oil Water Separation Products»The Multi-Pack design allows flexibility that is impossible to obtain with other coalescer designs. For example, the plate gaps within the coalescer can be varied in order to fine-tune the separator to maximize efficiency. After the installation process, flexibility means the ability to handle unforeseen wastewater conditions, changes in effluent limitations, or a change in the amount of solids present in the wastewater. The Multi -Pack Removable Plate Coalescer System allows the end user to adjust to any 5/16' right angle gap, in the field, by simply adding or removing the smooth, flat coalescer plates. If a higher efficiency is required down the road, just add additional plates and maximize the efficiency of the coalscer by increasing plate surface area--without any modifications to the separator or the coalescer! Have an issue with solids fouling certain areas of the coalescer? Simply pull plates only in these areas and keep the higher efficiency throughout the rest of the pack. The Multi-Pack can be fine-tuned in the field to meet your effluent efficiency needs as well as the maintenance requirements.Another interesting way to utilize the adjustable plate feature is to keep tighter plate gaps toward to top of the coalescer pack, where there are typically fewer solids present, and larger plate gaps toward the bottom where solids concentrations are frequently higher.

Mercer International Inc. Announces Joint Venture With Resolute Forest Products Inc. To Commercialize Sustainable New Biomaterial






GlobeNewswire



Jun 23, 2014 8:30 AM EDT













 


















































  About Performance BioFilaments Inc.   Performance BioFilaments Inc., a joint venture between Mercer International Inc. and Resolute Forest Products Inc., is focused on the development of commercial applications for cellulose filaments, one of the world's most exciting new biomaterials. Cellulose filaments can be used to enhance the performance characteristics of a wide variety of products. Derived from wood fiber – a renewable and natural resource – cellulose filaments optimize the strength, stability, flexibility and longevity of a variety of materials including composites, coatings and consumer products. For more information, please visit   www.performancebiofilaments.com .  About Mercer International Inc.  Mercer International Inc. is the world's largest producer of Northern Bleached Softwood Kraft ("NBSK") market pulp and has become a leader among forest products companies in embracing the bio-economy and maximizing value derived from residual forest resources. Mercer has three modern, large-scale pulp mills located in Germany (Rosenthal and Stendal), as well as BC, Canada (Celgar). The Company's total NBSK pulp production capacity is 1.54 million tonnes per year.  The mills utilize all parts of the wood they process to create not only pulp, but also valuable by-products. These by-products often provide renewable alternatives to traditionally petrochemical-based materials. For example, Mercer's mills have a combined green energy generation capacity of 305 MW. All of the mills are net exporters of energy, meaning they produce more energy than they consume. Biochemicals have become an increasingly important by-product of Mercer's pulping process, as well.  The Company's shares are listed on the NASDAQ Global Market (MERC) and on the Toronto Stock Exchange (MRI.U). For more information, please visit   www.mercerint.com .  About Resolute Forest Products Inc.  Resolute Forest Products Inc. is a global leader in the forest products industry with a diverse range of products, including newsprint, specialty papers, market pulp and wood products. Resolute owns or operates nearly 40 pulp and paper mills and wood products facilities in the United States, Canada and South Korea, and power generation assets in Canada. The shares of Resolute trade under the stock symbol RFP on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Toronto Stock Exchange. For more information, please visit   www.resolutefp.com .  The preceding includes forward looking statements which involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause the Company's actual results in future periods to differ materially from forecasted results. Words such as "expects", "anticipates", "projects", "intends", "designed", "will", "believes", "estimates", "may", "could" and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Among those factors which could cause actual results to differ materially are the following: the highly cyclical nature of the Company's business, raw material costs, the Company's level of indebtedness, competition, foreign exchange and interest rate fluctuations, the Company's use of derivatives, expenditures for capital projects, environmental regulation and compliance, disruptions to the Company's production, market conditions and other risk factors listed from time to time in the Company's SEC reports. CONTACT: APPROVED BY:                  Jimmy S.H. Lee         Chairman, CEO & President         (604) 684-1099                  David M. Gandossi         Executive Vice-President,         Chief Financial Officer & Secretary         (604) 684-1099
