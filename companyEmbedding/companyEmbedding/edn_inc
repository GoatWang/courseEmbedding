Assume that you have a resistive tee network embedded in an impenetrable potting material and you want to make a direct measurement of the value of one of those resistors. Since you can't access the center node, the other resistor(s) would seem to make that an impossible task, but it can be done. Read More...

Since you can't access the center node, the other resistor(s) would seem to make that an impossible task, but it can be done. Read More...

No. Although we sell the highest quality, non-GMO seeds, we also understand if you want to plant your own seeds!




question_answerAre your seeds organic and non-GMO?
            

Yes, you can trust us to only provide you with the best organic seeds. We are on a mission to bring healthy food to peoples' homes.




question_answerIs produce from ēdn gardens just as nutritious as organic store bought foods?
            

Your greens will be just as nutritious as their store bought counterparts - most likely even more!




question_answerIs ēdn committed to sustainability?

Plants


question_answerWhat plants can I grow in the gardens of ēdn?
You can grow almost any type of flower, herb or vegetable plant in our gardens. If you choose to plant seeds of a larger plant, keep in mind that you might need to repot the plants when they outgrow your ēdn garden. 


question_answerHow do plants grow with LEDs?
Did you know you could even grow plants with candle light (admitted, it wouldn't be too efficient)? Our LEDs provide your plants with an enhanced light spectrum that is optimized for your plants' growth.


question_answerHow do plants grow in the soil-less gardens?
Our awesome dirt-free 'soil' is inspired by NASA technology and provides an optimal living environment for plants. The 'soil' ensures that there's always enough room for your plants to breathe and to retrieve the right amount of water and plant food.

You'll only need to refill the water reservoir when you plant the seeds, and then recurringly around every two weeks. You'll know when to refill the water when the blue LED lights up.

Please don't add more than 2 pitchers of water. Overwatering happens when plants can't breath via the soil when it is submerged in water. Our gardens provide just enough water from below, minimizing the chance of overwatering your plants.

Please only use standard tap water with a normal pH level, or distilled water. Never use 'hard' water, which is common tapwater in the southwestern states. Your plants might turn yellow or won't grow well when you use the wrong water type because the dissolved minerals in the water can block the intake of nutrients.


question_answerHow much time does it take caring for my plants?
It should only take a few minutes each month. After planting your seeds, all you need to do is add water and plant food. And, of course, harvest your delicious foods or beautiful flowers!


question_answerHow long can the plants be left alone if I am traveling?
Most plants can be left alone for around two weeks.

With our soil-less gardens, you can easily lift the plants out of the tray and transplant without harming any roots.
