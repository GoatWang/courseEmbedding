The Funds' investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other important information about the investment company. Please read it carefully before investing. A hard copy of the prospectus can be requested by calling 1-800-966-4354.
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Small and medium-capitalization companies may have more limited liquidity and greater price volatility than large-capitalization companies. Investments in foreign securities may involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risk and differences in accounting methods. A non-diversified fund, one that may concentrate its assets in fewer individual holdings than a diversified fund, is more exposed to individual stock volatility than a diversified fund. A fund that concentrates its investments within one country, one sector, or a small group of industries, such as Japan, Technology, Financials or Natural Gas, may be subject to a higher degree of risk. Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. The risk is greater for longer-term debt securities. Investment by a fund in lower-rated and non-rated securities presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher-rated securities. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are subject to prepayment risk, which is the risk that the borrower will prepay some or all of the principal owed to the issuer. Funds that invest in pooled investment vehicles (including ETFs) may experience higher fees. The formula-based strategy employed by some Funds may cause those Funds to buy or sell securities at times when it may not be advantageous.

Roadmap to the Best and Worst Fund Styles
David Trainer0 Comments  There are no Attractive-rated investment styles. The primary driver behind the Neutral-or-worse ratings is poor portfolio management. Fund managers are simply not picking stocks well. More details in my article “A Cheap Fund Is Not Always a Good Fund”. Arti­cles on all style and sec­tor funds are here. Investors looking for the best style funds…

ETFs vs Mutual Funds: The Winner Is…
David Trainer0 Comments  The radically higher number of US equity mutual funds (4,700+) versus ETFs (380+) is not indicative of better stock selection from active management. On the contrary, the vast majority of actively-managed funds do not justify the higher fees they charge. They do not, in terms of stock selection and expected returns, add value versus passively managed benchmarks.

Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are subject to prepayment risk, which is the risk that the borrower will prepay some or all of the principal owed to the issuer. Funds that invest in pooled investment vehicles (including ETFs) may experience higher fees. The formula-based strategy employed by some Funds may cause those Funds to buy or sell securities at times when it may not be advantageous.

The Funds' investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other important information about the investment company. Please read it carefully before investing. A hard copy of the prospectus can be requested by calling 1-800-966-4354.
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Small and medium-capitalization companies may have more limited liquidity and greater price volatility than large-capitalization companies. Investments in foreign securities may involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risk and differences in accounting methods. A non-diversified fund, one that may concentrate its assets in fewer individual holdings than a diversified fund, is more exposed to individual stock volatility than a diversified fund. A fund that concentrates its investments within one country, one sector, or a small group of industries, such as Japan, Technology, Financials or Natural Gas, may be subject to a higher degree of risk. Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. The risk is greater for longer-term debt securities. Investment by a fund in lower-rated and non-rated securities presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher-rated securities. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are subject to prepayment risk, which is the risk that the borrower will prepay some or all of the principal owed to the issuer. Funds that invest in pooled investment vehicles (including ETFs) may experience higher fees. The formula-based strategy employed by some Funds may cause those Funds to buy or sell securities at times when it may not be advantageous.

Opinions expressed are subject to change at any time, are not guaranteed and should not be considered investment advice.
Performance data quoted represents past performance; past performance does not guarantee future results. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

Diversification does not assure a profit, nor does it protect against a loss in a declining market.

For Morningstar Ratings for the Small Cap Financial Fund and Large Cap Financial Fund, and Gas Utility Fund, click here. The
Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for
managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life
subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts)
with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual
funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is
calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts
for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more
emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance.  The
top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5%
receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars,
and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.  The Overall Morningstar Rating™ for a
managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures
associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar
Rating™ metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of
total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of
total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year
rating for 120 or more months of total returns.  While the 10-year overall
star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the
most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is
included in all three rating periods.  For Morningstar Percentile Rankings for the Equity and Income Fund, click here. Morningstar Percentile Ranking compares a fund’s Morningstar risk and return scores with all the funds in the same Category, where 1% = Best and 100% = Worst. Each Morningstar category average represents a universe of funds with similar objectives.
  

IBD’s SmartSelect composite rating combines all five IBD ratings (Technical Rating, Fundamental Rating, Attractiveness Rating, Group's Technical Rating and Group's Fundamental Rating) into 1-99 rating scale. Those stocks that earn a 99 score are deemed to have the best overall strength for investment and thus the most potential for a fair return on investment in the immediate future.  IBD Best Mutual Funds Criteria: Funds considered have at least $100 million in assets and at least 10 years old, beaten its benchmark for the past one, three, five and ten years.

Past performance does not guarantee future results. Fund managers named to the Barron’s list of the industry's top 100 have consistently outperformed their peers. The Barron's/Value Line annual rankings system awards points to managers who generate more stable returns and subtracts points from funds deemed too volatile. A manager with average performance and volatility gets a score of zero. Superior managers get positive scores commensurate with the value they’ve added to a fund’s performance on an annualized basis. Value Line first scanned 1,008 equity funds, screening out those with more than two lead managers and managers with less than three years’ tenure. The remaining funds were then organized by investment objective, and those with less than $200 million in assets were eliminated. 564 managers qualified to be ranked.




Unwavering commitment to our shareholders is a guiding principle at Hennessy Funds.  We strive to always deliver outstanding customer care, and we maintain a strong and dedicated Sales and Service team to serve our clients, shareholders and business partners.

The Funds' investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other important information about the investment company. Please read it carefully before investing. A hard copy of the prospectus can be requested by calling 1-800-966-4354.
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. Small and medium-capitalization companies may have more limited liquidity and greater price volatility than large-capitalization companies. Investments in foreign securities may involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risk and differences in accounting methods. A non-diversified fund, one that may concentrate its assets in fewer individual holdings than a diversified fund, is more exposed to individual stock volatility than a diversified fund. A fund that concentrates its investments within one country, one sector, or a small group of industries, such as Japan, Technology, Financials or Natural Gas, may be subject to a higher degree of risk. Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. The risk is greater for longer-term debt securities. Investment by a fund in lower-rated and non-rated securities presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher-rated securities. Mortgage- and asset-backed securities are subject to prepayment risk, which is the risk that the borrower will prepay some or all of the principal owed to the issuer. Funds that invest in pooled investment vehicles (including ETFs) may experience higher fees. The formula-based strategy employed by some Funds may cause those Funds to buy or sell securities at times when it may not be advantageous.
