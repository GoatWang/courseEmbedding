History and Structure
TradeLink started trading in 1979, and formed its DigiLog Capital LLC asset management unit in 1995, which allowed outside investors to participate alongside the firm's principals. Its first fund offered was the DigiLog Full Portfolio. As of Aug. 1, 2007, DigiLog had $744 million in assets under management. TradeLink carried out the first trade on the Chicago Climate Exchange in 2003.[2]

Product Development
TradeLink has an electronic trading interface in commodity options, financial futures and options, and currency futures and options at all major U.S. exchanges and most international ones. It is also a major participant in securities and over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives markets.[3] Tradelink has significantly reduced its presence on the floor as more and more trade has moved to the screen.
