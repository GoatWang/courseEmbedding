(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following management's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and the related notes thereto contained in this report. The management's discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Any statements that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. When used, the words "believe," "plan," "intend," "anticipate," "target," "estimate," "expect" and the like, and/or future tense or conditional constructions ("will," "may," "could," "should," etc.), or similar expressions, identify certain of these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those under "Risk Factors" in this Form 8-K, that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. The Company's actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report.  As a result of the Share Exchange and the change in business and operations of the Company, from engaging in the business of an e-commerce daily discount marketplace to the business of becoming a global, equity based crowdfunding platform, a discussion of the past, pre-Share Exchange financial results of Symbid Corp., is not pertinent, and under applicable accounting principles, the historical financial results of Symbid B.V., the wholly owned operating subsidiary of Symbid Holding B.V. and the accounting acquirer, prior to the Share Exchange are considered the historical financial results of the Company.  The following discussion highlights the Company's results of operations and the principal factors that have affected our financial condition, as well as our liquidity and capital resources for the periods described, and provides information that management believes is relevant for an assessment and understanding of the statements of financial condition and results of operations presented herein. The following discussion and analysis are based on the Company's audited financial statements contained in this Current Report, which we have prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. You should read this discussion and analysis together with such financial statements and the related notes thereto.  Basis of Presentation  The audited financial statements for our fiscal years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 include a summary of our significant accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with the discussion below. In the opinion of management, all material adjustments necessary to present fairly the results of operations for such periods have been included in these audited financial statements. All such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature.  Overview  Overview 2013  A new product was introduced to the market at the start of 2013 to balance our product portfolio and strengthen the focus on the core activity of matching online entrepreneurs and investors. Symbid Group licenses were being offered to partners wanting their own crowdfunding Group on the Symbid platform. Fees are typically lower as compared to fees charged for the white label platforms, lowering the barriers for new partners to enter the Symbid eco-system. Refocusing the product strategy to the core activity is the main reason for the total revenue for 2013 being lower compared to the 2012 period. However, we feel comfortable by this shift in the product strategy our product portfolio has become more balanced and focused. In addition to the Group product, we developed new corporate partnership products, with this product category we are taking first steps in offering crowdfunding services to large corporates. A corporate partnership deal consists of several other products being packaged into one deal, which over time, will result in more efficient sales cycles and a focus on building up a portfolio of partners we can scale up our services with. One of those crowdfunding related services is the valuation tool from Equidam Holding B.V. where we became a shareholder in August 2013. In September we raised $143,277 as Symbid B.V. in equity from one new investor, Sharpe Financial Communication, and current shareholders of Symbid B.V. The proceeds from this raise have been used as working capital and for PR services.  Overview 2014  During 2014 we have seen a significant increase in the equity-based crowdfunding volume of the business. In 2014 we added approximately 12,000 new users to our thriving community. As of December 31, 2014 we had 29,000 users within our community. As of December 31, 2014, Symbid has facilitated over $6.88 million in funding to innovative start-ups and SMEs. For the financial year 2014 the funding volume alone totaled approximately $ 4.5 million. During 2014 a total of 36 entrepreneurs were successfully funded through our equity-based crowdfunding platform.  The results of our crowdfunding business in 2014 were facilitated by the launch of a new version of our crowdfunding platform. The design, look and feel and user interaction of the platform significantly changed by the implemented improvements. 2014 has also proved to be the year of preparing new product roll-outs for the coming period. We acquired FAC B.V. in order to start offering monitoring services to the market. Also we have been investing in the preparation of the launch of our loan product offering. We aim at launching those products and services in the first half year of 2015, however there can be no assurance these goals will be achieved.  During 2015 we launched one product to the market, which relates to the Groups product we launched during 2013. In a collaboration with Farmersfunding we launched our Private Placement board within the Dutch market. The product features are comparable to the Group feature we offer on the crowdfunding platform. Closed group funding through an online platform, where within the Group functionality only equity-based crowdfunding could be offered, within the Private Placement board all types of product can be offered. In the latter Symbid is not taking care of the execution of the actual transaction between SME and investors. The corporate partnership product has been evolving over the past year into a model where corporates can become a partner in the Funding Network of Symbid. First corporate partnerships to be closed in 2015, however there can be no assurance this goal will be achieved.  Going Concern  The Company has suffered recurring losses, for 2014 a net loss of $2,822,000 (December 31, 2013, $1,260,196). As of December 31, 2014, the Company had cash on hand of $233,000, current liabilities to credit institutions of $118,000 and a working capital deficit of $456,000. The recurring losses raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The recoverability of a major portion of the recorded asset amounts shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet is dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which in turn, is dependent upon the Company's ability to raise capital and/or generate positive cash flows from operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets and classifications that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence.  Additionally, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in their report for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern.  Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our generating operating cash flow and raising capital sufficient to fund operations. We have discussed our strategy and plans relating to these matters elsewhere in this Annual Report although the consolidated financial statements included herein do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. We expect that with the successful closing of the PPO, which we commenced in October, 2014, we will be able to fund ongoing operations and accelerate our international expansion for the next nine (9) months. Our business strategy may not be successful in addressing these issues, however, and if we cannot continue as a going concern, our stockholders may lose their entire investment in us.  Strategy  During 2012, we developed a template model for our corporate crowdfunding platform. The pillars of this model are standardization, economies of scale and the concept "think global, act local." Through standardization, our core crowdfunding processes have been fully documented and can be easily rolled out in other markets. Other new crowdfunding related products and services can be incorporated under the same model, with the Netherlands being our test market, and new models can be copied from there to other markets. Our main revenue stream is based on a transaction based model, so in the end we require a certain scale to operate successfully. A scale which could best be fueled by making use of network effects.  The continued exponential growth of our core investment crowdfunding business in 2014 is the foundation on which The Funding Network is being built. This new, forward-thinking brand identity is rooted in our positioning at the heart of financial technology and reinforces the introduction of several new products and services starting the first quarter of 2015. February 2015 marks a crucial milestone in our strategic vision to provide the most efficient access to capital service worldwide as we add monitoring and deal-making tools to our online investment platform. During the start of the second quarter we aim at launching a debt based crowdfunding solution to the Dutch SME market. The Funding Network aims at giving small businesses direct access to all forms of finance, while offering investors full transparency on the potential risks and returns of their portfolio. Symbid is becoming the go-to platform for SME funding, connecting new and traditional sources of finance in one integrated network built around cutting-edge technology.  By expanding our product portfolio, market reach and revenue models by adding a monthly recurring revenue stream from monitoring services we intend to reach a break-even point in our cash flow by the end of 2015. For the international expansion separate funding will be required, which does imply we require a significant capital increase to realize this growth path and cover the related expected investments and operational losses. With the current PPO we intend to obtain the required capital for our next stage of the international roll-out in Europe, so other countries beyond Italy. By being quoted as Symbid Corp. on the OTC Bulletin Board and the OTC Markets QB Tier we intend to raise more capital from the markets in order to realize also the future stages of our growth path and start also operations in the United States once the JOBS-act has been implemented. Ultimately we intend to become the largest online Funding Network worldwide, however there can be no assurance this goal will be achieved.  Highlights  The following is a summary of our financial performance for the financial year 2014:  ? Consolidated revenue for the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 totaled approximately $276,325 and $79,430 respectively, an increase of over 248%.  ? For the twelve months ended December 31, 2014, over 96.8% of our total revenues during this period was attributable to core equity based crowdfunding activities.  ? For the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, total selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $2,151,679 and $427,103, respectively.  ? As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 we had 25 and 10 full-time employees, respectively.  Share Exchange and PPO closings  On December 6, 2013, we closed a Share Exchange pursuant to which the 19 shareholders of Symbid Holding B.V. sold all of their capital stock in Symbid Holding B.V. to us in exchange for 21,170,000 shares of our common stock, $0.001 par value per share. Concurrent with the closing of the Share Exchange, we completed a closing of a PPO in which we sold 3,089,736 units of our common stock and warrants, at a price of $0.50 per unit for a total consideration of $1,549,368.  On February 5, 2014, a second closing of the private placement offering was completed in which an additional 373,984 units were sold which generated gross proceeds of $186,987. In connection with the second closing, we incurred advisory and professional fees of $80,251, of which issuance costs of $7,750 were allocated to equity issuance costs and deducted from additional paid in capital.  On May 20, 2014, a third closing of the private placement offering was completed in which an additional 2,380,810 units were sold generating gross proceeds of $1,190,405. In connection with the third closing, we incurred advisory and professional fees of $81,724, none of which were allocated to equity issuance costs and deducted from additional paid- in capital.  2013 Equity Incentive Plan  Before the Share Exchange on December 6, 2013, the Board of Directors adopted and the stockholders approved, the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2013 Plan"), which provides for the issuance of incentive awards of up to 5,000,000 shares of common stock to officers, key employees, consultants and directors. On July 24, 2014 the Company issued an aggregate of 1,003,500 restricted stock units to certain employee and non- employees under the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (See for more detail Note 11 to the Financial Statements).  Shares Issued for Services  On December 8, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement with Fortion Holding B.V. and issued 1,500,000 shares of common stock valued at $645,000 for Credion's obligations under the agreement (see for more detail Note 16 to the Financial Statements).  Shares Issued for Asset Acquisition  On July 29, 2014, our wholly owned subsidiary Symbid Holding, a limited liability Corporation in the Netherlands, acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of FAC B.V. ("acquiree") in exchange for 2,750,000 shares of our restricted common stock. Acquiree owns a perpetual, worldwide, exclusive license to infrastructure technology upon which we intend to develop a platform to enable cloud based financing solutions for small and medium sized enterprises, expanding on our current equity based crowdfunding solutions in the Netherlands. FAC B.V. was formed by FAC 2 B.V. for the specific purpose of holding the license and has no customers, employees, operations or revenues. Acquiree's only assets are its proprietary software and technology. Prior to our acquisition of Acquiree, (i) an indirect employee of ours who is a member of Symbid B.V. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Symbid Holding B.V.) management and is also the managing director of a 5% shareholder of ours indirectly owned 20% of Acquiree; (ii) an indirect employee of ours who is a member of Symbid B.V. management indirectly owned 20% of Acquiree; and (iii) a minority shareholder of ours indirectly owned 10% of Acquiree. (See for more detail Note 7 to the Financial Statements).  Incorporation of Symbid Germany GmbH  In August 2014 we incorporated in Germany our subsidiary Symbid Germany GmbH. We contributed capital of $7,749 to this subsidiary which is currently an entity without operations. During 2015 Symbid Germany GmbH is expected to start operations, however there can be no assurance this goal will be achieved.  Incorporation Symbid Italia SPA  On February 20, 2015, Symbid Italia SPA ("Symbid Italia"), an Italian corporation created to develop the business of equity crowdfunding in Italy, was formed by our wholly owned subsidiary, Symbid Holding B.V., together with Banca Sella Holding SPA ("Banca Sella") and Marco Bicocchi Pichi. Through Symbid Italia, we intend to create a new online funding platform, based on our existing crowdfunding technology, in which Italian investors and entrepreneurs can connect, fund and grow together and to digitalize financial services for Italian small and medium enterprises. Symbid Italia represents the first stage of the European roll-out of our crowdfunding platform outside of The Netherlands. In connection with the formation of Symbid Italia, we paid ?250,000 for a 50.1% ownership interest. Banca Sella holds a 29.94% ownership interest and Mr. Pichi holds a 19.96% interest. The roles and rights of the founding shareholders in managing and developing Symbid Italia are set forth in a 5-year Subscription and Shareholders' Agreement signed in December 2014.  Gambitious interest sale  On February 9, 2015, we sold our remaining 12% indirect interest in Gambitious B.V. for ?18,000 due to Gambitious B.V. having incurred continuing losses in 2014, Gambitious B.V. having switched its business focus to that of the publishing of games, Gambitious B.V. requiring capital contributions from its existing owners and Gambitious B.V. no longer constituting a strategic fit with our evolving operations.  Critical Accounting Estimates  We regularly evaluate the accounting estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the Notes to our audited financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.  We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.  Revenue Recognition  In 2014 we generated substantially all our revenue from administration and success fees from transactions on the Crowdfunding platform. Revenue from these transactions is accounted for at the moment an investment is made or a proposition is successfully funded. There is no credit risk since the fees are collected directly at the moment that the transaction takes place on the platform.  At the start of a funding campaign, the entrepreneur signs a contract with Symbid pursuant to which he or she agrees to pay Symbid a success fee once a successful fund raising campaign for that entrepreneur closes. Once the funding campaign has closed, Symbid's success fee is transferred by Intersolve, the third party banking entity that holds all funds in escrow until closing, and the net proceeds of the funding are transferred by Intersolve to the entrepreneur. Upon completion of the funding campaign on Symbid's platform, services delivered under the contract with the entrepreneur have been and Symbid recognizes its success fee revenues at the time the campaign's proceeds have been simultaneously transferred to the Company. Also, because the success fee percentage is stated in the contract with the entrepreneur prior to the start of the funding campaign, Symbid believes that this amount is fixed and, assuming the successful conclusion of the funding campaign, collectible from Intersolve. This revenue recognition policy complies with ASC 605-10-S99-1 in that it is based on written agreements with the entrepreneurs, contractual services have been completed, pricing is fixed and determinable based on agreements with the customer and collectability is reasonably assured as revenues are forwarded directly by Intersolve.  Effectively Symbid has no refund policy. The cash which is collected from investors is held in a third party bank account with Intersolve, which cannot be used or accessed by Symbid. With funds in this bank account, an investor buys crowdfunding credits which are accounted for in an electronic wallet and allocated by the investor to the investor's funding projects of choice. Allocated funds can only be refunded to an investor from his electronic wallet if a particular project is not fully funded and the funding campaign is terminated. In that situation the investor project allocated funds are credited by Intersolve back to his electronic wallet, from where he can invest again in another project or request a refund of his money from Intersolve, net of an administration fee of approximately $21 (?20). Symbid receives 25% of this administrative fee. At each year end, InterSolve marks the processed and completed refunds and, after this internal process, InterSolve sends a credit invoice to Symbid, recognizing the refund administration costs as revenues to be paid out to Symbid. At the moment Symbid receives the credit invoice from InterSolve stating the total number of refunds and the refund administration costs to be paid out to Symbid, we recognize these refunds as revenue. As of December 1, 2014 we changed our terms and made the refunds to bank accounts for investors free of any charge, however InterSolve is currently charging us $16 (? 15) for each refund by an investor.  Other revenue is generated by licensing the platform to third parties. Revenue is accounted for on a monthly basis for the agreed monthly licensed fee. There is limited credit risk. If the monthly licensed fee is not paid we are entitled to set the platform offline.  As of the first quarter 2015 we will introduce two new revenue streams. An application fee for each entrepreneur registering at the Funding Network and an ongoing monitoring fee for each entrepreneur successfully funded within the Funding Network. Since those revenue streams will be applicable only as of the first quarter 2015 we will not discuss the revenue recognition policies here in more detail.  We provide a description of the different types of revenue below.  Create process related revenues  ? Application fees - $370 (exclusive of VAT) for every entrepreneur applying for funding on The Funding Network, with part of such fee being utilized to purchase advisory services from Credion in its capacity as a preferred supplier  Matchmaking related revenues  Public funding  ? Transaction fees - For every payment transaction to a Symbid wallet or investment in an investment proposition, a fee is charged to the investor.  degree 2.5% Fee (exclusive of VAT) charged for investments up to $5,250  degree 1% Fee (exclusive of VAT) charged for investments exceeding $5,250  ? Refund Fee -If an investor requests a refund from the "Online Wallet" a fee is charged to the investor in the amount of approximately $21 (? 20), of which the Company will receive approximately $5. As of December 1, 2014 the Company will be charged $16 for each refund by an investor, while for the investor a refund has become free of any charge.  ? Success fee - When reaching a funding target, 5% (exclusive of VAT) of the target capital is charged to the target company.  Private funding  ? Placement fee - When reaching a funding target, $265 (exclusive of VAT) as flat fee is being charged to that target company.  Monitoring related revenues  ? Monitoring fees - The financier will pay us a monthly fee of $10 (exclusive of VAT) for one monitoring portal access. Entrepreneurs will be charged a fee of $320 (exclusive VAT) for a monitoring start package which includes three portal accesses for one year.  Licensing related revenues  In addition to sublicensing the crowdfunding platform technology to Symbid Coöperatie U.A., Symbid intends to sublicense the platform technology in the forms discussed below to others in The Netherlands and to country partners as part of its internalization strategy.  ? White label licenses - Symbid offers stand-alone and white label versions of its crowdfunding platform to partners, companies and other (educational) organizations. Stand-alone versions of the crowdfunding platform operate independently in a closed environment while white label versions are interconnected with the Symbid crowdfunding platform allowing for interaction with Symbid platform users. Target net revenue per partner is $10,000 for the set-up and a yearly license fee to cover maintenance costs.  ? Software licenses - Symbid offers exclusive licenses within a country to use the Symbid legal and technology infrastructure. Set-up fees are at a minimum of $25,000 and yearly license fees will be offered for a minimum of $10,000 per year;  ? Affiliate and Group licenses - Symbid offers owners of existing communities or groups a crowdfunding service so they do not require their own crowdfunding infrastructure. Prices range from $530 to $2,500 on a yearly basis.  In general, and in compliance with ASC 605-10-S99-1, revenue is recognized when the services have been rendered and upfront payments are deferred until services have been rendered.  Concentrations of Credit Risk  The Company has cash balances at financial institutions located in the Netherlands. Balances at financial institutions in the Netherlands may, from time to time, exceed insured limits. Currently the insured limit amounts to EUR 100,000 ($ 122,000). We have not experienced any losses in such accounts.  Accounts Receivable: Customer accounts typically are collected within a short period of time, and based on its assessment of current conditions and its experience collecting such receivables, management believes it has no significant risk related to its concentration within its accounts receivable.  Components of Results of Operations  Revenues  We generate our revenues partly from crowdfunding related fees like administration fees and success fees and for the other part from software license fees.  Research and development  Research and development expenses consist primarily of fees we are being charged for developing the source code of the software platform enabling us to build new products as well as improve existing products. We expense substantially all of our research and development costs as they are incurred.  Selling, General and Administrative  Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries for our executives as well as our finance, legal, human resources, and other administrative employees. In addition, general and administrative expenses include outside consulting, legal and accounting services, and facilities and other supporting overhead costs.  Distinct Characteristics of The Dutch Model  Symbid B.V. has a variable interest in Symbid Coöperatie U.A. Symbid Coöperatie U.A. licenses from Symbid B.V. its online crowdfunding platform in exchange for 100% of the administration fees and success fees earned by Symbid Coöperatie U.A. In addition, Symbid Coöperatie U.A. has entered into a perpetual platform management service agreement with Symbid B.V. for customer support, software updates and content management system control for approximately $6,000 per year. The management team of Symbid Coöperatie U.A. is the same as the management team . . .  Mar 25, 2015  (c) 1995-2015 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  The following management's discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the historical financial statements and the related notes thereto contained in this report. The management's discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Any statements that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. When used, the words "believe," "plan," "intend," "anticipate," "target," "estimate," "expect" and the like, and/or future tense or conditional constructions ("will," "may," "could," "should," etc.), or similar expressions, identify certain of these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including those under "Risk Factors" in this Form 10-K, that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. The Company's actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors. The Company does not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report.  The following discussion highlights the Company's results of operations and the principal factors that have affected our financial condition, as well as our liquidity and capital resources for the periods described, and provides information that management believes is relevant for an assessment and understanding of the statements of financial condition and results of operations presented herein. The following discussion and analysis are based on the Company's audited financial statements contained in this Annual Report, which we have prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. You should read this discussion and analysis together with such financial statements and the related notes thereto.  Basis of Presentation  The audited financial statements for our fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 include a summary of our significant accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with the discussion below.  Overview 2016  To mitigate the conditions that raised substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern management sought out new and current strategic institutional investors. However, the Company was unable to raise additional funds during the first quarter of 2016. To avoid bankruptcy due to the cash flow position of the Company, management decided to implement a cost reduction program during the second quarter of 2016. The following cost reduction actions have been successfully implemented and have provided a positive impact on the cost structure of the Company:  ?  During the second half of 2016, the Company was still unable to raise additional capital from investors and was forced to enter settlement agreements with its creditors and note holders to restructure the Company. Because of the restructuring, the Company curtailed certain operations and changed its business focus from the operation of online funding platforms and the provision of software solutions for SMEs in the alternative financing market to the licensing of available software packages that the Company owns and licenses.  In addition to the measures implemented in the first nine months of 2016, the Company also implemented the following cost reductions in connection with the restructuring during the fourth quarter of 2016:  ?  ?  ?  As the result of the restructuring, the Company's crowdfunding platform in the Netherlands is now operated through Symbid Coop. The Company previously controlled and operated Symbid Coop through corporate governance but as the result of the restructuring, Symbid Coop has become an independent entity. Because the Company no longer has the resources to continue the software development of the online funding platform, Symbid Coop took over the development of software for the crowdfunding platform during the fourth quarter of 2016 in order to remain compliant under the laws and regulations of The Netherlands. Symbid Coop has, in return for reimbursing the further development of the software, been granted a non-exclusive license to the intellectual property from IP Foundation in order to continue crowdfunding operations in The Netherlands. The Company will continue to hold an identical non-exclusive license to the intellectual property of the crowdfunding platform whereby we will be allowed to use the most up to date versions of the software and other intellectual property.  On December 9, 2016, the Company entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement to issue shares constituting upon issuance 80% of its outstanding shares in consideration for the cancellation of $86,456 due from the Company to the subscriber, a cash payment of $43,614 to be used to pay off Company debts to third parties and the subscribers commitment to fund certain future operating expenses of the Company.  Going Concern  The Company suffered recurring losses during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, of $1,507,652 and $2,299,275, respectively. At December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company had a working capital deficit of $11,371 and working capital of $164,209, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, the Company had cash on hand of $9,677. The recurring losses raise substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern. The recoverability of a major portion of the recorded asset amounts shown in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet is dependent upon continued operations of the Company, which in turn, is dependent upon the Company's ability to raise capital and/or generate positive cash flows from operations. The financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of recorded assets and classifications that might be necessary in the event the Company cannot continue in existence.  Additionally, our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in their report for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 regarding concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern.  Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our generating operating cash flow and raising capital sufficient to fund operations. We have discussed our strategy and plans relating to these matters elsewhere in this Annual Report although the consolidated financial statements included herein do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. On December 9, 2016, we signed a Securities Purchase Agreement under which the subscriber has agreed to fund ongoing operation expenses of the Company until such time that the Company can independently fund its operations or until the Company completes an acquisition, business combination or similar transaction with an operating entity which results in a change of control of the Company. Our business strategy may not be successful in addressing these issues, however, and if we cannot continue as a going concern, our stockholders may lose their entire investment in us.  Strategy  Our revised business model requires fewer employees, advisors and consultants and is more economical to operate. The Company has developed several software products suitable for the alternative market which it will continue to offer to third parties. Such products and related services include white label versions of crowdfunding software for investor groups and monitoring software to provide investors with ongoing insight into the performance of SMEs to which they have loaned money. Related licensing fees and subscription agreements may include set fees and yearly contribution fees.  The Company's goal is to substantially reduce and eliminate its debt while continuing to operate its business and negotiate a possible acquisition or other business combination with another operating entity. There can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in this endeavor or that if a business combination is consummated that it will be on favorable terms. In the interim, the Company will continue forward with its ongoing operations under the revised business model.  Highlights  The following is a summary of our financial performance for the financial year 2016:  ?  ?  ?  ?  Share Exchange and PPO closings  On December 6, 2013, we closed a Share Exchange pursuant to which the 19 shareholders of Symbid Holding B.V. sold all of their capital stock in Symbid Holding B.V. to us in exchange for 21,170,000 shares of our common stock, $0.001 par value per share. Concurrent with the closing of the Share Exchange, we completed a closing of a PPO in which we sold 3,089,736 units of our common stock and warrants, at a price of $0.50 per unit for a total consideration of $1,549,368. On February 5, 2014, a second closing of the private placement offering was completed in which an additional 373,984 units were sold which generated gross proceeds of $186,987. In connection with the second closing, we incurred advisory and professional fees of $80,251, of which issuance costs of $7,750 were allocated to equity issuance costs and deducted from additional paid in capital. On May 20, 2014, a third closing of the private placement offering was completed in which an additional 2,380,810 units were sold generating gross proceeds of $1,190,405. In connection with the third closing, we incurred advisory and professional fees of $81,724, none of which were allocated to equity issuance costs and deducted from additional paid- in capital.  On January 28, 2015, we completed the initial closing under a private placement offering in which we offered shares of our common stock at a purchase price of $0.50 per share. In connection therewith, we sold 1,248,232 shares for aggregate proceeds of $624,116. Effective June 30, 2015, we sold an additional 200,000 shares for aggregate proceeds of $100,000 and completed the offering.  On July 14, 2015 and September 8, 2015, we closed on the sale of $250,000 and $1,250,000, respectively, in principal amount of 8% unsecured convertible promissory notes (the "Notes"). Subject to earlier prepayment or conversion, the Notes were scheduled to mature three years from issuance. Interest was payable on the first, second and third anniversaries of the issuance date. At any time after issuance, the holders could, at their option, convert all or a portion of the principal and interest then due into shares of common stock at a price of $0.25 per share. On July 14, 2015, we received conversion notices from four persons holding an aggregate of $190,000 in principal amount of Notes of their determination to convert all of such principal into an aggregate of 760,000 shares and subsequently issued such shares. The balance of the Notes were terminated on November 15, 2016 pursuant to Note Termination and Conversion Agreements.  On June 1, 2016, we closed on the sale of $550,000 in principal amount of 8% unsecured convertible promissory notes (the "Notes") to three persons. Subject to earlier prepayment or conversion, the Notes were scheduled to mature three years from issuance. Interest was payable on the first, second and third anniversaries of the issuance date. If, during the term of the Notes, we completed an equity offering (a "Qualified Offering") for gross proceed of not less than $1,500,000, the holders could, at their option, convert all or a portion of the principal and interest then due on the Notes into shares of our common stock at a price per share equal to 50% of the price at which our common stock was sold in the Qualified Offering. The Notes were terminated on November 15, 2016 pursuant to Note Termination and Conversion Agreements.  2013 Equity Incentive Plan  Before the Share Exchange on December 6, 2013, our Board of Directors adopted and our stockholders approved, the 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2013 Plan"), which provides for the issuance of incentive awards of up to 5,000,000 shares of common stock to officers, key employees, consultants and directors.  Shares Issued for Services  On December 8, 2014, the Company entered into an agreement with Fortion Holding B.V. and issued 1,500,000 shares of common stock valued at $645,000 for Credion's obligations under the agreement.  Shares Issued for Asset Acquisition  On July 29, 2014, our wholly owned subsidiary Symbid Holding, a limited liability Corporation in the Netherlands, acquired all the issued and outstanding shares of FAC B.V. ("acquiree") in exchange for 2,750,000 shares of our restricted common stock. Acquiree owns a perpetual, worldwide, exclusive license to infrastructure technology upon which we intend to develop a platform to enable cloud based financing solutions for SMEs, expanding on our current equity based crowdfunding solutions in the Netherlands. FAC B.V. was formed by FAC 2 B.V. for the specific purpose of holding the license and has no customers, employees, operations or revenues. Acquiree's only assets are its proprietary software and technology. Prior to our acquisition of Acquiree, (i) an indirect employee of ours who is a member of Symbid B.V. (a wholly owned subsidiary of Symbid Holding B.V.) management and is also the managing director of a 5% shareholder of ours indirectly owned 20% of Acquiree; (ii) an indirect employee of ours who is a member of Symbid B.V. management indirectly owned 20% of Acquiree; and (iii) a minority shareholder of ours indirectly owned 10% of Acquiree. (See for more detail Note 7 to the Financial Statements).  Incorporation of Symbid Germany GmbH  In August 2014 we incorporated in Germany our subsidiary Symbid Germany GmbH. We contributed capital of $7,749 to this subsidiary which is currently an entity without operations.  Incorporation Symbid Italia SPA  On February 20, 2015, Symbid Italia SPA ("Symbid Italia"), an Italian corporation created to develop the business of equity crowdfunding in Italy, was formed by our wholly owned subsidiary, Symbid Holding B.V., together with Banca Sella Holding SPA ("Banca Sella") and Marco Bicocchi Pichi. Through Symbid Italia, we intended to create a new online funding platform, based on our existing crowdfunding technology, in which Italian investors and entrepreneurs could connect, fund and grow together and to digitalize financial services for Italian SMEs. In connection with the formation of Symbid Italia, we paid ?250,000 for a 50.1% ownership interest. Banca Sella held a 29.94% ownership interest and Mr. Pichi held a 19.96% interest.  From the date of formation through December 31, 2015, Symbid Italia incurred operating losses, of approximately $118,000. Based thereon and following an extensive review of the prospects of Symbid Italia developing profitable operations in the near future and beyond, the board of directors and shareholders of Symbid Italia determined that further investment in Symbid Italia was not warranted. This conclusion was based upon an assessment of the then current and expected medium term Italian equity crowdfunding market, the view that the current European regulatory framework for equity crowdfunding reflects a country by country market rather than a pan European market which greatly limits expected synergies and economies of scale and because the Italian equity crowdfunding regulations restrict the ability to attract non-domestic investors. At the direction of the Symbid Italia board of directors, a special Symbid Italia shareholder meeting was held on April 29, 2016, at which it was determined to liquidate Symbid Italia and return the residual capital to the Symbid Italia shareholders. On May 26, 2016, Symbid Italia was liquidated and we received proceeds of $44,744 and recognized a loss on derecognition of $2,986. The loss represents the difference between the fair value of the proceeds received, the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interest and the carrying amount of Symbid Italia's net assets at May 26, 2016.  Gambitious interest sale  On February 9, 2015, we sold our remaining 12% indirect interest in Gambitious B.V. for ?18,000 due to Gambitious B.V. having incurred continuing losses in 2014, Gambitious B.V. having switched its business focus to that of the publishing of games, Gambitious B.V. requiring capital contributions from its existing owners and Gambitious B.V. no longer constituting a strategic fit with our evolving operations.  December 9, 2016 Securities Purchase Agreement  On December 9, 2016 we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with CKR Law LLP ("CKR"), pursuant to which we issued 149,863,484 shares of our restricted common stock to CKR and its designees for (i) the cancellation of an aggregate of $86,456 due from the Company to CKR for legal services and expense reimbursements; (ii) a cash payment of $43,614 to be used to pay an aggregate of $37,614 to creditors of the Company, including payments required to enable the filing of our September 30, 2016 Quarterly Report; and (iii) the commitment of CKR to fund, to the extent future net revenues of the Company prove insufficient, additional operating expenses of the Company necessary to ensure its continuing operation and existence until such time that the Company can fund operations independently or until the Company completes an acquisition, business continuation, or similar transaction with an operating entity in a transaction that results in a change of control.  Critical Accounting Estimates  We regularly evaluate the accounting estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements. A complete summary of these policies is included in the Notes to our audited financial statements. In general, management's estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ from those estimates made by management.  We believe that of our significant accounting policies, which are described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, the following accounting policies involve a greater degree of judgment and complexity. Accordingly, these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.  Revenue Recognition  In 2014 we generated substantially all our revenue from administration and success fees from transactions on the Crowdfunding platform. Revenue from these transactions is accounted for at the moment an investment is made or a proposition is successfully funded. Until the end of year 2015 there has been no credit risk since the success fees were collected directly at the moment that the transaction takes place on the platform. As of January 2016 we had to change the policy for collecting the success fees and there will be a credit risk going forward. Administration fees have no credit risk since the fees are collected directly at the moment the transaction takes place on the platform.  At the start of a funding campaign, the entrepreneur signs a contract with Symbid pursuant to which he or she agrees to pay Symbid a success fee once a successful fund raising campaign for that entrepreneur closes. Once the funding campaign has closed, Symbid's success fee is transferred by Intersolve, the third party banking entity that holds all funds in escrow until closing, and the net proceeds of the funding are transferred by Intersolve to the notary or directly to the entrepreneur. Upon completion of the funding campaign on Symbid's platform, services delivered under the contract with the entrepreneur have been completed and Symbid recognizes its success fee revenues at the time the campaign has been closed successfully. Also, because the success fee percentage is stated in the contract with the entrepreneur prior to the start of the funding campaign, Symbid believes that this amount is fixed and, assuming the successful conclusion of the funding campaign, collectible from the entrepreneur. This revenue recognition policy complies with ASC 605-10-S99-1 in that it is based on written agreements with the entrepreneurs, contractual services have been completed, pricing is fixed and determinable based on agreements with the customer and collectability is reasonably assured as the customers of Symbid have just received their new funding.  Effectively Symbid has the following refund policy. The cash which is collected from investors is held in a third party bank account with Intersolve, which cannot be used or accessed by Symbid. With funds in this bank account, an investor buys crowdfunding credits which are accounted for in an electronic wallet and allocated by the investor to the investor's funding projects of choice. Allocated funds can only be refunded to an investor from his electronic wallet if a particular project is not fully funded and the funding campaign is terminated. In that situation the investor project allocated funds are credited by Intersolve back to his electronic wallet, from where he can invest again in another project or request a refund of his money from Intersolve. Investors can refund to their bank accounts free of any charge, however InterSolve is currently charging us $15.5 (?15) for each refund by an investor.  Other revenue is generated by licensing the platform to third parties. Revenue is accounted for on a monthly basis for the agreed monthly licensed fee. There is limited credit risk. If the monthly licensed fee is not paid, we are entitled to set the platform offline.  We provide a description of the different types of revenue below.  Create process related revenues  ?  Matchmaking related revenues  Public funding (Not applicable after October 2016)  ?  ?  ?  Private funding  ?  Monitoring related revenues  ?  Licensing related revenues  Symbid may sublicense the platform technology in the forms discussed below in The Netherlands and to country partners.  ?  ?  ?  Concentrations of Credit Risk  The Company has cash balances at financial institutions located in the Netherlands. Balances at financial institutions in the Netherlands may, from time to time, exceed insured limits. Currently the insured limit amounts to EUR 100,000 ($105,252). We have not experienced any losses in such accounts.  Accounts Receivable: Customer accounts typically are collected within a short period of time, and based on its assessment of current conditions and its experience collecting such receivables, management believes it has a minimal risk related to its concentration within its accounts receivable.  Components of Results of Operations  Revenues  We generated our revenues partly from crowdfunding related fees like administration fees and success fees and for the other part from revenues from The Funding Network.  Research and development  Research and development expenses consist primarily of fees we are being charged for developing the source code of the software platform enabling us to build new products as well as improve existing products. We expense substantially all of our research and development costs as they are incurred.  Selling, General and Administrative  Our selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of legal and accounting services and other supporting overhead costs.  Distinct Characteristics of The Dutch Model  Symbid B.V. had until November 2016 a variable interest in Symbid Co�peratie U.A. Symbid Co�peratie U.A. licensed from Symbid B.V. its online crowdfunding platform in exchange for 100% of the administration fees and success fees earned by Symbid Co�peratie U.A. In addition, Symbid Co�peratie U.A. has entered into a . . .  Mar 31, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

History[edit]
Early years[edit]
In 2007, Symbid's founders Robin Slakhorst and Korstiaan Zandvliet met while studying Entrepreneurship & New Business Venturing MSc at Rotterdam School of Management.[1] They have stated that witnessing classmates fail to start their own businesses post-graduation due to a lack of funding was the main inspiration behind Symbid.[citation needed]
Between 2007 and 2010 Zandvlliet and Slakhorst coordinated a fiscal-legal structure allowing non-accredited investors to invest online in start-ups and small businesses. While a number of crowdfunding platforms began to appear online from 2006 onwards, these were associated with creative projects and rewards or donation-based crowdfunding. Few countries had introduced formal equity crowdfunding legislation at this time.[2] Symbid was founded in April 2011 as one of the first equity crowdfunding platforms worldwide.[3]
Symbid was formally incorporated in Utrecht, the Netherlands, as a cooperative entity (Coöperatie) in accordance with Dutch law. A cooperative structure means Symbid is able to complete investment transactions online and store invested capital in a separate third-party (trust) account as an electronically stored monetary value (e-money).[4] As of March 2015, Intersolve, a company operating under license as an electronic money institution and supervised by the De Nederlandsche Bank and the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets, was responsible for managing this trust account.[5]
In November 2011, Symbid was granted the Shell LiveWIRE 2011 Audience Award alongside a cash prize after receiving 40% the online vote.[6]
Expansion[edit]
During 2012 Symbid established itself as one of several platforms in the rapidly expanding European equity crowdfunding industry.[7]
Symbid became involved in coordinating Dutch crowdfunding legislation at this time, in addition to co-founding initiatives aimed at improving transparency and platform standards within the equity crowdfunding industry. These initiatives include the Crowdfunding Accreditation for Platform Standards (CAPS) in conjunction with Crowdsourcing.org and the European Crowdfunding Network (ECN), a Europe-wide organisation involved in policy discussion and public opinion-building. Symbid is also a member of EBAN, the European Trade Association for Business Angels, Seed Funds and Early Stage Market Players.
Between 2011 and 2013 Symbid grew in size, hiring campaign managers to assist entrepreneurs in their equity crowdfunding efforts. In October 2012, Forbes named Symbid as one of the companies most likely to profit from the pending legalization of equity crowdfunding in the United States in accordance with the U.s. JOBS Act.[8]
Ownership interests[edit]
From 2012 onwards, Symbid has maintained ownership interests in several affiliated companies, including Gambitious Coöperatie U.A. and 12% of Gambitious B.V.—the Dutch divisions of crowd funding and video game publishing company Gambitious Digital Entertainment, the online business valuation tool Equidam, and the initiative funded by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, which operates a tool which enables entrepreneurs to present critical business information to investors in a standardized format, namely Kredietpaspoort, through its parent company, Symbid Corp.[9]
Going public[edit]
On December 6, 2013 Symbid, through its parent company Symbid Corp., acquired a public listing in the United States on OTCQB Markets. As of July 2014, Symbid became one of the first publicly traded crowdfunding platforms worldwide.[10] In addition to going public, Symbid Corp. conducted a private placement offering (PPO), raising a gross total of (US)$2,926,695.[11] In accordance with this public listing, Symbid Corp. opened offices in New York City, United States.[12]
Further expansion & relocation[edit]
In February 2014 Symbid introduced a new user interface to its crowdfunding platform. Early 2014 saw Symbid feature several high-profile campaigns on its equity crowdfunding platform including Greendaddy which raised $333,960 (€245,000) in 47 hours in May 2014, setting a new record for the Dutch crowdfunding industry.[13] Other prominent campaigns included the Archimedes - a wind turbine research and development company.[14] - and Bidroom, a hotel booking platform on which hotels bid directly for guests.[15]




Symbid HQ in the Rotterdam Science Tower


Symbid relocated to its current headquarters in the Erasmus Centre for Entrepreneurship in the Rotterdam Science Tower in March 2014.[16]
Later in 2014, Symbid signed a cooperation agreement with A-Film Benelux, whereby Symbid will fund upcoming Dutch movie titles including ‘De Surprise’ from Oscar-winning director Mike van Diem.[17] In September of that same year, Symbid announced its equity crowdfunding platform had passed the €5 million funding milestone.[18]
The launch of The Funding Network[edit]
Symbid and financial advisory firm Credion signed a partnership agreement in December 2014, creating the largest Dutch online funding platform by transaction volume.[19] The partnership sees Credion using the Symbid platform to connect its nationwide network of investors and entrepreneurs, combining alternative and traditional sources of funding.[20] Credion Director Carlo van der Weg described the partnership as “streamlining the way in which entrepreneurs find that crucial investment." [21] Although not revealed at the time, this partnership was the precursor to the launch of The Funding Network in March 2015.[citation needed]
In March, 2015, Symbid relaunched its website and rebranded as Symbid, The Funding Network. Previously an equity crowdfunding platform, as of March 2015 Symbid began offering other financial products and services for start-ups and small businesses including financial advice, monitoring and traditional and alternative financing options.[22] In addition to a redesigned website, Symbid released a new monitoring product based on XBRL data.
As of March 2015, Symbid claims to have connected 30,000 private (crowdfunding) investors and 40 institutional investors to The Funding Network, plus other online funding platforms active in niche industries, such as FarmersFunding.[23] Following the launch, on 24 March Symbid and Economic Board Utrecht (EBU) announced a partnership to provide local, sustainable initiatives with loan capital via The Funding Network. EBU has committed $1 million in growth capital to entrepreneurs on The Funding Network in 2015.[24]
International expansion[edit]
Symbid announced the incorporation of Symbid Italia on 10 March 2015, in partnership with Gruppo Banca Sella. The launch of Symbid Italia represents the first international expansion of the Symbid equity crowdfunding platform.[25] Although connected to The Funding Network, Symbid Italia will function purely as an equity crowdfunding platform. Marco Bicocchi Pichi, Italian Business Angel of the Year 2014, occupies the role of Managing Director.[26] The partnership between Symbid and Gruppo Banca Sella involves Symbid's use of the banking group's payment solutions, banking services and network. In 2016, Symbid Italia was deemed economically inviable and on April 29, 2016, a shareholders meeting determined to liquidate Symbid Italia.[27]
Financial troubles[edit]
In 2014 and 2015 Symbid reported low turnover ($267,358 and $282,155 respectively) and a net losses of $2,821,794 (2014) and $2,299,275 (2015).[28] In April 2015 the complete non-executive board of directors resigned in what Symbid reports as a "differences with remaining management concerning the Company’s strategic direction".[29] Also in April 2016 it was reported that Symbid made their development team redundant.[30] More losses of $2,005,751 in the first half year of 2016 "raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern".[31] On October 12, 2016, the remaining three directors decided to reduce their salary to zero,"retroactive to August 1, 2016".[32] They also stated that "the company is investigating the options available for further cost reductions.".[33]
At the same time, Symbid will have to apply for a license as investment firm under the MiFIDto continue our equity based crowdfunding activities as required by the Dutch AFM, the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets, for all equity-based crowdfunding activities.[34]

History[edit]
Early years[edit]
In 2007, Symbid's founders Robin Slakhorst and Korstiaan Zandvliet met while studying Entrepreneurship & New Business Venturing MSc at Rotterdam School of Management.[1] They have stated that witnessing classmates fail to start their own businesses post-graduation due to a lack of funding was the main inspiration behind Symbid.[citation needed]
Between 2007 and 2010 Zandvlliet and Slakhorst coordinated a fiscal-legal structure allowing non-accredited investors to invest online in start-ups and small businesses. While a number of crowdfunding platforms began to appear online from 2006 onwards, these were associated with creative projects and rewards or donation-based crowdfunding. Few countries had introduced formal equity crowdfunding legislation at this time.[2] Symbid was founded in April 2011 as one of the first equity crowdfunding platforms worldwide.[3]
Symbid was formally incorporated in Utrecht, the Netherlands, as a cooperative entity (Coöperatie) in accordance with Dutch law. A cooperative structure means Symbid is able to complete investment transactions online and store invested capital in a separate third-party (trust) account as an electronically stored monetary value (e-money).[4] As of March 2015, Intersolve, a company operating under license as an electronic money institution and supervised by the De Nederlandsche Bank and the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets, was responsible for managing this trust account.[5]
In November 2011, Symbid was granted the Shell LiveWIRE 2011 Audience Award alongside a cash prize after receiving 40% the online vote.[6]
Expansion[edit]
During 2012 Symbid established itself as one of several platforms in the rapidly expanding European equity crowdfunding industry.[7]
Symbid became involved in coordinating Dutch crowdfunding legislation at this time, in addition to co-founding initiatives aimed at improving transparency and platform standards within the equity crowdfunding industry. These initiatives include the Crowdfunding Accreditation for Platform Standards (CAPS) in conjunction with Crowdsourcing.org and the European Crowdfunding Network (ECN), a Europe-wide organisation involved in policy discussion and public opinion-building. Symbid is also a member of EBAN, the European Trade Association for Business Angels, Seed Funds and Early Stage Market Players.
Between 2011 and 2013 Symbid grew in size, hiring campaign managers to assist entrepreneurs in their equity crowdfunding efforts. In October 2012, Forbes named Symbid as one of the companies most likely to profit from the pending legalization of equity crowdfunding in the United States in accordance with the U.s. JOBS Act.[8]
Ownership interests[edit]
From 2012 onwards, Symbid has maintained ownership interests in several affiliated companies, including Gambitious Coöperatie U.A. and 12% of Gambitious B.V.—the Dutch divisions of crowd funding and video game publishing company Gambitious Digital Entertainment, the online business valuation tool Equidam, and the initiative funded by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, which operates a tool which enables entrepreneurs to present critical business information to investors in a standardized format, namely Kredietpaspoort, through its parent company, Symbid Corp.[9]
Going public[edit]
On December 6, 2013 Symbid, through its parent company Symbid Corp., acquired a public listing in the United States on OTCQB Markets. As of July 2014, Symbid became one of the first publicly traded crowdfunding platforms worldwide.[10] In addition to going public, Symbid Corp. conducted a private placement offering (PPO), raising a gross total of (US)$2,926,695.[11] In accordance with this public listing, Symbid Corp. opened offices in New York City, United States.[12]
Further expansion & relocation[edit]
In February 2014 Symbid introduced a new user interface to its crowdfunding platform. Early 2014 saw Symbid feature several high-profile campaigns on its equity crowdfunding platform including Greendaddy which raised $333,960 (€245,000) in 47 hours in May 2014, setting a new record for the Dutch crowdfunding industry.[13] Other prominent campaigns included the Archimedes - a wind turbine research and development company.[14] - and Bidroom, a hotel booking platform on which hotels bid directly for guests.[15]




Symbid HQ in the Rotterdam Science Tower


Symbid relocated to its current headquarters in the Erasmus Centre for Entrepreneurship in the Rotterdam Science Tower in March 2014.[16]
Later in 2014, Symbid signed a cooperation agreement with A-Film Benelux, whereby Symbid will fund upcoming Dutch movie titles including ‘De Surprise’ from Oscar-winning director Mike van Diem.[17] In September of that same year, Symbid announced its equity crowdfunding platform had passed the €5 million funding milestone.[18]
The launch of The Funding Network[edit]
Symbid and financial advisory firm Credion signed a partnership agreement in December 2014, creating the largest Dutch online funding platform by transaction volume.[19] The partnership sees Credion using the Symbid platform to connect its nationwide network of investors and entrepreneurs, combining alternative and traditional sources of funding.[20] Credion Director Carlo van der Weg described the partnership as “streamlining the way in which entrepreneurs find that crucial investment." [21] Although not revealed at the time, this partnership was the precursor to the launch of The Funding Network in March 2015.[citation needed]
In March, 2015, Symbid relaunched its website and rebranded as Symbid, The Funding Network. Previously an equity crowdfunding platform, as of March 2015 Symbid began offering other financial products and services for start-ups and small businesses including financial advice, monitoring and traditional and alternative financing options.[22] In addition to a redesigned website, Symbid released a new monitoring product based on XBRL data.
As of March 2015, Symbid claims to have connected 30,000 private (crowdfunding) investors and 40 institutional investors to The Funding Network, plus other online funding platforms active in niche industries, such as FarmersFunding.[23] Following the launch, on 24 March Symbid and Economic Board Utrecht (EBU) announced a partnership to provide local, sustainable initiatives with loan capital via The Funding Network. EBU has committed $1 million in growth capital to entrepreneurs on The Funding Network in 2015.[24]
International expansion[edit]
Symbid announced the incorporation of Symbid Italia on 10 March 2015, in partnership with Gruppo Banca Sella. The launch of Symbid Italia represents the first international expansion of the Symbid equity crowdfunding platform.[25] Although connected to The Funding Network, Symbid Italia will function purely as an equity crowdfunding platform. Marco Bicocchi Pichi, Italian Business Angel of the Year 2014, occupies the role of Managing Director.[26] The partnership between Symbid and Gruppo Banca Sella involves Symbid's use of the banking group's payment solutions, banking services and network. In 2016, Symbid Italia was deemed economically inviable and on April 29, 2016, a shareholders meeting determined to liquidate Symbid Italia.[27]
Financial troubles[edit]
In 2014 and 2015 Symbid reported low turnover ($267,358 and $282,155 respectively) and a net losses of $2,821,794 (2014) and $2,299,275 (2015).[28] In April 2015 the complete non-executive board of directors resigned in what Symbid reports as a "differences with remaining management concerning the Company’s strategic direction".[29] Also in April 2016 it was reported that Symbid made their development team redundant.[30] More losses of $2,005,751 in the first half year of 2016 "raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern".[31] On October 12, 2016, the remaining three directors decided to reduce their salary to zero,"retroactive to August 1, 2016".[32] They also stated that "the company is investigating the options available for further cost reductions.".[33]
At the same time, Symbid will have to apply for a license as investment firm under the MiFIDto continue our equity based crowdfunding activities as required by the Dutch AFM, the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets, for all equity-based crowdfunding activities.[34]

In October 2012, Forbes named Symbid as one of the companies most likely to profit from the pending legalization of equity crowdfunding in the United States in accordance with the U.s. JOBS Act.[8]
Ownership interests[edit]
From 2012 onwards, Symbid has maintained ownership interests in several affiliated companies, including Gambitious Coöperatie U.A. and 12% of Gambitious B.V.—the Dutch divisions of crowd funding and video game publishing company Gambitious Digital Entertainment, the online business valuation tool Equidam, and the initiative funded by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, which operates a tool which enables entrepreneurs to present critical business information to investors in a standardized format, namely Kredietpaspoort, through its parent company, Symbid Corp.[9]
Going public[edit]
On December 6, 2013 Symbid, through its parent company Symbid Corp., acquired a public listing in the United States on OTCQB Markets. As of July 2014, Symbid became one of the first publicly traded crowdfunding platforms worldwide.[10] In addition to going public, Symbid Corp. conducted a private placement offering (PPO), raising a gross total of (US)$2,926,695.[11] In accordance with this public listing, Symbid Corp. opened offices in New York City, United States.[12]
Further expansion & relocation[edit]
In February 2014 Symbid introduced a new user interface to its crowdfunding platform. Early 2014 saw Symbid feature several high-profile campaigns on its equity crowdfunding platform including Greendaddy which raised $333,960 (€245,000) in 47 hours in May 2014, setting a new record for the Dutch crowdfunding industry.[13] Other prominent campaigns included the Archimedes - a wind turbine research and development company.[14] - and Bidroom, a hotel booking platform on which hotels bid directly for guests.[15]




Symbid HQ in the Rotterdam Science Tower


Symbid relocated to its current headquarters in the Erasmus Centre for Entrepreneurship in the Rotterdam Science Tower in March 2014.[16]
Later in 2014, Symbid signed a cooperation agreement with A-Film Benelux, whereby Symbid will fund upcoming Dutch movie titles including ‘De Surprise’ from Oscar-winning director Mike van Diem.[17] In September of that same year, Symbid announced its equity crowdfunding platform had passed the €5 million funding milestone.[18]
The launch of The Funding Network[edit]
Symbid and financial advisory firm Credion signed a partnership agreement in December 2014, creating the largest Dutch online funding platform by transaction volume.[19] The partnership sees Credion using the Symbid platform to connect its nationwide network of investors and entrepreneurs, combining alternative and traditional sources of funding.[20] Credion Director Carlo van der Weg described the partnership as “streamlining the way in which entrepreneurs find that crucial investment." [21] Although not revealed at the time, this partnership was the precursor to the launch of The Funding Network in March 2015.[citation needed]
In March, 2015, Symbid relaunched its website and rebranded as Symbid, The Funding Network. Previously an equity crowdfunding platform, as of March 2015 Symbid began offering other financial products and services for start-ups and small businesses including financial advice, monitoring and traditional and alternative financing options.[22] In addition to a redesigned website, Symbid released a new monitoring product based on XBRL data.
As of March 2015, Symbid claims to have connected 30,000 private (crowdfunding) investors and 40 institutional investors to The Funding Network, plus other online funding platforms active in niche industries, such as FarmersFunding.[23] Following the launch, on 24 March Symbid and Economic Board Utrecht (EBU) announced a partnership to provide local, sustainable initiatives with loan capital via The Funding Network. EBU has committed $1 million in growth capital to entrepreneurs on The Funding Network in 2015.[24]
International expansion[edit]
Symbid announced the incorporation of Symbid Italia on 10 March 2015, in partnership with Gruppo Banca Sella. The launch of Symbid Italia represents the first international expansion of the Symbid equity crowdfunding platform.[25] Although connected to The Funding Network, Symbid Italia will function purely as an equity crowdfunding platform. Marco Bicocchi Pichi, Italian Business Angel of the Year 2014, occupies the role of Managing Director.[26] The partnership between Symbid and Gruppo Banca Sella involves Symbid's use of the banking group's payment solutions, banking services and network. In 2016, Symbid Italia was deemed economically inviable and on April 29, 2016, a shareholders meeting determined to liquidate Symbid Italia.[27]
Financial troubles[edit]
In 2014 and 2015 Symbid reported low turnover ($267,358 and $282,155 respectively) and a net losses of $2,821,794 (2014) and $2,299,275 (2015).[28] In April 2015 the complete non-executive board of directors resigned in what Symbid reports as a "differences with remaining management concerning the Company’s strategic direction".[29] Also in April 2016 it was reported that Symbid made their development team redundant.[30] More losses of $2,005,751 in the first half year of 2016 "raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern".[31] On October 12, 2016, the remaining three directors decided to reduce their salary to zero,"retroactive to August 1, 2016".[32] They also stated that "the company is investigating the options available for further cost reductions.".[33]
At the same time, Symbid will have to apply for a license as investment firm under the MiFIDto continue our equity based crowdfunding activities as required by the Dutch AFM, the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets, for all equity-based crowdfunding activities.[34]

History[edit]
Early years[edit]
In 2007, Symbid's founders Robin Slakhorst and Korstiaan Zandvliet met while studying Entrepreneurship & New Business Venturing MSc at Rotterdam School of Management.[1] They have stated that witnessing classmates fail to start their own businesses post-graduation due to a lack of funding was the main inspiration behind Symbid.[citation needed]
Between 2007 and 2010 Zandvlliet and Slakhorst coordinated a fiscal-legal structure allowing non-accredited investors to invest online in start-ups and small businesses. While a number of crowdfunding platforms began to appear online from 2006 onwards, these were associated with creative projects and rewards or donation-based crowdfunding. Few countries had introduced formal equity crowdfunding legislation at this time.[2] Symbid was founded in April 2011 as one of the first equity crowdfunding platforms worldwide.[3]
Symbid was formally incorporated in Utrecht, the Netherlands, as a cooperative entity (Coöperatie) in accordance with Dutch law. A cooperative structure means Symbid is able to complete investment transactions online and store invested capital in a separate third-party (trust) account as an electronically stored monetary value (e-money).[4] As of March 2015, Intersolve, a company operating under license as an electronic money institution and supervised by the De Nederlandsche Bank and the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets, was responsible for managing this trust account.[5]
In November 2011, Symbid was granted the Shell LiveWIRE 2011 Audience Award alongside a cash prize after receiving 40% the online vote.[6]
Expansion[edit]
During 2012 Symbid established itself as one of several platforms in the rapidly expanding European equity crowdfunding industry.[7]
Symbid became involved in coordinating Dutch crowdfunding legislation at this time, in addition to co-founding initiatives aimed at improving transparency and platform standards within the equity crowdfunding industry. These initiatives include the Crowdfunding Accreditation for Platform Standards (CAPS) in conjunction with Crowdsourcing.org and the European Crowdfunding Network (ECN), a Europe-wide organisation involved in policy discussion and public opinion-building. Symbid is also a member of EBAN, the European Trade Association for Business Angels, Seed Funds and Early Stage Market Players.
Between 2011 and 2013 Symbid grew in size, hiring campaign managers to assist entrepreneurs in their equity crowdfunding efforts. In October 2012, Forbes named Symbid as one of the companies most likely to profit from the pending legalization of equity crowdfunding in the United States in accordance with the U.s. JOBS Act.[8]
Ownership interests[edit]
From 2012 onwards, Symbid has maintained ownership interests in several affiliated companies, including Gambitious Coöperatie U.A. and 12% of Gambitious B.V.—the Dutch divisions of crowd funding and video game publishing company Gambitious Digital Entertainment, the online business valuation tool Equidam, and the initiative funded by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, which operates a tool which enables entrepreneurs to present critical business information to investors in a standardized format, namely Kredietpaspoort, through its parent company, Symbid Corp.[9]
Going public[edit]
On December 6, 2013 Symbid, through its parent company Symbid Corp., acquired a public listing in the United States on OTCQB Markets. As of July 2014, Symbid became one of the first publicly traded crowdfunding platforms worldwide.[10] In addition to going public, Symbid Corp. conducted a private placement offering (PPO), raising a gross total of (US)$2,926,695.[11] In accordance with this public listing, Symbid Corp. opened offices in New York City, United States.[12]
Further expansion & relocation[edit]
In February 2014 Symbid introduced a new user interface to its crowdfunding platform. Early 2014 saw Symbid feature several high-profile campaigns on its equity crowdfunding platform including Greendaddy which raised $333,960 (€245,000) in 47 hours in May 2014, setting a new record for the Dutch crowdfunding industry.[13] Other prominent campaigns included the Archimedes - a wind turbine research and development company.[14] - and Bidroom, a hotel booking platform on which hotels bid directly for guests.[15]

Symbid relocated to its current headquarters in the Erasmus Centre for Entrepreneurship in the Rotterdam Science Tower in March 2014.[16]
Later in 2014, Symbid signed a cooperation agreement with A-Film Benelux, whereby Symbid will fund upcoming Dutch movie titles including ‘De Surprise’ from Oscar-winning director Mike van Diem.[17] In September of that same year, Symbid announced its equity crowdfunding platform had passed the €5 million funding milestone.[18]

As of March 2015, Symbid claims to have connected 30,000 private (crowdfunding) investors and 40 institutional investors to The Funding Network, plus other online funding platforms active in niche industries, such as FarmersFunding.[23] Following the launch, on 24 March Symbid and Economic Board Utrecht (EBU) announced a partnership to provide local, sustainable initiatives with loan capital via The Funding Network. EBU has committed $1 million in growth capital to entrepreneurs on The Funding Network in 2015.[24]
International expansion[edit]
Symbid announced the incorporation of Symbid Italia on 10 March 2015, in partnership with Gruppo Banca Sella. The launch of Symbid Italia represents the first international expansion of the Symbid equity crowdfunding platform.[25] Although connected to The Funding Network, Symbid Italia will function purely as an equity crowdfunding platform. Marco Bicocchi Pichi, Italian Business Angel of the Year 2014, occupies the role of Managing Director.[26] The partnership between Symbid and Gruppo Banca Sella involves Symbid's use of the banking group's payment solutions, banking services and network. In 2016, Symbid Italia was deemed economically inviable and on April 29, 2016, a shareholders meeting determined to liquidate Symbid Italia.[27]
Financial troubles[edit]
In 2014 and 2015 Symbid reported low turnover ($267,358 and $282,155 respectively) and a net losses of $2,821,794 (2014) and $2,299,275 (2015).[28] In April 2015 the complete non-executive board of directors resigned in what Symbid reports as a "differences with remaining management concerning the Company’s strategic direction".[29] Also in April 2016 it was reported that Symbid made their development team redundant.[30] More losses of $2,005,751 in the first half year of 2016 "raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern".[31] On October 12, 2016, the remaining three directors decided to reduce their salary to zero,"retroactive to August 1, 2016".[32] They also stated that "the company is investigating the options available for further cost reductions.".[33]

Symbid Announces New Products & Market Expansion to Shareholders
 Tweet5 Share Share +1 Reddit Pin EmailShares 5

February 5, 2015 @ 3:53 pm By Samantha Hurst 


Symbid Corp. (OTCQB: SBID), a financial technology brand committed to building an online funding network based on investment crowdfunding and cloud-based monitoring technologies, has provided an update on the Company’s continued progress in the execution of its business strategy.
Key developments include:

Symbid Corp. will begin its vertical expansion into new products and services with the formal launch of the Company’s long-term partnership with financial advisory firm Credion in the first quarter of 2015. Symbid Corp. will receive monthly recurring revenues and transaction fees from Credion’s use of the Company’s online monitoring and deal-making tools during the month of February. The contract will see Symbid Corp. channel an expected $860 million worth of transaction volume in 2015 through The Funding Network.


The Company has begun communicating an upcoming repositioning of the Symbid brand towards The Funding Network™, the go-to platform for all types of SME funding. The re-launch of Symbid.com in early February will incorporate a new online infrastructure stretching across crowdfunding (equity and loans), angel investors, venture capital and institutional investors. The Company’s new brand identity is linked to the ongoing addition of new products and services and will be announced formally in March 2015.


Management completed an initial closing of its Private Placement Offering raising $625,000 from a global investor base to support the growth of the Company’s online funding network. Symbid Corp. successfully raised the funds at a price 100% higher than the listed U.S. stock price, issuing 1,250,000 shares at $0.50.

Symbid’s Korstiaan Zandvliet, also released a letter to the company’s shareholders:
Dear Fellow Shareholders,
The first quarter of 2015 sees the culmination of several crucial aspects of Symbid’s business development as we continue to innovate and expand our financial technology portfolio, adding long-term recurring revenue streams and creating value for our shareholders. The fact that we were able to raise capital at a significant premium to our stock price confirms that our investors recognize the true strategic value of The Funding Network™.
We are actively pursuing both vertical and horizontal growth of our online funding platform, as indicated by recent Symbid business highlights. The third quarter of 2014 saw exponential growth of 860% in the total capital invested via Symbid.com versus the same period last year. Additionally, we added 2,000 new users to our thriving community of 29,000 active investors, captured 10% of the entire Dutch seed capital market, and cemented our status as a global industry leader in investment crowdfunding. As of December 31, 2014, Symbid has facilitated over $7.3 million in funding to innovative start-ups and small businesses.
The continued exponential growth of our core investment crowdfunding business is the foundation on which The Funding Network™ is being built. This new, forward-thinking brand identity is rooted in our market positioning at the heart of financial technology and reinforces the introduction of several new products and services starting this quarter. The Funding Network™ provides small businesses direct access to all forms of finance, while offering investors full transparency on the potential risks and returns of their portfolio. Symbid is becoming the go-to platform for SME funding, connecting new and traditional sources of finance in one integrated network built around cutting-edge technology.
The upcoming launch of The Funding Network™ in cooperation with financial advisory firm Credion will see Symbid facilitate both B2C and B2B deals with an expected transaction volume worth $860 million in 2015. This partnership means we are making concrete progress towards a tiered business model producing monthly recurring revenues on top of our core crowdfunding revenues starting in March 2015. Credion’s evergreen subscription to The Funding Network™ represents the validation and monetization of our financial technology portfolio, demonstrating Symbid’s commitment to ensuring long-term value for shareholders.
Meanwhile, the introduction of a loan product in the second quarter of 2015 will mark our entry into the rapidly expanding peer-to-peer lending market. With Symbid earning 5% on every $1 loaned via our platform, this product has significant revenue-generating potential and is a major boost to our core transaction-based crowdfunding model. This is another crucial step forward in securing the long-term future of Symbid as we seek to deliver on our first mover advantage in online funding.
In terms of horizontal expansion, we are now initiating the first stage of a European roll-out with the launch of Symbid Italy in partnership with Banca Sella, a 129-year-old renowned banking institution. This joint venture is set to generate 6% commission rates on all funding and will validate our B2C business model. We expect the venture to yield further monthly recurring revenues with the incorporation of The Funding Network™ and its online monitoring and deal-making technology. Symbid Italy represents a key milestone in our growth strategy as we make steps to become the first Europe-wide online (crowd)funding platform with further expansions in 2015.
Our Company remains committed to revolutionizing the way SMEs receive funding as we lead the transition from crowdfunding to online funding. The addition of monthly recurring revenue streams with our cloud-based monitoring and deal-making technology does not only secure Symbid’s future as a leader in financial technology innovation, but signals the birth of The Funding Network™. As of February 2015, we are no longer one of the world’s first investment crowdfunding platforms — we are the go-to platform for small businesses in search of funding.
Thank you for your continued participation in Symbid — I look forward to speaking with you soon.
Sincerely,
Korstiaan Zandvliet, co-founder and CEO of Symbid Corp.

Announces First Quarter 2015 ResultsMarketwiredMay 15, 2015ReblogShareTweetShareROTTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS and NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - May 15, 2015) -  Symbid Corp. (  OTCQB :  SBID ) www.symbidcorp.comTotal revenue of $73,866 for first quarter 2015 includes first registrations to The Funding Network™ after March launch. Revenue down 14% on same period last year due mainly to worsening exchange rate. Investment in joint venture and subsequent incorporation of Symbid Italia S.p.A. represents first international expansion of Symbid funding platform. Operating expenses equal to same period last year except for share-based compensation expenses, accounting for 27% of total first quarter operating expenses of $655,203. Positive cash flow from financing and investing activities following closing of Private Placement Offering and sale of Gambitious shares. "We are pleased to report the first revenues following the successful launch of Symbid, The Funding Network™ in March. This represents a major step forward in our commitment to creating long-term value for shareholders through an innovative service offering for start-ups and small businesses. Following several quarters of heavy investment into research and development, we are now in a position to begin reaping the financial benefits of our newly launched advanced investing, monitoring and data tools in the form of monthly recurring revenues," said Korstiaan Zandvliet, co-founder and CEO of Symbid Corp. "A declining exchange rate notwithstanding, revenues from our crowdfunding platform have remained at a similar level to the same period last year due to the major pivot in our business strategy this quarter. The incorporation of Symbid Italia -- the first international expansion of the Symbid investment crowdfunding platform -- plus a loan crowdfunding product expected in second quarter, means we are confident of increasing our core crowdfunding revenues in the coming months. Add to this the continuing commercialisation of the diversified product portfolio of The Funding Network™, including our monitoring product and upcoming deal-making too, and 2015 is a crucial year in our business development. As we look ahead, these results represent a solid foundation on which we expect to build towards our strategic vision of becoming the leading European online funding platform in 2016."Summary of First Quarter 2015 Financial Performance:Total revenue decreased by 14% compared to prior year period to $73,866. 74% of revenue attributable to transaction-based model of core investment crowdfunding business, compared to 97% in same period 2014, due to first revenues from The Funding Network™. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by 49% from same period 2014 to $409,353 due to increase in share-based payments made to staff members, accounting for approximately $120,000. Research and development costs decreased by 52% compared to same period 2014 to $22,242 due to fewer external suppliers providing related services and personnel costs for internal developers being listed under selling, general and administrative expenses. Total operating expenses increased by 25% from same period 2014 to $655,203, roughly equal except for share-based payments which have been added as a cost factor. Gambitious Coöperatie shareholding was sold entirely in February 2015. Net losses increased by 37% from same period 2014 to $579,821 in line with the Company's commitment to the research and development of innovative products creating long-term value for its shareholders. 2015 Commercial Outlook:In December 2014 the Company signed a strategic alliance agreement with leading financial advisory firm Credion which, following its launch in March, has resulted in a monthly transaction volume of approximately $55m for The Funding Network™. The Company expects this to result in new monthly recurring revenue streams attributable to its cloud-based monitoring product and soon-to-be released loan crowdfunding and deal-making products beginning second quarter 2015. The Company underwent a successful re-launch of its website in March 2015 in line with its repositioning to a more holistic funding platform, known as The Funding Network™, connecting traditional and alternative financing options in one go-to platform. The Company expects to continue its ongoing release of new products and services with the launch of a loan product in the second quarter of 2015, resulting in additional transaction-based crowdfunding revenues. The formal incorporation of Symbid Italia S.p.A. in February 2015 represents the first stage of a European roll-out which the Company expects to continue throughout 2015. The Company intends to commercialize this international expansion in the third quarter of 2015. Management completed a closing of a Private Placement Offering raising $624,116 to support the growth of The Funding Network™. The Company is actively pursuing a capital raise strategy in order to accelerate the horizontal and vertical expansion of its funding network and balance cash flow. First quarter 2015 saw the Company continue its focus on the internal development of technology thereby creating long-term value through successful innovation. The Company intends to bring this financial technology portfolio to market in 2015 following the launch of The Funding Network™ in March.                 Three months ended March 31,         2015     2014     Revenues                     Crowdfunding   $ 54,394     $ 78,055       Other     19,472       8,050         Total revenues'     73,866       86,105     Operating expenses                     Selling, general and administrative     409,454       274,015       Professional fees     186,670       204,713       Research and development costs     22,242       45,975       Depreciation and amortization     36,938       334         Total operating expenses     665,203       525,037         Operating loss     (581,337 )     (438,932 )   Other income (expense)                     Fair value adjustment derivative liability - warrants     (7,274 )     15,264       Interest expense     (2,714 )     (5,810 )     Government subsidy     -       8,221       Gain on sale of investment in Gambitious B.V.     11,504       -       Other income and expense     -       (1,631 )       Total other income (expense)     1,516       16,044         Net loss     (579,821 )     (422,888 )                       Net loss attributable to non-controlling interests     (12,848 )     (11,018 )                           Net loss attributable to Symbid Corp. stockholders   $ (566,973 )   $ (411,870 )                       Basic and diluted net loss per common stock   $ (0.02 )   $ (0.02 )                       Weighted average number of shares outstanding                     Basic and diluted     34,079,498       26,498,864                        Disclaimer This press release is for information purposes only and is not intended to constitute, and should not be construed as, an offer to sell or a solicitation of any offer to buy securities of Symbid Corp.
