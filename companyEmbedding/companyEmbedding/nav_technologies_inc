We use bank-level, 256-bit encryption to protect your data.




Nav doesn’t sell your information for marketing purposes.











Why we're here
We launched Nav in 2012 to solve a major challenge faced by small business owners: finding affordable financing. There are more ways than ever to get business funding—over 44 options at last count—but it is still a complex and miserable experience. Business owners need a partner, not just a loan.
As small business owners themselves, our founders, Levi King and Caton Hanson, experienced this challenge first hand. They believed small business owners deserved an easier, transparent way to manage their financial health and find the right financing.
It’s why Nav was an original signer of the Small Business Borrowers Bill of Rights. It’s why we provide unbiased, educational content. It’s why we’re the only place to access free business and personal credit, along with personalized insights. It’s why our financing marketplace connects business owners to the best financing option for their needs—not the needs of lenders.
We know we’ll have a meaningful impact on the lives of millions of small business owners by doing what’s best for them.
