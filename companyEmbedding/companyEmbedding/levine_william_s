Description

                    At publication, The Control Handbook immediately became the definitive resource that engineers working with modern control systems required. Among its many accolades, that first edition was cited by the AAP as the Best Engineering Handbook of 1996. Now, 15 years later, William Levine has once again compiled the most comprehensive and authoritative resource on control engineering. He has fully reorganized the text to reflect the technical advances achieved since the last edition and has expanded its contents to include the multidisciplinary perspective that is making control engineering a critical component in so many fields. Now expanded from one to three volumes, The Control Handbook, Second Edition brilliantly organizes cutting-edge contributions from more than 200 leading experts representing every corner of the globe. They cover everything from basic closed-loop systems to multi-agent adaptive systems and from the control of electric motors to the control of complex networks.
Progressively organized, the three volume set includes: * Control System Fundamentals * Control System Applications * Control System Advanced Methods Any practicing engineer, student, or researcher working in fields as diverse as electronics, aeronautics, or biomedicine will find this handbook to be a time-saving resource filled with invaluable formulas, models, methods, and innovative thinking. In fact, any physicist, biologist, mathematician, or researcher in any number of fields developing or improving products and systems will find the answers and ideas they need. As with the first edition, the new edition not only stands as a record of accomplishment in control engineering but provides researchers with the means to make further advances.show more

About William S. Levine

                            Dr. William S. Levine received the B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees from M.I.T. He then joined the faculty of the University of Maryland, College Park where he is currently Research Professor of ECE. Throughout his career, he has specialized in the design and analysis of control systems and related problems in estimation, filtering, and system modeling. Motivated by the desire to understand a collection of interesting controller designs, he has done a great deal of research on mammalian control of movement in collaboration with several neurophysiologists.    Dr. Levine is co-author of Using MATLAB to Analyze and Design Control Systems (1992, second edition, 1995) and editor of The Control Handbook (published by CRC Press in cooperation with IEEE Press), and of a series on control engineering for Birkhauser. He is also co-editor of The Handbook of Networked and Embedded Control Systems (published by Birkhauser, 2005). He has been president of the IEEE Control Systems Society and the American Cntrol Council. He is presently the Chairman of the SIAM special interest group Control Theory and its Applications.     Dr. Levine is a Fellow of the IEEE, a Distinguished Member of the IEEE Control Systems Society, and a recipient of the IEEE Third Millennium Medal. He and his collaborators received the Schroers Award for outstanding rotorcraft research in 1998. He and another group of collaborators received the award for outstanding paper in the IEEE Transactions on Auotomatic Control for "Discrete Time Point Processes in Urban Traffic Queue Estimation"show more

        Murder, anger, greed, revenge. Levine trial reveals obsessive 
    


MYLINDA CANE

Jun 23, 1991

















































































The intrigue of who shot JR Ewing that captivated an entire
nation in the
early 1980s has been resurrected here in federal court.
The JR Ewing in this true-life drama is Donald Levine, a
prominent Chicago

and Arizona real estate developer whose sometimes treacherous
business deals,
vile temper and obsession for money earned the wrath of a host
of business
partners, friends, family and, perhaps, even the Mafia.
The multimillionaire who made his home in Munster and Phoenix,
Ariz. even
swindled his own father out of money, so much money that his
father at his
retirement had to begin rebuilding his wealth, according to
testimony.
Donald's brother Robert Levine, 50, of the Phoenix area has been
on trial
for the past two weeks for allegedly ordering the murders of
Donald, 55, his
wife, Marsha, 53, and their only child, Mark, then 24.
Donald and Marsha were brutally murdered in their Munster home
Nov. 9, 1989.
Mark was struck over the head with the butt of a gun and escaped
with a
fractured skull.
Robert faces federal charges in U.S. District Court in Hammond
for allegedly
hiring a killer to bump off his brother's family. Worth about $6
million
himself, Robert allegedly faced financial ruin because Donald
was reportedly
about to cut Robert out of the family's real estate
business.
The defense argues that the death of Donald, the financier of
the deals
between the two brothers, brought about Robert's financial
demise. Robert and
his wife Patricia Steward filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy after
Donald's death.
"Murder, anger, greed, revenge," Assistant U.S. Attorney Ronald
Kurpiers
said in his melodramatic opening remarks to the jury. "Put them
together, and
they're the reason we're sitting in the court room."
The defense doesn't argue that the motive in the killings was
not money - it
just differs in who wanted the Levine's estimated $25 million
fortune, much of
which came from a trust left to Marsha by her family.
Defense lawyer Kevin Milner has argued that the man who hired
the killer was
the couple's son, Mark, who escaped "with an 'owie.' "
Milner has not missed an opportunity to point out Mark's strange
behavior -
why did he run first to the basement and not his mother, who was
bleeding to
death in the china room of the home, or his father, who was
moaning and rolling
back and forth from the pain of two bullets?
Why did Mark take time to call his girlfriend in Chicago after
calling
police from a pay phone at a school across the street from the
home while the
gunman was still in the house. Mark apparently passed his two
dying parents
while walking to the master bedroom to make another call after
the murders, and
as he was being carried out on the stretcher, he again had the
phone in his
hand.
"The only thing he doesn't do is stop and order a pizza," Milner
said
sarcastically during opening statements to the jury.
Mark is expected to be among the 100 witnesses who testify at
the trial that
could extend well beyond the three-week schedule.
Another family member to take the stand will be William Levine,
another
brother of Donald, who the defense has tried to imply might have
also wanted to
kill him.
The defense pried out of hired killer Bruce McKinney the details
of a sexual
relationship William had with Bruce and William's ex-wife,
Linda. McKinney
denied that Donald knew of the relationship or might have been
upset about it.
On the day before the murders, Marsha and Donald were extremely
upset,
testified fellow employees of the Levine's Chicago business
Commercial Retail
Specialists Inc.
Donald was "unusually upset, incommunicative, very curt," said
Stanley
Epstein, a broker of the Chicago business. "He just wasn't
himself."
Donald and Marsha had a reason to be happy that day - their son,
a graduate
of Yale Law School, who has been described as their "crown
prince," was to
return home so he could attend his swearing in ceremony as an
Illinois lawyer
the following day - the day of the murders.
At the time of the murders, Donald and Marsha were selling off
their Chicago
real estate business, largely comprised of shopping centers.
They had bought a
$750,000 home in Phoenix and were preparing to move.
In addition to the real estate business, Donald had invested $3
million,
reportedly all of his liquidity, in a Montana gold mine, which
was giving him
problems because the residents had opposed the mining.
The move to Arizona followed what has been described as a
"terrible nuclear
war of a fight" that erupted in May 1989 between Robert and
Donald.
Donald accused Robert and Patricia of embezzling a third of a
million
dollars and had threatened to put them in jail. It apparently
bothered him more
that it was his brother who allegedly did this to him than the
amount of the
money, witnesses said.
The amount of the money involved and the extent of the criminal
activity
varied greatly among the witnesses. The dispute actually could
have been a
$5,000 accounting mistake.
Although the boiling dispute eventually simmered, the negotiated
settlement
left bitter feelings and proved costly to Robert and Patricia's
Arizona real
estate company, which was forced to give up management services
it provided for
three shopping centers held by a partnership involving Donald
and Robert.
The dispute only elevated tensions between the two families -
Donald and
Marsha despised Patricia. The new company formed to manage the
development of
three shopping malls after the dispute only included Donald and
Robert.
Marsha was less forgiving and told her husband that if he died
first, she
would make sure Robert was run out of the business because "I
don't deal with

thieves."
Throughout the trial, Robert has sat almost emotionless, though
attentive.
He entered the courtroom every day carrying a large file and
pencils, and as
the proceedings started, he took out a white legal pad that he
uses for note
taking. The father of four has had two years of training in law
and has
participated actively in his case.
Robert's wife, Patricia, has missed only a couple hours of the
testimony,
and she, like her husband, carries a note pad. On one occasion,
she actually
interrupted testimony to pass a message to her husband's
lawyer.
Although the two reportedly had marital problems, some of which
may have
been caused by Donald and Marsha's intense hatred for Patricia,
the couple have
supported each other as their private lives are exposed in the
courtroom.
The drama of the trial has come from not only the witness stand,
but also
from the government and the defense lawyer, who unabashedly take
their digs at
every opportunity. Kurpiers and Milner rarely have agreed on
anything,
including what time the court should recess.
The trial has progressed slowly as testimony is frequently
interrupted so
the lawyers and the judge can argue over what the jury should or
should not
hear.
For the lawyers, there has been a lot to argue - hearsay
evidence from a
dead woman, the admission of a polygraph test from Mark and the
government's
smoking gun, a jailhouse confession.
The trial recessed for a day last week to give the defense time
to regroup
and prepare for the potentially damaging testimony of John Gary
Rinaldo, an
inmate who was being held at a California detention center while
awaiting
charges on money laundering and bank fraud.
Rinaldo testified outside of the ears of the jury that while
incarcerated

with Robert, he had more than 20 conversations with Robert about
the murders.
The defense is now trying to round up prisoners and prison
officials who can
testify that Rinaldo accepted money for legal work while in jail
and was not
the jailhouse buddy the government represented to the court.
Milner wants to prevent the testimony from being heard by the
jury, arguing
that what Robert told Rinaldo is protected by attorney-client
privilege.
Over the objections from the government, U.S. District Court
Judge Rudy
Lozano delayed the testimony of Rinaldo, though he ruled it
could be allowed.
The defense, which was caught off guard, is hoping to change
that ruling.
Neither Robert nor Milner recognized Rinaldo's name on the
government's witness
list because the inmate apparently used a different name in
jail.
The star witness in the case is the gunman himself , Bruce
McKinney, an
unemployed real estate agent who bragged often of his days in
Vietnam and his
involvement with the elite special forces of the U.S. Army.
The father of two served in the Army but never went to Vietnam
nor served in
the special forces. He admitted he told war stories when there
were none to
tell.
The one war story McKinney hopes the jury believes is that
Robert had
promised to make him a millionaire if he would kill Donald,
Marsha and Mark and
that if he didn't, McKinney's family would be harmed.
Sitting behind bars since his arrest Dec. 22, 1989, McKinney
broke eight
months of silence and denial with a confession and a deal that
could spare him
a date with the electric chair.
McKinney has testified that Robert "ordered" him to kill Donald
and
subsequently added Marsha and Mark to the list to ensure himself
a slice of the
inheritance.
McKinney detailed his misfortunes - a heart attack that drained
his finances
and cost him his business and home, a conviction for possession
of marijuana
and his difficulties in paying rent, utility bills and feeding
his family
around the time of the murders.
The large-framed man with a thick, black beard wore a power blue
short coat
that softened his imposing stature. He was polite, answering
"yes, sir" or
"no, sir" and sprinkling his remarks with a touch of humor -
he
described Robert for the jury as the "one wearing the
toupee."
To support his wife and two daughters, McKinney was carving
totem poles and
wooden bears in Rawhide, Ariz., a western theme town. He
harbored dreams of
re-entering the real estate business when he met Robert and
Patricia in 1989.
He previously worked for their business, Elles Corp., and asked
Robert if
he could again hang his real estate license at the office.
McKinney first met Robert and Patricia through William, a
longtime friend of
McKinney and the godfather to one of his two daughters. The
confessed murderer
had attended Robert and Patricia's wedding, which he described
as a costume
ball at their house.
Robert gave McKinney an office, though not a job, in the summer
of 1989. A
few months later, McKinney believed Robert and Donald were
considering giving
him a job in their new company.
That is when Robert allegedly began to bear his soul to McKinney
about the
problems between the two brothers. McKinney said Robert came to
him one day and
said he had obtained permission to kill Donald and that "we"
wanted you to do
it.
The permission, McKinney said, he believed came from the Mafia
because he
had often heard William talk about his family's ties to the
mob.
In the end, McKinney said, he had changed his mind about the
killings and
even considered going to Donald and began to leave a trail of
clues.
However, as the defense pointed out, McKinney failed to take
various
opportunities to contact Donald about the alleged scheme.
