Financial Planning

A trusted partner to stand side-by-side on your life’s journey.



“Fiduciary duty” is not a term we take lightly. It’s the highest standard of care an advisor can provide. To us, this trusted fiduciary relationship is at the core of all we do.







We listen, we take the time to build a relationship, we research the best options for your needs, and we give you unbiased, substantiated opinions on the best direction for you and your family.


Your needs change over time, so it’s important to understand that financial planning is not a one-time event, but a long-term relationship. You have goals and needs, and Verus can help you achieve them by gaining an understanding of your personal values and hopes for the future. Our success comes when we make a positive impact on your life.


We’re here to help you navigate life’s opportunities and challenges.


Medical needs. Saving for education. Estate planning. Investing. Planning for retirement. Difficult family issues. The loss of a loved one.


We stand alongside our clients as a trusted partner through the highs and lows of life. As you or your family’s situation changes, we can make adjustments to your financial, tax, and investment plans. Whether it’s a small question or big decision, we’re there to guide you. Sometimes, our advice is what you want to hear. Other times, you might prefer we told you differently. But rest assured, our guidance is meant to keep your financial objectives on track to reach your goals.
Things change and nothing is guaranteed, but Verus can be your constant.

What are analysts saying about NCI stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about NCI stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "NCI, Inc. is a leading provider of information technology services and solutions to U.S. federal government agencies. NCI's award-winning expertise encompasses areas critical to its customers' mission objectives including enterprise systems management, information assurance, network engineering, and systems development and integration.   " (5/13/2017)
2. Cowen and Company analysts commented, "NCIT offers an attractive risk/reward profile as its peer-low valuation (5.9x EV/EBITDA)." (4/10/2017)
3. FBR & Co analysts commented, "We take a neutral perspective on NCI shares for the time being, although we are encouraged by the efforts that the company is taking to position itself for success in an evolving government IT landscape. CEO Paul Dillahay was appointed in October 2016, and we believe he is taking steps to increase NCI’s ability to capture new business. Given that we estimate that this company has a very strong recompete win rate, the base upon which the team can build appears fairly stable. That being said, we think that the company has outsized dependence on a few larger contracts —like the PEO Soldier contract that we estimate accounted for 16% of revenue in 2016—and there may be a near-term sentiment overhang on the stock related to the recently disclosed alleged embezzlement by the former controller. The company does have significant capabilities in agile software development, and we believe management’s approach is inspired; there could be an opportunity to become more constructive in the future, but for the time being, we think that remaining on the sidelines would be advisable." (4/4/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for NCI (NASDAQ:NCIT) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.25)Consensus Price Target: $18.33 (8.33% downside)
