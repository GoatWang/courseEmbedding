New Brand Reinforces Commitment to Fitness and Health Improvement Programs, Including Flagship Product SilverSneakers



















January 10, 2017 07:45 ET

 | Source: Healthways, Inc






NASHVILLE, Tenn., Jan.  10, 2017  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Healthways, Inc., (NASDAQ:HWAY) today announced that the company is rebranding and changing its name to Tivity Health, Inc., to better align with its portfolio of fitness and health improvement programs and to position the company for future growth. The company is unveiling the new brand at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, today at 8 a.m. PST, and will begin trading under its new ticker symbol TVTY on the NASDAQ exchange on Wednesday, January 11, 2017. The Tivity Health presentation will be webcast live at http://jpmorgan.metameetings.com/confbook/healthcare17/directlink.php?p=22528. Tivity Health is a leading provider of fitness and health improvement programs, with strong capabilities in developing and managing networks of fitness centers and complementary and alternative practitioners and managing specialty health benefits through its three networks: SilverSneakers®, Prime® Fitness and WholeHealth LivingTM. With a focus on enabling healthy aging, both in place and in the community, Tivity Health will continue to deliver the products and services its health plan and employer customers and its consumers have come to expect.   The name Tivity Health represents the company’s commitment to helping people thrive, no matter their age or stage, and helping customers to provide access to cost effective solutions that keep their members and employees healthy. “Our name evokes the tangible benefits that our products deliver - a focus on physical activity, improved productivity, strong connectivity and spirited creativity, all with a sense of positivity,” said Donato Tramuto, Tivity Health CEO. “After numerous conversations with many of our customers, participating fitness center locations, consumers and analysts, it was abundantly clear that the Healthways brand was largely associated with total population health and the company’s deep roots in disease management,” said Tramuto. “Following our divestiture last July of our total population health services business to Sharecare, we set out to develop a strong corporate brand that resonates with our stakeholders and aligns with our long and short-term growth strategy. The Tivity Health brand allows us to strengthen our focus on customer and member needs and improve our consumer experience.” Tivity Health will continue to focus on its SilverSneakers, Prime and WholeHealth Living networks with targeted approaches to increase engagement and to develop new programming. Longer term, there is additional opportunity to help transform the aging process. The senior population is experiencing explosive growth, and older adults are seeking ways to live with vitality and purpose. Tivity Health has the expert resources to innovate and create programs that drive engagement and results for its customers and consumers. Tivityhealth.com, the company’s new website, will go live tomorrow, January 11. Tivity Health can also be found on Twitter, under the handle @TivityHealth, and on YouTube.

About Tivity HealthTivity Health, Inc., (NASDAQ:TVTY) is a leading provider of fitness and health improvement programs, with strong capabilities in developing and managing network solutions.

With more than 13.5 million Americans eligible for SilverSneakers, over 10,000 fitness centers in the Prime Fitness Network, and more than 25 years of clinical and operational expertise in managing specialty health benefits and networks, including chiropractic services, physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, acupuncture, massage and complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) services, the company touches millions of consumers across the country and works directly with hundreds of healthcare practitioners and many of the nation’s largest payers and employers.Media Contact:

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)
language_code

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

Healthways is a well-being improvement company founded in 1981 and headquartered in Franklin, Tennessee.
In 2003, the company topped a list of "America's fastest-growing small companies," based on earnings/share growth, revenue growth, and total return.[5] The company's name was changed from American Healthways (NASDAQ: AMHC) to "Healthways" (NASDAQ: HWAY) in 2006 in order to better compete for business outside the United States.[6] In 2009 Healthways acquired HealthHonors, a behavior economics company that specializes in behavior change science and use of incentives.
In 2010, Blue Zones and Healthways teamed up to create, support, and sustain a national movement to improve community health and well-being by leading a city-by-city environment transformation with collaboration from both the public and private sectors.[7]
In 2011, Healthways acquired Navvis & Company, a St. Louis-based firm providing strategic counsel and change management services both to enable its healthcare system clients to become future-ready clinical enterprises and to align the incentives for all stakeholders. Their partnership is now called Navvis Healthways.[8]
In 2013, Healthways and The Lampo Group, Inc. — headed by Dave Ramsey — entered into an exclusive agreement for Healthways to deliver the CORE Financial Wellness program as part of its Well-Being Improvement Solution. This program is known as Healthways Financial Well-Being, Powered by Dave Ramsey.[9] Also in 2013, Healthways contracted with Dean Ornish to operate and license his Lifestyle Management Programs. The agreement enabled the company to offer programs for changing lifestyles in order to prevent, treat and reverse certain chronic diseases.[10]
Healthways currently operates eight Well-Being Improvement Centers (WBICs) across the US, and three international facilities.[11]
Other programs[edit]
SilverSneakers is a fitness program designed for older adults who are Medicare-eligible, to group retiree members and to members of other sponsoring organizations.[12] SilverSneakers originated in 1992 when HealthCare Dimensions, Inc. was founded Tempe, Arizona which later merged with several other health-related companies to form Axia Health Management, Inc. In 2006 Healthways purchased Axia.[13]
QuitNet is an online smoking cessation system emphasizing social support as a mechanism for behavior change. The system originated at Boston University's School of Public Health in 1995 as a demonstration project and was spun-out as a for-profit entity in 2000.[14] The company was later merged along with SilverSneakers and others to form Axia Health Management, Inc. and ultimately acquired by Healthways in 2006.
MeYou Health is a subsidiary of Healthways. Daily Challenge, their core product, is an interactive social gaming program designed to suggest slight changes in lifestyle to improve well-being. It incorporates Walkadoo, a wireless pedometer program, a Well-Being Tracker, to monitor changes in lifestyle, Hello 200, a social community element to help users find ways to reduce 200 calories a day-the amount typically needed to create greater fitness, and Quitnet, an online smoking cessation system.[15]

About Healthways
At Healthways, our business is improving well-being. Understanding needs within customer populations. Engaging individuals in sustained behavior change that helps them live longer, happier, more productive lives.
Healthways has always been at the forefront of healthcare transformation. More than 30 years ago, we started with programs to support diabetes care, progressed to help set the first national standards for disease management, evolved to support the continuum of health across populations, and finally expanded our scope from physical health to overall well-being improvement.
Why? We embrace the World Health Organization’s definition of health as “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” Healthier people cost less and perform better, which is the value proposition we offer our clients.
The opportunity to improve well-being is vast
A Healthways study of the potential impact of health risk reduction and prevention for Medicare and commercial populations estimated 10-year savings beyond $2 trillion.
People with high well-being simply cost less. In fact, their medical costs are 20% lower than average, while people who report low well-being cost 50% more. Low well-being also hurts performance. One analysis found an almost $20,000 gap in productivity between surveyed employees with the lowest and highest levels of well-being.
Improving well-being in a substantive way across populations is a sizable challenge. Few companies have the resources and expertise to make it happen.
Healthways has what it takes
We have the definitive well-being measurement instrument in the Gallup-Sharecare Well-Being 5™, and we use it to help our clients understand the opportunities for improvement in their populations across the five key well-being elements: purpose, social, financial, community and physical. Then, we apply our comprehensive, highly configurable Well-Being Improvement Solution to keep healthy people healthy, mitigate lifestyle risk and optimize care.
Healthways experts in research, analytics and medical science have partnered with leading physicians, social scientists, psychologists and others to create high-impact programs — and to prove that they work. We are constantly bringing innovations to the market from fields such as game theory, social network mapping, community-based health transformation and more. 
Explore the opportunities 
Collaboration powers our customer relationships. We have the flexibility to create a solution that’s right for each population. We continually partner with customers on new priorities, from quality improvement to provider-directed well-being improvement strategies. Join us in our mission to create a healthier world, one person at a time.

Healthways, Inc. Is Now Tivity Health, Inc.






GlobeNewswire



Jan 10, 2017 7:45 AM EST













 




























































 NASHVILLE, Tenn., Jan. 10, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Healthways, Inc., (NASDAQ:HWAY) today announced that the company is rebranding and changing its name to Tivity Health, Inc., to better align with its portfolio of fitness and health improvement programs and to position the company for future growth. The company is unveiling the new brand at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, today at 8 a.m. PST, and will begin trading under its new ticker symbol TVTY on the NASDAQ exchange on Wednesday, January 11, 2017. The Tivity Health presentation will be webcast live at  http://jpmorgan.metameetings.com/confbook/healthcare17/directlink.php?p=22528 . Tivity Health is a leading provider of fitness and health improvement programs, with strong capabilities in developing and managing networks of fitness centers and complementary and alternative practitioners and managing specialty health benefits through its three networks: SilverSneakers®, Prime® Fitness and WholeHealth Living TM. With a focus on enabling healthy aging, both in place and in the community, Tivity Health will continue to deliver the products and services its health plan and employer customers and its consumers have come to expect.   The name Tivity Health represents the company's commitment to helping people thrive, no matter their age or stage, and helping customers to provide access to cost effective solutions that keep their members and employees healthy. "Our name evokes the tangible benefits that our products deliver - a focus on physical activity, improved productivity, strong connectivity and spirited creativity, all with a sense of positivity," said Donato Tramuto, Tivity Health CEO. "After numerous conversations with many of our customers, participating fitness center locations, consumers and analysts, it was abundantly clear that the Healthways brand was largely associated with total population health and the company's deep roots in disease management," said Tramuto. "Following our divestiture last July of our total population health services business to Sharecare, we set out to develop a strong corporate brand that resonates with our stakeholders and aligns with our long and short-term growth strategy. The Tivity Health brand allows us to strengthen our focus on customer and member needs and improve our consumer experience."

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.
            








Standards of BBB Accreditation






Build Trust









            Establish and maintain a positive track record in the marketplace.
        

           An accredited business or organization agrees to:

                   1. Have been operational (actively selling products or services) in any BBB service area for at least the most recent 6 months, unless the principle(s) previously operated a similar business with an eligible record (one that qualifies for BBB accreditation).
                

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3. Be free from government action that demonstrates a significant failure to support BBB ethical principles in marketplace transactions (this requires a determination by BBB as to the nature of any violation, whether it was caused or condoned by management, and actions taken to resolve underlying issues that led to the government action).
                
4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

                   5. In its relationship with BBB: 
1. meet all applicable standards within this Code of Business Practices

                            2. cooperate with BBB's activities and efforts to promote voluntary self- regulation within the business' industry
                        
3. honor any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process

                            4. complete the required application and pay all monetary obligations to BBB in a timely manner
                        









Advertise Honestly









            Adhere to established standards of advertising and selling.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Follow federal, state/provincial and local advertising laws.
                

                    2. Abide by the BBB Code of Advertising. Supply, upon request, substantiation for advertising and selling claims. Correct advertising and selling practices, when recommended by BBB.
                
3. Adhere to applicable BBB industry codes of advertising.
4. Cooperate with BBB self-regulatory programs for the resolution of advertising disputes.
5. Use the BBB name and logos in accordance with BBB policy.

                    6. Avoid misleading customers by creating the false impression of sponsorship, endorsement, popularity, trustworthiness, product quality or business size through the misuse of logos, trustmarks, pictures, testimonials, or other means
                







Tell the Truth









            Honestly represent products and services, including clear and adequate disclosures of all material terms.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Make known all material facts in both written and verbal representations, remembering that misrepresentation may result not only from direct statements but by omitting or obscuring relevant facts.
                

                    2. Ensure that any written materials are readily available, clear, accurate and complete.
                







Be Transparent









            Openly identify the nature, location, and ownership of the business, and clearly disclose all policies, guarantees and procedures that bear on a customer's decision to buy.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Upon request, provide BBB with all information required to evaluate compliance with BBB standards. This may include, but is not limited to business name, address and contact information; names and background of principles; business and banking references; licensing and/or professional accreditation; and a complete description of the nature of the business.
                

                    2. Clearly disclose to customers:

                    
1. direct and effective means to contact the business
2. terms of any written contract
3. any guarantees or warranties accompanying a product

                            4. any restrictions or limitations imposed (e.g. limited supply,maximum number available per customer)
                        
5. the business' return/refund policy

                            6. any recurring commitment into which the customer may be entering, including information on how future billing will occur
                        
7. total cost of the transaction, including tax, shipping and handling, and other related charges



                    3. If selling products or providing services on Web sites or via other electronic means: 
1. provide any required product labeling information

                            2. disclose the nature and terms of shipping, including any known delays or shortages of stock
                        
3. provide an opportunity to review and confirm the transaction before the sale is completed

                            4. provide a receipt summarizing the transaction after the purchase
                        









Honor Promises









            Abide by all written agreements and verbal representations.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 
1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached. 2. Honor representations by correcting mistakes as quickly as possible.







Be Responsive









            Address marketplace disputes quickly, professionally, and in good faith.
        

            An accredited business or organization agrees to: 

                    1. Promptly respond to all complaints forwarded by BBB by: 
1. Resolving the complaint directly with the complainant and notifying BBB, or

                            2. Providing BBB with a response that BBB determines: 

                                    1. is professional,
                                
2. addresses all of the issues raised by the complainant,
3. includes appropriate evidence and documents supporting the business' position, and

                                    4. explains why any relief sought by the complainant cannot or should not be granted.
                                





                    2. Make a good faith effort to resolve disputes, which includes mediation if requested by BBB. Other dispute resolution options, including arbitration, may be recommended by BBB when other efforts to resolve a dispute have failed. BBB may consider a business' willingness to participate in recommended dispute resolution options in determining compliance with these standards.
                

                    3. Comply with any settlements, agreements or decisions reached as an outcome of a BBB dispute resolution process.
                

                    4. Cooperate with BBB in efforts to eliminate the underlying cause of patterns of customer complaints that are identified by BBB.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Armed with vague clues from her father's journal, Myung ja and Buok eventually track down the four boys in question.cheap generic kamagra What they find is hardly inspiring: A laid back playboy who delivers noodles, a beauty about to make his TV debut as a back up dancer, a depressed school kid, and a delinquent in deep with the law.dick with viagra The pace moves at a good clip, dropping in tidbits of background for the supergroup to be, but so far the most depth we get is the prickly relationship between Buok and Myung ja.ajanta pharma kamagra review

You're sniping balloons with your butthole, friend.louboutin vide dressing You left dignity behind long, long ago.christian louboutin bianca nudeWell, he does wear a mask, so presumably he still has some shred of shame.harrods louboutinHighlights of his career include imitating a bumblebee in front of a visibly humbled Howard Stern, playing fart music on (the sidewalks of) Broadway, and farting his rendition of the Blue Danube for Simon Cowell on Britain's Got Talent before getting buzzed off the stage.louboutin wiki Later on he was approached by the German (of course) version of the show, where he made it to the semifinals, but ultimately lost to a dancing dog.louboutin backpack.christian louboutin women

Then i went to fucking japan for a year near the ned of high school. In japan, my eyes were opening. I saw lots of crazy shit there that i wanted to emulate, but due to constraints of budget and uniform i couldn really get there. Don't forget to check out the other eBoutiques at GirlSense for inspiration. Celebrity online fashion games will give you ideas and show you how to create a professional looking eBoutique. Also look at the fashion design games created by girls just like you. 

As I said above, I am fine with the idea of being concerned that he might change because of the rise in game. That's just human nature to be concerned. But to judge that he has in fact changed just doesn't work for me. Send Jack off the reservation, put him in a foreign country somewhere, or let him try to instigate some incredibly complex plan instead of stopping one. Whatever the future of the show holds, it owes just as much to its idiocy as to its smarts. Embracing 24's good and bad elements alike makes for a marvelous cocktail like nothing else on TV punctuated by sharp action that always works as pure mindless stimulus..

Healthways is a well-being improvement company founded in 1981 and headquartered in Franklin, Tennessee.
In 2003, the company topped a list of "America's fastest-growing small companies," based on earnings/share growth, revenue growth, and total return.[5] The company's name was changed from American Healthways (NASDAQ: AMHC) to "Healthways" (NASDAQ: HWAY) in 2006 in order to better compete for business outside the United States.[6] In 2009 Healthways acquired HealthHonors, a behavior economics company that specializes in behavior change science and use of incentives.
In 2010, Blue Zones and Healthways teamed up to create, support, and sustain a national movement to improve community health and well-being by leading a city-by-city environment transformation with collaboration from both the public and private sectors.[7]
In 2011, Healthways acquired Navvis & Company, a St. Louis-based firm providing strategic counsel and change management services both to enable its healthcare system clients to become future-ready clinical enterprises and to align the incentives for all stakeholders. Their partnership is now called Navvis Healthways.[8]
In 2013, Healthways and The Lampo Group, Inc. — headed by Dave Ramsey — entered into an exclusive agreement for Healthways to deliver the CORE Financial Wellness program as part of its Well-Being Improvement Solution. This program is known as Healthways Financial Well-Being, Powered by Dave Ramsey.[9] Also in 2013, Healthways contracted with Dean Ornish to operate and license his Lifestyle Management Programs. The agreement enabled the company to offer programs for changing lifestyles in order to prevent, treat and reverse certain chronic diseases.[10]
Healthways currently operates eight Well-Being Improvement Centers (WBICs) across the US, and three international facilities.[11]
Other programs[edit]
SilverSneakers is a fitness program designed for older adults who are Medicare-eligible, to group retiree members and to members of other sponsoring organizations.[12] SilverSneakers originated in 1992 when HealthCare Dimensions, Inc. was founded Tempe, Arizona which later merged with several other health-related companies to form Axia Health Management, Inc. In 2006 Healthways purchased Axia.[13]
QuitNet is an online smoking cessation system emphasizing social support as a mechanism for behavior change. The system originated at Boston University's School of Public Health in 1995 as a demonstration project and was spun-out as a for-profit entity in 2000.[14] The company was later merged along with SilverSneakers and others to form Axia Health Management, Inc. and ultimately acquired by Healthways in 2006.
MeYou Health is a subsidiary of Healthways. Daily Challenge, their core product, is an interactive social gaming program designed to suggest slight changes in lifestyle to improve well-being. It incorporates Walkadoo, a wireless pedometer program, a Well-Being Tracker, to monitor changes in lifestyle, Hello 200, a social community element to help users find ways to reduce 200 calories a day-the amount typically needed to create greater fitness, and Quitnet, an online smoking cessation system.[15]

Our air purifiers might be industrial strength, but they’re perfect for residential settings as well. And they need to be. Poor indoor air quality can wreak havoc on your allergies and contain potentially dangerous bacteria, along with chemicals from common household products. For these reasons, the EPA lists indoor air pollution as one of the top five risks to our health.
So with a portable HealthWay unit in your home, you'll bring more than clean air into your lungs - you’ll bring peace of mind into your life. Our award-winning, state-of-the-art Disinfecting Filtration System (DFS), developed in collaboration with the United States Government and featured in all of our products, captures more than 99.99% of particles at 0.007 micron size - four times better capacity than a HEPA-approved rate. Armed with DFS, units like the HealthWay Deluxe will give you a 90% cleaner home in just 30 minutes.
Watch the video above to learn more about how our cutting-edge technology purifies your home.
Whether it's with our portable air purifiers or our green cleaning products - which replace traditional products that release volatile organic compounds - HealthWay exists to achieve indoor air purity from every possible angle. Our goal is to have your family enjoy the comforts of home, in the healthiest possible way, breathing air that's as clean and clear as it looks.
How HealthWay stacks up against HEPA filtration.
HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) is a standard for air filtration set by the U.S. Government. While this is generally seen as an acceptable measurement for whether indoor air is good or bad, at HealthWay, we only saw it as a starting point. After all, HEPA filters are not 100% effective for capturing particles up to 0.3 microns - which the American Lung Association qualifies as "ultrafine particles." Our technology has four times the filter loading capacity than a typical HEPA rated filter, with an efficiency of  capturing 99.99% of pollutants at  at 0.007 microns  (40x smaller than a typical HEPA efficiency at 0.3 micron).

I saw lots of crazy shit there that i wanted to emulate, but due to constraints of budget and uniform i couldn really get there.

As I said above, I am fine with the idea of being concerned that he might change because of the rise in game. That's just human nature to be concerned. But to judge that he has in fact changed just doesn't work for me.

Whatever the future of the show holds, it owes just as much to its idiocy as to its smarts.

16.  LIMITATION ON ACTIONS BROUGHT AGAINST HEALTHWAYS
You agree that any claim or cause of action arising out of your use of this Site or these Terms must be filed within one year after such claim or cause of action arose or it shall forever be barred, notwithstanding any statute of limitations or other law to the contrary. Within this period, any failure by Healthways to enforce or exercise any provision of these Terms or related right shall not constitute a waiver of that right or provision. 
17.  DISPUTE RESOLUTION
You agree that any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to your use of this Site requires that such claim be resolved exclusively by confidential binding arbitration except that, to the extent you have in any manner violated or threatened to violate Intellectual Property Rights, Healthways may seek injunctive or other appropriate relief.  The arbitration shall be conducted before three neutral arbitrators in Nashville, Tennessee, U.S.A., in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as then in effect.  No claims of any other parties may be joined or otherwise combined in the arbitration proceeding.  Unless otherwise expressly required by applicable law, each party shall bear its own attorneys’ fees without regard to which party is deemed the prevailing party in the arbitration proceeding.  Except for punitive and consequential damages (which may not be awarded), and subject to these Terms, the arbitrators shall be authorized to award either party any provisional or equitable remedy permitted by applicable law.  
BECAUSE THE USE OF THIS SITE REQUIRES THE ARBITRATION OF ANY CLAIMS OR DISPUTES EXISTING BETWEEN THE PARTIES, NEITHER PARTY WILL HAVE THE RIGHT TO PURSUE THAT CLAIM IN COURT OR BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR ANY OTHER COLLECTIVE OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.  THE ARBITRATORS’ DECISION WILL BE FINAL AND BINDING. OTHER RIGHTS THAT EITHER PARTY WOULD HAVE IF SUCH PARTY WENT TO COURT, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION THE RIGHT TO CONDUCT DISCOVERY OR TO APPEAL, MAY BE LIMITED OR UNAVAILABLE IN ARBITRATION.
The award of the arbitrators may be enforced in any court having jurisdiction thereof.  Each party hereby consents (a) to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Tennessee or to any Federal Court located within the State of Tennessee for any action (i) to compel arbitration, (ii) to enforce any award of the arbitrators, or (iii) at any time prior to the qualification and appointment of the arbitrators, for temporary, interim or provisional equitable remedies, and (b) to service of process in any such action by registered mail or any other means provided by law.  Should this Section 17 be deemed invalid or otherwise unenforceable for any reason, it shall be severed and the parties agree that exclusive jurisdiction and venue for any claims will be in state or federal courts in Nashville, Tennessee.
18.  ACKNOWLEDGEMENT 
You acknowledge (a) that you have read and understood these Terms; and (b) that these Terms have the same force and effect as a signed agreement.
19.  GENERAL
In the event that any provision of these Terms is found invalid or unenforceable, it will be enforced to the extent permissible and the remainder of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. Healthways’ failure to act with respect to a breach by any visitor using the Site does not constitute a waiver of its right to act with respect to subsequent or similar breaches.  These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Tennessee without regard to its choice of law provisions. In the event of any conflict between foreign laws, rules and regulations and those of the United States, the laws, rules and regulations of the United States will govern.  These Terms and the Privacy Policy as posted from time to time by Healthways on this Site, and any modifications to the foregoing, constitute the entire agreement between the parties with regard to the subject matter in these Terms and supersede all prior understandings and agreements, whether written or oral, as to such subject matter.
