	Security and Issuer





	This Amendment No. 4 to Schedule 13D (this 

	Amendment
	No. 4

	) amends the Schedule 13D filed on August 26, 2013, as amended by Amendment No. 1, filed on February 7, 2014, Amendment No. 2, filed on July 23, 2014 and Amendment No. 3, filed on December 10,
	2014 (collectively, the 

	Original Schedule 13D

	) and relates to the common stock, par value $0.01 per share (

	Common Stock

	), of Independence Realty Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation (

	IRT

	). The
	address of the principal executive offices of IRT is Cira Centre, 2929 Arch Street, 17

	th

	Floor, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104. This Amendment No. 4 is being filed solely to amend the
	facing pages, Item 1, Item 2, Item 4, Item 5, Item 6 and Item 7, as set forth below. Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined in this Amendment No. 4 have the meanings set forth in the Original
	Schedule 13D.


	 





	Item 2.




	Identity and Background





	Annex I of the Original Schedule 13D is amended and restated in
	the manner attached as Annex I to this Amendment No. 4.


	Item 2 of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended by replacing
	paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 with the following:


	Annex I hereto sets forth the name, business address, title, present principal occupation or
	employment and principal business of any corporation or other organization in which such employment is conducted and citizenship of each director and executive officer of RAIT. The information set forth in Annex I hereto is incorporated herein by
	this reference.


	During the last five years, neither RAIT nor any Subsidiary has been, and, to the best of the knowledge of RAIT and the
	Subsidiaries, no person listed in Annex I hereto has been, convicted in a criminal proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors).


	During the last five years, neither RAIT nor any Subsidiary has been and, to the best of the knowledge of RAIT and the Subsidiaries, no person
	listed in Annex I hereto has been, a party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent jurisdiction resulting in a judgment, decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activity
	subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any violations with respect to such laws.


	 





	Item 4.




	Purpose of Transaction





	Item 4 of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended and
	supplemented by the addition of the following:


	On May 11, 2015, IRT, Independence Realty Operating Partnership, L.P., a Delaware
	limited partnership and a subsidiary of IRT (

	IRT OP

	), IRT Limited Partner, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of IRT (

	IRT LP LLC

	), and Adventure Merger Sub LLC, a Delaware
	limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of IRT OP (

	OP Merger Sub

	 and, collectively with IRT, IRT OP and IRT LP LLC, the 

	IRT Buyer Parties

	), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
	

	Merger Agreement

	) with Trade Street Residential, Inc., a Maryland corporation (

	TSRE

	), and Trade Street Operating Partnership, L.P. (the 

	Operating Partnership

	).


	 


	-12-






	Pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain
	conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, (i) OP Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Operating Partnership (the 

	Partnership Merger

	) at the effective time of the Partnership Merger, whereupon the separate existence
	of the OP Merger Sub will cease and the Operating Partnership will be the surviving entity and wholly-owned subsidiary of IRT OP and (ii) TSRE will be merged with and into IRT LP LLC (the 

	Company Merger

	 and, collectively with
	the Partnership Merger, the 

	Merger

	) at the effective time of the Company Merger (the 

	Company Merger Effective Time

	), whereupon the separate existence of TSRE will cease and IRT LP LLC will be the surviving
	entity and a wholly-owned subsidiary of IRT.


	At the Company Merger Effective Time, each share of common stock of TSRE, par value $0.01 per
	share, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Company Merger Effective Time will be converted automatically into the right to receive, subject to certain adjustments, the following consideration: (i) an amount in cash equal to $3.80
	(provided that IRT may elect, prior to the closing of the Merger to increase the per share cash amount up to $4.56) (such cash amount, the 

	Per Share Cash Amount

	); and (ii) a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the
	quotient determined by dividing (a) $7.60 less the Per Share Cash Amount, by (b) $9.25, and rounding the result to the nearest 1/10,000.


	The description of the Merger Agreement and the Merger contained herein does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by
	reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit F hereto and incorporated herein by reference.


	As an inducement to TSREs willingness to enter into the Merger Agreement, RAIT, as beneficial owner of an aggregate of 7,269,719 shares
	of Common Stock, entered into a voting agreement, dated as of May 11, 2015, with TSRE (the 

	Voting Agreement

	) pursuant to which RAIT agreed (among other things) until the Expiration Date (as defined below) and at every meeting
	of the stockholders of IRT called with respect to the following matters to (including via proxy), (i) appear at such stockholders meeting or otherwise cause its shares of Common Stock , including any shares of Common Stock that it
	acquires after May 11, 2015 (collectively, the 

	Subject Shares

	) to be counted as present thereat for purposes of calculating a quorum and (ii) vote, or cause to be voted, the Subject Shares: (a) in favor of the
	issuance of Common Stock in connection with the Merger, (b) in favor of any other matter that is reasonably required to facilitate the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, (c) in favor
	of any proposal to adjourn a stockholders meeting to solicit additional proxies in favor of the approval of the issuance of Common Stock in connection with the Merger, and (d) against (I) any action or agreement that would reasonably
	be expected to result in any condition to the consummation of the Merger not being fulfilled, and (II) any action which would reasonably be expected to materially impede, interfere with, materially delay, materially postpone or adversely affect
	consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, in each case to the extent that the stockholders of IRT are entitled to consider and vote on such matters(s) at a stockholders meeting. RAIT is not required to vote its
	Subject Shares as described above if (i) the board of directors of IRT changes its recommendation to its stockholders to approve the Merger prior to obtaining such approval or (ii) the Merger Agreement is amended or proposed to be amended
	in any manner that is materially adverse to RAIT (an 

	Adverse Amendment

	).


	In addition, RAIT has agreed, subject to
	certain exceptions, to refrain from (i) transferring or otherwise disposing of any Subject Shares, (ii) depositing any Subject Shares into a voting trust or entering into a voting agreement or arrangement with respect to such Subject
	Shares or granting any proxy (except as otherwise provided in the Voting Agreement) or powers of attorney


	 


	-13-






	with respect thereto or (iii) committing or agreeing to take any of the foregoing actions. TSRE, and such designees as it may name, was appointed as RAITs true and lawful
	attorney-in-fact and irrevocable proxy to vote such Subject Shares for the limited purposes set forth above.


	The Voting Agreement will
	terminate (the 

	Expiration Date

	) on the earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement), (ii) such date and time as the Merger Agreement shall be terminated in accordance with the terms
	thereof, (iii) the date of any modification, waiver, change or amendment to the Merger Agreement that is an Adverse Amendment, or (iv) the End Date (as such term is defined in the Merger Agreement).


	The description of the Voting Agreement contained herein does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the
	full text of the Voting Agreement, a copy of which is attached as Exhibit G hereto and incorporated herein by reference.


	 





	Item 5.




	Interest in Securities of the Issuer





	Item 5 of the Original Schedule 13D is hereby
	amended and restated as follows:


	(a)-(b) RAIT and the Subsidiaries beneficially own 7,269,719 shares of Common Stock, representing
	approximately 21.9% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (based on 33,150,734 shares of Common Stock, the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of May 8, 2015 (which includes 1,282,449 shares reserved for issuance upon the
	exchange of units in IRT OP), as represented by IRT in the Merger Agreement). The shares of Common Stock and percentage of outstanding Common Stock beneficially owned by RAIT and each of the Subsidiaries are set forth in Items 11 and 13 of the cover
	pages of this Amendment No. 4, which items are hereby incorporated herein by reference. Each direct holder expressly disclaims beneficial ownership of all shares held by other direct holders.


	(c) The information set forth in Item 4 of this Amendment No. 4 is hereby incorporated by reference. Other than the Voting Agreement,
	there have been no transactions in the Common Stock during the sixty days prior to the date of this Amendment No. 4 by RAIT, the Subsidiaries or any person named on Annex 1.


	(d) TSRE does not have the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or proceeds from the sale of, the shares of
	Common Stock owned by RAIT and the Subsidiaries and reported by this statement, and RAIT and the Subsidiaries have the right to receive or the power to direct the receipt of dividends from, or proceeds from the sale of, the shares of Common Stock
	owned by RAIT and the Subsidiaries and reported by this statement.


	(e) Not applicable.

	Explanatory Note




	This Amendment No. 3 (this 

	Amendment No. 3

	) relates to the Common Stock of Independence Realty Trust, Inc.,
	a Maryland corporation (

	IRT

	). This Amendment No. 3 is being filed solely to amend the facing pages, Item 1, Item 4 and

	Item 5(a) to reflect the current percentage of the common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the
	

	Common Stock

	) of IRT beneficially owned by RAIT and the Subsidiaries (each as defined in Amendment No. 2 to Schedule 13D filed on July 23, 2014) following IRTs public offering of 6,000,000 shares of Common Stock which closed
	on November 25, 2014. Except as otherwise set forth herein, this Amendment No. 3 does not modify any of the information previously reported by the Reporting Persons in the Schedule 13D as amended to date.


	 





	Item 1.




	Security and Issuer.





	This statement relates to the Common Stock of IRT,
	which has its principal executive offices at Cira Centre, 2929 Arch Street, 17

	th

	 Floor, Philadelphia, PA 19104. The total number of shares of Common Stock reported as beneficially owned in
	this Schedule 13D is 7,269,719 shares, which constitutes approximately 22.9% of the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on a diluted basis.


	 





	Item 4.




	Purpose of Transaction.





	RAIT and the Subsidiaries acquired beneficial
	ownership of Common Stock for investment purposes; however RAIT and the Subsidiaries may be deemed to control IRT by virtue of (i) their collective ownership of 22.9% of the outstanding Common Stock, (ii) Independence Realty Advisors, LLC
	(Advisor), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of RAIT, acting as the external manager of IRT, and (iii) another subsidiary of RAIT managing the properties owned by IRT.






	Neither RAIT nor the Subsidiaries have plans or proposals which relate or would
	result in:


	(a) The acquisition by any person of additional securities of IRT, or the disposition of the securities of IRT
	except that (i) under the advisory agreement between IRT and Advisor, Advisor may receive some portion or all of its management fees in Common Stock, at Advisors option; and (ii) RAIT and the Subsidiaries have rights to register the
	shares of Common Stock held by them for sale under the Securities Act of 1933, as described in Item 6, although as of the date hereof they have no plan or proposal to sell any such shares;


	(b) An extraordinary corporate transaction, such as a merger, reorganization or liquidation, involving IRT or any of its
	subsidiaries;


	(c) A sale or transfer of a material amount of assets of IRT or of any of its subsidiaries;


	(d) Any change in the present board of directors or management of IRT, including any plans or proposals to change the number or
	term of directors or to fill any existing vacancies on the board;


	(e) Any material change in the present capitalization or
	dividend policy of IRT;


	(f) Any other material change in IRTs business or corporate structure;


	(g) Changes in IRTs charter, bylaws or instruments corresponding thereto or other actions which may impede the
	acquisition of control of IRT by any person;


	(h) Causing a class of securities of IRT to be delisted from a national
	securities exchange or to cease to be authorized to be quoted in an inter-dealer quotation system of a registered national securities association;


	(i) A class of equity securities of IRT becoming eligible for termination of registration pursuant to Section 12(g)(4) of
	the Act; or


	(j) Any action similar to those enumerated above.


	 





	Item 5.




	Interest in Securities of the Issuer.





	(a) RAIT and the Subsidiaries
	beneficially own 7,269,719 shares of Common Stock, representing approximately 22.9% of the outstanding Common Stock. The denominator used to calculate the foregoing percentage is the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding as of
	November 25, 2014, following IRTs public offering of 6,000,000 shares of Common Stock. The shares of Common Stock and percentage of outstanding Common Stock beneficially owned by RAIT and each of the Subsidiaries are set forth in Items 11 and
	13 of the cover pages of this Schedule 13D, which such items are hereby incorporated herein by this reference. Each direct holder expressly disclaims beneficial ownership of all shares held by the other direct holders.
