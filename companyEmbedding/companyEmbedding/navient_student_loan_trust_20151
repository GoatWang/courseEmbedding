                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.

Fitch to Rate Navient Student Loan Trust 2015-1; Presale Issued | Business Wire


























































      Fitch to Rate Navient Student Loan Trust 2015-1; Presale Issued
    





February 12, 2015 11:21 AM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings expects to rate Navient Student Loan Trust 2015-1 as 
      follows:
    

      --$257,400,000 class A-1 notes 'AAAsf(exp)'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$472,600,000 class A-2 notes 'AAAsf(exp)'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$20,000,000 class B notes 'A+sf(exp)'; Outlook Stable.
    

      Key Rating Drivers
    

      High Collateral Quality: The trust collateral consists of Federal Family 
      Education Loan Program (FFELP) loans, including approximately 15.1% of 
      rehab loans, with guaranties provided by eligible guarantors and 
      reinsurance provided by the U.S. Department of Education (ED) for at 
      least 97% of principal and accrued interest. Fitch currently rates the 
      U.S. at 'AAA'/Stable Outlook.
    

      Sufficient Credit Enhancement: Cash flow scenarios for the class A and B 
      notes were satisfactory under Fitch's 'AAAsf' and 'A+sf' stresses, 
      respectively. Credit enhancement (CE) is provided by 
      overcollateralization (OC), excess spread and, for the class A notes, 
      approximately 2.67% of subordination provided by the class B notes. A 
      target OC amount equal to the greater of 1.50% of the adjusted pool 
      balance and $3 million must be met before excess cash can be released.
    

      Adequate Liquidity Support: Liquidity support is provided by a reserve 
      account sized at 1.65% of the initial student loan balance which is 
      funded at closing. The required reserve account balance for any 
      distribution dates prior to May 25, 2016 (the step-down date) is 1.65% 
      of the current student loan balance. Thereafter, the requirement will be 
      the greater of 0.25% of the current student loan balance and 0.10% of 
      the initial student loan balance.
    

      Acceptable Servicing Capabilities: Navient Solutions, Inc. (formerly 
      known as Sallie Mae, Inc.) will service 100% of the trust's student loan 
      pool. In Fitch's opinion, Navient Solutions, Inc. is an acceptable 
      servicer of FFELP student loans.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Since FFELP student loan ABS rely on the U.S. government to reimburse 
      defaults, 'AAAsf' FFELP ABS ratings will likely move in tandem with the 
      'AAA' U.S. sovereign rating. Aside from the U.S. sovereign rating, 
      defaults and basis risk account for the majority of the risk embedded in 
      FFELP student loan transactions. Additional defaults and basis shock 
      beyond Fitch's published stresses could result in future downgrades. 
      Likewise, a buildup of CE driven by positive excess spread given 
      favorable basis factor conditions could lead to future upgrades.
    

      Key Rating Drivers and Rating Sensitivities are further described in the 
      pre-sale report titled 'Navient Student Loan Trust 2015-1', and for a 
      further discussion on the representations, warranties, and enforcement 
      mechanisms available to investors in this transaction, please see the

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
