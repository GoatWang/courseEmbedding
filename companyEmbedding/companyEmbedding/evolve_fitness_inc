Inflammation (known as the silent killer) has been identified as the trigger mechanism to multiple health issues, including promoting “leptin resistance.” Leptin is the hormone that plays a significant role in determining whether our bodies burn fat or sugar for fuel. The LifeBar is the only whole food product on the market specifically designed to help the body address leptin resistance, inflammation, and digestion to help the body achieve better health and sustainable fat loss.

 





 




 




 



We believe that a healthy lifestyle should be simple. That’s why we’ve created the best natural, science-driven products that are simple, clean, and great-tasting! Replace your bad habits with smart choices, replace your current spending and save money, and you can enjoy the benefits of Simple Health with Evolv, too!

 





 




 




 




 




 




 



Our advanced nutritional products provide a healthier option to the foods and “quick solutions” that are slowly affecting the health of so many today. Each natural product is formulated to work in complete harmony with your body’s normal cellular functions of defense, repair, and regeneration while supporting gut health and digestion, and helping the body address the risk factors of  inflammation.
