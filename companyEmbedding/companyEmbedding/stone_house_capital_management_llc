 









Stonehouse Capital Management Inc.
Corporate Vision













 










 


 







 





 



Stonehouse was founded in 2000 as an independent portfolio management firm with a vision of applying professional capital markets expertise to the microcap arena for the benefit of a select group of astute Canadian investors in what is essentially a family office.

We seek outperformance by investing in and actively managing a concentrated portfolio of focused positions in small public companies and other unique situations where we believe there to be good opportunity for unlocking value for shareholders.  Often this involves taking a board position or otherwise engaging with management to assist them in the assessment of strategic alternatives.

Hedge Fund Rising Stars: Mark Cohen










      < Back to the Hedge Fund Rising
      Stars










 



                  Mark Cohen



                  Stone House Capital Management





            When William Ackman, founder of activist hedge fund
            firm Pershing Square Capital Management, co-hosted the
            Harbor Investment Conference in Manhattan in February,
            he created plenty of buzz by inviting Mark
            Cohen up to the stage and asking the young
            hedge fund manager to give an impromptu presentation on
            his best current investment idea. Ackman also told the
            crowd that he invests in Cohens Stone House
            Capital Management. Cohen, 31, launched Stone House in
            2010, having previously worked as a senior analyst at
            New Yorkbased long-short equity hedge fund firm
            Force Capital Management. The Chappaqua, New York,
            native, who holds a BS in economics from the Wharton
            School of the University of Pennsylvania, likes to run
            a concentrated portfolio and doesnt fear
            volatility. Stone House manages only about
            $50 million, but as of the first quarter its
            long-short equity funds compounded net annual
            return since inception topped 43 percent. Ackman is
            Cohens largest investor.

VAN BUREN, Ark., May 23, 2014 /PRNewswire/ -- USA Truck, Inc. (NASDAQ:   USAK), a leading North American transportation and logistics provider, today announced that it has reached an agreement (the "Cooperation Agreement") with United Shareholders for the Benefit of USAK, as well as its constituent stakeholders, Baker Street Capital Management, LLC and Stone House Capital Management, LLC (collectively, "United Shareholders").  United Shareholders are collectively the largest shareholder of USA Truck with an approximate equity stake of 28% of the Company's shares.
Under the terms of the Cooperation Agreement, the Company has agreed to appoint Vadim Perelman, Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer of Baker Street Capital, and Thomas Glaser to the Company's Board of Directors.  With the addition of Messrs. Perelman and Glaser, the USA Truck Board expands to nine members.  
The United Shareholders have agreed to vote all of their shares for the election of William H. Hanna and James D. Simpson, III as directors and in favor of the other proposals submitted for stockholder approval at the 2014 Annual Meeting.  The United Shareholders have also agreed to certain customary standstill provisions through the date that is 10 days prior to the deadline for submission of stockholder nominations for the 2015 Annual Meeting.
USA Truck Chairman Robert A. Peiser commented, "As always, the USA Truck Board is dedicated to creating value for our shareholders and we appreciate the constructive input that Baker Street Capital and Stone House Capital have provided towards our mutual goal over the past several months.  We welcome both Vadim Perelman and Tom Glaser to the Board.  We expect Vadim to be a constructive member of our Board who will add valuable financial and strategic expertise that will help us accelerate the execution of our turnaround plan.  Tom has been a senior transportation executive for almost three decades and served as a consultant to USA Truck in 2012 and as interim Chief Operating Officer in 2013.  His deep knowledge of the trucking industry and USA Truck, combined with his sound judgment and professionalism, will also further the Company's turnaround plan." 
Vadim Perelman and Thomas Glaser jointly remarked, "We are pleased to join USA Truck's Board of Directors. We look forward to working with management and the Board to improve operational and financial performance. Having met with the Company's management team and Board, we believe the greatest opportunity for maximizing shareholder value over the long term is the successful execution of the Company's standalone plan to restore USA Truck to a best-in-class, profitable truckload and logistics company."

Financial Planning




What is meant by ‘Financial Planning’?




Simply put, personal financial planning is the process of developing strategies for managing one’s finances that allow you to build long-term wealth while enjoying an acceptable lifestyle. It can be defined as: "a process of determining an individual's financial goals, purposes in life and life's priorities, and after considering his resources, risk profile and current lifestyle, to detail a balanced and realistic plan to meet those goals."  The objective is to achieve financial security. While some people are inclined to think that financial planners only concentrate on giving advice about investments, this is actually not correct. A professional financial planner looks holistically at all aspects of your lifestyle, goals and financial requirements to develop a specific financial strategy suitable for your specific circumstances. The finalised plan will help you reach your financial goals effectively and efficiently.
 


Why do you need a Financial Plan?




While there are often few certainties in the world of finances, there is one: your actions today will impact dramatically on the financial lifestyle you will enjoy in the future. Clearly you are better off with a plan than without. A good financial plan, which highlights the financial choices you need to make, empowers you to achieve your desired lifestyle over time.
However, the unfortunate reality is that most people fail to achieve any significant measure of financial security, much less achieve their desired lifestyle, simply because they lack a specific financial plan based on their personal circumstances. An experienced financial planner will help you create a plan based on sound financial principles. Having such a plan in place should help reduce your financial risk and dramatically improve the prospects that you will achieve your financial goals and consequently enjoy the standard of living to which you aspire.
Many people however, believe that with a little bit of ad hoc planning and patience they can secure their ideal financial lifestyle on their own. Yet when they reach retirement, they may be bitterly disappointed to find themselves unable to afford the future they thought they had planned for.
The reason for this reality is that most individuals, who try to develop their own financial plans, do so in a vacuum. Financial planning is not their full time profession and consequently they may lack the knowledge and intellectual framework that forms the backbone of a systematic financial planning process. More importantly they lack the objectivity to see their finances as a third party would.
 


What Does A Financial Planner Do?




A financial planner (also often referred to as a personal financial planner) is a practicing professional who assists people with a wide variety of personal financial issues including:
Retirement planning,
Investment planning,
Risk management including life assurance and income protection,
Cash flow management,
Tax planning,
Estate planning
Business succession planning (for business owners).
Objectives
People enlist the help of a financial planner because of the complexity of performing the following:
Finding direction and meaning in one's financial decisions;
Understanding how each financial decision affects other areas of finance; and
Adapting to life changes in order to feel more financially secure.
The best results of working with a comprehensive financial planner, from an individual client or family's perspective are:
To create the greatest probability that all financial goals (anything requiring both money and planning to achieve) are accomplished by the target date, and
To have a frequently-updated sensible plan that is proactive enough to accommodate any major unexpected financial event which could negatively affect the plan, and
To make intelligent financial choices along the way.
The financial planning process
The Financial Planning Institute of Southern Africa recommends the following 6 step financial planning process:
Establishing and defining a professional relationship
Gathering data, including goals
Analysing and evaluating your financial status
Developing and presenting financial planning recommendations and/or alternatives
Implementing the financial planning recommendations
Monitoring the financial planning recommendations
Your chosen financial planner should guide you through this comprehensive process

Other Considerations




The individual's goals are used as guideposts to map a course of action on 'what needs to be done' to reach those goals.
Planning often requires consideration of self-constraints in postponing some enjoyment today for the sake of the future. To be effective, the plan should consider the individual's current lifestyle so that the 'pain' in postponing current pleasures is bearable over the term of the plan. In times where current sacrifices are involved, the plan should help ensure that the pursuit of the goal will continue. A plan should consider the importance of each goal and should prioritise each goal. Many financial plans fail because these practical points were not sufficiently considered.
Financial planning should cover all areas of the client’s financial needs and should result in the achievement of each of the client's goals.
 


How do I get in touch with a suitable Financial Planner?




Before agreeing to work with a financial planner, you should a establish that he or she is competent and worthy of trust, and will act in your interests. StoneHouse Capital has strategic partnerships with some of South Africa's top independent financial planners. Our strategic partners are financial planning specialists, registered with the Financial Services Board, ensuring best practice at all times. Many are Certified Financial Planners® (the highest level of professional certification from the Financial planning Institute of Southern Africa).
As your financial plan will need to be adjusted over time as your personal situation and the external environment changes, it makes sense to retaining an ongoing relationship with your financial planner.

About Us




Our Guiding Principles




Setting the Standard in Personal Wealth Management
Planning for your future means making important choices about your life, your financial strategies and your investments. Today’s financial world is dynamic and complex and that can make these choices difficult. For this reason, many of us seek and use financial advice. However, not all financial advice is equal. Some financial advice can be of a poor quality and may be delivered by individuals without the necessary experience and expertise to provide a holistic solution to our real needs.
Your financial situation is unique
To be of true value, the financial advice you receive must be based on a comprehensive analysis and a detailed view of your financial circumstances. It must be given by experts who have the knowledge, experience and wisdom to identify, anticipate and meet your current and future financial needs. The kind of advice you will receive from a StoneHouse Capital Partner.
Through face-to-face advice with a StoneHouse Capital partner, they will help you build a framework for making financial decisions - starting with what you want to achieve in life
Making good financial decisions cannot happen without taking into account your lifestyle, life plans, goals and ambitions. Investment decisions need to be made in the context of all your other choices – like what and where you spend, how much you save, when you want to retire and even what your retirement dream is. StoneHouse Capital Partners look at all your experiences and needs. They will give you reliable and personal advice designed to suit your individual requirements so that you can make deliberate choices and implement strategies with clear goals in mind. A truly holistic, relevant and achievable financial plan.
