John M Rhodes's Experience
Title: Chief Executive Officer
               Company: Corinth Gas
Job Details
               The Corinth Gas and Water Department is a not-for-profit municipal utility governed by the Corinth Public Utilities Commission. This commission controls, manages and operates the natural gas and water distribution systems for the City of Corinth. The Mayor and Board of Aldermen created the Corinth Public Utilities Commission by special charter in June of 1954 to assure the availability of an adequate source of natural gas and water, at a minimum cost consistent with sound economy and good management. The Commission, a separate governing authority, consists of five members that receive no compensation for their services. The Mayor and Board of Aldermen appoint them to each serve a five-year term. There is one commissioner appointed or reappointed annually, so that there are always five (5) members serving continually. The Utility Commission is accountable to the residents of Corinth in accordance with the laws of the State of Mississippi. They discharge their responsibilities by delegating duties to its employees through directives, policy bulletins, resolutions and other actions. Business meetings, not withstanding special called meetings, are open to the public and held monthly at the Gas and Water Department office building. Water is supplied to approximately 6500 customers through nearly 250 miles of distribution piping. Our water source is groundwater coming entirely from the Paleozoic Aquifer deep underground and pumped from 12 operational wells scattered in and around Corinth. Wells average a little more than 500 feet in depth and are screened off in the fractured limestone of the aquifer. The raw water is treated and disinfected separately at each well site, hence the water quality may vary at each location. Large pressure filters are utilized at 5 of the production sites to remove dissolved minerals (primarily iron and manganese) prior to entering the distribution system. Corinth's 6 elevated storage tanks, excellent system hydraulics, good production capacity and emergency pumping capabilities provide the City with excellent fire ratings that result in lower insurance rates for the city and its utility customers. Natural gas is purchased from the most competitive producer or marketer, transported to Corinth via interstate pipeline, and then distributed through the City's over 350 miles of distribution mains and service lines to approximately 7500 customers. The gas originates primarily from offshore Louisiana and arrives at any of the City's three "gate stations" under one of the several transportation contracts with Tennessee Gas Pipeline. It may also be placed in a storage field for later use. Expansion of the distribution system into the county and surrounding communities is ongoing, as the demands for economical and environmentally friendly sources of energy increase.
