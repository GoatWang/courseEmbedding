About YCG - Overview
The Fund’s investment adviser is YCG, LLC (“YCG”). YCG is an investment advisory firm based in Austin, Texas. In addition to serving as the investment adviser to the YCG Enhanced Fund (YCGEX), YCG offers professional investment management services to individuals, investment advisers, and institutions through separate account management. For more information regarding our separately managed accounts, please visit www.ycginvestments.com.
YCG is wholly owned by its principals Brian Yacktman (President , Chief Investment Officer, and Portfolio Manager), Will Kruger (Senior Vice President and Chief Executive Officer), and Elliott Savage (Senior Vice President and Portfolio Manager).
YCG seeks to achieve high risk-adjusted returns using a concentrated, long-term approach. We search for securities that are trading at prices that we believe will produce attractive long-term compound annualized returns with reasonable investment risk.  Generally, we gravitate towards high quality businesses that are low in capital intensity and cyclicality and that are managed with shareholders in mind.

Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. The fund is non-diversified, meaning it may concentrate its assets in fewer individual holdings than a diversified fund. Therefore, the Fund is more exposed to individual stock volatility than a diversified fund. The Fund invests primarily in equity securities without regard to market capitalization, thus investments will be made in mid and smaller capitalization companies, which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility. The Fund may also write put options and covered call options on a substantial portion of the Fund’s long equity portfolio, which have the risks of early option contract assignment forcing the Fund to purchase the underlying stock at the exercise price which may be the cause of significant losses due to the failure of correctly predicting the direction of securities prices, interest rates and currency exchange rates. The investment in options is not suitable for all investors. Covered call writing may limit the upside of an underlying security. The Fund may also invest in foreign securities which involve greater volatility and political, economic and currency risks and differences in accounting methods. Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Investment in lower-rated, non-rated and distressed securities presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher-rated securities.

Product
“Product” refers to certain innate characteristics that makeup a high quality company.  We search for these high quality companies because we believe that, counter-intuitively, high quality businesses tend to outperform low quality businesses over the long term with less volatility. Additionally, we believe these types of businesses tend to significantly outperform their lower quality peers during catastrophic periods. Generally, these companies possess one or more of the following attributes:

The above grid plots capital intensity and cyclicality of businesses. Every business can fit somewhere on this grid. We have chosen a few industries for illustration purposes. As a natural consequence, our process seeks to help us avoid the highly cyclical and highly capital intensive businesses such as airlines and autos. Brian Yacktman, Portfolio Manager, often cites the example found in the airline industry. "When you sum up all the profits in the airline industry since Kitty Hawk, they are negative, despite being one of the fastest growing industries when looking at revenues since that time."
While some businesses may lack these qualities, the process of calculating a forward rate of return (as discussed in Price section) helps us to develop a frame of reference for how much extra return potential we should require before purchasing lower quality stocks. This point should not be overlooked because one would not want to fall into the trap of purchasing a security that appears statistically cheap, regardless of the quality of the assets and without understanding the reinvestment rate or the long-term viability of the business. However, at a price, when the expected forward rate of return appears to sufficiently compensate for the additional risk, we may venture into lower quality fare.

About this Mutual Fund
		The investment seeks to maximize long-term capital appreciation consistent with reasonable investment risk.The fund invests primarily in equity securities without regard to market capitalization that the Adviser believes will produce high, risk-adjusted, forward rates of return. It may also write put options and covered call options on a substantial portion of the fund's long equity portfolio as a means to generate additional income and to tax-efficiently enter and exit positions. It is non-diversified.
	


			The chart above represents the growth of a hypothetical investment of $10,000. The 
			total return is not adjusted to reflect sales charges or taxes, however it does show 
			actual ongoing fund expenses and assumes the reinvestment of dividends and capital 
			gains. If the returns were adjusted to include sales charges, the quoted performance 
			would be lower.

Performance Details



			Total return reflects performance without adjusting for sales charges or the effects 
			of taxation, but is adjusted to reflect all actual ongoing fund expenses and assumes 
			reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. If adjusted, sales charges would reduce 
			the performance quoted.
		

The performance quoted represents past performance, is no guarantee of future results and may not provide an adequate basis for evaluating the performance of the product over varying market conditions or economic cycles. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.

Investment Returns, Risks and ComplexitiesCarefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses before investing. A prospectus, obtained by calling 800-669-3900 or by clicking on the prospectus link, contains this and other important information about an investment company. Read carefully before investing.A mutual fund is not FDIC-insured, may lose value, and is not guaranteed by a bank or other financial institution. Performance quoted represents past performance, is no guarantee of future results, and may not provide an adequate basis for evaluating the performance of the product over varying market conditions or economic cycles. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. The investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate so that an investor's shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.TD Ameritrade receives remuneration from mutual fund companies, including those participating in its no-load, no-transaction-fee program, for recordkeeping, shareholder services, and other administrative and distribution services. The amount of TD Ameritrade's remuneration for these services is based in part on the amount of investments in such funds by TD Ameritrade clients. PLEASE ALSO SEE IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL FUND FEE DISCLOSURE INFORMATIONNo-transaction-fee funds and other funds offered through TD Ameritrade have other fees and expenses that apply to a continued investment in the fund and are described in the prospectus.Mutual funds, closed-end funds and exchange-traded funds are subject to market, exchange rate, political, credit, interest rate, and prepayment risks, which vary depending on the type of fund.  International investments involve special risks, including currency fluctuations and political and economic instability. Asset allocation and diversification do not eliminate the risk of experiencing investment losses.  Fund purchases may be subject to investment minimums, eligibility and other restrictions, as well as charges and expenses.Although certain money market funds seek to preserve their value of your investment at $1 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in such a fund.  Certain money market funds may impose liquidity fees and redemption gates in certain circumstances.Some mutual funds sold through TD Ameritrade impose a charge on the purchase of shares, called a “sales load.” An investor may be able to purchase fund shares through TD Ameritrade without paying a front-end sales load, but an investor  may be charged a fee, called a “contingent deferred sales charge,” when the investor sells or redeems shares.  TD Ameritrade may receive part or all of the sales load.Some mutual funds offer reductions in front-end sales loads (“breakpoints”) for purchases over certain amounts or purchases through Letters of Intent or Rights of Accumulation.  Some funds also offer waivers of those loads, often to retirement plans or charities.  Such breakpoints or waivers will be as further described in the prospectus. You, as the investor, should determine and obtain any breakpoints or waivers or provide TD Ameritrade with sufficient information to assist it in obtaining them.Most mutual funds charge 2.00% on the redemption of shares (including by exchange) held for less than a certain number of calendar days.  Performance figures reported do not reflect the deduction of this fee. If reflected, the fee would reduce the performance quoted. Please refer to the fund's prospectus for redemption fee information. TD Ameritrade may also charge its own short-term redemption fee.See the SEC Guide to Mutual Funds for more information.TD AMERITRADE RISKS OF INVESTING IN FUNDS: PLEASE READ IMPORTANT ADDITIONAL MUTUAL FUND, EXCHANGE-TRADED FUND, AND CLOSED-END FUND RISK DISCLOSURESResearch and planning tools are obtained by unaffiliated third-party sources deemed reliable by TD Ameritrade. However, TD Ameritrade does not guarantee their accuracy and completeness and makes no warranties with respect to results to be obtained from their use. The Investment Profile report is for informational purposes only.The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.Morningstar Investment Management LLC is a registered investment adviser and subsidiary of Morningstar, Inc.

Product
“Product” refers to certain innate characteristics that makeup a high quality company.  We search for these high quality companies because we believe that, counter-intuitively, high quality businesses tend to outperform low quality businesses over the long term with less volatility. Additionally, we believe these types of businesses tend to significantly outperform their lower quality peers during catastrophic periods. Generally, these companies possess one or more of the following attributes:

The above grid plots return on tangible assets and consistency of cash flows of various businesses and industries. Every business can fit somewhere on this grid. We have chosen eight industries for illustration purposes. As a natural consequence of our focus on quality, we generally avoid businesses with both low returns on tangible assets and low consistency of cash flows such as auto manufacturing and commodity mining since this combination of attributes can prove fatal during recessions.
However, we are not, in principle, against buying lower quality stocks. A sufficiently low price can more than offset shortcomings in the underlying business, and our process of calculating a forward rate of return (as discussed in Price section) helps us to develop a frame of reference for how much extra return potential we should require before purchasing lower quality stocks. This point should not be overlooked because one would not want to fall into the trap of purchasing a security that appears statistically cheap, regardless of the quality of the assets and without understanding the reinvestment rate or the long-term viability of the business. However, at a price, when the expected forward rate of return appears to sufficiently compensate for the additional risk, we may venture into lower quality fare.

Neither Morningstar nor its content providers are responsible for any damages or losses arising from any use of this information. Fidelity does not review the Morningstar data and, for fund performance, you should check the fund's current prospectus or other product materials for the most up-to-date information concerning applicable loads, fees and expenses.



1. No Transaction Fee funds are available without paying a transaction fee. No Transaction Fee funds will also be offered without a load or on a load waived basis. However, the fund may charge a short term trading fee or a redemption fee. Other fees and expenses, including those which apply to a continued investment in the fund, are described in the fund's current prospectus. Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC ("FBS"), or its affiliates, receives compensation in connection with (i) access to, purchase or redemption of, and/or maintenance of positions in mutual funds and other investment products ("funds"), (ii) infrastructure needed to support such funds as well as additional compensation for shareholder services, start-up fees, infrastructure support and maintenance, and other programs and/or (iii) a fund's attendance at events for FBS's clients and/or representatives, and opportunities for the fund to promote its products and services. This compensation may take the form of sales loads and 12b-1 fees described in the prospectus and/or additional compensation paid by the fund, its investment adviser or an affiliate. Additional information about the source(s) and amount(s) of this compensation as well as any other remuneration received by FBS or its affiliates will be furnished upon request.
2. Expense caps and waivers are limits that the fund company has placed on the level of the expenses borne by the fund until 4/1/2018 and indicates the maximum level of expenses (with certain exceptions) that the fund would be paying until that time.

Policy Sellers

Do you have a policy that you might want to sell?
At Abacus Life Settlements, we understand that seniors like you may have life insurance policies you no longer need, and you want to learn the facts about life settlements from a source you can trust. (See “What is a Life Settlement?”).
More importantly, you want to feel confident that a life settlement is a safe and sensible alternative to policies that are no longer wanted or on the verge of lapsing. And, you want to feel assured that the entity handling your life settlement transaction will have your best interests in mind.
Abacus Life Settlements is committed to providing you with the knowledge you need to make an informed decision, and to handling your case with the confidentiality, transparency, and urgency that it deserves. As one of the nation’s most experienced and respected life settlement funders, we are a direct licensed buyer and are here to personally assist you with each step of the transaction once you make the decision to sell your policy. (See “Learn How Life Settlements Work”)
What motivates seniors to sell their life insurance policies?
While policyholders 65 years of age and older may qualify for a life settlement depending on medical factors and life expectancy, the most common age for life settlement transactions is 78 years of age or older.
Some seniors have found it helpful to understand how their peers arrived at the conclusion that a life settlement was the most advantageous solution for them. If you are like many other seniors, your motivation to learn more about the benefits of life settlements may stem from one of several situations or lifestyle hardships:
• You may be paying expensive premiums for a policy this is no longer needed or affordable.
• Or perhaps you are in need of immediate cash to help pay for medical expenses.
• It’s also likely that your lifestyle needs have simply changed and you are looking to sell your policy to be relieved of premium payments while keeping a portion of the death benefit for your beneficiaries.
Whether you’re seeking a viable exit strategy for a policy that is about to lapse or struggling to find an immediate source of cash for medical or lifestyle expenses, a life settlement (also referred to as senior settlements) may be a sensible option for those who qualify. (See “When to Consider Life Settlements” )
Why haven’t more seniors heard about the benefit of life settlements?
For more than 20 years, seniors have benefited from selling their life insurance policies to institutional investors operating in what is known as “the secondary market for life insurance.” Although still considered relatively new, the good news is that the industry is poised to undergo substantial growth over the next 20 years as millions of baby boomers advance in age, and as more institutional investors respond to market demand.
Yet, in spite of the obvious benefit to seniors, many consumers are still unaware that a life settlement offers a legally viable solution for those who qualify. It’s critical that more seniors are made aware that there may be a financially responsible alternative to surrendering a policy or letting it lapse, and Abacus Settlements is committed to filling the information void.
There is a combination of reasons for the lack of awareness, the most notable of which is that state regulatory initiatives had been slow to enact licensure guidelines for brokers and funders operating in the marketplace. However, the regulatory environment has greatly matured over the past few years and a majority of state governments (42 out of 50) now regulate life settlements.

VSTOXX® Futures Investable Index
VelocityShares’® suite of two EURO STOXX Volatility ETPs includes 1x long and daily inverse positions on the VSTOXX Short-Term Futures Investable Indices.  The VelocityShares VSTOXX-related ETPs are the only US listed ETPs providing exposure to volatility futures on the European stock market. These ETNs provide institutional investors with exchange traded instruments for implementing views on volatility and hedging risks. Investors can employ  strategies using combinations of these ETNs with other US volatility instruments to create volatility selling strategies, as well as tail risk (black swan) strategies, in addition to expressing short term view on European volatility futures.

ETN Risks
Important information about the VelocityShares ETNs is contained within the current prospectuses. For more complete information regarding the VelocityShares ETNs, download a prospectus from this site, call 1-877-5-VELOCITY or 1-203-992-4301, or write to Prospectus Inquiry, VelocityShares, 17 Old Kings Highway S, Darien, CT, 06820 to request a prospectus. You should read the prospectus carefully before making an investment decision.
Not all risks described below will apply to all products.  Please refer to the applicable prospectus supplement for a detailed discussion of risks applicable to a particular ETN.
An investment in the ETNs involves significant risks. Please read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to an investment in the ETNs in “Risk Factors” in the applicable pricing supplement.
The ETNs are intended to be daily trading tools for sophisticated investors to manage daily trading risks.  They are designed to achieve their stated investment objectives on a daily basis, but their performance over different periods of time can differ significantly from their stated daily objectives.  The ETNs are riskier than securities that have intermediate- or long-term investment objectives, and may not be suitable for investors who plan to hold them for a period other than one day.  Any decision to hold the ETNs for more than one day should be made with great care and only as the result of a series of daily (or more frequent) investment decisions to remain invested in the ETNs for the next one-day period.  Accordingly, the ETNs should be purchased only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of an investment linked to the underlying index and of seeking daily compounding, leveraged long or leveraged inverse investment results, as applicable.  Investors should actively and frequently monitor their investments in the ETNs, even intra-day.  If an investor holds the ETNs for more than one day, it is possible that the investor will suffer significant losses in the ETNs even if the performance of the underlying index over the time the investor holds them is positive, in the case of the leveraged long ETNs, or negative, in the case of the leveraged inverse ETNs.
Because the ETNs are linked to the daily performance of the applicable underlying index and may include either leveraged long or leveraged inverse exposure, adverse changes in the market price of the futures included in the underlying index will have a magnified adverse effect on the ETNs and a greater likelihood of causing such ETNs to be worth zero than if such ETNs were not linked to the leveraged inverse or leveraged long return of the applicable underlying Index.
The ETNs do not guarantee any return of principal at maturity, acceleration or redemption and do not pay any interest during their term.
Although the issuer intends to list or has listed the ETNs on NYSE Arca, NASDAQ, or BATS, a trading market for your ETNs may not develop.  The issuer is not required to maintain any listing of the ETNs on an exchange.  The issuer of the ETNs may delist the ETNs from any exchange for any reason at any time.
The issuer is not obligated to issue any particular amount of the ETNs and may suspend further issuances at any time.  If the issuer suspends further issuances of the ETNs, it is possible that the ETNs could begin to trade at a premium to the indicative value.  Any premium that develops may be reduced or eliminated at any time, including as a result of an announcement that the issuer will restart issuances or an announcement that the issuer will exercise its right to accelerate the ETNs for an amount based on the indicative value.  Paying a premium purchase price over the indicative value of the ETNs could lead to significant losses in the event the investor sells the ETNs at a time when such premium is no longer present in the marketplace or the ETNs are accelerated at the issuer’s option.
The trading price of the ETNs may vary considerably before any valuation date (as defined in each prospectus), due, among other factors, to fluctuations in the price or the volatility of the underlying index, and other events that are difficult to predict. At higher levels of volatility, and since the ETNs are not principal protected, there is a significant chance of a complete loss of ETN value even if the performance of the underlying index is flat.
The daily resetting of each ETN’s leveraged exposure to the underlying index is likely to cause each ETN to experience a “decay” effect, which is likely to worsen over time and will be greater the more volatile the underlying index.  The “decay” effect refers to a likely tendency of the ETNs to lose value over time independent of the performance of the underlying index.  Accordingly, the ETNs are not suitable for intermediate- or long-term investment, as any intermediate- or long-term investment is very likely to sustain significant losses, even if the underlying index appreciates (in the case of the leveraged long ETNs) or depreciates (in the case of the leveraged inverse ETNs) over the relevant time period.  Although the decay effect is more likely to manifest itself the longer the ETNs are held, the decay effect can have a significant impact on ETN performance even over a period as short as two days.
If the level of the underlying index decreases or does not increase sufficiently (or if it increases or does not decrease sufficiently in the case of inverse ETNs), to offset the effect of the Daily Investor Fee and any other applicable fees over the term of the ETNs, the investor will receive less than the amount invested upon sale, early redemption, acceleration or maturity of the ETNs.
Prior to maturity, you may, subject to certain restrictions described in the pricing supplement, offer the applicable minimum number of your ETNs to the issuer for redemption on an Early Redemption Date (as defined in the prospectus). You must offer for redemption at least the applicable minimum number of ETNs (typically 25’000 or 50’000 depending on the product) as set forth in the pricing supplement, or an integral multiple of such amount in excess thereof, at one time in order to exercise your right to cause the issuer to redeem your ETNs on any Early Redemption Date. In addition, the issuer may charge investors a redemption charge of a percentage of the Closing Indicative Value of any ETN that is redeemed at the investor’s option, at a rate as indicated in the applicable pricing supplement.  Please see the applicable pricing supplement for fees or charges relating to the ETNs.
Any payment on the ETNs is subject to the ability of the issuer to satisfy its obligations as they become due.
The risks listed above are not exhaustive. Investors should review the prospectus for each ETN, including all risk factors set forth therein, and consult their independent tax, accounting, legal and financial advisors before investing in any ETN.

ETN Risks
Important information about the VelocityShares ETNs is contained within the current prospectuses. For more complete information regarding the VelocityShares ETNs, download a prospectus from this site, call 1-877-5-VELOCITY or 1-203-992-4301, or write to Prospectus Inquiry, VelocityShares, 17 Old Kings Highway S, Darien, CT, 06820 to request a prospectus. You should read the prospectus carefully before making an investment decision.
Not all risks described below will apply to all products.  Please refer to the applicable prospectus supplement for a detailed discussion of risks applicable to a particular ETN.
An investment in the ETNs involves significant risks. Please read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to an investment in the ETNs in “Risk Factors” in the applicable pricing supplement.
The ETNs are intended to be daily trading tools for sophisticated investors to manage daily trading risks.  They are designed to achieve their stated investment objectives on a daily basis, but their performance over different periods of time can differ significantly from their stated daily objectives.  The ETNs are riskier than securities that have intermediate- or long-term investment objectives, and may not be suitable for investors who plan to hold them for a period other than one day.  Any decision to hold the ETNs for more than one day should be made with great care and only as the result of a series of daily (or more frequent) investment decisions to remain invested in the ETNs for the next one-day period.  Accordingly, the ETNs should be purchased only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of an investment linked to the underlying index and of seeking daily compounding, leveraged long or leveraged inverse investment results, as applicable.  Investors should actively and frequently monitor their investments in the ETNs, even intra-day.  If an investor holds the ETNs for more than one day, it is possible that the investor will suffer significant losses in the ETNs even if the performance of the underlying index over the time the investor holds them is positive, in the case of the leveraged long ETNs, or negative, in the case of the leveraged inverse ETNs.
Because the ETNs are linked to the daily performance of the applicable underlying index and may include either leveraged long or leveraged inverse exposure, adverse changes in the market price of the futures included in the underlying index will have a magnified adverse effect on the ETNs and a greater likelihood of causing such ETNs to be worth zero than if such ETNs were not linked to the leveraged inverse or leveraged long return of the applicable underlying Index.
The ETNs do not guarantee any return of principal at maturity, acceleration or redemption and do not pay any interest during their term.
Although the issuer intends to list or has listed the ETNs on NYSE Arca, NASDAQ, or BATS, a trading market for your ETNs may not develop.  The issuer is not required to maintain any listing of the ETNs on an exchange.  The issuer of the ETNs may delist the ETNs from any exchange for any reason at any time.
The issuer is not obligated to issue any particular amount of the ETNs and may suspend further issuances at any time.  If the issuer suspends further issuances of the ETNs, it is possible that the ETNs could begin to trade at a premium to the indicative value.  Any premium that develops may be reduced or eliminated at any time, including as a result of an announcement that the issuer will restart issuances or an announcement that the issuer will exercise its right to accelerate the ETNs for an amount based on the indicative value.  Paying a premium purchase price over the indicative value of the ETNs could lead to significant losses in the event the investor sells the ETNs at a time when such premium is no longer present in the marketplace or the ETNs are accelerated at the issuer’s option.
The trading price of the ETNs may vary considerably before any valuation date (as defined in each prospectus), due, among other factors, to fluctuations in the price or the volatility of the underlying index, and other events that are difficult to predict. At higher levels of volatility, and since the ETNs are not principal protected, there is a significant chance of a complete loss of ETN value even if the performance of the underlying index is flat.
The daily resetting of each ETN’s leveraged exposure to the underlying index is likely to cause each ETN to experience a “decay” effect, which is likely to worsen over time and will be greater the more volatile the underlying index.  The “decay” effect refers to a likely tendency of the ETNs to lose value over time independent of the performance of the underlying index.  Accordingly, the ETNs are not suitable for intermediate- or long-term investment, as any intermediate- or long-term investment is very likely to sustain significant losses, even if the underlying index appreciates (in the case of the leveraged long ETNs) or depreciates (in the case of the leveraged inverse ETNs) over the relevant time period.  Although the decay effect is more likely to manifest itself the longer the ETNs are held, the decay effect can have a significant impact on ETN performance even over a period as short as two days.
If the level of the underlying index decreases or does not increase sufficiently (or if it increases or does not decrease sufficiently in the case of inverse ETNs), to offset the effect of the Daily Investor Fee and any other applicable fees over the term of the ETNs, the investor will receive less than the amount invested upon sale, early redemption, acceleration or maturity of the ETNs.
Prior to maturity, you may, subject to certain restrictions described in the pricing supplement, offer the applicable minimum number of your ETNs to the issuer for redemption on an Early Redemption Date (as defined in the prospectus). You must offer for redemption at least the applicable minimum number of ETNs (typically 25’000 or 50’000 depending on the product) as set forth in the pricing supplement, or an integral multiple of such amount in excess thereof, at one time in order to exercise your right to cause the issuer to redeem your ETNs on any Early Redemption Date. In addition, the issuer may charge investors a redemption charge of a percentage of the Closing Indicative Value of any ETN that is redeemed at the investor’s option, at a rate as indicated in the applicable pricing supplement.  Please see the applicable pricing supplement for fees or charges relating to the ETNs.
Any payment on the ETNs is subject to the ability of the issuer to satisfy its obligations as they become due.
The risks listed above are not exhaustive. Investors should review the prospectus for each ETN, including all risk factors set forth therein, and consult their independent tax, accounting, legal and financial advisors before investing in any ETN.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!

About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
