Chunk Systems Agent 00Funk Mark II Bass Envelope Filter Effects Pedal
OVERVIEW



Built for bass but also sounds great with guitars and other electric instruments.


The Agent 00Funk Mark II (pronounced "agent double O funk mark two") is an envelope filter pedal that turns bass guitars and other electric instruments into instant funky squelching fatness. The Agent 00Funk Mark II features a highly resonant lowpass filter that sweeps up or down with every note you play giving you a super-punchy automatic wah tone.  Based on the highly acclaimed original Agent 00Funk, the Mark II stompbox squeezes extra funk into a more convenient, easier to use package. Now with true bypass and only the best quality analogue electronics, the Agent 00Funk Mark II is perfect effect pedal for all you clean sound freaks. For maximum squelch, the new envelope input allows you to use a clean envelope prior to fuzz or distortion. Plug the Chunk Systems Brown Dog gated bass fuzz pedal straight in to create some truly amazing synth tones.  Controls In addition to the high-quality metal bypass switch, the Agent 00Funk Mark II has four knobs and a switch:  The pitch control determines the filter frequency when the input is silent. You use it to determine the overall pitch of the filter effect. Turning it lower will tend to give you fatter, bassier tones while higher settings will affect only the higher end of your sound.  The smoothness control determines how quickly the filter sweeps in response to changes in input level. If you set it low, the filter will make large, jerky jumps on each note. This tends to sound squidgy and warbles a little as the filter responds to individual audio cycles. If you set it high, the filter makes smaller, slower movements.  Adjusting the sweep control changes how wide the filter sweeps are. When you set it low, the filter sweeps over a narrow range and is not very responsive to the dynamics of your playing. When you set it high, the filter sweeps over a wider range and the dynamics of your playing will have a greater affect.  The squelch control determines how extreme the filtering effect is by adjusting the resonance of the filter. As you turn it higher, the filter has a higher gain at the filter frequency and accentuates those frequencies more, making a "squelchier" sound.  The switch determines the direction of the filter sweep. In up mode the filter starts low and sweeps up to higher frequencies. This can add a lot of punch to the start of each note as the filter sweeps over the fundamental frequency. In down mode, the filter starts high and sweeps lower, which gives a different type of sound in which the note tends to get swallowed in the middle but returns at the end.




FEATURES
Suitable for bass guitar, electric guitar and other electric instruments True bypass - input is connected directly to output when switched off Four controls allow you to fine-tune your sound Switchable up/down sweep direction Runs from a single 9V battery or external power supply (not included) Convenient form factor includes no-tools battery drawer Sturdy steel case finished in a lurid purple High quality soft-feel foot switch Compatible with Brown Dog for crazy synth tones High quality analogue electronics throughout Two pole lowpass filter with logarithmic sweep for extra funk Wide range non-optical sweep circuit for better resonance and reliability Lovingly manufactured in Australia

The best EF pedal I ever owned and I go back to the original Doctor Q. Great variety of sounds very tweakable. Remember getting a good sound with a EF pedal requires patience and trail and error you have to play it it's a touch and volume thing. No EF pedal is going to magically make you sound like Bootsy but this piece will get you close with some practice and patience.(1 of 1 customers found this review helpful)Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review5/25/2009 4.0all that glitter aint gold By Vancakesfrom Cornwall ct.See all my reviews Comments about Chunk Systems Agent 00Funk Mark II Bass Envelope Filter Effects Pedal:So I saw this pedal and was rather interested so I decided to check out their website. I went on there and listened to their sound samples. they were fantastic. I went to the artists page and saw bootsy collins and the bassist from beck. I said to myself this is the pedal for me so I went and got it. When plugged it in, I was immediately disappointed. Turns out, someone like me who only owns active basses is going to have a difficult time making this thing sound good. Not to mention, my amp isn't fantastic. Don't be put off yet thought. I plugged it into my friends ampeg with his j-bass and it sounded epic. So my advice is, make sure you have at least 1 decent passive bass and you should probably have a decent amp too. I'd classify myself as an intermediate player, and would really only reccomend it to advanced bassists. Anyway, this thing sounds great with the proper equipment, skill, and technical knowhow.Was this review helpful? Yes / No - You may also flag this review3/23/2010 5.0Funk-E-Fresh By Anonymousfrom UndisclosedComments about Chunk Systems Agent 00Funk Mark II Bass Envelope Filter Effects Pedal:Just picked this up today.

The bass guitar is almost always the unsung hero of any band, but a great bass effects pedal can add serious distinction and character to any bass. Whether you’re looking for filters, compressors or just some added oomph for your bottom end, there is an effects pedal out there to keep you sounding your best.  With so many pedal options available to you, it’s important to have a basic idea of what kind of sound you’re trying to achieve. Different pedals provide different effects and no two are exactly alike. For example, pedals such as the Cry Baby 105Q Bass Wah from Dunlop or the PBA-2 Dual Bass Wah from Morley effect the pitch and frequency of your bass by creating a sweeping sound, more commonly described as the â€œwah wahâ€ sound. This effect can be heard everywhere from Miles Davis’ On The Corner record to Metallica’s (Anesthesia) Pulling Teeth, which definitely showcases the diversity of a wah pedal’s sound. If you’re looking for more of a classic fuzz tone for your bass, you’ll definitely want to check out the XO Bass Big Muff PI Distortion Effects Pedal from Electro Harmonix or the Hand-Painted Woolly Mammoth Fuzz Bass Effect Pedal from ZVex. The fuzz sound is arguably one of the most distinct in popular music. The effect is used by a diverse group of artist such as Christopher Wolstenholme of Muse, Robert Sledge of the Ben Folds Five, Ken Jordan and Scott Kirkland of the Crystal Method and Scott Shriner of Weezer. Your lower end will cut through any style of music, from indie rock to electronica, when it’s powered up by some serious fuzz.  Maybe you’re not looking for one specific sound, but rather a wider spectrum from which to explore. If that’s the case you’ll want to check out options such as the BP355 Bass Multi-Effects Pedal from DigiTech or the GT-10B Multi-Effects Pedal. Multi-effects pedals offer you the ability to mix and match between pre-sets and custom settings to come up with sounds that are totally unique, all while keeping you from having to carry a potentially huge pedal board from gig to gig. If you’re chasing a truly custom sound, odds are you’ll find it with a multi-effects pedal.  As you can imagine, the right bass effects pedal for you is simply going to be the one that catches your ear and inspires your playing. Whether you’re carefully exploring the fret board or chugging along like a freight train, there is a pedal that will complement your playing style and bring your sound to the next level.

Guitar pedals and effects pedals are a crucial piece in any guitarist's repertoire. Able to lift your sound from ordinary to extraordinary, these pedals play an important role, especially when you're playing live and in the studio. If you're looking for a way to help ensure your playing stands out from the pack, guitar pedals and effects pedals are definitely the way to go. Some of our most popular brands in this category are Digitech, Korg, Boss, Electro-Harmonix, Line 6, Moog, Ibanez, Dunlop, MXR, Fulltone, and much more.We all have our favorite guitar riffs. They may span genre, playing style, and decade, but one thing they all probably have in common is that they were brought to life with help from a guitar effects pedal. Now, whether you want to recreate the riffs you love or unleash some new ones of your own, you'll have no trouble finding what you need here. So, what type of pedal is right for you? Well, that's a matter of personal preference. Are you looking for some serious effects? Then feast your ears on an option like the B9 Organ Machine Guitar Effects Pedal from Electro-Harmonix, which turns your guitar into a full-bodied electric organ. Another great option is the Windowpane Silicon Fuzz Guitar Effects Pedal from BBE. This pedal is packed with seriously creamy fuzz tones that capture the authentic sound of some legendary performers. Maybe you'd rather the Soul Food Overdrive, or a Big Muff-Pi, or an analog delay, it doesn't matter what kind of effect you're after, you'll find it here. Looking for a lush reverb pedal? Check out the Digitech Polara, featuring Lexicon Reverb sounds, this pedal will surely add texture to your sound. Of course, in this section you'll also find plenty of practical pedals such as the TU-3 Chromatic Pedal Tuner from Boss and the Electronic Polytune 2 Pedal Tuner from TC. Pedals such as these will ensure that you're all tuned up and ready to roll when you hit the stage.Whether you're a hobbyist who's playing for fun or a pro on tour with the band, a solid collection of guitar and effects pedals can go a long way in helping you create a signature sound. So what are you waiting for? Find the pedals that are right for you and get ready to rock!

Bass-ed in Sydney Australia, Chunk Systems specializes in highly innovative, high quality custom effects for the low end. Their first product the Agent 00Funk took the underground by storm and offered many unique filtering features and signal routing options unavailable from other products.

Chunk Systems Effects In 2006, Chunk Systems updated the Agent Funk and made it even more user-friendly and affordable than before. In addition they created a sister pedal, The Brown Dog Gated Fuzz, that works in conjunction w/the A00F Mark II to provide even more bizarre filter and fuzz effects and analog synth textures.

In august 2008, Chunk will unveil the mother of all Bass effects - the Octavius Squeezer.  The O.S. is the world's first programmable analog bass synthesizer effect in a compact stompbox.  it features both the Agent Funk and Brown Dog circuits as well as Octave Down, Octave Up, and Two Octave Up voices, beat-locked effects and a plethora of other goodies.  With the O.S.'s simple user interface amazingly fat analog synth sounds can be created, stored, and recalled at the touch of a button, or written to the onboard flash memory card and stored for future use.  Simple yet ingenious, compact yet complete, the Octavius Squeezer is the future of Bass effects!

Each Chunk Systems product is lovingly assembled by hand Down Under and comes with a 3-year parts and labor warranty. Look for more Chunk Systems Bass products soon!

AGENT FUNK MARK II 

$299.00




***DISCONTINUED PEDAL - SOLD OUT***
An updated version of Chunk Systems highly-acclaimed envelope filter, the Agent 00Funk Mark II trims some fat from the original design and leaves nothing but the funk! Housed in a smaller, sturdier chassis with a no-tools battery compartment, the Agent Funk will turn your electric bass, guitar, keyboard or virtually any mono sound source into instant funky fatness. Four independently variable parameters control a highly resonant, super linear 12 dB/octave low-pass filter that can go from super-smooth filtering to squelching sonic chaos. Control Voltage Out lets the Agent 00Funk control external devices, allowing for even further sonic mayhem. Hook it up in various combinations with the Brown Dog Gated Fuzz and achieve some of the most unique synth-bass sounds ever! If you’re serious about your funk, then the Agent 00Funk Mark II is your only serious choice in filters! 

 

Check out the new video review of Agent 00Funk Mark II and Brown Dog from Ed Friedland at Guitar World. You can read the full review here.

Uptown funk (Mark Ronson ft Bruno Mars)
$11.90–$19.90





Uptown funk Sheet music is an arrangement written for String quartet. You can choose to buy score, parts or both score and parts together.
“Uptown Funk” is a song recorded by English producer Mark Ronson, with guest vocals by American recording artist Bruno Mars, for Ronson's fourth studio album, Uptown Special (2015). The song is heavily influenced by the “Minneapolis sound” of the early 80s, pioneered by Prince, and The Time with Morris Day, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. According to Ronson in Rolling Stone the song “animates a Minneapolis groove.”
Here you can listen to string quartet “String Along”, and one part of their performance of our arrangement “Uptown Funk”

Description

The Agent 00Funk Mark II (pronounced "agent double O funk mark two") is an envelope filter pedal that turns bass guitars and other electric instruments into instant funky squelching fatness. The Agent 00Funk Mark II features a highly resonant lowpass filter that sweeps up or down with every note you play giving you a super-punchy automatic wah tone. Based on the highly acclaimed original Agent 00Funk, the Mark II stompbox squeezes extra funk into a more convenient, easier to use package. Now with true bypass and only the best quality analogue electronics, the Agent 00Funk Mark II is perfect effect pedal for all you clean sound freaks. For maximum squelch, the new envelope input allows you to use a clean envelope prior to fuzz or distortion. Plug the Chunk Systems Brown Dog gated bass fuzz pedal straight in to create some truly amazing synth tones. Controls In addition to the high-quality metal bypass switch, the Agent 00Funk Mark II has four knobs and a switch:The pitch control determines the filter frequency when the input is silent. You use it to determine the overall pitch of the filter effect. Turning it lower will tend to give you fatter, bassier tones while higher settings will affect only the higher end of your sound.The smoothness control determines how quickly the filter sweeps in response to changes in input level. If you set it low, the filter will make large, jerky jumps on each note. This tends to sound squidgy and warbles a little as the filter responds to individual audio cycles. If you set it high, the filter makes smaller, slower movements.Adjusting the sweep control changes how wide the filter sweeps are. When you set it low, the filter sweeps over a narrow range and is not very responsive to the dynamics of your playing. When you set it high, the filter sweeps over a wider range and the dynamics of your playing will have a greater affect. The squelch control determines how extreme the filtering effect is by adjusting the resonance of the filter. As you turn it higher, the filter has a higher gain at the filter frequency and accentuates those frequencies more, making a "squelchier" sound.The switch determines the direction of the filter sweep. In up mode the filter starts low and sweeps up to higher frequencies. This can add a lot of punch to the start of each note as the filter sweeps over the fundamental frequency. In down mode, the filter starts high and sweeps lower, which gives a different type of sound in which the note tends to get swallowed in the middle but returns at the end.
