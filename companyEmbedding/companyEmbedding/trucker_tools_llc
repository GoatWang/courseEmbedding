Truck Tool Boxes - Aluminum, Steel, and Diamond Plate







































Truck Tool Boxes to Organize Your Stuff



Advanced Northwest Welding, LLC is a proud distributor of Highway Products, Inc. truck tool boxes. We sell and install Highway Products on all kinds of trucks and trailers.We also will design, build, and install custom toolboxes for your truck or trailer.Off the shelf or custom design, Advanced Northwest Welding sells and installs aluminum truck tool boxes, stainless steel truck tool boxes, and diamond plate truck tool boxes.



Highway Products Truck Tool Boxes
Why Highway Products truck tool boxes?Highway Products Inc., has built its reputation by manufacturing the toughest semi truck and trailer toolboxes on the highway.

These unique line of boxes are constructed of the thickest grade of aluminum stock utilized in the industry: 1/8-inch thick marine grade weather-resistant diamond plate aluminum. What this means is that the box will stand up to use and abuse year after year.These boxes are tough!

For another example of Highway Products' commitment to quality and innovation, take the Top Lid tool boxes. These tool boxes are unique in the industry.You can get a lot of cargo in the boxes and it is pretty easy to retrieve the cargo from inside the tool box when you need it.Great design. Great security.Very little wasted space.Back to Top of Page
Aluminum Truck Tool Boxes
The truck pictured to the bottom is an example of the custom work performed by Advanced Northwest Welding.

Aluminum truck tool boxes are lighter than steel and don't rust. They are the perfect addition to any utility truck body.One of the benefits of aluminum tool boxes is that they can be significantly lighter than steel tool boxes. And with the price of fuel, this can be a factor with your operational costs. If you own a fleet of vehicles, fuel cost savings can be significant over time.However, if you really don't drive that many miles, then the choice of aluminum or steel truck tool boxes really becomes an individual preference.Let Advanced Northwest Welding, LLC help you decide. Call us today and let us give you custom quotes for both the purchase and installation.Back to Top of Page
Stainless Steel Truck Tool Boxes
Truck tool boxes are by and large constructed of aluminum or steel and fit snugly against the back of the truck cab. Aluminum boxes are advantages because they’re lightweight, improving fuel economy. Steel boxes are heavier, which means they are tougher and more secure.A step up from steel tool boxes are stainless steel truck tool boxes. Stainless steel provides the security of regular steel, without the risk of corrosion.Stainless steel is a bit more pricey than other materials, but if you have security in mind and care about what’s inside your toolbox, it’s worth it.Back to Top of Page
Diamond Plate Truck Tool Boxes
Why have just a tool box for your truck when you can have a diamond plate tool box?Aluminum diamond plate is a thick, rugged and durable material, preferred by professionals everywhere for truck tool boxes.

Steel, even painted steel, will show its age after use - scratches and dents will eventually show on painted sheet metal.And to be honest, sheet metal, even painted sheet metal, rusts after a while.And because your truck is designed to work, it is going to be exposed to the weather and wind and rain.

But diamond plate will still look great year after year.For custom sales and service of diamond plate truck tool boxes, contact us today.Back to top of pageBack to Home Page

Find a Truck Stop




                                                        Trucker Tools has the accurate list of truck stops and real-time fuel prices.

What our customers say about us







"This is a great, underrated app for truckers, here! Not only can it help you find just about any truck related point of interest, but also gives you as much information as available about them. Best thing about it I love to use it for, is I can put in my Point A and Point B, and it'll tell me every single truck stop along my whole entire route, from the big mega truck stop chains, to the little hole in the wall mom and pop truck stops. Beats the snot out of the overrated Trucker Path app!“

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.

Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
