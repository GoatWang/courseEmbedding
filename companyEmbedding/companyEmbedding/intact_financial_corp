History[edit]




Intact Financial corporate office


Started out as the Halifax Fire Insurance Association in 1809. In the 1950s, Dutch insurer Nationale-Nederlanden (NN) established itself in Canada by acquiring the Halifax Insurance Company; Dutch immigration to Canada attracted Nationale-Nederlanden to the country.
In the 1980s, the company continued to grow with the acquisition of three well-known regional insurers - Commerce Group and Belair in Quebec, and Western Union in Alberta. In 1991, Nationale-Nederlanden merged with NMB Postbank to create ING Group, one of the first bank assurance groups in the world. In 1993, as the company’s business continued to grow, it brought together its insurance companies that had been operating as separated entities under the umbrella of ING Canada.
The company continued to grow with the acquisition of Guardian Insurance’s business in Canada in 1998, followed by the acquisition of Zurich Canada’s home, auto and small and medium business insurance portfolio in 2001.
In 2004, the company acquired Allianz Canada. That was soon followed with an Initial Public Offering and the start of trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange with ING Group retaining 70% ownership.
On March 10, 2009, ING Insurance Company of Canada changed its name to Intact Insurance Company. On May 13, 2009, ING Canada Inc. changed its name to Intact Insurance.
Business and business segments[edit]
Intact's multi-channel distribution operates under the following distinct brands:

Intact Insurance

Intact Insurance is Canada’s largest home, auto and business insurance company, the choice of more than four million consumers. Its coast-to-coast presence and strong relationship with insurance brokers mean the company can provide the outstanding service, comfort and continuity customers deserve.

belairdirect

Established in 1955, belairdirect is a direct-to-consumer P&C insurance company that provides complete car and home insurance solutions direct to consumers from coast to coast. In 1997, belairdirect became the first car insurance company in North America to offer an online car insurance quote directly to consumers. The company became an Intact Financial Corporation company in 1989.

BrokerLink

Established in 1991, the BrokerLink companies, which include Canada Brokerlink Inc., Canada Brokerlink (Ontario) Inc. and Macdonald Chisholm Trask Insurance, together constitute one of the largest Canadian property and casualty insurance brokerage operations with over 115 offices supported by more than 1,400 employees across Ontario, Alberta and Atlantic Canada. The BrokerLink companies are subsidiaries of Intact Financial Corporation (TSX: IFC).[16]
Leadership[edit]
Charles Brindamour is the Chief Executive Officer of Intact Financial Corporation.
Corporate Social Responsibility[edit]
Since 2004, the Intact Foundation has contributed over $26 million in charitable funding to over 1,300 organizations nationally. This represents an average of 1/4000th of their premium income approximately. The Intact Foundation is governed by employees of Intact Financial Corporation, Intact Insurance, and belairdirect, and focuses its resources in two arenas – climate change adaptation and supporting at-risk youth.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Intact Insurance is the largest provider of property and casualty insurance in Canada with close to $8.0 billion in annual premiums.[2] Formerly an ING Group subsidiary, ING Canada, Intact became a widely held Canadian company and changed its name from ING Canada to Intact Insurance in 2009.
Supported by over 12,000 employees, the company insures more than five million individuals and businesses through its insurance subsidiaries and is the largest private sector provider of P&C insurance in British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, Québec, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland & Labrador. The company distributes insurance under the Intact Insurance brand through a wide network of brokers, including its wholly owned subsidiary, BrokerLink, and directly to consumers through belairdirect.
In 2011, Intact acquired AXA Insurance's Canadian operations for $2.6 billion.[3] In 2012, Intact acquired Jevco Insurance Company for $530 million,[4] which allowed the company to expand its service to brokers through the opportunity to offer their clients complementary specialized products such as recreational vehicle insurance and specialty lines products to businesses.
In 2014, Intact acquired Metro General Insurance Corporation, further strengthening its market position in Newfoundland and Labrador. In 2015, Intact acquired Canadian Direct Insurance Incorporated (CDI), extending its direct-to-consumer operations from coast to coast.[5]
Direct premiums written (the amount of money customers paid for policies written during the year) has grown over the years. In 2015, they totalled $7.9 billion.[6]
The company has ranked well in a number of customer satisfaction surveys;[7]
In the J.D. Power 2015 Canadian Home Insurance Satisfaction Study,[8] belairdirect was ranked highest in the Atlantic/Ontario region with a score of 799 and in the Quebec region with a score of 814 and Intact Insurance ranked third with a score of 791.[9]

History[edit]




Intact Financial corporate office


Started out as the Halifax Fire Insurance Association in 1809. In the 1950s, Dutch insurer Nationale-Nederlanden (NN) established itself in Canada by acquiring the Halifax Insurance Company; Dutch immigration to Canada attracted Nationale-Nederlanden to the country.
In the 1980s, the company continued to grow with the acquisition of three well-known regional insurers - Commerce Group and Belair in Quebec, and Western Union in Alberta. In 1991, Nationale-Nederlanden merged with NMB Postbank to create ING Group, one of the first bank assurance groups in the world. In 1993, as the company’s business continued to grow, it brought together its insurance companies that had been operating as separated entities under the umbrella of ING Canada.
The company continued to grow with the acquisition of Guardian Insurance’s business in Canada in 1998, followed by the acquisition of Zurich Canada’s home, auto and small and medium business insurance portfolio in 2001.
In 2004, the company acquired Allianz Canada. That was soon followed with an Initial Public Offering and the start of trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange with ING Group retaining 70% ownership.
On March 10, 2009, ING Insurance Company of Canada changed its name to Intact Insurance Company. On May 13, 2009, ING Canada Inc. changed its name to Intact Insurance.
Business and business segments[edit]
Intact's multi-channel distribution operates under the following distinct brands:

Intact Insurance

Intact Insurance is Canada’s largest home, auto and business insurance company, the choice of more than four million consumers. Its coast-to-coast presence and strong relationship with insurance brokers mean the company can provide the outstanding service, comfort and continuity customers deserve.

belairdirect

Established in 1955, belairdirect is a direct-to-consumer P&C insurance company that provides complete car and home insurance solutions direct to consumers from coast to coast. In 1997, belairdirect became the first car insurance company in North America to offer an online car insurance quote directly to consumers. The company became an Intact Financial Corporation company in 1989.

BrokerLink

Established in 1991, the BrokerLink companies, which include Canada Brokerlink Inc., Canada Brokerlink (Ontario) Inc. and Macdonald Chisholm Trask Insurance, together constitute one of the largest Canadian property and casualty insurance brokerage operations with over 115 offices supported by more than 1,400 employees across Ontario, Alberta and Atlantic Canada. The BrokerLink companies are subsidiaries of Intact Financial Corporation (TSX: IFC).[16]
Leadership[edit]
Charles Brindamour is the Chief Executive Officer of Intact Financial Corporation.
Corporate Social Responsibility[edit]
Since 2004, the Intact Foundation has contributed over $26 million in charitable funding to over 1,300 organizations nationally. This represents an average of 1/4000th of their premium income approximately. The Intact Foundation is governed by employees of Intact Financial Corporation, Intact Insurance, and belairdirect, and focuses its resources in two arenas – climate change adaptation and supporting at-risk youth.

Intact Financial Corporation (www.intactfc.com) is the largest provider of property and casualty insurance in Canada. Intact offers home, auto and business insurance through Intact Insurance, belairdirect, Grey Power, BrokerLink, and Jevco.
After successfully deploying Guidewire ClaimCenter® earlier this year, Intact again called on Guidewire to help simplify its technology footprint and upgrade its systems. Intact selected BillingCenter to replace its current billing systems and deliver a single flexible alternative that could be easily maintained and adapted. Intact plans to deploy BillingCenter in a phased implementation approach starting with its direct billing in personal lines.






Our previous experience with Guidewire played a large part in our decision to implement BillingCenter. But Guidewire’s best-in-class technology speaks for itself. We are now implementing a billing solution that will grow with us and deliver operational efficiencies and cost benefits well into the future.Mark Tullis, Executive Vice President, Intact Financial Corporation
