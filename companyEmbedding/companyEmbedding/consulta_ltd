THE QUARTER NOTE
FORMALDEHYDE AND YOU
Formaldehyde is ubiquitous.  If you are allergic to it, it will cause you to suffer asthma-like pulmonary function deficits that will not only be triggered by formaldehyde itself, but also by other aldehydes commonly found in perfumes and other odorants.  It also is capable of causing allergic reactions on skin in sensitized individuals.  Formaldehyde is typically present in most homes from numerous sources including particle board which may be used in various cabinets, flooring, urea-formaldehyde insulation, tobacco smoke, fumes from gas stoves, cooking processes, and various consumer products including cosmetics and crease-resistant new clothing.  Particle board is made up of wood chips held together with a phenol-formaldehyde resin which can off-gas formaldehyde.  If you think that you are allergic to formaldehyde, you can go to your allergist and be patch tested; but this test is only meaningful if the results are positive.  A negative test does not mean that you are not allergic to formaldehyde.  Patch tests for formaldehyde have been shown to be unreliable in many cases.  Formaldehyde is also a known animal carcinogen producing nasal tumors in rats, and a suspect human carcinogen linked to lymphatic and hematopoietic cancers including lymphoma, multiple myeloma, and leukemia; but the association is not strong.  Formaldehyde also has been shown to result in mutagenicity and to produce chromosomal aberrations.

Our Services - In Brief
 
There are several statutes, regulations and best practice obligations on anyone making vertical transportation equipment available for use (the "Duty-Holder") whether it be a building owner or manager, dependent on the type of equipment and the premises. 
 
These include the requirement for having your equipment regularly inspected and certified by competent personnel, you keeping a documented record and acting on the recommendations raised during said inspections, and to have said equipment regularly maintained to the appropriate standard to ensure the safety of users.
 
Your obligations are covered by, not exhaustively:
 
The Health & Safety at Work Act
LOLER
PUWER
SAFED (LG1) Supplementary Testing
The Accessibility Act 2010 (Formerly DDA)
The Machinery Directive
Given the number of regulations and the fact that they are often inter-dependent, it is easy to see how many duty-holders are unsure as to whether they are complying and what they need to do to ensure that they are.
 
At ConsultaLift Ltd. we have 35 years of industry experience and keep ourselves up to date with latest developments and changes to regulations.
 
We can carry out an audit and thereafter provide guidance to ensure that you are compliant with your responsibilities.
Compliance
Your Lifts and Escalators not only have a direct effect on your business in moving your workforce efficiently in a comfortable and timely manner,  but are also often the first impression clients have of your business when visiting your organisation.
 
As your equipment ages, component parts wear at different rates dependent on the traffic and usage and quite often this can be resolved by partial modernisation which deals specifically with those components rather than replacement of the entire installation.
 
It is possible, on certain types of Maintenance Contract, that the client will have paid, over a number of years of repetitive callouts for the cost of a Major or full refurbishment or complete replacement of the installation, whilst suffering from extended downtime that could all be avoided by taking the appropriate action and investing in the replacement of the correct parts of the installtion at the appropriate time.
 
There is also a fine balance dependent on various circumstances and factors which also mean that sometimes repeated partial modernisations during the lifespan of the installation are less cost effective in the long run than "premature" complete replacement.
 
Given that, dependent on the type of maintenance contract,  making continuing running repairs to failing equipment, could in the long term increase the total cost of ownership exponentially to your detriment, and beyond the original cost of replacement, the engagement of a reputable experienced Lift Consultant to give independent advice and recommendations based upon life expectancy and lifecycle costs puts you, the client, back in the driving seat and ensures that your investment is protected and correctly and efficiently targetted saving you money over the expected lifespan of the equipment.
Modernisation
At ConsultaLift Ltd. we utilise our 35 years of industry experience to assist you and specialise in carrying out the following:
 
Condition surveys and reports, including component life expectancy
Dilapidation surveys and reports
Health & Safety surveys and reports
Portfolio condition reporting and investment strategy
Tailored modernisation specifications 
Competitive Tendering, Analysis and Contractor selection
Project progress and management
Project acceptance inspections
Defects liability period inspections​
A new Lift or Escalator installation is a major capital investment necessitating the requirement for thorough planning, research and design in order to ensure that it is not only both fit for the purpose it is intended but also continues to give reliable service for the maximum possible time and thus safeguard and maximise your initial investment.
 
Whether in a completely new build or in a re-purposed existing building,be it a completely new installation or the replacement of an existing one, there are numerous factors to consider from the outset such as:
 
Will the building occupancy be served adequately to accepted standards by the planned amount and type of lifts post-project?
 
Is a like for like replacement the most efficient way forward or is there another solution which may free up space in my building and or reduce costs and improve reliability?
 
Are the lifts being recommended to me :
 
Fit for the usage they are intended for?
Of sufficient quality and with a known spares supply chain?
Being installed to a price rather than a suitable specification? 
Open protocol to ensure freedom of selection of maintenance contractor in future?​
Compliant with current regulations and are any building or planning issues to consider or any deviations or additional permissions   to be applied for?
​We are able to assist you with all the above considerations. We  keep ourselves up to date with technological developments as well as maintaining a list of 'approved' manufacturers and contractors who we assess and audit over several projects and installations in order to ensure that our recommendations are relevant and suitable for your particular application.
At ConsultaLift Ltd. we utilise our 35 years of industry experience to assist you and specialise in carrying out the following:
 
Feasibility studies and surveys
Project design services
Traffic studies and analysis
Specifications for New Lifts/Escalators
Competitive Tendering, analysis and contractor selection
Project progress inspections and project management
Project acceptance inspections
Defects liability period inspections
​
New Installations
The  appropriate level, standard and frequency of maintenance is both a legal requirement  and also best practice covered by several items of legislation and recommendations.
 
As the duty-holder (defined as any person or organisation making Vertical Transport equipment or machinery available for use or the management thereof)  it is incumbent on you to ensure the ongoing maintenance and  safety of the installation and that of its passengers / users.
 
Aside from compliance with the above, there are also several factors for you to consider such as:
 
Is maintenance being carried out to the appropriate standard and frequency by my existing contractor?
Am I getting best value in terms of the type of contract and inclusions/exclusions therein? Is my contractor responsive and promptly available when I need them?
Am I sure that my Lift Contractor is acting appropriately and in a timely manner on recommendations and requirements highlighted in my thorough examination reports (often referred to as insurance inspections) ?
I'm getting what seems to be an inordinate amount of breakdowns, is this due to the age and wear of the equipment, is this normal, and what can I do about it?
Am I being supplied with, and keeping sufficient records of, maintenance visits, call-outs, inspections and certification to satisfy the legal requirements and my obligations?
Can I get an overview of all the equipment in my portfolio in one easily accessible and understandable format in order to assist me in making the right decisions? ​
I'm being told that my equipment is obsolete. What now?
​We are able to assist you with all the above considerations and also maintain an 'approved'  list of contractors whose standards of service are consistent and known and are audited  regularly in order to ensure that our recommendations are relevant and suitable for your particular application.
At ConsultaLift Ltd. we utilise our 35 years of industry experience to assist you and specialise in carrying out the following:
 
Maintenance audits
Review of existing maintenance contracts and arrangements
Regular maintenance review meetings with your contractor
Maintenance management and reporting
Tailored maintenance specifications including KPI and agreed SLA
Competitive Tendering, analysis and contractor selection
​
Maintenance
At ConsultaLift Ltd. we utilise our 35 years of industry experience and specialise in assisting you with the following:
 
It is often the case, especially over time, that legislation and standards change and are improved upon.
 
You may also be in the process of considering a modernisation to your lifts in which case you will want to ensure that the package being proposed will meet the current requirements (We often find, especially with partial modernisations that the client has not been fully advised of items which may be central to Health & Safety and which have not been included within the proposed project and which, if included would be both more cost-effective to carry out as part of the modernisation and also ensure that the modernised lift is fully compliant. 
 
Unless we are already acting on your behalf (in which case we've got this covered for you) in designing the project and producing the specification, you would benefit from engaging us to carry out a Health & Safety inspection to ensure that your intended works comply with EN81 and other standards.
 
Are you about to take over a new building, perhaps on a repair & replace type lease, or perhaps wish to know that a property you are intending to acquire does not hold any surprises such as major works to the lifts before it can be considered fit for your business?
 
Engaging us to carry out a Pre-Acquisition condition Survey could save you a considerable sum of money and inconvenience.
 
Are you up to speed with the latest legislation in terms of Public access? 
 
We can carry out full Accessibility Act (2010)  surveys to ensure you are compliant.
Have an ongoing project and perhaps not engaged a consultant and are now finding that the works are stalling, or perhaps you wish to ensure that the application for payment from your contractor equates to actual progress on site?
 
Engaging us to carry out a Works Progress inspection will give you peace of mind.
 
Coming to the end of a project and want to ensure that the works are to the specification (or proposals) given at the outset by your contractor and meet regulations?
 
Our Works Acceptance and Witness Test inspections will safeguard your investment.
 
Is your warranty period (usually 1-2 years) about to end?
 
We can attend to carry out a full DLP Inspection, to ensure that the equipment is still functioning correctly before your warranty expires.
Inspections
 
Although it is advisable and beneficial to employ a Lift Consultant at the outset of the design process, in practice, there may be circumstances for various reasons where this may not have been the case. Clients regularly approach us part way through their projects to assist and help re-align the works to their original intentions and ensure a successful outcome.
 
We not only offer  a wide range of consultancy services, from turn key project consultancy to individual elements of the project which may benefit from consultancy depending on what stage of the process we are engaged at, but also a number of additional beneficial services which are worth considering.
 
Among these are:
 
Contract Administration - including Contract documentation, valuations and certification of applications for payment.
