The Common Stock offered by this prospectus is being registered for the account
of the Selling Stockholders. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of
Common Stock by the Selling Stockholders.


Telehealth has created its own ecosystem and the primary parts of the ecosystem
are based on technology, including, peripheral device suppliers and gateway
suppliers - health hubs and mobile gateways; in addition to data transmission
service providers - cellular and broadband. There are several companies offering
the exact same services as the Company. Almost all of these companies have
substantially greater capital and marketing resources, and greater experience in
commercializing products and services than we have.

As the industry defines itself, suppliers in different segments of the ecosystem
are collaborating. However, as the market changes, competition between suppliers
will increase.

The market primarily consists of three types of entities. They are:

. Data transmission suppliers, which provide information exchange technology for
  Telehealth systems; mobile and internet

. Gateway suppliers, which provide Telehealth hubs and user platforms.

. Peripheral device suppliers, which provide remote monitoring devices - such as
  blood pressure monitors and glucose meters, used in conjunction with 
  Telehealth services.

Competition will increase as these entities expand the types of services they
provide. Through improved choices, new competition brings with it the real
possibility of higher quality and lowered costs. This increased competition also
presents a challenge to providers, health systems and regulators used to
traditional delivery systems. Many feel threatened. Resistance to the growth of
telemedicine can be attributed, in part, to the fear of competition.
Nevertheless, consumer choice and competition flourish when barriers to access
and innovation are removed. This creates an opportunity for profitable
relationships between gateways and peripheral suppliers.


Company Description
Telemedicine and Virtual Medicine are interchangeable terms often described
under the heading of “Telehealth” referring to the use of electronic
communication and information technologies to provide or support clinical care
at a distance.  Telehealth, being the broadest of these terms is often used


 to
refer to a diverse group of health-related activities. Wadena is developing a
fixed digital gateway presence for Telehealth services through a diverse
marketing strategy that highlights E-visits for doctor patient interaction.

On August 3, 2015, the Company signed an agreement with New Benefits, Inc. to
become one of its independent sales representatives. Wadena intends to offer
membership to healthcare benefits packages as a reseller for New Benefits, Inc.
under its own private label. The service offered connects individuals with
participating physicians and other licensed healthcare practitioners (the
“Providers”) in real time, via live streaming video, telephone and/or secure
e-mail for diagnosis and treatment of patients over the Internet, as well as
providing other types of administrative services and information. All of the
participating Providers have independently contracted to be in a network
operated by New Benefits, Inc. Wadena does not provide any physicians’ or other
Providers’ services itself.  Our services enable access to Providers who have
agreed to provide patient care to customers using our system. Wadena service
consists of a telemedicine feature. Wadena arranges for the provision of care;
we do not provide medical care nor does New Benefits.

New Benefits is a leader in non-insured health, personal security and leisure
benefit plans. It has been in business for over 25 years and has in excess of 25
million members in its various plans.  New Benefits members, depending on the
plan they purchase, have access to a doctor 24/7 through their telephone,
computer, Smartphone or tablet to obtain a quick diagnosis and/or treatment
options from a U.S. licensed physician.  New Benefits contracts with U.S.
board-certified doctors.  Neither New Benefits or the Company is responsible for
the care and treatment rendered to the members by the participating doctors.
 The care and treatment is between the member/patient and the doctor and the
doctor is solely responsible for such care and treatment.

The services will be marketed over the Internet and anchored by a team of
qualified sales people via the telephone. Wadena will secure merchant accounts
and take credit cards over the phone and on the Internet for the memberships it
sells.  Fulfillment is provided by our contracted Direct Medical Provider
Organization (“DMPO”), New Benefits, Inc. The Company’s business model enables
it to leverage the expertise of its management who is a seasoned e commerce and
direct marketer. It is intended for Phase 1 to provide Wadena with the
knowledge, information and firmly position the Company to generate revenue under
the DMPO model, which at this time is the most profitable channel for these
services, primarily offered through employee benefits programs.

As a new age healthcare company Wadena will create value for patients,
physicians, and payment systems through Telemedicine services.  As a result of
the increasing digital transformation in healthcare, we will be able to address
some of the challenges facing healthcare today, recognizing a diversity of
services provided in healthcare that present complications. The healthcare
industry represents approximately 17% of the U.S. economy. This is important
given the extent of government involvement with healthcare for the elderly and
the poor through Medicare and Medicaid. Cost, access, and convenience present
difficulties for patients who need care, the doctors who provide it and how it
is paid for. Some of these problems can be alleviated through the use of
telemedicine. Convenience is a driving force behind the growing popularity of
Telehealth services, however the ability to deliver care at a lower cost is
ultimately what will determine success. Lower overhead is the primary factor
that allows for a lower cost. This is attractive both to patients and
physicians. Wadena will collect fees from every physician-patient interaction. 
Wadena has chosen to enter this market at the perfect time as digital technology
is able to rapidly increase its application in the healthcare industry. In
addition to the obvious increase in ease of use, Wadena will be able to provide
comfort and desire for interaction with physicians in a more convenient cost
effective way.


The terms “fixed digital gateway presence” and “fixed digital gateway for
Telehealth services and internet interface” are interchangeable used in context
and do not relate directly to the product we intend to sell initially.  One is
more descriptive than the other, describing the fact there will be a website.
The dual-channel approach refers to the enterprise-level Telemedicine platform
we will have to offer healthcare providers to introduce virtual medicine
programs in their offices. The platform facilitates on-demand and scheduled
consults, record keeping and billing solutions, which can be managed by all
levels of clinicians including primary care and specialty physicians,
pharmacists, nurse practitioners and physician’s assistants. Wadena will collect
fees for every e-visit and virtual consult that takes place on the system in 
addition to collecting fees from clinicians for access to and use of the
platform.

Selling the New Benefits suite of services is not a technical platform it will
be in addition to the technical platform that will be used to provide virtual
medicine in medical practices. We do not intend to employ a third party, we will
be a reseller for one of several providers of the enterprise level telemedicine
platform and run it ourselves, the provider will manage the technology. This is
in addition to reselling New Benefits programs.
