EXPLANATORY NOTE 
This amendment No. 2 (this Amendment) to Schedule 13D amends and supplements the Schedule 13D originally filed by
MRD Holdco, NGP VIII, NGP IX, NGP IX Offshore, GFW VIII, GFW Energy VIII, GFW Energy IX, GFW IX and NGP ECM (collectively, the Reporting Persons) on June 27, 2014, as amended by that certain Amendment No. 1 filed by the
Reporting Persons on November 24, 2014 (as so amended, the Original Schedule 13D), relating to the Issuers Common Stock. This Amendment is being filed in order to reflect certain changes as a result of the Agreement
and Plan of Merger dated as of May 15, 2016 (the Merger Agreement), by and among the Issuer, Range Resources Corporation, a Delaware corporation (Range), and Medina Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware
corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Range (Merger Sub), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into the Issuer, with the Issuer continuing as the surviving entity and as a wholly owned subsidiary of Range.
The Original Schedule 13D is hereby amended and supplemented by the Reporting Persons as set forth below in this Amendment. Unless set forth below, all previous Items of the Original Schedule 13D are unchanged. Capitalized terms used herein but not
defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Original Schedule 13D.  Item 2. Identity and Background. 
This Item 2 shall be deemed to amend and supplement Item 2 of the Original Schedule 13D as set forth below. 
(c) The present principal occupation or employment of Kenneth A. Hersh at NGP ECM is Chairman. 
Item 4. Purpose of Transaction. 
This Item 4 shall be deemed to amend and supplement Item 4 of the Original Schedule 13D as set forth below. 
Merger Agreement 
On May 15, 2016, the Issuer entered into the Merger Agreement pursuant to which Range will acquire the Issuer in exchange for shares of Range
common stock, par value $0.01 per share (Range Common Stock). The Merger Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein, Merger Sub will be merged with and into the Issuer, with
the Issuer continuing as the surviving entity and a wholly owned subsidiary of Range (the Merger).  Under the
terms of the Merger Agreement, each issued and outstanding share of Common Stock, other than certain shares held by the Issuer, Range, Merger Sub and any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries, will be converted into the right to receive
0.375 of a share of Range Common Stock (the Merger Consideration). Immediately prior to the effective time of the merger, each outstanding share of restricted Common Stock shall become fully vested and the restrictions
applicable thereto shall immediately lapse, and at the effective time of the merger, shall be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. 
The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties from both the Issuer and Range, and each party has agreed to customary
covenants. The closing of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions. The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both the Issuer and Range, including a right to terminate the Merger
Agreement for a superior proposal following compliance with certain procedures and payment of a termination fee. Upon termination of the Merger Agreement, under certain circumstances, either party may be required to make an expense
reimbursement payment or termination fee payment to the other party. At the effective time of the merger, the existing certificate of incorporation of the Issuer will remain unchanged and will be the certificate of incorporation of the Issuer as the
surviving entity, and the existing bylaws of the Issuer will remain unchanged and will be the bylaws of the Issuer as the surviving entity. 
The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement set forth in this Item 4 does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement, which is incorporated by reference as Exhibit I. 
  11 


Voting Agreement 
On May 15, 2016, MRD Holdco, Anthony Bahr, Jay Graham, the Issuers chief executive officer, and WHR (collectively, the Key
MRD Stockholders), entered into a Voting and Support Agreement (the Voting Agreement) with Range with respect to the Merger Agreement. The Voting Agreement restricts the Key MRD Stockholders from selling
Common Stock owned by such Key MRD Stockholders until the earlier of the termination of the Merger Agreement or the consummation of the Merger, except that immediately after the approval of the Merger Agreement and the Merger by the Issuers
stockholders, MRD Holdco may distribute any or all of its Common Stock to NGP VIII, NGP IX and NGP IX Offshore (collectively, the NGP Funds) and the holders of MRD Holdcos incentive units, and the NGP Funds may
distribute any or all such Common Stock to their respective partners. Upon such distribution, the Voting Agreement shall no longer apply to any Common Stock distributed to any person pursuant to such distribution, other than Messrs. Graham and Bahr,
WHR and any person that received such distribution solely in its capacity as a general partner of one of the NGP Funds.  The Voting
Agreement generally requires that each of the Key MRD Stockholders vote or cause to be voted all Common Stock owned by such Key MRD Stockholder in favor of the Merger Agreement and against alternative transactions, subject to certain exceptions. The
Voting Agreement also prohibits the Key MRD Stockholders from soliciting alternative acquisition proposals, subject to certain exceptions. The Voting Agreement further prohibits certain sales, transfers and dispositions of Range Common Stock
received by the Key MRD Stockholders as Merger Consideration for 90 days following the closing date of the Merger, subject to the exceptions described above. 
The Voting Agreement contains certain standstill provisions to which the Key MRD Stockholders are subject. Among other things, these
provisions, subject in each case to exceptions specified in the Voting Agreement, place restrictions on the Key MRD Stockholders ability to acquire additional Range Common Stock, propose certain transactions involving Range and take certain
actions to influence the management of Range for one year following the effective time of the Merger.  Except in certain circumstances,
the Voting Agreement will terminate upon the earliest to occur of (a) the consummation of the Merger, (b) the termination of the Merger Agreement pursuant to and in compliance with its terms and (c) a change of recommendation by the board of
directors of the Issuer.  The Voting Agreement also includes a grant by MRD Holdco to Messrs. Bahr and Graham and WHR of an irrevocable
limited waiver (the Holdco Voting Agreement Waiver) of certain provisions of the existing voting agreement among the Key MRD Stockholders and the Company dated June 18, 2014 to allow Messrs. Bahr and Graham and WHR to
comply with obligations under the Voting Agreement discussed above. The Holdco Voting Agreement Waiver will be effective until the date that Messrs. Bahr and Graham and WHR have no further obligations under the Voting Agreement. 
The foregoing description of the Voting Agreement set forth in this Item 6 does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the full text of the Voting Agreement, which is incorporated by reference as Exhibit J.  Item 5. Interest in Securities of the
Issuer.  This Item 5 shall be deemed to amend and supplement Item 5 of the Original Schedule 13D. 
The information contained in rows 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13 on the cover pages of this Amendment is hereby incorporated by reference. 
Item 6. Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships With Respect to Securities of the Issuer. 
This Item 6 shall be deemed to amend and supplement Item 6 of the Original Schedule 13D as set forth below. 
Merger Agreement 
On May 15, 2016, the Issuer entered into the Merger Agreement, a description of which is contained in Item 4 of this Amendment and is
incorporated by reference herein.
