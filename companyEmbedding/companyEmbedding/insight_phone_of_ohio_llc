AT&T Sweeps All Categories to Take the Top Ranking  in J.D. Power Purchase Experience Full-Service Study


Mobility /  Dallas, Texas, Feb 16, 2017

Share






























AT&T Scored Higher Than the Industry Average and Closest Competitor, Taking the Award for the 8th Time in a Row 
AT&T1* swept all categories to take the top ranking in the J.D. Power 2017 U.S. Wireless Purchase Experience Full-Service StudySM Volume 1, released today.2
We are the first carrier to rank highest in all 6 categories evaluated for the Purchase Experience Study. Categories include store sales rep, facility, website, phone sales rep, offerings and promotions and cost of service. This demonstrates the value that AT&T provides.
Today’s ranking marks the 8th time in a row AT&T has earned this award. We outscored the full-service industry average and our closest competitor by 14 points, according to the study.
“Customers have spoken. And we are thrilled with what they had to say,” said Glenn Lurie, president and CEO, AT&T Mobility and Consumer Operations. “Add that to our recent award for wireless customer care and that means we swept J.D. Power’s 2016 Volume 2 and 2017 Volume 1 Customer Care and Purchase Experience Studies among full service providers. Each of these consecutive studies measures a 6-month period.
“Simply put, this means AT&T is providing a great overall experience when you shop with us and when you need help with your service at any touchpoint!”
AT&T received top honors in J.D. Power’s Wireless Customer Care rankings released earlier this month – for the second time in a row.2
J.D. Power presents the Purchase Experience award twice a year. We have earned top honors in the last 8 studies, since 2013. The study took place from July to December 2016, with 8,058 U.S. wireless customers participating.
1*AT&T products and services are provided or offered by subsidiaries and affiliates of AT&T Inc. under the AT&T brand and not by AT&T Inc.
2AT&T received the highest number among providers in the J.D. Power 2013 Volume 2, 2014-2016 (V1 & V2), and 2017 Volume 1 U.S. Wireless Purchase Experience Full-Service Performance and 2016 (Vol. 2) and 2017 (Vol. 1) U.S. Wireless Customer Care Full-Service Performance Studies. 2017 Vol 1 studies based on 8,058 (Purchase) and 8,135 (Customer Care) total responses, measuring the perceptions and experiences of current customers, surveyed July-December 2016.
