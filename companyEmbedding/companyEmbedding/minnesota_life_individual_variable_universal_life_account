Item 26(m) - VUL Defender                                                       

For the policy illustration showing current charges shown in this SAI, the      
death benefit, accumulation value, and cash surrender value columns show end of 
year values. All values are shown rounded to the nearest dollar, and reflect    
any policy loans illustrated (none in this case).                               

The calculation for the accumulation value is the accumulated premiums with the 
assumed investment return less all charges. The value shown for any particular  
year depends on all prior years' premiums and charges. For the 5th policy year  
under the 6 percent gross return assumption, the end of the 4th year cash       
value, $11,538, is used as the starting point. Additions of premiums less       
charges against premiums are added at the beginning of each month.              

In this case premiums are assumed to be paid annually, so in the first month    
the premium of $4,800 less the premium charge (4 percent of premium, or $192)   
is added in the first month. That amount is $4,608. After the premium less      
charges is added at the beginning of the month, the Monthly Policy Charge, the  
Policy Issue Charge, the Mortality and Expense (M&E) Risk Charge, and the Cost  
of Insurance Charge are next deducted from the accumulation value. The          
accumulation value then grows at the assumed net rate of return to the end of   
the month. The net annual returns are derived from the hypothetical gross rates 
of return by deducting the sum of the average investment management fee (0.60   
percent), average fund expense (0.20 percent), average 12b-1 distribution fee   
(0.14 percent), and then increasing that amount by the average unit value       
credit (0.18 percent). In this case the assumed net rate of return is 5.25      
percent which translates into a monthly assumed growth rate of 0.42731 percent  
= 1.0525 ^ (1/12) - 1.                                                          

The Monthly Policy Charge is $8. The Policy Issue Charge recovers the expense   
of issuing, underwriting, and distributing the policy. The amount of the Policy 
Issue Charge is shown on the policy data pages of the Policy. The M&E Risk      
Charge is equal to 0.00 percent of the accumulation value at the beginning of   
the month. The Cost of Insurance Charge is calculated as the COI rate for the   
illustrated insured multiplied by the net amount at risk of the policy. The net 
amount at risk is the death benefit divided by the net amount at risk divisor   
(also shown on the policy data pages) less the accumulation value. This process 
is rolled forward monthly until the end of the policy year to get the end of    
year accumulation value shown. The table below details these calculations for   
the 5th policy year.                                                            

The death benefit is calculated as the greater of the face amount selected and  
the minimum death benefit required to qualify as life insurance. This amount    
would be reduced by any policy loan balance at that time. For the 5th policy    
year under the 6 percent gross return assumption, the death benefit shown is    
$500,000. The minimum amount of insurance to qualify as life insurance is the   
end of the 5th year accumulation value multiplied by the guideline premium test 
death benefit corridor factor since this sample illustration uses the Guideline 
Premium Test for life insurance. The corridor factor in this case is 191%. The  
minimum death benefit amount in order to qualify for life insurance is          
therefore $14,794 * 1.91 = $28,257. So in this case the death benefit is equal  
to the selected face amount. The calculation would not differ in other years,   
although the accumulation value and death benefit corridor factors would        
reflect the values for that particular year.

								Variable universal life
							
Following the market
Variable universal life offers the potential to build cash value based on the performance of the investment options you choose.
The policy offers greater growth potential when the markets perform well. The tradeoff for this growth is the investment risk – including the potential to lose cash value when markets perform poorly.
Benefits to you

Lifetime protection for your loved ones
Flexible premiums allow you to adjust your payments, or you can choose a fixed, consistent amount
Ability to adjust your benefit amount to align with your changing life.
Greater tax-deferred cash value growth potential than non-variable products
Choice of investment options based on your risk tolerance

Considerations

If you do not pay enough premium, the policy may lapse
Involves market risk, including loss of principal; sustained market declines can negatively impact policy cash value
Loans and withdrawals will impact both the death benefit and policy surrender value
Adjusting benefit amounts may require new underwriting

 
You should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of a portfolio and the variable insurance product carefully before investing. The portfolio and variable insurance product prospectuses contain this and other information. You may obtain a copy of the prospectus from your representative. Please read the prospectuses carefully before investing.

Life insurance products contain fees, such as mortality and expense charges, and may contain restrictions, such as surrender periods. Variable life insurance products contain fees, such as management fees, fund expenses, distribution fees and mortality and expense charges. The variable investment options are subject to market risk, including loss of principal.
This information is a general discussion of the relevant federal tax laws provided to promote ideas that may benefit a taxpayer. It is not intended for, nor can it be used by any taxpayer for the purpose of avoiding federal tax penalties. Taxpayers should seek the advice of their own advisors regarding any tax and legal issues specific to their situation.
Please keep in mind that the primary reason to purchase a life insurance product is the death benefit.

VARIABLE UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE POLICY                                        

   This prospectus describes a Variable Universal Life Insurance Policy (the
     "Policy") issued by Minnesota Life Insurance Company ("Minnesota Life" "we"
"us" or "our"). The Policy is a long-term investment designed to provide
significant life insurance benefits for the insured. This prospectus  
provides basic information that you should know before purchasing the 
    Policy. You should consider the Policy in conjunction with other insurance
     you own. Replacing your existing life insurance with this Policy may not be
    to your advantage. In addition, it may not be to your advantage to finance
the purchase or maintenance of this Policy through a loan or through  
 withdrawals from another policy. Please consult your insurance agent or
financial adviser.                                                    

You can allocate your Policy's accumulation value to one or more      
sub-accounts of the Minnesota Life Individual Variable Universal Life 
  Account (the "Account"), each of which invests exclusively in one of the
   Portfolios listed below. The value of your investment in the Account will
     vary with the investment experience of the sub-accounts you select. You can
   also allocate your Policy's accumulation value to the guaranteed interest
     account, which credits a specific rate of interest and is part of Minnesota
Life's general account.

SUMMARY OF BENEFITS AND RISKS                                                   

The following summary is designed to answer certain general questions 
concerning the Policy and to give you a brief overview of the more    
  significant features of the Policy. The summary is not comprehensive and
   you should review the information contained elsewhere in this prospectus.
This prospectus describes a flexible premium variable universal life  
insurance policy called Accumulator VUL. As the policy owner, you can 
     exercise all the rights under the Policy, including the right to change the
owner, the beneficiary and to make other policy changes. The Policy   
combines both life insurance protection and the potential for the     
 accumulation of cash values; the Policy is not suitable as a short-term
investment vehicle. You can lose some or all of your money.           

WHAT ARE SOME OF THE BENEFITS OF THE POLICY?                          

The Policy allows for the growth of accumulation value, while life    
  insurance coverage remains in force, and permits the flexible payment of
premiums. The accumulation value of the Policy will fluctuate with the
     investment performance of the sub-accounts of the Account. You may transfer
accumulation value among the sub-accounts and the guaranteed interest 
    account, surrender all or part of your accumulation value under the Policy
and take policy loans, subject to the limitations described in this   
prospectus. Each Policy has a face amount, however, the death benefit 
    payable upon the death of the insured may be greater than the face amount,
as described later in this prospectus.                                

We offer seven Agreements that provide supplemental insurance benefits
     under the Policy: Accelerated Benefit, Death Benefit Guarantee, Family Term
 -- Children, Overloan Protection, Term Insurance, Waiver of Charges and
Waiver of Premium Agreements. There is no charge for the Accelerated  
Benefit Agreement. The Agreements may not be available in all states. 

  We also offer several ways of receiving death benefit proceeds under the
 Policy, other than in a lump sum. Information concerning the settlement
   options available under the Policy is set forth later in this prospectus,
 and in the Statement of Additional Information that we will provide you
 upon request. See "Statement of Additional Information" section to this
prospectus.                                                           

     In general, under the Internal Revenue Code (the "Code"), the death benefit
 payable under a qualifying life insurance policy is excludable from the
     gross income of the beneficiary, and the owner would not be deemed to be in
     constructive receipt of the accumulation value of the Policy until there is
   a distribution. This means that under a qualifying life insurance policy,
accumulation value builds up on a tax deferred basis and transfers of 
    accumulation value among the available investment options under the Policy
   may be made tax free. This Policy is designed to afford the tax treatment
normally accorded life insurance contracts under the Code.            

HOW CAN THE POLICY BE CHANGED?                                        

   The Policy allows you the flexibility to tailor your Policy to your needs
at issue and to change your Policy thereafter as your insurance needs 
   change. Within very broad limits, including those designed to assure that
     the Policy qualifies as life insurance for tax purposes, you may choose the
    level of premium you wish to pay, the face amount and death benefit option
under the Policy.                                                     

WHAT MAKES THE POLICY VARIABLE?                                       

   The Policy is called "variable" because unlike traditional whole life and
    universal life contracts which provide for accumulation of contract values
    at fixed rates determined by the insurance company, the accumulation value
    of the Policy may be invested in the sub-accounts of the Account. In turn,
each sub-account invests exclusively in a corresponding Portfolio of a
Fund. Thus, your accumulation value,                                  

 1

P-->N-68th�Page�of�80TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�8th
 to the extent invested in a sub-account, will vary with the positive or
negative investment experience of the corresponding Portfolio.        

 If you seek a fixed return on your accumulation value, you can allocate
   premiums and accumulation value to the guaranteed interest account, which
  credits a fixed rate of interest and is part of Minnesota Life's general
   account. See "Individual Variable Universal Life Account" and "The Funds"
on page 9.                                                            

     With the guaranteed interest account, you do not bear the risk that adverse
    investment performance will lower your accumulation value invested in that
     account. See "The Guaranteed Interest Account and the Loan Account" on page
12.                                                                   

WHAT DEATH BENEFIT OPTIONS ARE OFFERED UNDER THE POLICY?              

The Policy provides three death benefit options: the Level Option, the
Increasing Option and the Sum of Premiums Option.                     

     Under the Level Option, the death benefit is the face amount of the Policy.
 If the Level Option is in effect, the death benefit payable will not be
   affected by either the negative or positive investment performance of the
investment options.                                                   

  Under the Increasing Option, the death benefit equals the face amount of
     the Policy plus the accumulation value at the time of death of the insured.
If the Increasing Option is in effect, the death benefit payable will 
reflect the investment performance of the investment options in which 
accumulation value has been invested.                                 

The Sum of Premiums Option provides a death benefit equal to the face 
    amount of the Policy plus the sum of all premiums paid less the sum of all
   partial surrenders. If the Sum of Premiums Option is in effect, the death
 benefit payable will not be affected by either the negative or positive
investment performance of the investment options. See "Death Benefit
Options" on page 23.                                                  

     In order for your Policy to be considered life insurance under Code Section
7702, it must satisfy either the cash value accumulation test or the  
 guideline premium test. Unless you specify otherwise, the death benefit
     qualification test for this Policy is the guideline premium test. The death
    benefit qualification test is shown on the policy data pages and cannot be
    changed. In order to ensure the Policy continues to satisfy the definition
     of life insurance under Code Section 7702, we may need to adjust the amount
  of death benefit payable under the death benefit option you have chosen.

DO YOU HAVE ACCESS TO YOUR ACCUMULATION VALUE?                        

 Yes. You may transfer accumulation value among the available investment
  options or surrender the Policy at any time. You may also make a partial
  surrender of the accumulation value of the Policy after the first policy
   year. A surrender or partial surrender may have federal tax consequences.
  See "Federal Tax Status" on page 37. A Surrender Charge may apply if you
    surrender the Policy. If you request a partial surrender, we will assess a
   Partial Surrender Transaction Charge of 2 percent of the amount withdrawn
not to exceed $25.                                                    

     The maximum partial surrender that you may make at any time is equal to the
   accumulation value less any outstanding policy loan and accrued interest,
  any applicable Surrender Charge and three months of monthly charges. The
    minimum partial surrender that you may make is $500. We will not process a
   partial surrender that would cause your Policy to be disqualified as life
    insurance under the Code. We reserve the right to defer the payment of any
amount from the guaranteed interest account upon surrender or partial 
surrender for up to six months.                                       

 2

P-->N-69th�Page�of�80TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�9th
You may also borrow an amount up to your accumulation value less any  
     applicable Surrender Charge and three months of monthly charges as a policy
    loan. A policy loan may have tax consequences. See "Federal Tax Status" on
page 37.                                                              

WHAT ARE SOME OF THE RISKS OF THE POLICY?                             

 Your accumulation value under the Policy, to the extent invested in the
  sub-accounts of the Account, has no guaranteed minimum value. Therefore,
you bear the risk that any adverse investment performance in the      
   sub-accounts may reduce your accumulation value under the Policy. You are
also subject to the risk that the investment performance of the       
sub-accounts you select may be less favorable than that of other      
    sub-accounts, and in order to keep the Policy in force you may be required
  to pay more premiums than originally planned. The Policy also offers you
    the opportunity to have your accumulation value increase more rapidly than
it would under comparable fixed life insurance by virtue of favorable 
  investment performance. The death benefit may also increase and decrease
with investment experience.                                           

There is the risk that the Policy may terminate. As described in the  
    "Termination" and "Reinstatement" sections of this prospectus, termination
    will only occur when the accumulation value under the Policy, less the sum
of any outstanding policy loans and unpaid policy loan interest, is   
    insufficient to cover the monthly charges, and the subsequent grace period
expires without sufficient payment being made. You may reinstate a    
     terminated Policy, subject to certain conditions. Policy loans may increase
 the risk that the Policy will terminate. If a Policy terminates with an
    outstanding policy loan, there may be significant adverse tax consequences
  to the owner. Policy loans may also have a negative effect on a Policy's
     accumulation value, and may reduce the death benefit. See "Policy Premiums"
on page 15.                                                           

You may elect the Overloan Protection Agreement to prevent policy     
 termination in certain circumstances. The tax treatment of the Overloan
     Protection Agreement is uncertain and, it is not clear whether the Overloan
Protection Agreement will be effective to prevent taxation of any     
outstanding loan balance as a distribution in those situations where  
    Overloan Protection takes effect. Anyone contemplating the purchase of the
     Policy with the Overloan Protection Agreement should consult a tax adviser.

    Surrendering your Policy or taking partial surrenders may have significant
tax consequences. If you Surrender your Policy, you may be assessed a 
Surrender Charge. A partial surrender will be subject to a transaction
     charge equal to the lesser of $25 or 2 percent of the amount of the partial
    surrender. A partial surrender will reduce the accumulation value and will
     reduce the death benefit and increase the risk of termination. See "Federal
Tax Status" on page 37.                                               

     There is risk that the Policy may not qualify as life insurance for federal
  tax purposes. We believe that a Policy issued on the basis of a standard
  underwriting class should so qualify. However, it is not clear whether a
 Policy issued on a sub-standard basis would qualify. Failure to qualify
   would mean that the death proceeds would be included in the beneficiary's
 gross income for federal income tax purposes, and that the accumulation
value is constructively received before it is actually received.      

 The Policy may be unsuitable as a short-term savings vehicle due to the
  costs of insurance and expenses charged. Furthermore, sub-account values
 could decline depending upon changes in the underlying funds. Depending
    upon the timing of withdrawals, the policy owner could lose all or part of
their premium payments.                                               

 There is also a risk that a Policy qualifying as life insurance will be
    treated as a modified endowment contract ("MEC"). A MEC is treated as life
insurance with respect to the tax treatment of death

proceeds and the tax-free inside build-up of yearly accumulation value
increases. However, any amounts you receive, such as loans or amounts 
  received from partial or total surrender of the Policy are includable in
 gross income on an income-first basis. With certain exceptions, the tax
treatment includes a ten percent additional income tax imposed on the 
  portion of any distribution that is included in income. See "Federal Tax
Status" on page 37.                                                   

   PORTFOLIO RISKS A comprehensive discussion of the risks of each Portfolio

   Portfolios' prospectuses for more information. There is no assurance that
any Portfolio will achieve its stated investment objective.

(1)  The Policy Issue Charge varies based on the insured's gender, risk class,  
     age, and the death benefit option chosen. The Policy Issue Charges shown in
the table may not be representative of the charge you will pay. Your  
 Policy's schedule page indicates your Policy Issue Charge applicable to
  your Policy. More information about the Policy Issue Charge is available
    upon request by contacting us at the telephone number or address listed on
the cover page of this prospectus.                                    

(2)  The minimum Policy Issue Charge assumes that the insured has the following 
characteristics: Male, Preferred Non-Tobacco Risk Class, age 0, Level 
Option death benefit.                                                 

(3)  The maximum Policy Issue Charge assumes that the insured has the following 
  characteristics: Male, Preferred Select Risk Class, age 80, Level Option
death benefit.                                                        

(4)  The Cost of Insurance Charge will vary based on the insured's gender, risk 
     class, and age. The Cost of Insurance Charges shown in the table may not be
   typical of the charges you will pay. The policy data pages of your Policy
  will indicate the guaranteed Cost of Insurance Charge applicable to your
 Policy, and more detailed information concerning your Cost of Insurance
   Charge is available upon request by contacting us at the telephone number
or address listed on the cover page of this prospectus.               

(5)  The minimum Cost of Insurance Charge assumes the insured has the following 
characteristics: Female, Preferred Non-Tobacco, age 6.                

(6)  The net amount at risk is equal to the death benefit payable divided by the
net amount at risk divisor, as shown on the policy data pages of your 
Policy, minus Policy accumulation value.                              

(7)  The maximum Cost of Insurance Charge assumes the insured has the following 
characteristics: Male, Standard Non-Tobacco, age 120.                 

(8)  The Cash Extra Charge is uniquely determined for each insured and may vary 
based on such factors as the insured's gender, risk class and age. The
charge compensates us for providing the death benefit under the Policy
 where the insured presents a heightened or increased level of mortality
    risk as a result of an outstanding medical condition (e.g., cancer that is
in remission) or an occupation or activity (e.g., sky-diving). We will
assess the Cash Extra Charge only for the period of time necessary to 
   compensate us for the heightened mortality risk we would bear as a result
of an insured's outstanding medical condition, occupation or activity.
   Under most Policies, we do not assess a Cash Extra Charge. The Cash Extra
  Charge shown in the table may not be typical of the charge you will pay.
The policy data pages of your Policy will indicate the guaranteed Cash
Extra Charge applicable to your Policy. More detailed information     
     concerning whether a Cash Extra Charge applies is available upon request by
   contacting us at the telephone number or address listed on the cover page
of this prospectus.

MINNESOTA LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY 

     We are Minnesota Life Insurance Company, a life insurance company organized
     under the laws of Minnesota. Our home office is at 400 Robert Street North,
     St. Paul, Minnesota 55101-2098, telephone: 651-665-3500. We are licensed to
    conduct life insurance business in all states of the United States (except
   New York where we are an authorized reinsurer), the District of Columbia,
Canada, Puerto Rico and Guam.                                         

INDIVIDUAL VARIABLE UNIVERSAL LIFE ACCOUNT 

On June 12, 2007, our Board of Trustees established the Minnesota Life
Individual Variable Universal Life Account, as a separate account in  
 accordance with Minnesota insurance law. The Account is registered as a
     "unit investment trust" with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC")
 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 ("1940 Act"), but registration
    does not signify that the SEC supervises the management, or the investment
    practices or policies, of the Account. The Account meets the definition of
a "separate account" under the federal securities laws.               

We are the legal owner of the assets in the Account. Minnesota Life is
  obligated to pay all amounts promised to policy owners and beneficiaries
under the Policies. The Minnesota law under which the Account was     
     established provides that the assets of the Account shall not be chargeable
  with liabilities arising out of any other business which we may conduct,
    but shall be held and applied exclusively to the benefit of the holders of
    those variable universal life insurance policies for which the Account was
established. The investment performance of the Account is entirely    
   independent of both the investment performance of our general account and
  of any other separate account which we may have established or may later
establish.                                                            

The Account currently has 20 sub-accounts to which you may allocate   
   premiums. Each sub-account invests in shares of a corresponding Portfolio
of the Funds.                                                         

THE FUNDS 

Below is a list of the Portfolios and their investment adviser and/or 
sub-adviser, and investment objective. Prospectuses for the Portfolios
 accompany this Prospectus. Prospectuses for the Portfolios contain more
detailed information about each Portfolio, including discussion of the
Portfolio's investment techniques and risks associated with its       
  investments. No assurance can be given that a Portfolio will achieve its
  investment objective. You should carefully read the prospectuses for the
Portfolios before investing in the Policy.

ADDITIONS, DELETIONS OR SUBSTITUTIONS                                 

We reserve the right to add, combine or remove any sub-accounts of the
     Account and to transfer the assets of one or more sub-accounts to any other
    sub-account as permitted by law. Each additional sub-account will purchase
shares in a new Portfolio or mutual fund. Such sub-accounts may be    
 established when, in our sole discretion, marketing, tax, investment or
  other conditions warrant such action. We will use similar considerations
should there be a determination to eliminate one or more of the       
    sub-accounts of the Account. New investment options will be made available
to existing policy owners as we determine in our sole discretion.     

   We retain the right, subject to any applicable law, to make substitutions
with respect to the investments of the sub-accounts of the Account. If
investment in a Fund Portfolio should no longer be possible or if we  
determine it becomes inappropriate for Policies of this class, we may 
     substitute another mutual fund or Portfolio for a sub-account. Substitution
     may be made with respect to existing accumulation values and future premium
  payments. A substitution may be made only with any necessary approval of
the SEC.                                                              

    We reserve the right to transfer assets of the Account as determined by us
    to be associated with the Policies to another separate account. A transfer
    of this kind may require the approvals of state regulatory authorities and
the SEC.                                                              

We also reserve the right, when permitted by law, to de-register the  
   Account under the 1940 Act, to restrict or eliminate any voting rights of
 the policy owners, to combine the Account with one or more of our other
  separate accounts, operate the Account or a sub-account as either a unit
    investment trust or management company under the 1940 Act, or in any other
   form allowed by law, terminate and/or liquidate the Account, and make any
changes to the Account to conform with, or required by any change in, 
  federal tax law, the 1940 Act and regulations promulgated thereunder, or
any applicable federal or state laws.                                 

     The Funds serve as the underlying investment medium for amounts invested in
life insurance company separate accounts funding both variable life   
    insurance policies and variable annuity contracts as the investment medium
for such policies and contracts issued by Minnesota Life and other    
     affiliated and unaffiliated life insurance companies, and as the investment
   medium when used by both a life insurance company to fund its policies or
   contracts and a participating qualified plan to fund plan benefits. It is
  possible that there may be circumstances where it is disadvantageous for
 either: (i) the owners of variable life insurance policies and variable
   annuity contracts to invest in one of the Funds at the same time, or (ii)
the owners of such policies and contracts issued by different life    
     insurance companies to invest in one of the Funds at the same time or (iii)
  participating qualified plans to invest in shares of one of the Funds at
  the same time as one or more life insurance companies. Neither the Funds
   nor Minnesota Life currently foresees any disadvantage, but if one of the
Funds determines that there is any such disadvantage due to a material
 conflict of interest between such policy owners and contract owners, or
between different life insurance companies, or between participating  
    qualified plans and one or more life insurance companies, or for any other
     reason, one of the Funds' Board of Directors will notify the life insurance
     companies and participating qualified plans of such conflict of interest or
other applicable event. In that event, the life insurance companies or
     participating qualified plans may be required to sell the applicable Funds'
    shares with respect to certain groups of policy owners or contract owners,
or certain participants in participating qualified plans, in order to 
resolve any conflict. The life insurance companies and participating  
qualified plans will bear the entire cost of resolving any material   
conflict of interest.

THE GUARANTEED INTEREST ACCOUNT AND THE LOAN ACCOUNT 

The guaranteed interest account and the loan account are part of our  
 general account. Our general account consists of all assets owned by us
  other than those in the Account and any other separate accounts which we
may establish.                                                        

    Because of exemptive and exclusionary provisions, interests in our general
    account have not been registered as securities under the Securities Act of
1933, and the general account has not been registered as an investment
     company under the 1940 Act. Therefore, the guaranteed interest account, the
     loan account, and any interest therein are not subject to the provisions of
 these Acts, and we have been advised that the staff of the SEC does not
    review disclosures relating to the guaranteed interest account or the loan
     account. Disclosures regarding the guaranteed interest account and the loan
     account may, however, be subject to certain generally applicable provisions
     of the Federal Securities Laws relating to the accuracy and completeness of
statements made in prospectuses.                                      

    The guaranteed interest account and the loan account are those portions of
    our general assets which are attributable to the Policy and other policies
    of its class. The description is for accounting purposes only and does not
     represent a division of the general account assets for the specific benefit
   of policies of this class. Allocations to the guaranteed interest account
and the loan account become part of our general assets and are used to
    support insurance and annuity obligations and are subject to the claims of
    our creditors. Subject to applicable law, we have sole discretion over the
investment of assets of the guaranteed interest account and the loan  
    account. Policy owners do not share in the actual investment experience of
the assets in the general account.                                    

You may allocate a portion or all of the net premiums or transfer     
    accumulation value from the sub-accounts of the Account to accumulate at a
 fixed rate of interest in the guaranteed interest account. We guarantee
   such amounts as to principal and a minimum rate of interest. Transfers to
     and from the guaranteed interest account to the sub-accounts of the Account
     are subject to certain limitations with respect to timing and amount. These
     limitations are described under the "Transfers" section of this prospectus.

GUARANTEED INTEREST ACCOUNT VALUE We bear the full investment risk for
 amounts allocated to the guaranteed interest account and guarantee that
interest credited to each policy owner's accumulation value in the    
guaranteed interest account will not be less than an annual rate of 3 
percent without regard to the actual investment experience of the     
guaranteed interest account. We may, at our sole discretion, credit a 
   higher rate of interest, "excess interest," although we are not obligated
    to credit interest in excess of 3 percent per year, and may not do so. Any
interest credited on the Policy's accumulation value in the guaranteed
interest account in excess of the guaranteed minimum rate will be     
determined at our sole discretion. You assume the risk that interest  
credited may not exceed the guaranteed minimum rate.                  

   LOAN ACCOUNT VALUE We bear the full investment risk for amounts allocated
    to the loan account. The loan account accumulation value is the sum of all
policy loans, less all policy loan repayments. This amount will be    
increased by any loan account interest and reduced by any loan account
interest allocated to the guaranteed interest account or the separate 
     account. The loan account accumulation value will be credited daily with an
   annual rate of interest of not less than 3 percent. Any interest credited
 on the Policy's accumulation value in the loan account in excess of the
guaranteed minimum rate will be determined at our sole discretion. You
assume the risk that interest credited may not exceed the guaranteed  
minimum rate.

PAYMENTS MADE BY UNDERLYING MUTUAL FUNDS                              

   We pay the costs of selling Policies, some of which are described in more
    detail in the "Compensation Paid for the Sale of Policies" section of this
    prospectus. Sale of the Policies benefits the Funds by providing increased
 distribution of the shares of the Funds. The Funds, or their investment
  advisers or principal underwriters, may pay us (or our affiliates) a fee
    for the purpose of reimbursing us for the costs of certain distribution or
   operational services that we provide and that benefit the Funds. Payments
from an underlying fund that relate to distribution services are made 
  pursuant to the Fund's 12b-1 plan, under which the payments are deducted
from the Fund's assets and described in the fee table included in the 
     Fund's prospectus. The 12b-1 payments from underlying funds range in amount
from 0 percent to 0.25 percent of fund assets held in the Account.    

In addition, payments may be made pursuant to service/administration  
    agreements between us (or our affiliates) and the underlying mutual fund's
investment adviser (or its affiliates), in which case payments are    
typically made from assets of that firm and not from the assets of the
    fund. Service and administrative payments are paid to us or our affiliates
for such things as our aggregation of all policy owner purchase,      
  redemption, and transfer requests within the sub-accounts of the Account
     each business day and the submission of one net purchase/redemption request
to each underlying mutual fund. When the Account aggregates such      
transactions through the Account's omnibus account with an underlying 
mutual fund, the Fund avoids the expenses associated with processing  
     individual transactions. Service and administrative payments received by us
  or our affiliates range in amount from 0 percent to 0.20 percent of fund
assets held in the Account.                                           

INFORMATION ABOUT THE POLICY                                                    
VARIABLE UNIVERSAL LIFE INSURANCE                                     

This Policy is a universal life insurance policy which permits you to 
determine the amount of life insurance protection and the amount of   
premiums you plan to pay. Universal life allows you the flexibility to
     customize a Policy to meet your needs and to change your Policy after issue
    to meet your changing needs and objectives. You may change the face amount
     and planned premium subject to the limitations described herein, so long as
the Policy remains in force.                                          

FLEXIBILITY AT ISSUE Subject to certain minimums, maximums and our    
underwriting standards, you may choose any level of premium or death  
   benefit that you wish. Under the Policy, the highest premium permitted at
  the time of issue, for a specific death benefit, is one which is allowed
  under the Code for the Policy to qualify as life insurance. The smallest
 premium that we will accept at the time of issue is the initial minimum
    premium (shown on your policy data pages). The minimum initial face amount
is $100,000.                                                          

POLICY CHANGES 

     The Policy allows you to change the face amount or the death benefit option
of the Policy after it has been issued, subject to the limitations    
 described more fully below. Changes in face amount or the death benefit
     option are referred to as policy changes. A partial surrender of a Policy's
accumulation value or a change in risk classification are also policy 
    changes. You may make one policy change or a combination of policy changes
   at one time. Policy changes may only be made after the first policy year.

A request to change your Policy's face amount must be made within the 
insured's lifetime. The minimum change in face amount must be at least
 $5,000 except for face amount changes which are the result of a partial
surrender.                                                            

13

P-->N-620th�Page�of�80TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�20th
 You must submit an application to us at our home office to increase the
face amount. The application must include evidence of insurability    
    satisfactory to us. The effective date of the increase in face amount will
     be the first monthly policy anniversary on or following the date we approve
the increase in face amount.                                          

To decrease your face amount, you must send to us at our home office a
     written request. The initial face amount or any subsequent increase in face
    amount may be decreased if it has been in force for at least one year. The
     effective date of the decrease will be the first monthly policy anniversary
on or following the date we approve your written request.             

 If there have been prior increases in face amount, any decrease in face
amount will be made in the following order:                           

1. first, from the most recent increase in face amount;     

     2. second, from the next most recent increase in face amount; and

3. finally, the initial face amount.                        

 If a face amount decrease would cause your Policy to be disqualified as
     life insurance under the Code, we will not approve your request. Unless you
have specified otherwise in writing, we will not approve a face amount
decrease that would cause your Policy to be classified as a modified  
  endowment contract under the Code or to have other tax consequences. See
"Federal Tax Status."                                                 

 If you have chosen the Level Option death benefit and request a partial
  surrender, we will reduce the face amount of the Policy by the amount of
   the partial surrender. A partial surrender will not result in a reduction
     in the face amount of your Policy if either the Increasing Option or Sum of
Premiums Option death benefit is in effect.                           

    Whenever a policy change is made, we will provide you with new policy data
pages. The policy data pages will identify any new face amount, death 
benefit option, risk class, planned premium or age of the insured.    

Policy changes may only be made on a monthly anniversary of the policy
   date. Once on any given monthly policy anniversary, you may make one or a
combination of policy changes. You may request a policy change by     
    completing an application for change. Your policy change will be effective
     on the first monthly policy anniversary on or after the date we approve the
policy change.                                                        

 TRANSACTION REQUESTS We process requests for financial transactions and
   certain non-financial transactions under the Policy on the Valuation Date
   we receive your request at our home office in good order. This means that
   if we receive your request for a financial transaction prior to 3:00 p.m.
   Central time on a Valuation Date, we will process the request at the unit
    values determined as of the end of that Valuation Date. If we receive your
    request for a financial transaction at or after 3:00 p.m. Central time, or
 on a non-Valuation Date, we will process the request at the unit values
determined as of the end of the next Valuation Date. We apply the same
     cutoff times for processing requests for certain non-financial transactions
as well.                                                              

Financial transactions include premium payments, surrenders, partial  
surrenders, transfers, policy changes and policy loans. Non-financial 
 transactions subject to the same cutoff times as financial transactions
include changes in allocation of net premium payments among investment
 options. Requests for surrenders, partial surrenders and policy changes
   must be made in writing and signed by you. Requests for transfers, policy
    loans and changes in the allocation of net premium payments may be made in
  writing or via telephone by you, or if authorized by you, your agent may
   make a request for transfer or policy loan by telephone. Written requests
may be submitted to us by mail or by facsimile (FAX) transmission at  
651-665-4194. Telephone requests may be made by calling us at         
1-800-277-9244

 between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Central time, our regular
     business hours. We treat requests made via telephone and facsimile (FAX) as
  received once the call or transmission ends. We treat requests submitted
via mail as received when received in the mailroom of our home office.

PROOF OF INSURABILITY We require proof of insurability for all policy 
 changes resulting in an increase in death benefit, except for increases
    made pursuant to an additional agreement. In addition, we require proof of
 insurability for partial surrenders where, at the request of the policy
 owner, no reduction is made in the Policy's death benefit. Decreases in
face amount do not require evidence of insurability.                  

We may also require evidence of insurability to change the risk       
classification of the insured or to add additional agreements to the  
Policy.                                                               

  CHARGE FOR POLICY CHANGE Currently, we will assess a $60 charge to cover
    the administrative costs associated with processing a policy change and in
  no event will we increase the charge to more than $100. If, however, the
 only policy change is a partial surrender, we will assess a transaction
 charge equal to 2 percent of the amount surrendered, not to exceed $25.
     Because of the underwriting and selling expenses associated with any policy
 change resulting in an increase in face amount, we will assess a Policy
Issue Charge for such a change. See "Policy Charges."
APPLICATIONS AND POLICY ISSUE                                         

    You must send a completed application and an initial premium payment to us
     at our home office to purchase the Policy. Before issuing a Policy, we will
   require evidence of insurability of the insured satisfactory to us, which
in some cases will require a medical examination. The Policy is only  
available for insureds between issue ages 0-90. Our approval of an    
   application is subject to our underwriting rules and we reserve the right
to reject an application for any reason.                              

If the application is accompanied by a check for at least the initial 
     minimum premium and we approve the application, the policy date will be the
issue date, which is the date we approve the application and issue the
Policy. We use the policy date to determine subsequent monthly policy 
anniversaries.                                                        

 If we approve an application that is not accompanied by a check for the
   initial minimum premium, we may issue the Policy with a policy date which
 is 25 days after the issue date. Life insurance coverage will not begin
   until the initial minimum premium is paid. If the initial minimum premium
is paid after the policy date (and the policy date is not changed as  
     described below), you will have paid for insurance coverage during a period
  when no coverage was in force. In that circumstance you may request that
   the policy date be the date on which our home office receives the initial
     minimum premium. We will forward to you updated policy pages to reflect the
   change in policy date. You must make such request at or prior to the time
you pay the initial minimum premium.                                  

     In certain cases it may be to your advantage to have the policy date be the
    same as the issue date in order to preserve an issue age of the insured to
   provide more favorable cost of insurance rates. In that case, the initial
    minimum premium must be paid when the Policy is delivered to you. When the
   Policy is issued, the face amount, planned premium, death benefit option,
and any additional agreements chosen will be listed on the policy data
pages.                                                                

POLICY PREMIUMS 

The amount of the initial minimum premium will depend on the Policy's 
    initial face amount, the death benefit option, the insured's age at issue,
   gender, risk classification and any additional benefit agreements chosen.
   The initial minimum premium is due as of the policy date and must be paid
     on or before the date your Policy is delivered. Between the date we receive
the initial minimum premium for

    the Policy and the date insurance coverage commences under the Policy, the
     life of the insured may be covered under the terms of a temporary insurance
agreement. You may request temporary insurance coverage at the time of
     application in an amount up to $250,000. In order to receive such coverage,
     you must meet certain insurability requirements at the date of application,
    complete the application and pay the initial minimum premium. You may call
   or write us at our home office to obtain additional information regarding
   coverage under a temporary insurance agreement or the application of your
initial minimum premium.                                              

  All premiums after the initial minimum premium should be mailed to us at
     our home office. You may also elect to have premiums paid monthly under our
   automatic payment plan through pre-authorized transfers from your account
at a bank or other financial institution.                             

     Any premium payment after the initial minimum premium must be at least $50;
for premiums paid under an automatic payment plan, the minimum premium
    payment must be at least $25. You may pay premiums at any time. We reserve
  the right to require evidence of insurability satisfactory to us for any
premium payment that would result in an immediate increase in the net 
amount at risk under the Policy.                                      

   When you apply for a Policy, you may elect to pay a planned premium which
is shown on the policy data pages. We will send you a notice for the  
  planned premium at the frequency shown on the policy data pages. You may
    request that we send you notices once a year, twice a year or four times a
    year. The amount of the planned premium and frequency you have chosen will
 be identified on the notice. You may change the amount and frequency of
   your planned premium payment at any time by written request. PAYMENT OF A
  PLANNED PREMIUM DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE POLICY WILL REMAIN IN FORCE.

We intend that this Policy will qualify as a life insurance policy as 
   defined by Code Section 7702. In order to maintain such qualification, we
  reserve the right to increase the amount of insurance on the insured, to
    return any excess accumulation value or premium, or to limit the amount of
 premium we will accept. There may be tax consequences to you if we must
 return part of the accumulation value in order to maintain the Policy's
    status as life insurance. See "Federal Tax Status." In the event the death
    benefit is increased to maintain qualification as a life insurance policy,
    we may make appropriate adjustments to any monthly charges or supplemental
  benefits that are consistent with such increase. In addition, unless you
have specified otherwise in writing, if the payment of a premium would
   cause your Policy to be classified as a modified endowment contract under
    the Code, we will not accept a payment in excess of the amount that causes
your Policy to become a modified endowment contract. See "Federal Tax
Status."                                                              

   We assess a Premium Charge against each premium payment. The premium less
   the Premium Charge results in the net premium. Net premiums are allocated
 to the guaranteed interest account or sub-accounts of the Account which
sub-accounts, in turn, invest in shares of the Portfolios.            

   You must designate the allocation of net premiums on your application for
    the Policy. You may change your allocation instructions for future premium
    payments by forwarding to us a signed written request, or by calling us at
    1-800-277-9244 between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Central time,
our regular business hours. The allocation of net premiums to the     
     guaranteed interest account or to any sub-account of the Account must be in
multiples of 1 percent of the net premium.                            

We reserve the right to delay the allocation of net premiums to the   
     sub-accounts you designated for a period of up to 30 days after issuance of
     the Policy or after a policy change. In no event will any such delay extend
   beyond the free look period that applies in the state in which the Policy
    is issued. If we exercise this right, we will allocate net premiums to the
 guaranteed interest account until the end of the free look period. This
 right, which as of the date of the prospectus has not been implemented,
will

  be exercised by us only when we believe economic conditions make such an
     allocation necessary to reduce our market risk during the free look period.

     We also reserve the right to restrict the allocation of net premiums to the
  guaranteed interest account. If we do so, no more than 25 percent of the
net premium may be allocated to the guaranteed interest account. In   
  addition, we reserve the right to further restrict the allocation of net
     premiums to the guaranteed interest account if the current interest rate we
 credit to the guaranteed interest account equals the minimum guaranteed
interest rate. Currently, we do not exercise these restrictions.      

If mandated under applicable law, we may reject a premium. We may also
  provide information about a policy owner and a policy owner's account to
government regulators.

   It is important to us that you are satisfied with this Policy after it is
 issued. If you are not satisfied with it, you may request to cancel the
   Policy and return the Policy to us or your agent within 30 days after you
  receive it. We will send to you within seven days of the date we receive
  your notice of cancellation and the Policy a full refund of the premiums
you have paid.                                                        

   If the Policy is changed, as described under the "Policy Changes" section
     of this prospectus, and if the change results in an increase in face amount
     and/or the addition of any agreements, you will have a right to examine the
   changed Policy and you may return the changed Policy within 30 days after
    you receive it. If you return the changed Policy, the face amount increase
and/or additional agreements will be cancelled, and the Policy will   
continue in force.                                                    

ACCUMULATION VALUE                                                    

   Your Policy's accumulation value equals your investment in the guaranteed
   interest account and the sub-accounts of the Account, plus any collateral
 held in the loan account for any loans you have taken. The accumulation
     value of the Policy varies with the investment experience of the guaranteed
interest account and the sub-accounts of the Account.                 

 Unlike a traditional fixed benefit life insurance policy, your Policy's
accumulation value cannot be determined in advance, even if you pay   
     premiums as planned, because the separate account accumulation value varies
daily with the investment performance of the sub-accounts. Even if you
continue to pay premiums as planned, the separate account accumulation
value of your Policy could decline to zero because of unfavorable     
investment experience and the assessment of charges.                  

  Upon request, we will tell you the accumulation value of your Policy. We
     will also send to you a report each year on the policy anniversary advising
you of your Policy's accumulation value, the face amount and the death
  benefit as of the date of the report. It will also summarize your policy
    transactions during the year. The information will be current as of a date
within two months of its mailing.                                     

GUARANTEED INTEREST ACCOUNT ACCUMULATION VALUE The guaranteed interest
    account accumulation value of your Policy equals the sum of the following:

          -    the net premiums you allocate to the guaranteed interest account;

      -    plus, any interest credited thereto, any loan repayments, any
          transfers of accumulation value from the sub-accounts of the
      Account and any allocation of loan account interest; and

17

P-->N-624th�Page�of�80TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�24th
 -    less, any policy loans, partial surrenders, transfers of
              accumulation value to the sub-accounts of the Account and policy
charges.                                          

     SEPARATE ACCOUNT ACCUMULATION VALUE The separate account accumulation value
of your Policy is not guaranteed. We determine your Policy's separate 
     account accumulation value by multiplying the current number of sub-account
units for each sub-account in which you are invested by the current   
sub-account unit value for that sub-account and adding those values   
  together. A sub-account unit is a measure of your Policy's interest in a
    sub-account. The number of units credited with respect to each net premium
  payment is determined by dividing the portion of the net premium payment
allocated to each sub-account by the then current unit value for that 
  sub-account. The number of units credited is determined as of the end of
 the valuation date on which we receive your premium at our home office.

  Once determined, the number of units credited to your Policy will not be
affected by changes in sub-account unit values. However, the number of
  units in a sub-account will be increased by the allocation of subsequent
   net premiums, loan repayments, transfers and loan account interest to the
sub-account. The number of units will be decreased by policy charges, 
  policy loans, transfers and partial surrenders from the sub-account. The
 number of units in a sub-account will decrease to zero if the Policy is
surrendered or terminated.                                            

    The unit value of a sub-account will be determined on each valuation date.
  The amount of any increase or decrease will depend on the net investment
     experience of the sub-account. The value of a unit for each sub-account was
 originally set at $1.00 on the first valuation date. For any subsequent
    valuation date, its value is equal to its value on the preceding valuation
   date multiplied by the net investment factor for that sub-account for the
valuation period ending on the subsequent valuation date.             

    The net investment factor is a measure of the net investment experience of
 a sub-account. The net investment factor for a valuation period is: the
     gross investment rate for such valuation period, plus any unit value credit
under the Policy. We determine periodically whether unit value credits
 apply. Unit value credits are not guaranteed. For any period we apply a
    unit value credit, we will apply the credit each day when we calculate the
unit value for the sub-account.                                       

The gross investment rate is equal to:                                

  1.   the net asset value per share of a Fund share held in the
             sub-account of the Account determined at the end of the current
valuation period; plus                            

2.   the per share amount of any dividend or capital gain   
               distributions by the Fund if the "ex-dividend" date occurs during
   the current valuation period; with the sum divided by

     3.   the net asset value per share of that Fund share held in the
          sub-account determined at the end of the preceding valuation
period.                                           

    The table below describes the annual unit value credit that we may, in our
    sole discretion, apply to each sub-account of the Account. The annual unit
value credit is expressed as a percentage of average annual Portfolio 
    assets held by the sub-account. The amount of the unit value credit we may
 apply varies among sub-accounts with some sub-accounts receiving larger
unit value credits than other sub-accounts. Some sub-accounts are not 
    eligible for a unit value credit. The table below also describes the total
annual portfolio operating expenses for each Portfolio in which the   
  corresponding sub-account invests for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2006 and provides a net portfolio operating expenses figure for each  
  Portfolio. The net portfolio operating expenses figure is a hypothetical
figure that is intended to demonstrate the effect that the unit value 
   credit would have had on total annual portfolio operating expenses if the
unit value credit had been applied directly to reduce such expenses.

We determine the value of the units in each sub-account on each day on
  which the corresponding Portfolio values its shares. In general, the net
 asset value of each Portfolio's shares is computed once daily as of the
     primary closing time for business on the New York Stock Exchange (typically
3:00 p.m. Central time).                                              

     Some investment advisers to the Funds or their affiliates have an agreement
   with us or our affiliates to pay us or our affiliates for administrative,
     recordkeeping and shareholder services we provide to the Funds' Portfolios.
We or our affiliates may also receive payments from the Funds, their  
     investment advisers or principal underwriters to reimburse us for the costs
  of certain distribution or operational services that we perform and that
    benefit the Funds' Portfolios. See "Payments Made by Underlying Funds," on
page 13. We may, in our sole discretion, apply some or all of these   
payments as unit value credits to the sub-accounts that invest in the 
Funds' Portfolios. From time to time some of these arrangements may be
   renegotiated so that we receive a different payment than previously paid.
  These fee arrangements do not result in any additional charges to Policy
owners.                                                               

     LOAN ACCOUNT ACCUMULATION VALUE The loan account accumulation value of your
Policy equals the sum of the following:                               

-    all policy loans less all policy loan repayments;      

-    plus, any loan account interest; and                   

    -    less, any loan account interest allocated to the guaranteed
interest account or the Account.                  

19

P-->N-626th�Page�of�80TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�26th
We credit interest on the loan account accumulation value daily at an 
 annual rate of interest of not less than 3 percent. We may, at our sole
discretion, credit interest at a higher rate.                         

TRANSFERS 

     You may transfer accumulation value between the guaranteed interest account
and the sub-accounts of the Account and among the sub-accounts. We    
 determine the amount you have available for transfers at the end of the
  Valuation Date on which we receive your request at our home office. Your
request for transfer may be made in writing or you, or your agent if  
    authorized by you, may make a request for transfer by telephone. To do so,
   you may call us at 1-800-277-9244 between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 4:30
  p.m., Central time, our regular business hours. You may also submit your
     request for transfer to us by facsimile (FAX) transmission at 651-665-4194.

    We process transfers based on the unit values determined at the end of the
  Valuation Date on which we receive your request for transfer at our home
  office. This means that if we receive your request for transfer prior to
    3:00 p.m. Central time on a Valuation Date, we will process the request at
  the unit values determined as of that Valuation Date. If we receive your
request for transfer at or after 3:00 p.m. Central time, or on a      
non-Valuation Date, we will process the request at the unit values    
   determined as of the following Valuation Date. We treat transfer requests
made via telephone and facsimile (FAX) as received once the call or   
transmission ends.                                                    

 You may transfer accumulation value among the sub-accounts an unlimited
number of times in a policy year, subject to our limitations on       
    market-timing and frequent trading activities and Portfolio limitations on
 the frequent purchase and redemption of shares. We reserve the right to
     limit transfers to and from the guaranteed interest account to one transfer
     per policy year. We also reserve the right to restrict the dollar amount of
any transfer to or from the guaranteed interest account.              

    Currently, we assess a $10 charge from the amount transferred for the 13th
     and each additional transfer in a policy year. The charge is guaranteed not
to exceed $25. For purposes of assessing the charge, we consider all  
   telephone, facsimile and/or written requests processed on the same day to
  be one transfer, regardless of the number of sub-accounts (or guaranteed
interest account) affected by the transfer(s).                        

    We impose other restrictions on transfers. We reserve the right to require
that the amount transferred to or from a sub-account or the guaranteed
interest account be at least $250. If the accumulation value in a     
    sub-account or the guaranteed interest account from which a transfer is to
  be made is less than $250, the entire accumulation value attributable to
    the sub-account or the guaranteed interest account must be transferred. If
a transfer would reduce the accumulation value in the sub-account from
     which the transfer is to be made to less than $250, we reserve the right to
include that remaining sub-account accumulation value in the amount   
transferred.                                                          

     TELEPHONE TRANSFERS A request for transfer submitted to us via telephone is
   subject to the same conditions and procedures as would apply to a written
transfer request. However, during periods of marked economic or market
    changes, you may have difficulty due to a heavy volume of telephone calls.
   In those circumstances, you should consider submitting a written transfer
     request while continuing to attempt to contact us via telephone. We reserve
   the right to restrict the frequency of, or otherwise modify, condition or
    terminate telephone transfer privileges. For more information on telephone
  transactions, contact us at our home office or at 1-800-277-9244 between
the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Central time.

  With all telephone transactions, we will employ reasonable procedures to
     satisfy ourselves that instructions received from policy owners are genuine
   and, to the extent that we do not, we may be liable for any losses due to
unauthorized or fraudulent instructions. We require policy owners to  
 identify themselves through policy numbers, social security numbers and
 such other information we deem reasonable. We record telephone transfer
instruction conversations and we provide policy owners with a written 
confirmation of each telephone transfer.                              

     MARKET-TIMING AND DISRUPTIVE TRADING This Policy is not designed to be used
     as a vehicle for frequent trading (i.e., frequent transfers) in response to
 short-term fluctuations in the securities markets, often referred to as
     "market-timing." Market-timing activity and frequent trading in your Policy
     can disrupt the efficient management of the underlying Portfolios and their
investment strategies, dilute the value of Portfolio shares held by   
long-term shareholders, and increase Portfolio expenses (including    
     brokerage or other trading costs) for all Portfolio shareholders, including
     long-term policy owners invested in affected Portfolios who do not generate
  such expenses. It is our policy to discourage market-timing and frequent
transfer activity, and, when we become aware of such activity, to take
 steps to attempt to minimize the effect of frequent trading activity on
   affected Portfolios. You should not purchase this Policy if you intend to
engage in market-timing or frequent transfer activity.                

     We have developed policies and procedures to detect and deter market-timing
and other frequent transfers, and we will not knowingly accommodate or
  create exceptions for policy owners engaging in such activity. We employ
     various means to attempt to detect and deter market-timing or other abusive
transfers. However, our monitoring may be unable to detect all harmful
  trading nor can we ensure that the underlying Portfolios will not suffer
    disruptions or increased expenses attributable to market-timing or abusive
    transfers resulting from other insurance carriers which invest in the same
Portfolios. In addition, because our policies and procedures are      
discretionary, it is possible that some policy owners may engage in   
  market-timing and other frequent transfer activity while others may bear
     the harm associated with such activity. Moreover, because market-timing can
     only be detected after it has occurred to some extent, our policies to stop
     market-timing activity do not go into effect until after we have identified
such activity.                                                        

   We reserve the right to restrict the frequency of -- or otherwise modify,
   condition or terminate -- any transfer method(s). Your transfer privilege
  is also subject to modification if we determine, in our sole discretion,
     that the exercise of the transfer privilege by one or more policy owners is
     or would be to the disadvantage of other policy owners. Any new restriction
   that we would impose will apply to your Policy without regard to when you
purchased it. We also reserve the right to implement, administer, and 
     charge you for any fees or restrictions, including redemption fees that may
    be imposed by a Portfolio attributable to transfers in your Policy. One or
    more of the following factors will be considered in determining whether to
implement and administer any restrictions and assess any fees:        

-    the dollar amount of the transfer(s);                  

      -    whether the transfers are part of a pattern of transfers that
          appears designed to take advantage of market inefficiencies;

       -    whether a Portfolio has requested that we look into identified
unusual or frequent activity in the Portfolio;    

      -    the number of transfers in the previous calendar quarter; and

21

P-->N-628th�Page�of�80TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�28th
        -    whether the transfers during a quarter constitute more than two
        "round trips" in a particular Portfolio. A round trip is a
              purchase into a Portfolio and a subsequent redemption out of the
Portfolio, without regard to order.               

In the event your transfer activity is identified as disruptive or    
   otherwise constitutes a pattern of market-timing, you will be notified in
   writing that your transfer privileges will be restricted in the future if
     the activity continues. Upon our detecting further prohibited activity, you
  will be notified in writing that your transfer privileges are limited to
transfer requests delivered via regular U.S. mail only. No fax, voice,
    courier or express delivery requests will be accepted. The limitations for
the transfer privileges in your Policy will be permanent.             

   In addition, the Funds may restrict the purchase of their shares in order
to protect shareholders. In such case, if you request a transfer to a 
   sub-account(s) that invests in a Fund that has restricted the purchase of
   its shares, we will not redeem accumulation value from the sub-account(s)
     from which the transfer would have otherwise been made, unless you submit a
new request for transfer to our home office designating a new         
sub-account(s) to which the transfer should be made.                  

DEATH BENEFIT                                                                   
DEATH BENEFIT PROCEEDS                                                

    As long as the Policy is in force, we will determine the amount of and pay
     the death benefit proceeds on the Policy upon receipt at our home office of
 satisfactory proof of the insured's death, plus written direction (from
     each eligible recipient of death benefit proceeds) regarding how to pay the
  death benefit payment, and any other documents, forms and information we
  need. We may require return of the Policy. We will pay the death benefit
proceeds to the beneficiary(ies), if living. If each beneficiary dies 
    before the insured, we will pay the death benefit proceeds to the owner or
the owner's estate, or, if the owner is a corporation, to it or its   
    successor. We will pay the death benefit proceeds in a lump sum or under a
settlement option.                                                    

Death benefit proceeds equal:                                         

-    the death benefit (described below);                   

      -    plus any additional insurance on the insured's life under the
Term Insurance Agreement;                         

          -    plus under the Level Option death benefit, any premium paid after
the date of the insured's death;                  

   -    plus any assessed monthly charges for the period after the
insured's death;                                  

-    minus any unpaid monthly charges;                      

-    minus any outstanding policy loan;                     

-    minus any accrued loan interest.                       

We may further adjust the amount of the death benefit proceeds if we  
   contest the Policy, if the insured dies by suicide or if you misstate the
insured's age or gender. See "Statement of Additional Information."

DEATH BENEFIT OPTIONS 

 The Policy provides a death benefit. The death benefit is determined on
    each monthly policy anniversary and as of the date of the insured's death.
 You must select one of the three death benefit options we offer in your
application. If you do not choose a death benefit option in your      
application, the Level Option death benefit will automatically be in  
effect.                                                               

The Policy is intended to qualify under Code Section 7702 as a life   
     insurance policy for federal tax purposes. The death benefit is intended to
    qualify for the federal income tax exclusion. The provisions of the Policy
and any attached agreement will be interpreted to ensure such         
qualification, regardless of any language to the contrary.            

     To the extent the death benefit is increased to maintain qualification as a
    life insurance policy, we will make appropriate adjustments to any monthly
charges or supplemental agreements that are consistent with such an   
   increase. Adjustments will be reflected in the monthly charge assessment.

Under Code Section 7702, a Policy will generally be treated as life   
insurance for federal tax purposes if at all times it meets either a  
    "guideline premium test (GPT)" or a "cash value accumulation test (CVAT)."
 You must choose either the GPT or the CVAT before the Policy is issued.
Once the Policy is issued, you may not change to a different test. The
death benefit will vary depending on which test is used.              

The GPT has two components, a premium limit component and a corridor  
  component. The premium limit restricts the amount of premium that can be
  paid into the Policy. The corridor requires that the death benefit be at
     least a certain percentage (varying each year by age of the insured) of the
     accumulation value. The CVAT does not have a premium limit, but does have a
corridor that requires that the death benefit be at least a certain   
  percentage (varying based on the age and gender class of the insured) of
the accumulation value.                                               

   The corridor under the CVAT is different than the corridor under the GPT.
    Specifically, the CVAT corridor requires more death benefit in relation to
   accumulation value than is required by the GPT corridor. Therefore, for a
    Policy in the corridor with no additional agreements, as your accumulation
  value increases your death benefit will increase more rapidly under CVAT
than it would under GPT.                                              

  Your Policy will be issued using the GPT unless you choose otherwise. In
  deciding whether or not to choose the CVAT, you should consider that the
     CVAT generally permits more premiums to be contributed to a Policy, but may
require the Policy to have a higher death benefit, which may increase 
certain charges.                                                      

     UNDER THE GUIDELINE PREMIUM TEST (GPT) -- LEVEL OPTION DEATH BENEFIT EQUALS
THE GREATEST OF:                                                      

1.   the face amount on the insured's date of death; or     

          2.   a specified "limitation percentage," called the Guideline Premium
              Test Death Benefit Percentage Factor (GPT DBPF) on your Policy's
               data pages, multiplied by the accumulation value on the insured's
date of death.                                    

Under the Level Option, your death benefit remains level unless the   
    limitation percentage multiplied by the accumulation value is greater than
     the face amount; then the death benefit will vary as the accumulation value
varies.                                                               

   The limitation percentage is the minimum percentage of accumulation value
we must pay as the death benefit under federal tax requirements. It is
based on the age of the insured at the beginning of each              

23

P-->N-630th�Page�of�80TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�30th
   policy year. The following table indicates the limitation percentages for
the guideline premium test for different ages:

40 and under                     250%                 
  41 to 45     250% minus 7% for each year over age 40
  46 to 50     215% minus 6% for each year over age 45
  51 to 55     185% minus 7% for each year over age 50
  56 to 60     150% minus 4% for each year over age 55
  61 to 65     130% minus 2% for each year over age 60
  66 to 70     l20% minus 1% for each year over age 65
  71 to 75     115% minus 2% for each year over age 70
  76 to 90                       105%                 
  91 to 95     105% minus 1% for each year over age 90
 96 to 121                       100%                 

If the Code requires us to determine the death benefit by reference to
     these limitation percentages, the Policy is described as "in the corridor."
   An increase in the accumulation value will increase our risk, and we will
increase the cost of insurance we assess from the accumulation value. 

     LEVEL OPTION GUIDELINE PREMIUM TEST ILLUSTRATION. Assume that the insured's
age is under 40. Under the Level Option, a Policy with a $100,000 face
    amount will generally pay $100,000 in death benefits. However, because the
death benefit must be equal to or be greater than 250 percent of the  
   accumulation value, any time the accumulation value of the Policy exceeds
     $40,000, the death benefit will exceed the $100,000 face amount. The figure
  $40,000 is derived because 250 percent of $40,000 equals $100,000. Every
     additional $100 added to the accumulation value above $40,000 will increase
the death benefit by $250.                                            

  Similarly, so long as the accumulation value exceeds $40,000, every $100
    taken out of the accumulation value will reduce the death benefit by $250.
If at any time the accumulation value multiplied by the limitation    
   percentage is less than the face amount, the death benefit will equal the
face amount of the Policy.                                            

     UNDER THE CASH VALUE ACCUMULATION TEST (CVAT) -- LEVEL OPTION DEATH BENEFIT
EQUALS THE GREATEST OF:                                               

1.   the face amount on the date of the insured's death; or 

          2.   the amount required for the Policy to qualify as a life insurance
policy under Code Section 7702.                   

Under the Level Option, your death benefit remains level unless the   
accumulation value is greater than the net single premium as specified
under Code Section 7702, multiplied by the face amount. The net single
premium is based on the insured's gender and age.                     

   Under the CVAT, a "limitation percentage" may be defined as the value "1"
 divided by the net single premium. While the limitation percentages are
  defined differently for the GPT and the CVAT, they work identically with
  respect to the relationship between the accumulation value and the death
benefit.                                                              

If the Code requires us to determine the death benefit by reference to
     these limitation percentages, the Policy is described as "in the corridor."
   An increase in the accumulation value will increase our risk, and we will
increase the cost of insurance we assess from the accumulation value.

 LEVEL OPTION CASH VALUE ACCUMULATION TEST ILLUSTRATION. Assume that the
    Policy has a face amount of $100,000, and the limitation percentage is 225
    percent. Under the Level Option, a Policy with a $100,000 face amount will
generally pay $100,000 in death benefits. However, because the death  
   benefit for the Policy must be equal to or be greater than 225 percent of
the accumulation value, any time the accumulation value of the Policy 
   exceeds $44,444, the death benefit of the Policy will exceed the $100,000
   face amount. The figure $44,444 is derived because 225 percent of $44,444
equals $100,000. Every additional $100 added to the accumulation value
above $44,444 will increase the death benefit of the Policy by $225.  

  Similarly, so long as the accumulation value exceeds $44,444, every $100
  taken out of the accumulation value will reduce the death benefit of the
 Policy by $225. If at any time the accumulation value multiplied by the
  limitation percentage is less than the face amount, the death benefit of
the Policy will equal the face amount of the Policy.

          1.   the face amount plus the accumulation value on the insured's date
of death; or                                      

   2.   the limitation percentage (the GPT DBPF) multiplied by the
accumulation value on the insured's date of death.

Under the Increasing Option, the death benefit always varies as the   
accumulation value varies.                                            

INCREASING OPTION GUIDELINE PREMIUM TEST ILLUSTRATION. Assume that the
 insured's age is under 40. Under the Increasing Option, a Policy with a
     face amount of $100,000 will generally pay a death benefit of $100,000 plus
the accumulation value. Thus, a Policy with an accumulation value of  
$60,000 will generally have a death benefit of $160,000 ($100,000 +   
   $60,000). The death benefit, however, must be at least 250 percent of the
  accumulation value. As a result, if the accumulation value of the Policy
 exceeds $66,666, the death benefit will be greater than the face amount
   plus the accumulation value. The figure of $66,666 is derived because 250
percent of $66,666 equals $100,000 + $66,666. Every additional $100 of
   accumulation value above $66,666 will increase the death benefit by $250.

Similarly, any time the accumulation value exceeds $66,666, every $100
   taken out of accumulation value will reduce the death benefit by $250. If
    at any time the accumulation value multiplied by the limitation percentage
  is less than the face amount plus the accumulation value, then the death
    benefit will be the face amount plus the accumulation value of the Policy.

          2.   the amount required for the Policy to qualify as a life insurance
policy under Code Section 7702.                   

Under the Increasing Option, the death benefit always varies as the   
accumulation value varies.                                            

  INCREASING OPTION CASH VALUE ACCUMULATION TEST ILLUSTRATION. Assume that
    the Policy has a face amount of $100,000, and the limitation percentage is
  225 percent. Under the Increasing Option, a Policy with a face amount of
$100,000 will generally pay a death benefit of $100,000 plus the      
  accumulation value. Thus, a Policy with an accumulation value of $65,000
   will generally have a death benefit of $165,000 ($100,000 + $65,000). The
death benefit for the Policy must be at least 225 percent of the      
  accumulation value. As a result, if the accumulation value of the Policy
    exceeds $80,000, the death benefit for the Policy will be greater than the
face amount plus the accumulation value. The figure of                

25

P-->N-632nd�Page�of�80TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�32nd
$80,000 is derived because 225 percent of $80,000 equals $100,000 +   
 $80,000. Every additional $100 of accumulation value above $80,000 will
increase the death benefit of the Policy by $225.                     

  Similarly, any time accumulation value exceeds $80,000, every $100 taken
  out of accumulation value will reduce the death benefit of the Policy by
  $225. If at any time the accumulation value multiplied by the limitation
   percentage is less than the face amount plus the accumulation value, then
the death benefit for the Policy will be the face amount plus the     
accumulation value of the Policy.

partial surrenders; or                            

   2.   the limitation percentage (the GPT DBPF) multiplied by the
accumulation value on the insured's date of death.

    Under the Sum of Premiums Option, the death benefit always varies with the
payment of premiums and partial surrenders taken.                     

SUM OF PREMIUMS GUIDELINE PREMIUM TEST ILLUSTRATION. Assume that the  
    insured's age is under 40, premiums paid equal $60,000, partial surrenders
equal $10,000, and the accumulation value equals $55,000. Under this  
scenario a Policy with the Sum of Premiums Option and a face amount of
     $100,000 will generally pay a death benefit of $150,000 ($100,000 + $60,000
 - $10,000). The death benefit, however, must be at least 250 percent of
  accumulation value. As a result, if the accumulation value of the Policy
 exceeds $60,000, the death benefit will be greater than the face amount
plus premiums paid less partial surrenders. The figure of $60,000 is  
     derived because 250 percent of $60,000 equals $100,000 + $60,000 - $10,000.
     Every additional $100 of accumulation value above $60,000 will increase the
death benefit by $250.                                                

  Similarly, any time accumulation value exceeds $60,000, every $100 taken
    out of accumulation value will reduce the death benefit by $250. If at any
     time the accumulation value multiplied by the limitation percentage is less
   than the face amount plus premiums paid less partial surrenders, then the
death benefit will be the face amount plus premiums paid less partial 
surrenders.                                                           

 UNDER THE CASH VALUE ACCUMULATION TEST -- SUM OF PREMIUMS DEATH BENEFIT
EQUALS THE GREATEST OF:                                               

   1.   the face amount plus the sum of all premiums paid less all
partial surrenders; or                            

          2.   the amount required for the Policy to qualify as a life insurance
policy under Code Section 7702.                   

    Under the Sum of Premiums Option, the death benefit always varies with the
payment of premiums and partial surrenders taken.                     

SUM OF PREMIUMS CASH VALUE ACCUMULATION TEST ILLUSTRATION. Assume that
premiums paid equal $80,000, partial surrenders equal $5,000, and the 
   accumulation value equals $70,000. Also assume that the Policy has a face
 amount of $100,000, and the limitation percentage is 225 percent. Under
     this scenario a Policy with the Sum of Premiums Option and a face amount of
     $100,000 will generally pay a death benefit of $175,000 ($100,000 + $80,000
     - $5,000). The death benefit for the Policy must be at least 225 percent of
the accumulation value. As a result, if the accumulation value of the 
  Policy exceeds $77,777, the death benefit for the Policy will be greater
   than the face amount plus premiums less partial surrenders. The figure of
     $77,777 is derived because 225 percent of $77,777 equals $100,000 + $80,000
  - $5,000. Every additional $100 of accumulation value above $77,777 will
increase the death benefit of the Policy by $225.                     

26

  Similarly, any time accumulation value exceeds $77,777, every $100 taken
  out of accumulation value will reduce the death benefit of the Policy by
  $225. If at any time the accumulation value multiplied by the limitation
percentage is less than the face amount plus premiums less partial    
surrenders, then the death benefit for the Policy, not including any  
agreements, will be the face amount plus premiums paid less partial   
surrenders.                                                           

EFFECT OF PARTIAL SURRENDERS ON THE DEATH BENEFIT                     

  If you choose the Level Option, a partial surrender will reduce the face
amount by an amount equal to the amount of the partial surrender.     
     Regardless of the death benefit option you choose, a partial surrender will
   reduce the death benefit by at least the amount of the partial surrender.

CHOOSING DEATH BENEFIT OPTIONS                                        

  You must choose one death benefit option on your application. This is an
     important decision. The death benefit option you choose will have an impact
   on the dollar value of the death benefit, on your accumulation value, and
    on the amount of cost of insurance charges you pay. If you do not select a
    death benefit option on your application, the Level Option will become the
death benefit option for your Policy, by default.                     

You may find the Level Option more suitable for you if your goal is to
  increase your accumulation value through positive investment experience.
You may find the Increasing Option more suitable if your goal is to   
    increase your total death benefit. You may find the Sum of Premiums Option
 more suitable if your goal is to receive a death benefit which includes
premiums paid.                                                        

CHANGING THE DEATH BENEFIT OPTION                                     

    After the first policy year, you may change your death benefit option once
each policy year. We will notify you of the new face amount.          

-    You must send your written request to our home office. 

    -    The effective date of the change will be the monthly policy
              anniversary on or following the date we approve your request for
a change.                                         

          -    There may be adverse federal tax consequences. You should consult
               a tax adviser before changing your Policy's death benefit option.

INCREASING/DECREASING THE FACE AMOUNT                                 

     You may increase or decrease the face amount of the Policy after the Policy
    has been in force for one year. An increase or decrease in the face amount
   will affect your cost of insurance charge, your guideline premium or cash
value accumulation tax calculation, and may have adverse federal tax  
consequences. You should consult a tax adviser before increasing or   
decreasing your Policy's face amount.                                 

An increase in face amount will be treated as an additional layer of  
 coverage with its own monthly Policy Issue Charge, surrender charge and
surrender charge period.                                              

Conditions for and impact of decreasing the face amount:              

-    you must send your written request to our home office; 

-    decreases are only allowed after the first policy year;

27

P-->N-634th�Page�of�80TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�34th
         -    we require your requested decrease in face amount to be at least
$5,000;                                           

          -    you may not decrease your face amount if it would disqualify your
Policy as life insurance under the Code;          

     -    if the decrease in face amount would cause your Policy to be
               classified a modified endowment contract (MEC) under the Code, we
    will not allow the decrease in face amount, unless you
         specifically instruct us in writing that you intend for the
Policy to be classified as a MEC; and             

         -    a decrease in face amount will take effect on the monthly policy
         anniversary on or after we receive and approve your written
request.                                          

Conditions for and impact of increasing the face amount:              

       -    your request must be applied for on a supplemental application
           and must include evidence of insurability satisfactory to us;

      -    a requested increase in face amount requires our approval and
            will take effect on the monthly policy anniversary on or after
the day we approve your request;                  

-    increases are only allowed after the first policy year;

         -    we require your requested increase in face amount to be at least
$5,000; and                                       

        -    each increase in face amount will have its own surrender charge
       that applies for 10 years after the date of the increase.

SETTLEMENT OPTIONS 

  There are several ways of receiving proceeds under the death benefit and
 surrender provisions of the Policy, other than in a lump sum. These are
     described under "Settlement Options" in your Policy and in the Statement of
Additional Information.                                               

POLICY LOANS                                                          

  Beginning after December 1, 2008, while your Policy is in force, you may
     submit a request to our home office to borrow money from us using only your
     Policy as the security for the loan. We normally pay the loan amount within
    seven days after we receive a proper loan request. We may postpone payment
of loans under certain conditions as described in the Statement of    
  Additional Information. You may increase your risk of termination if you
  take a loan. A loan that is taken from, or secured by a Policy, may have
adverse federal income tax consequences. See "Federal Tax Status."    

The maximum amount available for loans under your Policy is the Policy
accumulation value less any applicable surrender charge and three (3) 
   months of monthly charges. We determine this amount on the Valuation Date
    we receive your request for a loan at our home office. There is no minimum
    policy loan. When you take a loan, we will transfer an amount equal to the
    loan from your guaranteed interest account accumulation value and separate
account accumulation value to the loan account, part of our general   
  account. Unless you instruct us otherwise, we will transfer accumulation
value from the guaranteed interest account and the sub-accounts of the
    Account in which you are invested on a pro-rata basis. We hold this amount
     as collateral for the loan in the loan account and such collateral will not
be available for withdrawal.                                          

     Your Policy will remain in force so long as the accumulation value less the
     sum of the policy loan and any unpaid policy loan interest is sufficient to
cover the monthly charges when due. Otherwise, your                   

28

P-->N-635th�Page�of�80TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�35th
  Policy will terminate. To prevent your Policy from terminating, you will
     have to make a loan repayment. We will notify you 61 days in advance of the
  termination of your Policy and the loan repayment required to keep it in
   force. The time for repayment will be within 61 days after our mailing of
the notice.                                                           

  POLICY LOAN INTEREST We will charge you interest on a policy loan at the
     annual rate of interest shown on the policy data pages of your Policy while
 your policy loan is outstanding. Currently, we charge an annual rate of
interest of 4 percent. Policy loan interest becomes due and payable:  

-    on a policy loan transaction;                          

-    on each policy anniversary;                            

-    on surrender or termination of the Policy; or          

-    on the date of the death of the insured.               

     If you do not pay the interest on your loan when due, your policy loan will
be increased by the amount of the unpaid interest.                    

  We also credit interest to amounts in the loan account at least equal to
   the interest rate shown on the policy data pages. Currently, we credit an
  annual rate of interest which is not less than your policy loan interest
 rate minus 1 percent. However, if your Policy has been in force for ten
years or more, we will credit your loan amount with an annual rate of 
  interest equal to the policy loan rate minus .10 percent. On the date of
   each policy loan transaction and policy anniversary, we will allocate any
accrued loan account interest on a pro-rata basis to the guaranteed   
interest account and the sub-accounts of the Account based on your    
accumulation value in each investment option.                         

    POLICY LOAN REPAYMENTS If your Policy is in force, you may repay your loan
  in part or in full at any time before the insured's death. Your loan may
    also be repaid within 60 days after the date of the insured's death, if we
have not paid any of the benefits under the Policy. When we receive a 
payment from you, we will automatically treat that payment as premium 
   unless you specify otherwise when the payment is made. Payments specified
as loan repayments will not be subject to a premium charge.           

When you repay a loan, we transfer the repayment amount from the loan 
 account to your guaranteed interest account accumulation value and your
 separate account accumulation value. Unless you direct us otherwise, we
  will transfer the repayment amount on a pro-rata basis to the guaranteed
interest account and the sub-accounts of the Account based on your    
accumulation value in each investment option on the Valuation Date we 
 receive your loan repayment at our home office. We reserve the right to
restrict the amount of any loan repayment to the guaranteed interest  
account.                                                              

     A policy loan, whether or not it is repaid, will have a permanent effect on
 the accumulation value, and depending upon the death benefit option you
have chosen, the death benefit. As long as a loan is outstanding the  
collateral for the loan in the loan account is not affected by the    
 investment performance of sub-accounts and may not be credited with the
   rates of interest we credit accumulation value in the guaranteed interest
account.                                                              

  TERMINATION If the accumulation value less the sum of the policy loan(s)
  and any unpaid policy loan interest is insufficient to cover the monthly
     charges on a monthly policy anniversary, a 61-day grace period begins. Your
   Policy will remain in force during the grace period. You may pay premiums
during this grace period to cover the insufficiency and continue your 
    Policy in force beyond the grace period. We will send you and any assignee
of record, at the last known address, at least 31 days prior          

29

P-->N-636th�Page�of�80TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�36th
  to the end of the grace period, a written notice indicating the due date
and the payment required to keep your Policy in force.                

  The payment required to keep your Policy in force after the grace period
   commences is equal to three times the sum of all the monthly charges that
     were due at the beginning of the grace period, plus the premium charge that
 would apply. If the payment is not paid by the end of the grace period,
  your Policy will terminate without value. If the insured dies during the
grace period, the death proceeds will be paid to the beneficiary.     

REINSTATEMENT At any time within three years from the date of policy  
 termination while the insured is living, you may ask us to restore your
   Policy to an in force status, unless you surrendered your Policy. We will
require each of the following to reinstate your Policy:               

1.   your written request to reinstate the Policy;          

      2.   that you submit to us at our home office during the insured's
   lifetime evidence satisfactory to us of the insured's
          insurability so that we may have time to act on the evidence
during the insured's lifetime;                    

          3.   a payment sufficient to cover all monthly charges and policy loan
  interest due and unpaid during the grace period; and

       4.   a premium sufficient to keep the Policy in force for three (3)
months after the date of the reinstatement.       

The effective date of reinstatement will be the first monthly policy  
anniversary on or following the date we approve your request for      
    reinstatement. The Surrender Charge and Policy Issue Charge schedules that
were in place at the end of the grace period will be effective at the 
     reinstatement date. We will send you new policy data pages when your Policy
is reinstated.                                                        

SURRENDER                                                             

   You may request to surrender your Policy at any time while the insured is
   living and the Policy is in force. A surrender may have tax consequences.
See "Federal Tax Status."                                             

     The surrender value of the Policy is the accumulation value less any unpaid
    policy charges which we assess against accumulation value, less any policy
    loan, less any unpaid policy loan interest and less any surrender charges.
We determine the surrender value as of the Valuation Date on which we 
     receive your signed written request for surrender of the Policy at our home
     office. You may request that the surrender value be paid to you in cash or,
     alternatively, paid under a settlement option we offer. We may require that
you return the Policy.                                                

  If you surrender your Policy during the first ten policy years or during
    the first ten years following an increase in face amount, we will assess a
   Surrender Charge, which may significantly reduce the surrender value. See
   "Policy Charges." The amount you receive on surrender may be more or less
    than the total premiums you paid under the Policy. Once you surrender your
Policy, all coverage and other benefits under it cease and cannot be  
     reinstated. A surrender may have tax consequences. See "Distributions Other
Than Death Benefits from Modified Endowment Contracts" and "Distributions
 Other Than Death Benefits from Policies that are not Modified Endowment
Contracts."                                                           

  We will pay surrender or partial surrender proceeds as soon as possible,
 but not later than seven days after we receive your written request for
     surrender or partial surrender. However, if any portion of the accumulation
value to be surrendered is attributable to a premium payment made by  
   non-guaranteed funds such as a personal check, we will delay mailing that
   portion of the surrender proceeds until we have reasonable assurance that
the check has cleared and the funds have been collected.              

30

P-->N-637th�Page�of�80TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�37th
PARTIAL SURRENDER                                                     

  Any time after the first policy year while the insured is living and the
     Policy is in force, you may request a partial surrender of the accumulation
 value of your Policy by forwarding your request to our home office. The
   partial surrender must be at least $500. The maximum partial surrender we
    will allow is the accumulation value: (i) less any outstanding policy loan
 and accrued loan interest, (ii) less the amount of any Surrender Charge
applicable at that time, and (iii) less three (3) months of monthly   
charges. For each partial surrender, we assess a Partial Surrender    
    Transaction Charge of 2 percent of the amount of the partial surrender, up
to $25.00.                                                            

     You may tell us from which sub-accounts and the guaranteed interest account
   to make a partial surrender. If you do not specify, the partial surrender
  will be deducted from your accumulation value in the guaranteed interest
account and the sub-accounts on a pro-rata basis. We will process the 
    partial surrender at the unit values next determined after we receive your
    request at our home office. This means that if we receive your request for
partial surrender prior to 3:00 p.m. Central time, we will process the
request at the unit values determined as of that Valuation Date. If we
  receive your request for partial surrender at or after 3:00 p.m. Central
    time, we will process the request at the unit values determined as of 3:00
p.m. Central time on the following Valuation Date.                    

   If a partial surrender would cause your Policy to be disqualified as life
insurance under the Code, we will not process your request for partial
     surrender. In addition, unless you have instructed us otherwise in writing,
if a partial surrender would cause your Policy to be classified as a  
modified endowment contract under the Code, we will not process your  
request for partial surrender. Under the Level Option death benefit, a
  partial surrender will cause a decrease in the face amount of the Policy
equal to the amount of the partial surrender. For each death benefit  
   option, a partial surrender will decrease the amount of the death benefit
proceeds payable.                                                     

We reserve the right to defer the payment of surrender and partial    
surrender proceeds for up to six months from the date of your written 
    request, if such proceeds would be paid exclusively from your accumulation
value in the guaranteed interest account. In that case, if we postpone
     payment for more than 31 days, we will pay you interest at 3 percent annual
rate for the period during which payment is postponed.                

If mandated under applicable law, we may block an owner's account and 
    thereby refuse to pay any request for surrender or partial surrender until
  instructions are received from the appropriate regulator. We may also be
required to provide additional information about an owner and owner's 
account to government regulators.                                     

POLICY CHARGES 

     We assess certain charges against premiums and accumulation value under the
Policy. The maximum and minimum charges and the charges for certain   
specified insureds are described in the "Fee Tables" section of this  
 prospectus. The charges compensate us for: (1) services and benefits we
provide; (2) costs and expenses we incur; and (3) risks we assume.    

SERVICES AND BENEFITS WE PROVIDE:                                     

     -    the death benefit, cash, and loan benefits under the Policy;

   -    investment options, including premium payment allocations;

-    administration of elective options; and                

-    the distribution of reports to owners.                 

31

P-->N-638th�Page�of�80TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�38th
COSTS AND EXPENSES WE INCUR:                                          

        -    costs associated with processing and underwriting applications,
          and with issuing and administering the Policy (including any
Agreements);                                      

         -    overhead and other expenses for providing services and benefits,
              and sales and marketing expenses, including compensation paid in
connection with the sale of the Policies; and     

  -    other costs of doing business, such as collecting premium
         payments, maintaining records, processing claims, effecting
            transactions, and paying federal, state, and local premium and
other taxes and fees.                             

RISKS WE ASSUME:                                                      

          -    that the cost of insurance charges we may assess are insufficient
           to meet our actual claims because insureds die sooner than we
estimate; and                                     

        -    that the costs of providing the services and benefits under the
Policies exceed the charges we assess.            

     PREMIUM CHARGE Prior to allocation of a premium payment, we assess a charge
from each premium payment to compensate us for distribution and       
    administrative expenses and certain taxes associated with our issuance and
     maintenance of the Policy. We credit the remaining amount (the net premium)
to your Policy's accumulation value according to your allocation      
     instructions. The current Premium Charge is 4.0 percent of each premium and
is guaranteed not to exceed 7.0 percent of each premium.              

 ACCUMULATION VALUE CHARGES We assess the following charges against your
     accumulation value: (1) a Monthly Policy Charge; (2) a Policy Issue Charge;
  (3) a Cost of Insurance Charge; (4) a Mortality and Expense Risk Charge;
   (5) a Cash Extra Charge; (6) certain transaction charges; (7) a Surrender
Charge; and (8) charges for any Agreements you elect.                 

  Some of the accumulation value charges depend on the "risk class" of the
insured. The risk class of an insured is based upon the insured's     
"underwriting class" and "tobacco class."                             

 The underwriting class of the insured represents the level of mortality
    risk that we assume. The tobacco class refers to the tobacco use habits of
the insured.                                                          

         1.   MONTHLY POLICY CHARGE. The Monthly Policy Charge is currently $8
              per month and is guaranteed not to exceed a monthly charge equal
         to $12.00, plus $0.0125 per $1,000 of face amount under the
          Policy. The Monthly Policy Charge compensates us for certain
              administrative expenses we bear, including those attributable to
 the records we create and maintain for your Policy.

         2.   POLICY ISSUE CHARGE. We assess a monthly Policy Issue Charge for
              the first ten years following issuance of the Policy and for the
               first ten years following any increase in face amount. The charge
              varies based upon the age, gender and risk class of the insured.
        The Policy Issue Charge compensates us for our expenses of
           issuing, underwriting and distributing the Policy. The Policy
               Issue Charge for your Policy is shown on the policy data pages of
the Policy.                                       

        3.   COST OF INSURANCE CHARGE. We assess a monthly Cost of Insurance
             Charge to compensate us for underwriting the death benefit. The
             charge depends on a number of variables (insured's age, gender,
           risk class, and face amount) that would cause it to vary from
             Policy to Policy and from monthly policy anniversary to monthly
           policy anniversary. We calculate the Cost of Insurance Charge
            separately for the initial face amount and for any increase in
face amount,                                      

32

P-->N-639th�Page�of�80TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�39th
               each a coverage layer. If we approve an increase in your Policy's
          face amount, a different risk class (and a different cost of
               insurance rate) may apply to the increase, based on the insured's
       circumstances at the time of the increase in face amount.

          The cost of insurance charge for a coverage layer is the net
     amount at risk for the coverage layer multiplied by the
              applicable cost of insurance rate. The net amount at risk varies
          with investment performance, the payment of premiums and the
              assessment of policy charges. The net amount at risk is equal to
         the death benefit payable divided by the net amount at risk
           divisor, as shown on the data pages of your Policy, minus the
accumulation value of the Policy.                 

          COST OF INSURANCE RATES The actual monthly cost of insurance
            rates are based on our expectations as to future mortality and
          expense experience. The rates will never be greater than the
             maximum guaranteed cost of insurance rates for the initial face
               amount shown on the policy data pages of your Policy. The maximum
         guaranteed cost of insurance rates for any increase in face
             amount will be shown on the policy data pages we send to you at
             the time of the increase in face amount. These guaranteed rates
               are based on the 2001 Commissioner's Standard Ordinary Composite,
           Ultimate, Age Nearest Birthday, Sex-Distinct Mortality Tables
             (2001 Commissioner's Standard Ordinary Composite, Ultimate, Age
         Nearest Birthday, Table B Mortality Tables, if we issue the
            Policy on a unisex basis) and the insured's age. Any change in
               the cost of insurance rates will apply to all persons of the same
             age, risk class, and number of full years insurance has been in
force.                                            

               In general the longer you own your Policy, the higher the cost of
              insurance rate will be as the insured grows older. Also our cost
            of insurance rates will generally be lower if the insured is a
           female than if a male, unless we issue the Policy on a unisex
       basis. Similarly, our current cost of insurance rates are
               generally lower for non-tobacco users than tobacco users, and for
              persons considered to be in excellent health. On the other hand,
              insureds who present particular health, occupational or non-work
            related risks may require higher cost of insurance rates under
their Policies.                                   

         4.   MORTALITY AND EXPENSE RISK CHARGE. We assess a monthly Mortality
            and Expense Risk charge to compensate us for certain mortality
         and expense risks we assume. The mortality risk is that the
               insured will live for a shorter time than we project. The expense
     risk is that the expenses that we incur will exceed the
administrative charge limits we set in the Policy.

              This charge currently is equal to an annual rate of .030 percent
          of the accumulation value less the loan account value of the
          Policy in policy years one through ten. Currently, we do not
               assess a charge after the tenth policy year. We reserve the right
              to increase this charge to a maximum rate of .075 percent of the
accumulation value of the Policy.                 

               If this charge does not cover our actual costs, we may absorb any
          such loss. Conversely, if the charge more than covers actual
            costs, the excess is added to our surplus. We expect to profit
               from this charge and may use these profits for any lawful purpose
including covering distribution expenses.         

        5.   CASH EXTRA CHARGE. We may assess a monthly charge to compensate
           us for providing the death benefit under the Policy where the
           insured presents a heightened or increased level of mortality
              risk. An insured may present increased mortality risk because of
       an outstanding medical condition (e.g., cancer that is in
             remission), or occupation or activity engaged in by the insured
               (e.g., sky-diving). We will assess the Cash Extra Charge only for
the period of time                                

33

P-->N-640th�Page�of�80TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�40th
             necessary to compensate us for the heightened mortality risk we
        would bear as a result of an insured's outstanding medical
             condition, occupation or activity. The Cash Extra Charge, which
       is generally not applicable to most Policies, is uniquely
              determined for each insured and may vary based upon factors such
             as gender, risk class and age. The charge is defined as a level
              cost per thousand dollars of face amount. If a Cash Extra Charge
               applies to your Policy, the amount of the charge will be shown on
the policy data pages of the Policy.              

          6.   TRANSACTION CHARGES. We may assess certain transaction charges if
             you elect to make a policy change, take a partial surrender, or
        transfer accumulation value among the sub-accounts and the
             guaranteed interest account. We assess transaction charges from
the accumulation value of your Policy.            

              a.   POLICY CHANGE TRANSACTION CHARGE. We assess a Policy Change
                   Transaction Charge to compensate us for expenses associated
              with processing a policy change such as an increase or
                    decrease in face amount, a change in death benefit option or
                   a change in your risk classification. Currently, the charge
                   is $60 for each policy change. We guarantee the charge will
not exceed $100.                        

         b.   PARTIAL SURRENDER TRANSACTION CHARGE. For each partial
                 surrender, we assess a processing fee of 2 percent of the
         amount surrendered, up to $25, from the remaining
          accumulation value. The fee compensates us for the
                 administrative costs in generating the withdrawal payment
                    and in making all calculations which may be required because
of the partial surrender.               

              c.   TRANSFER TRANSACTION CHARGE. We currently allow you to make
              12 transfers among the sub-accounts and the guaranteed
                   interest account each policy year free of charge. We assess
                   $10 for the 13th and each additional transfer made during a
                policy year to compensate us for the costs of processing
                   these transfers. We assess the charge from the amount being
                 transferred. We guarantee the Transfer Transaction Charge
will not exceed $25.                    

                  For purposes of assessing the Transfer Transaction Charge,
                    we consider all telephone, facsimile and/or written requests
                   processed on the same day to be one transfer, regardless of
                   the number of sub-accounts (or guaranteed interest account)
affected by the transfer(s).            

 7.   SURRENDER CHARGE. If your Policy terminates or you fully
               surrender your Policy during the first ten policy years or within
               10 years after any increase in face amount, we assess a surrender
              charge from your accumulation value and pay the remaining amount
          (less any unpaid policy charges, outstanding policy loan and
             accrued interest) to you. The payment you receive is called the
surrender value.                                  

          The surrender charge equals 1.40 times the lesser of: (1) 60
              times the Policy Issue Charge for the initial face amount or the
       face amount increase as applicable, or (2) the sum of any
               remaining Policy Issue Charges for the initial face amount or the
       face amount increase, as applicable, measured from policy
      termination or full surrender to the end of the ten year
              surrender charge period. Increases in face amount have their own
          surrender charge penalty period. THE SURRENDER CHARGE MAY BE
              SIGNIFICANT. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CALCULATE THESE CHARGES BEFORE
            YOU REQUEST A SURRENDER OR INCREASE IN FACE AMOUNT. UNDER SOME
             CIRCUMSTANCES THE LEVEL OF SURRENDER CHARGES MIGHT RESULT IN NO
SURRENDER VALUE BEING AVAILABLE.                  

               We assess the Surrender Charge to compensate us partially for the
               cost of administering, issuing, and selling the Policy, including
agent sales commissions, the cost of printing the 

34

P-->N-641st�Page�of�80TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�41st
               prospectuses and sales literature, any advertising costs, medical
            exams, review of applications for insurance, processing of the
             applications, establishing policy records, and policy issue. We
             do not expect Surrender Charges to cover all of these costs. To
            the extent that they do not, we will cover the short-fall from
            our general account assets, which may include profits from the
             mortality and expense risk charge and cost of insurance charge.

8.   CHARGES FOR AGREEMENTS. We assess monthly charges for  
       supplemental insurance benefits you add to your Policy by
Agreement.                                        

               The Monthly Policy Charge, Policy Issue Charge, Cost of Insurance
               Charge, Mortality and Expense Risk Charge, Cash Extra Charge, and
            charges for Agreements, if any, are assessed in advance on the
  policy date and at every monthly policy anniversary.

            Charges will be assessed against the accumulation value in the
            guaranteed interest account and the sub-accounts on a pro-rata
       basis. If there is insufficient accumulation value in the
            guaranteed interest account and the sub-accounts, then we will
   assess charges against the loan account to the extent
          accumulation value in the loan account exceeds the amount of
outstanding policy loans.                         

  SEPARATE ACCOUNT CHARGE We reserve the right to charge or make provision
     for any taxes payable by us with respect to the Account or the Policies for
changes to federal or state tax laws that occur after issuance of the 
Policy. No such charge or provision is made at the present time.      

     PORTFOLIO EXPENSES The value of the net assets of each sub-account reflects
the management fees and other expenses incurred by the corresponding  
Portfolio in which the sub-account invests. For further information,  
 consult the Portfolios' prospectuses and the Annual Portfolio Operating
 Expenses table included in the "Fee Tables" section of this prospectus.

OTHER POLICY PROVISIONS                                               

 DEFERRAL OF PAYMENT Normally, we will pay any proceeds under the Policy
    within seven days after our receipt of all the documents required for such
     payment. Other than the death proceeds, which are determined as of the date
    of death of the insured, we will determine the amount of payment as of the
    end of the Valuation Date on which we receive the request in good order at
our home office.                                                      

 We reserve the right to defer the payment of proceeds under the Policy,
     including policy loans, for up to six months from the date of your request,
if such payment would be taken from your accumulation value in the    
  guaranteed interest account. In that case, if we postpone payment, other
     than a policy loan payment, for more than 31 days, we will pay you interest
 at 3 percent annual rate for the period beyond 31 days that payment has
 been postponed. We reserve the right to defer the payment of surrender,
  partial surrender, loan and death benefit proceeds from the sub-accounts
  and process transfers for the following: (a) any period during which the
  New York Stock Exchange is closed for trading (except for normal holiday
    closing); (b) when the SEC has determined that a state of emergency exists
    which may make such payment impractical; or (c) the SEC, by order, permits
deferral for the protection of policy owners.                         

     If mandated under applicable law, we may block a policy owner's account and
thereby refuse to pay any request for surrender, partial surrender,   
   transfer, loans or death benefit proceeds until instructions are received
from the appropriate regulator. We may also be required to provide    
additional information about a policy owner and the owner's account to
government regulators.                                                

35

P-->N-642nd�Page�of�80TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�42nd
BENEFICIARY When we receive proof satisfactory to us of the insured's 
 death, we will pay the death proceeds of a Policy to the beneficiary or
    beneficiaries named in the application for the Policy unless the owner has
   changed the beneficiary. In that event, we will pay the death proceeds to
the beneficiary named in the last change of beneficiary request.      

  If a beneficiary dies before the insured, that beneficiary's interest in
the Policy ends with that beneficiary's death. Only beneficiaries who 
    survive the insured will be eligible to share in the death proceeds. If no
 beneficiary survives the insured we will pay the death proceeds of this
     Policy to the owner, if living, otherwise to the owner's estate, or, if the
owner is a corporation, to it or its successor.                       

   You may change the beneficiary designated to receive the proceeds. If you
   have reserved the right to change the beneficiary, you can file a written
 request with us to change the beneficiary. If you have not reserved the
     right to change the beneficiary, we will require the written consent of the
irrevocable beneficiary.                                              

    Your written request to change the beneficiary will not be effective until
   it is recorded at our home office. After it has been so recorded, it will
    take effect as of the date you signed the request. However, if the insured
dies before the request has been so recorded, the request will not be 
     effective as to any death benefit proceeds we have paid before your request
was recorded in our home office records.                              

SUPPLEMENTAL AGREEMENTS                                               

     The following Agreements offering supplemental benefits are available under
the Policy. Some of the Agreements are subject to our underwriting    
approval. We may assess monthly charges for these Agreements from     
accumulation value. Charges for the Agreements are described in the   
     "Periodic Charges Other Than Investment Option Operating Expenses" table in
the "Fee Tables" section of this prospectus. Your agent can help you  
 determine whether certain of the Agreements are suitable for you. These
Agreements may not be available in all states. Please contact us for  
further details.                                                      

    WAIVER OF PREMIUM AGREEMENT The Waiver of Premiums Agreement provides that
     in the event of the insured's total and permanent disability (as defined in
    the Agreement), we will credit the specified premium payment identified in
    the Policy to the Policy each month while the insured is disabled, subject
   to the conditions set forth in the Agreement. This Agreement is available
   at issue with underwriting approval and may also be added after the first
    policy anniversary subject to underwriting approval. This Agreement is not
available if the Waiver of Charges Agreement is elected. We assess a  
separate monthly charge for this Agreement.                           

   WAIVER OF CHARGES AGREEMENT The Waiver of Charges Agreement provides that
     in the event of the insured's total and permanent disability (as defined in
 the Agreement), we will waive the monthly charges under the Policy each
     month while the insured is disabled, subject to the conditions set forth in
the Agreement. This Agreement is available at issue with underwriting 
   approval and may also be added after the first policy anniversary subject
    to underwriting approval. This Agreement is not available if the Waiver of
    Premium Agreement is elected. We assess a separate monthly charge for this
Agreement.                                                            

 FAMILY TERM AGREEMENT -- CHILDREN The Family Term Agreement -- Children
   provides fixed level term insurance on each of the insured's children (as
   defined in the Agreement) up to the first anniversary of the Agreement on
     or following the child's 25th birthday, subject to the conditions set forth
  in the Agreement. This Agreement is available at issue with underwriting
 approval and may be added after the first policy anniversary subject to
underwriting approval. We assess a separate monthly charge for this   
Agreement.                                                            

36

P-->N-643rd�Page�of�80TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�43rd
     ACCELERATED BENEFITS AGREEMENT The Accelerated Benefit Agreement allows you
 to receive a significant portion of your Policy's death benefit, if the
     insured develops a terminal condition due to sickness or injury (as defined
in the Agreement). This Agreement is available at issue without       
    underwriting approval and may be added after the first policy anniversary,
  again without underwriting approval. There is no separate charge for the
Agreement.                                                            

 DEATH BENEFIT GUARANTEE AGREEMENT The Death Benefit Guarantee Agreement
provides that the Policy will remain in force even if the accumulation
   value is not sufficient to cover monthly charges when due, as long as the
Death Benefit Guarantee value (as defined in the Agreement) less any  
    outstanding Policy loans is greater than zero. This Agreement is available
     at issue without underwriting approval and may not be added after issue. We
assess a separate monthly charge for this Agreement.                  

   TERM INSURANCE AGREEMENT The Term Insurance Agreement provides additional
level term insurance coverage on the life of the insured. Subject to  
    underwriting approval, this Agreement is available at issue and may not be
    added after issue. We assess a separate monthly charge for this Agreement.

  OVERLOAN PROTECTION AGREEMENT The Overloan Protection Agreement provides
    that the Policy will not terminate because of a policy loan even where the
   accumulation value of the Policy is insufficient to cover policy charges.
 This Agreement is available at issue without underwriting approval. The
   policy owner must elect to use the guideline premium test and cannot have
elected to use the Accelerated Benefit Agreement, or waived charges or
premiums under either the Waiver of Premium Agreement or the Waiver of
Charges Agreement. Once exercised, the death benefit payable under the
 Policy will be the minimum death benefit payable as permitted under the
Code at the time the Overloan Protection Agreement was exercised. The 
  Agreement may be exercised on non-modified endowment contracts after the
   Policy has been in force for at least 15 years and the insured is over 75
  years of age. Once elected, this Agreement will last until the Policy is
   surrendered or until the insured's death and will reduce the Policy death
     benefit by the amount of the loan account. We assess a one-time charge when
the Agreement is exercised.                                           

OTHER MATTERS                                                                   

FEDERAL TAX STATUS 

  INTRODUCTION The discussion of federal taxes is general in nature and is
not intended as tax advice. Each person concerned should consult a tax
  adviser. This discussion is based on our understanding of federal income
tax laws as they are currently interpreted. No representation is made 
    regarding the likelihood of continuation of current income tax laws or the
 current interpretations of the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"). We
have not considered any applicable state or other tax laws.           

TAXATION OF MINNESOTA LIFE AND THE INDIVIDUAL VARIABLE UNIVERSAL LIFE 
ACCOUNT We are taxed as a "life insurance company" under the Code. The
 operations of the Account form a part of, and are taxed with, our other
business activities. Currently, we pay no federal income tax on income
dividends received by the Account or on capital gains arising from the
   Account's activities. The Account is not taxed as a "regulated investment
   company" under the Code and it does not anticipate any change in that tax
status.                                                               

At the present time, we make no charge to the Account for any federal,
     state or local taxes that we incur that may be attributable to such Account
    or to the Policies. We, however, reserve the right in the future to make a
charge for any such tax or other economic burden resulting from the   
   application of the tax laws that we determine to be properly attributable
to the Account or the Policies.                                       

37

P-->N-644th�Page�of�80TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�44th
In calculating our corporate income tax liability, we derive certain  
 corporate income tax benefits associated with the investment of company
assets, including separate account assets that are treated as company 
  assets under applicable income tax law. These benefits, which reduce our
overall corporate income tax liability may include dividends received 
  deductions and foreign tax credits which can be material. We do not pass
   these benefits through to the separate accounts, principally because: (i)
     the majority of the benefits results from the dividends received deduction,
which involves no reduction in the dollar amount of dividends that the
 separate account receives; and (ii) under applicable income tax law for
purposes of both the dividends received deductions and the foreign tax
    credits, contract owners are not the owners of the assets generating those
benefits.                                                             

   TAX STATUS OF THE POLICY In order to qualify as a life insurance contract
   for federal income tax purposes and to receive the tax treatment normally
accorded life insurance contracts under federal tax law, a Policy must
   satisfy certain requirements which are set forth in the Code. Guidance as
  to how these requirements are to be applied is limited. Nevertheless, we
 believe that a Policy issued on a standard rate class basis (other than
     those with a Cash Extra Charge) should satisfy the applicable requirements.
There is less guidance, however, with respect to policies issued on a 
   substandard basis or with a Cash Extra Charge and it is not clear whether
   such policies will in all cases satisfy the applicable requirements. If a
Policy were determined not to be a life insurance contract for federal
income tax purposes, that Policy would not provide most of the tax    
advantages normally provided by a life insurance contract. If it is   
subsequently determined that a Policy does not satisfy the applicable 
requirements, we may take appropriate steps to bring the Policy into  
compliance with such requirements and we reserve the right to restrict
policy transactions in order to do so.                                

In some circumstances, owners of variable life insurance contracts who
     retain excessive control over the investment of underlying variable account
   assets may be treated as the owners of those assets and may be subject to
     tax on income produced by those assets. Although published guidance in this
    area does not address certain aspects of the Policies, we believe that the
    owner of a Policy should not be treated as the owner of the assets held in
the Account, which is the variable account underlying the Policy. We  
     reserve the right to modify the Policies to bring them into conformity with
applicable standards should such modification be necessary to prevent 
    owners of the Policies from being treated as the owners of the assets held
in the Account.                                                       

In addition, the Code requires that the investments of the Account be 
   "adequately diversified" in order to treat the Policy as a life insurance
contract for federal income tax purposes. We intend that the Account, 
  through the Funds and the Portfolios, will satisfy these diversification
requirements.                                                         

 The following discussion assumes that the Policy will qualify as a life
insurance contract for federal income tax purposes.                   

TAX TREATMENT OF POLICY BENEFITS                                      

   GENERAL We believe that the death benefit under a Policy should generally
    be excludible from the gross income of the beneficiary. Federal, state and
local transfer, and other tax consequences of ownership or receipt of 
policy proceeds depend on the circumstances of each policy owner or   
beneficiary. A tax adviser should be consulted on these consequences. 

Generally, the policy owner will not be deemed to be in constructive  
 receipt of the policy accumulation value until there is a distribution.
     When distributions from a Policy occur, or when loans are taken out from or
   secured by a Policy, the tax consequences depend on whether the Policy is
classified as a "Modified Endowment Contract."                        

38

P-->N-645th�Page�of�80TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�45th
    MODIFIED ENDOWMENT CONTRACTS Under the Internal Revenue Code, certain life
    insurance contracts are classified as MECs, with less favorable income tax
treatment than other life insurance contracts. Due to the Policy's    
  flexibility with respect to premium payments and benefits, each Policy's
circumstances will determine whether the Policy is a MEC. In general, 
 however, a Policy will be classified as a MEC if the amount of premiums
   paid into the Policy causes the Policy to fail the "7-pay test." A Policy
  will fail the 7-pay test if at any time in the first seven policy years,
    the amount paid into the Policy exceeds the sum of the level premiums that
     would have been paid at that point under a Policy that provided for paid-up
future benefits after the payment of seven level annual payments.     

   If there is a reduction in the benefits under the Policy during the first
  seven policy years, for example, as a result of a partial surrender, the
   7-pay test will have to be reapplied as if the Policy had originally been
   issued at the reduced face amount. If there is a "material change" in the
    Policy's benefits or other terms, even after the first seven policy years,
   the Policy may have to be retested as if it were a newly issued Policy. A
  material change can occur, for example, when there is an increase in the
death benefit which is due to the payment of an unnecessary premium.  
     Unnecessary premiums are premiums paid into the Policy which are not needed
    in order to provide a death benefit equal to the lowest death benefit that
  was payable in the first seven policy years. To prevent your Policy from
   becoming a MEC, it may be necessary to limit premium payments or to limit
reductions in benefits. A current or prospective policy owner should  
    consult with a competent adviser to determine whether a policy transaction
will cause the Policy to be classified as a MEC.                      

 DISTRIBUTIONS OTHER THAN DEATH BENEFITS FROM MODIFIED ENDOWMENT CONTRACTS
Policies classified as MECs are subject to the following tax rules:   

1.   All distributions other than death benefits, including 
              distributions upon surrender and withdrawals, from a MEC will be
               treated first as distributions of gain taxable as ordinary income
              and as tax-free recovery of the policy owner's investment in the
Policy only after all gain has been distributed.  

        2.   Loans taken from or secured by a Policy classified as a MEC are
treated as distributions and taxed accordingly.   

    3.   A 10 percent additional income tax is imposed on the amount
               subject to tax except where the distribution or loan is made when
         the policy owner has attained age 59 1/2 or is disabled, or
               where the distribution is part of a series of substantially equal
               periodic payments for the life (or life expectancy) of the policy
          owner or the joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the
           policy owner and the policy owner's beneficiary or designated
beneficiary.                                      

 If a Policy becomes a MEC, distributions that occur during the contract
    year will be taxed as distributions from a MEC. In addition, distributions
 from a Policy within two years before it becomes a MEC will be taxed in
    this manner. This means that a distribution made from a Policy that is not
a MEC could later become taxable as a distribution from a MEC.        

     DISTRIBUTIONS OTHER THAN DEATH BENEFITS FROM POLICIES THAT ARE NOT MODIFIED
   ENDOWMENT CONTRACTS Distributions other than death benefits from a Policy
   that is not classified as a MEC are generally treated first as a recovery
    of the policy owner's investment in the Policy and only after the recovery
of all investment in the Policy as taxable income. However, certain   
    distributions which must be made in order to enable the Policy to continue
    to qualify as a life insurance contract for federal income tax purposes if
     policy benefits are reduced during the first 15 policy years may be treated
in whole or in part as ordinary income subject to tax.                

39

P-->N-646th�Page�of�80TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�46th
Loans from or secured by a Policy that is not a MEC are generally not 
 treated as distributions. However, the tax consequences associated with
    preferred loans are less clear and a tax adviser should be consulted about
such loans.                                                           

Finally, the 10 percent additional income tax does not apply to       
distributions or loans from or secured by a Policy that is not a MEC. 

     SETTLEMENT OPTIONS Even if the death benefit under the Policy is excludible
 from income, payments under Settlement Options may not be excludible in
 full. This is because earnings on the death benefit after the insured's
death are taxable and payments under the Settlement Options generally 
include such earnings. You should consult a tax adviser as to the tax 
treatment of payments under the Settlement Options.                   

   MULTIPLE POLICIES Under the Code, all MECs issued by us (or an affiliated
    company) to the same policy owner during any calendar year will be treated
as one MEC for purposes of determining the amount includable in gross 
     income under Section 72(e) of the Code. Additional rules may be promulgated
 under this provision to prevent avoidance of its effects through serial
contracts or otherwise. For further information on current aggregation
rules under this provision, see your own tax adviser.                 

  INVESTMENT IN THE POLICY Your investment in the Policy is generally your
aggregate premiums. When a distribution is taken from the Policy, your
    investment in the Policy is reduced by the amount of the distribution that
is tax free.                                                          

    POLICY LOANS In general, interest on a policy loan will not be deductible.
  If a policy loan is outstanding when a Policy is canceled or terminated,
the amount of the outstanding indebtedness will be added to the amount
     distributed and will be taxed accordingly. Before taking out a policy loan,
you should consult a tax adviser as to the tax consequences.          

OVERLOAN PROTECTION AGREEMENT Anyone contemplating the purchase of the
    Policy with the Overloan Protection Agreement should be aware that the tax
     consequences of the Overloan Protection Agreement have not been ruled on by
     the IRS or the courts and it is possible that the IRS could assert that the
   outstanding loan balance should be treated as a taxable distribution when
  the Overloan Protection Agreement is exercised. You should consult a tax
adviser as to the tax risks associated with the Overloan Protection   
Agreement.                                                            

WITHHOLDING To the extent Policy distributions are taxable, they are  
generally subject to income tax withholding. Recipients can generally 
elect, however, not to have tax withheld from distributions.          

    OTHER TAXES The transfer of the Policy or the designation of a beneficiary
may have federal, state, and/or local transfer and inheritance tax    
consequences, including the imposition of gift, estate and            
     generation-skipping transfer taxes. For example, the transfer of the Policy
    to, or the designation as beneficiary of, or the payment of proceeds to, a
 person who is assigned to a generation which is two or more generations
below the generation of the policy owner, may have Generation-Skipping
Transfer tax considerations under Section 2601 of the Code.           

     The individual situation of each policy owner or beneficiary will determine
     the extent, if any, to which federal, state and local transfer taxes may be
 imposed. That situation will also determine how ownership or receipt of
  policy proceeds will be treated for purposes of federal, state and local
estate inheritance, generation-skipping transfer and other taxes.

 CONTINUATION OF POLICY BEYOND AGE 100 While we intend for the Policy to
remain in force through the insured's age 121, the tax consequences   
associated with a Policy remaining in force after the insured's 100th 
birthday are unclear. You should consult a tax adviser in all these   
circumstances.                                                        

 OTHER TRANSACTIONS Changing the policy owner may have tax consequences.
Pursuant to Section 1035(a)(1) of the Code, exchanging this Policy for
another involving the same insureds should have no federal income tax 
     consequences if there is no debt and no cash or other property is received.
  The new Policy would have to satisfy the 7-pay test from the date of the
exchange to avoid characterization as a MEC. An exchange of a life    
   insurance contract for a new life insurance contract may, however, result
     in a loss of grandfathering status for statutory changes made after the old
Policy was issued.                                                    

 BUSINESS USES OF POLICY The Policy may be used in various arrangements,
    including nonqualified deferred compensation or salary continuation plans,
split-dollar insurance plans, executive bonus plans, retiree medical  
benefit plans and others. The tax consequences of such plans may vary 
depending on the particular facts and circumstances of each individual
    arrangement. Therefore, if you are contemplating the use of such Policy in
     any arrangement the value of which depends in part on its tax consequences,
     you should be sure to consult a tax adviser regarding the tax attributes of
the particular arrangement.                                           

Moreover, in recent years, Congress has adopted new rules relating to 
    corporate owned life insurance. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 added a
new section to the Code that denies the tax-free treatment of death   
 benefits payable under an employer-owned life insurance contract unless
certain notice and consent requirements are met and either (1) certain
rules relating to the insured employee's status are satisfied or (2)  
 certain rules relating to the payment of the "amount received under the
     contract" to, or for the benefit of, certain beneficiaries or successors of
   the insured employee are satisfied. The new rules apply to life insurance
     contracts owned by corporations (including S corporations), individual sole
proprietors, estates and trusts and partnerships that are engaged in a
   trade or business. Any business contemplating the purchase of a Policy on
the life of an employee should consult with its legal and tax advisers
regarding the applicability of the new legislation to the proposed    
 purchase. If a Policy is owned or held by a corporation, trust or other
  non-natural person, this could jeopardize some (or all) of such entity's
interest deduction under Code Section 264, even where such entity's   
indebtedness is in no way connected to the Policy. In addition, under 
Section 264(f)(5), if a business (other than a sole proprietorship) is
directly or indirectly a beneficiary of a Policy, this Policy could be
treated as held by the business for purposes of the Section 264(f)    
 entity-holder rules. Therefore, it would be advisable to consult with a
 qualified tax adviser before any non-natural person is made an owner or
     holder of a Policy, or before a business (other than a sole proprietorship)
is made a beneficiary of a Policy.                                    

     SPLIT-DOLLAR ARRANGEMENTS A tax adviser should be consulted with respect to
    the 2003 split-dollar regulations if you have purchased or are considering
  the purchase of a Policy for a split-dollar insurance plan. Any business
    contemplating the purchase of a new life insurance contract or a change in
an existing contract should consult a tax adviser. Additionally, the  
    Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the "Act") prohibits, with limited exceptions,
publicly-traded companies, including non-U.S. companies that have     
securities listed on exchanges in the United States, from extending,  
 directly or through a subsidiary, many types of personal loans to their
   directors or executive officers. It is possible that this prohibition may
be interpreted as applying to split-dollar life insurance policies for
  directors and executive officers of such companies, since such insurance
   arguably can be viewed as involving a loan from the employer for at least
some purposes.                                                        

41

P-->N-648th�Page�of�80TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�48th
  Although the prohibition on loans is generally effective as of the Act's
effective date of July 30, 2002, there is an exception for loans      
  outstanding as of the date of enactment, so long as there is no material
   modification to the loan terms and the loan is not renewed after July 30,
2002. Any affected business contemplating the payment of a premium on an
existing Policy, or the purchase of a new Policy, in connection with a
split-dollar life insurance arrangement should consult legal counsel. 

   ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX There may also be an indirect tax upon the income
in the Policy or the proceeds of a Policy under the federal corporate 
alternative minimum tax, if the policy owner is subject to that tax.  

 ESTATE, GIFT AND GENERATION-SKIPPING TRANSFER TAXES The transfer of the
Policy or designation of a beneficiary may have federal, state, and/or
   local transfer and inheritance tax consequences, including the imposition
    of gift, estate, and generation-skipping transfer taxes. For example, when
  the insured dies, the death proceeds will generally be includable in the
 policy owner's estate for purposes of federal estate tax if the insured
    owned the Policy. If the policy owner was not the insured, the fair market
     value of the Policy would be included in the policy owner's estate upon the
   policy owner's death. The Policy would not be includable in the insured's
    estate if the insured neither retained incidents of ownership at death nor
had given up ownership within three years before death.               

  Moreover, under certain circumstances, the Code may impose a "generation
skipping transfer tax" when all or part of a life insurance policy is 
  transferred to, or a death benefit is paid to, an individual two or more
 generations younger than the policy owner. Regulations issued under the
Code may require us to deduct the tax from your Policy, or from any   
applicable payment, and pay it directly to the IRS.                   

   Qualified tax advisers should be consulted concerning the estate and gift
     tax consequences of Policy ownership and distributions under federal, state
   and local law. The individual situation of each owner or beneficiary will
   determine the extent, if any, to which federal, state, and local transfer
     and inheritance taxes may be imposed and how ownership or receipt of policy
   proceeds will be treated for purposes of federal, state and local estate,
inheritance, generation-skipping and other taxes.                     

ECONOMIC GROWTH AND TAX RELIEF RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2001 The Economic
 Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 ("EGTRRA") repeals the
     federal estate tax and replaces it with a carryover basis income tax regime
  effective for estates of decedents dying after December 31, 2009. EGTRRA
  also repeals the generation-skipping transfer tax, but not the gift tax,
for transfers made after December 31, 2009. EGTRRA contains a sunset  
provision, which essentially returns the federal estate, gift and     
   generation-skipping transfer taxes to their pre-EGTRRA form, beginning in
    2011. Congress may or may not enact permanent repeal between now and then.

    During the period prior to 2010, EGTRRA provides for periodic decreases in
   the maximum estate tax rate coupled with periodic increases in the estate
tax exemption.                                                        

The complexity of EGTRRA, along with uncertainty as to how it might be
  modified in coming years, underscores the importance of seeking guidance
  from a qualified adviser to help ensure that your estate plan adequately
addresses your needs and that of your beneficiaries under all possible
scenarios.                                                            

It should be understood that the foregoing description of the federal 
income, gift and estate tax consequences under the Policies is not    
   exhaustive and that special rules are provided with respect to situations
     not discussed. Statutory changes in the Code, with varying effective dates,
   and regulations adopted thereunder may also alter the tax consequences of
    specific factual situations. Due to the complexity of the applicable laws,
    a person contemplating the purchase of a variable life insurance policy or
exercising elections under such a Policy should consult a tax adviser.

VOTING RIGHTS                                                         

We will vote the Fund shares held in the various sub-accounts of the  
Account at regular and special shareholder meetings of the Funds in   
accordance with your instructions. If, however, the 1940 Act or any   
     regulation thereunder should change and we determine that it is permissible
     to vote the Fund shares in our own right, we may elect to do so. The number
   of votes as to which you have the right to instruct will be determined by
     dividing your Policy's accumulation value in a sub-account by the net asset
     value per share of the corresponding Fund Portfolio. Fractional shares will
    be counted. The number of votes as to which you have the right to instruct
   will be determined as of the date coincident with the date established by
   the Funds for determining shareholders eligible to vote at the meeting of
the Funds. We will vote Fund shares held by the Account as to which no
  instructions are received in proportion to the voting instructions which
    are received from policy owners with respect to all Policies participating
    in the Account. Proportional voting may result in a small number of policy
owners determining the outcome of the vote.                           

    We may, when required by state insurance regulatory authorities, disregard
    voting instructions if the instructions require that shares be voted so as
     to cause a change in sub-classification or investment policies of the Funds
   or approve or disapprove an investment advisory contract of the Funds. In
   addition, we may disregard voting instructions in favor of changes in the
investment policies or the investment advisers of the Funds if we     
    reasonably disapprove of such changes. A change would be disapproved only:

          -    if the proposed change is contrary to state law or disapproved by
             state regulatory authorities on a determination that the change
        would be detrimental to the interests of policy owners, or

        -    if we determined that the change would be inconsistent with the
       investment objectives of the Funds or would result in the
              purchase of securities for the Funds which vary from the general
         quality and nature of investments and investment techniques
             utilized by other separate accounts created by us or any of our
  affiliates which have similar investment objectives.

In the event that we disregard voting instructions, a summary of that 
    action and the reason for such action will be included in your next annual
report or through special notice.                                     

COMPENSATION PAID FOR THE SALE OF POLICIES 

    Securian Financial Services, Inc. ("Securian Financial"), whose address is
  400 Robert Street North, St. Paul, Minnesota 55101-2098, is a registered
     broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and a member of the
 National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Securian Financial was
 incorporated in 1984 under the laws of the state of Minnesota. Securian
    Financial, an affiliate of Minnesota Life, is the principal underwriter of
the Policies. Authorized broker-dealers sell Policies through their   
registered representatives, each of whom is also an insurance agent   
appointed by Minnesota Life. Commissions for the sale of Policies by  
   broker-dealers are paid directly to the broker-dealers by Minnesota Life,
in all cases as agent for Securian Financial, and as authorized by the
broker-dealers. The amount of commission received by an individual    
registered representative in connection with the sale of a Policy is  
  determined by his or her broker-dealer. The commissions and compensation
   described in this paragraph, and the payments to broker-dealers described
   below, do not result in charges to the Policy that are in addition to the
policy charges described elsewhere in this prospectus.                

We pay compensation for the sale of the Policies by affiliated and    
unaffiliated broker-dealers. The total compensation that we pay to    
 broker-dealers for the sale of the Polices is generally not expected to

43

P-->N-650th�Page�of�80TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�50th
 exceed 120% of first-year target premiums and 4% of renewal premium for
     policy years two through five. Beginning in policy year 6, we will also pay
compensation of up to .15 percent of the accumulation value.          

     Depending upon our agreements with unaffiliated broker-dealers, we may vary
  the form of compensation paid or the amounts paid as total compensation,
however, the total compensation will not exceed the maximum (120% of  
 first-year target premiums, 4% of renewal premium for years two through
    five and .15% of the accumulation value for policy year 6 and thereafter).

The actual amount and/or forms of total compensation we pay depend on 
factors such as the amount of premiums we receive through clients of  
     respective broker-dealer firms and the scope of services they provide. Some
broker-dealer firms may not receive maximum total compensation.       
Broker-dealers pay their sales representatives all or a portion of the
     commissions received for their sales of the Policy, which is dependent upon
their arrangement with their broker-dealer.                           

    All of the compensation described here, and other compensation or benefits
    provided by Minnesota Life or our affiliates, may be more or less than the
overall compensation on similar or other products. The amount and/or  
     structure of the compensation may influence your registered representative,
broker-dealer or selling institution to present this Policy over other
    investment alternatives. However, the differences in compensation may also
   reflect differences in sales effort or ongoing customer services expected
 of the registered representative or the broker-dealer. You may ask your
     registered representative about these differences and how he or she and his
or her broker-dealer are compensated for selling the Policies.        

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS                                                     

   As an insurance company, we are ordinarily involved in litigation. We are
of the opinion that, as of the date of this prospectus, there are no  
   pending or threatened lawsuits that will have a materially adverse impact
   on the Account, the ability of Securian Financial to perform its contract
   with the Account or the ability of Minnesota Life to meet its obligations
under the Policies.                                                   

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                                  

   The financial statements of Minnesota Life are contained in the Statement
of Additional Information. No financial information for the Account is
 included in this prospectus because no variable universal life policies
  utilizing the Account have been sold. Therefore, you should consider our
     financial statements only as bearing on our ability to meet our obligations
 under the Policy. The Statement of Additional Information is available,
    free of charge, from us upon request. To request a Statement of Additional
  Information, call us at 1-800-277-9244 or write to us at: Minnesota Life
  Insurance Company, 400 Robert Street North, Saint Paul, Minnesota 55101.

GENERAL INFORMATION AND HISTORY                                                 

We are Minnesota Life Insurance Company ("Minnesota Life"), a life insurance    
company organized under the laws of Minnesota. Minnesota Life was formerly known
as The Minnesota Mutual Life Insurance Company ("Minnesota Mutual"), a mutual   
life insurance company organized in 1880 under the laws of Minnesota. Effective 
October 1, 1998, Minnesota Mutual reorganized by forming a mutual insurance     
holding company named "Minnesota Mutual Companies, Inc." Minnesota Mutual       
continued its corporate existence following conversion to a Minnesota stock life
insurance company named "Minnesota Life Insurance Company." All of the shares of
the voting stock of Minnesota Life are owned by a second tier intermediate stock
holding company named "Securian Financial Group, Inc.," which in turn is a      
wholly-owned subsidiary of a first tier intermediate stock holding company named
"Securian Holding Company," which in turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the   
ultimate parent, Minnesota Mutual Companies, Inc.                               

Our home office is at 400 Robert Street North, St. Paul, Minnesota 55101-2098,  
telephone: (651) 665-3500. We are licensed to conduct life insurance business in
all states of the United States (except New York where we are an authorized     
reinsurer), the District of Columbia, Canada, Puerto Rico and Guam.             

On June 12, 2007, our Board of Trustees established a separate account, called  
the Minnesota Life Individual Variable Universal Life Account ("the Account"),  
in accordance with certain provisions of the Minnesota insurance law. The       
Account is registered as a unit investment trust separate account with the      
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") under the Investment Company Act of  
1940 ("1940 Act"). Registration under the 1940 Act does not signify that the SEC
supervises the management, or the investment practices or policies, of the      
Account.                                                                        

SERVICES                                                                        

Minnesota Life provides accounting oversight, financial reporting, legal and    
other administrative services. Additional accounting and administrative         
services are performed by State Street Bank and Trust Company, which includes   
overnight calculation of unit value amounts. Minnesota Life oversees State      
Street's performance of these services.                                         

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION                                                          

ASSIGNMENT The Policy may be assigned. Any assignment must be in writing and    
filed at our home office. We assume no responsibility for the validity or effect
of any assignment of the Policy or of any interest in it. Any proceeds which    
become payable to an assignee will be payable in a single sum. Any claim made by
an assignee will be subject to proof of the assignee's interest and the extent  
of the assignment.                                                              

MISSTATEMENT OF AGE OR GENDER If the insured's age or gender has been misstated,
we will adjust the proceeds payable under the Policy based on what the last     
monthly charges would have purchased at the correct age or gender.              

INCONTESTABILITY After a Policy has been in force during the insured's lifetime 
for two years from the original policy date, we may not contest the Policy,     
except in the case of fraud. However, if there has been a policy change or      
reinstatement for which we required evidence of                                 

 1

P-->N-657th�Page�of�80TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�57th
insurability, we may contest that policy change or reinstatement for two years  
with respect to information provided at that time, during the lifetime of the   
insured, from the effective date of the policy change or reinstatement.         

SUICIDE If the insured, whether sane or insane, dies by suicide, within two     
years of the original policy date, our liability will be limited to an amount   
equal to the premiums paid for the Policy less any policy loan, unpaid loan     
interest and partial surrenders. If there has been a policy change or           
reinstatement for which we required evidence of insurability, and if the insured
dies by suicide within two years from the effective date of the policy change or
reinstatement, our liability with respect to the policy change or reinstatement 
will be limited to an amount equal to the portion of the monthly charges        
associated with that policy change or reinstatement.                            

REPORTS At least once each year we will send you a report. This report will     
include the accumulation value, the face amount and the death benefit as of the 
date of the report. It will also show the premiums paid during the policy year  
and policy loan activity. We will send the report to you without cost. The      
information in the report will be current as of a date within two months of its 
mailing.                                                                        

UNDERWRITERS                                                                    

The Policies are sold in a continuous offering by state licensed life           
insurance producers who are also registered representatives of broker-dealers   
who have entered into selling agreements with Securian Financial Services,      
Inc. ("Securian Financial"). Securian Financial acts as principal underwriter   
for the Policies. Both Securian Financial and Minnesota Life are wholly-owned   
subsidiaries of Securian Financial Group, Inc., which is a second-tier          
subsidiary of a mutual insurance holding company called Minnesota Mutual        
Companies, Inc.                                                                 

Securian Financial, whose address is 400 Robert Street North, St. Paul,         
Minnesota 55101-2098, is a registered as a broker-dealer under the Securities   
Exchange Act of 1934 and a member of the NASD, Inc. Securian Financial was      
incorporated in 1984 under the laws of the State of Minnesota.

P-->N-658th�Page�of�80TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�58th
We pay compensation for the sale of the Policies by affiliated and              
unaffiliated broker-dealers.  The total compensation that we pay to             
broker-dealers for the sale of the Polices is generally not expected to         
exceed 120% of first-year target premiums and 4% of renewal premium for         
policy years two through five.  Beginning in policy year 6 we will also pay     
compensation of up to .15 percent of the accumulation value.                    

UNDERWRITING PROCEDURES                                                         

We require proof of insurability for policy issue and all policy changes        
resulting in an increase in face amount or other changes that result in an      
increase in the net amount at risk under the Policy. Proof of insurability and  
classification for cost of insurance charges are determined by our underwriting 
rules and procedures which utilize factors such as age, gender, health and      
occupation. Persons who present a lower mortality risk are charged the most     
favorable cost of insurance rates. Requirements may be waived or modified for   
Policies issued as a result of conversion from existing Policies, for Policies  
issued as part of a small group case or for face amount increases pursuant to an
additional benefit agreement.                                                   

The basis for the mortality charges guaranteed in the Policies are determined by
the gender, tobacco habits, and age of each insured and are based on the 2001   
CSO Composite gender distinct age nearest birthday mortality tables. In         
instances where the insurance is required to be provided on a Unisex basis, the 
guaranteed mortality charges are based on the 2001 CSO Unisex Table B.          

SETTLEMENT OPTIONS 

The proceeds of the Policy are payable upon surrender, or upon our receipt of   
satisfactory proof of the insured's death while the Policy is in force. We will 
pay the proceeds in a lump sum unless a settlement option has been selected. We 
will deduct any outstanding policy loan, any accrued loan interest and unpaid   
monthly charges from the proceeds we pay. Proof of any claim under this Policy  
must be submitted in writing to our home office.                                

We will pay interest on any death benefit proceeds payable if payment is to     
be made in a lump sum. Interest will accrue on the death benefit proceeds       
payable from the date of the insured's death until the date of payment.         
Interest will be credited at a rate which we shall determine in our             
discretion. Such credited interest will never be less than a 3 percent annual   
rate.                                                                           

You may, during the lifetime of the insured, request that we pay the proceeds of
the Policy under one of the settlement options described below. We may also     
offer other methods of payment that are agreeable to both you and us. A         
settlement option may be selected only if payments are to be made to a natural  
person in that person's own right.                                              

Each settlement option described below is payable only in fixed amounts. The    
payments do not vary with the investment performance of the Account.

     We will pay interest on the proceeds at such times and for such period that
    is agreeable to you and us. Withdrawals of proceeds may be made in amounts
    of at least $500. At the end of the period, any remaining proceeds will be
paid in either a lump sum or under any other method we approve.       

OPTION 2 - PAYMENTS FOR A SPECIFIED PERIOD                            

We will make payments for a specified number of years.                

OPTION 3 - LIFE INCOME                                                

   We will make payments monthly during the lifetime of a payee, terminating
   with the last monthly payment immediately preceding the payee's death. We
may require proof of the payee's age and gender.                      

OPTION 4 - PAYMENTS OF A SPECIFIED AMOUNT                             

    We will pay a specified amount until the proceeds and interest thereto are
fully paid.                                                           

If you request a settlement option, you will be asked to sign an agreement      
covering the settlement option which will state the terms and conditions of the 
payments. Unless you specify otherwise, the beneficiary may select a settlement 
option after the insured's death.                                               

The minimum rate of interest we will credit under any settlement option is a 3  
percent annual rate of interest. We may, in our sole discretion, credit higher  
rates of interest on monies held by us in our general account which are to be   
paid under a settlement option.                                                 

ILLUSTRATIONS                                                                   

To illustrate the operation of the Policy under certain assumptions, we have    
prepared the following tables along with explanatory text that may be of        
assistance.                                                                     

The following tables illustrate how the accumulation value, cash surrender value
and death benefit of a Policy change with the investment experience of the      
sub-accounts of the Account. The tables show how the accumulation value, cash   
surrender value and death benefit of a Policy to an insured of a given age and  
at a given premium would vary over time if the investment return on the assets  
held in each sub-account of the Account were a uniform, gross, after-tax rate of
0 percent and 6 percent The actual cash values and death benefits would be      
different from those shown if the returns averaged 0 percent and 6 percent but  
fluctuated over the life of the Policy.                                         

The tables illustrate a Policy issued to an insured male age 40 in the standard 
non-tobacco risk class with a Level Death Benefit Option. The tables assume an  
initial face amount of $500,000 and an annual planned premium payment of $6,000.
The tables also assume that the Guideline Premium Test for definition of life   
insurance has been elected. The tables reflect both guaranteed maximum and      
current charges for all charges under the Policy, except charges for            

 4

P-->N-660th�Page�of�80TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�60th
partial surrenders, transfers and any optional Agreements. The tables assume    
that there have been no allocations made to the guaranteed interest account.    

Guaranteed maximum cost of insurance charges will vary by age, gender, and risk 
class. We use the male, female and unisex Composite 2001 Commissions Standard   
Ordinary Mortality Table ("2001 CSO"), as appropriate. The unisex tables are    
used in circumstances where legal considerations require the elimination of     
gender-base distinctions in the calculation of mortality costs. Our maximum cost
of insurance charges are based on an assumption of the mortality rates reflected
in 2001 CSO Tables.                                                             

In many cases we intend to impose cost of insurance charges which are lower than
the maximum charges described above. In addition to the factors governing       
maximum cost of insurance charges, actual charges will vary depending on the    
risk category of the insured. Current cost of insurance charges reflect our     
current practices with respect to mortality charges for this class of Policies. 
Similarly, we impose a current monthly policy charge which is less than the     
guaranteed contractual charge. We expect that these current charges will        
compensate us for the actual costs of administration. If the actual costs       
change, this charge may increase or decrease as necessary, although it may not  
exceed the maximum stated in the Policy.                                        

The amounts shown for the hypothetical accumulation value and death benefit     
as of each policy year reflect the fact that the net investment return on the   
assets held in the sub-accounts is lower than the gross, after-tax return.      
This is because a daily investment management fee assessed against the net      
assets of the Portfolio is deducted from the gross return.  The investment      
management fee illustrated is 0.67 percent and represents the arithmetic        
average of the annual fee charged for all Portfolios available under the        
Policy.  The illustrations also reflect a deduction for those Fund costs and    
expenses borne by the Funds and for distribution (12b-1) fees.  Fund expenses   
illustrated are 0.20 percent, representing the arithmetic average of the 2006   
expense ratios of the Portfolios available under the Policy.  Certain           
expenses for certain portfolios of the Funds were waived or reduced, however    
the averages used in these illustrations do not reflect the waivers or          
reductions.  The 12b-1 fee illustrated is 0.25 percent and represents the       
arithmetic average of those fees charged for all Portfolios that assess a       
12b-1 fee.  Lastly, the net return is increased by any unit value credit that   
we are currently providing.  The unit value credit illustrated is 0.45          
percent and represents the arithmetic average of the unit value credit for      
all Portfolios available under the Policy.  For the maximum contractual         
charges illustration, no unit value credit is assumed so the net annual rates   
of return shown are -0.67 and 5.33 percent.  Therefore, gross annual rates of   
return of 0 and 6 percent correspond to approximate net annual rates of         
return of -1.12 and 4.88 percent on the current charges illustration.           

The illustration reflects the fact that no charges for federal, state or local  
income taxes are currently made against the Account. If such a charge is made in
the future, it will take a higher gross rate of return to produce after-tax     
returns of 0 and 6 percent than it does now.                                    

If a particular Policy would be subject to different levels of charges, the     
accumulation values, cash surrender values and death benefits would vary from   
those shown in the tables. The accumulation values, cash surrender values and   
death benefits would also vary if premiums were paid in other amounts or at     
other than annual intervals, or accumulation values were allocated differently  
among individual sub-accounts with varying rates of return. In addition, the    

 5

P-->N-661st�Page�of�80TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�61st
accumulation values, cash surrender values and death benefits would also vary   
between tables depending upon whether the Level Option, Increasing Option or Sum
of Premiums Option death benefit is illustrated.                                

Upon request, we will furnish a personalized illustration based upon a proposed 
insured's age, gender and risk classification, and on the face amount, premium, 
death benefit option and gross annual rate of return requested. Those           
illustrations may be materially different from the sample illustration included 
in this statement, depending upon the proposed insured's actual situation. For  
example, illustrations for females, tobacco users or individuals who are rated  
sub-standard will differ materially in premium amount and illustrated values,   
even though the proposed insured may be the same age as the proposed insured in 
our sample illustrations. You may request a personalized illustration, without  
charge, from us by calling us at 1-800-277-9244 or writing to us at: Minnesota  
Life Insurance Company at 400 Robert Street North, Saint Paul, Minnesota 55101.

(1)  A premium payment of $6,000 is assumed to be paid annually at the beginning
of each policy year.                                                  

(2)  The actual cost of insurance charges of a Policy depends on a variety of   
     factors as described in the prospectus. The initial assumed monthly cost of
    insurance (COI) rate per $1,000 of insurance, for a male, age 40, standard
     non-tobacco risk class used for the purposes of this illustration is $1.65.
The cost of insurance charge will increase as the insured ages.       

(3)  Assumes that no policy loans have been made, no partial surrenders have    
been made, that no transfer charges were incurred and that no optional
Agreements have been requested.                                       

THE HYPOTHETICAL INVESTMENT RATES OF RETURN SHOWN ABOVE ARE ILLUSTRATIVE ONLY   
AND SHOULD NOT BE DEEMED A REPRESENTATION OF PAST OR FUTURE INVESTMENT RATES OF 
RETURN. ACTUAL RATES OF RETURN MAY BE MORE OR LESS THAN THOSE SHOWN AND WILL    
DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE INVESTMENT ALLOCATIONS MADE BY THE 

 7

OWNER, THE FREQUENCY OF PREMIUM PAYMENTS CHOSEN BY THE OWNER, AND THE INVESTMENT
EXPERIENCE OF THE POLICY'S SUB-ACCOUNTS. THE DEATH BENEFITS AND POLICY VALUES   
FOR A POLICY WOULD BE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE SHOWN IF THE ACTUAL RATES OF RETURN  
AVERAGED 0 AND 6 PERCENT OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS BUT ALSO FLUCTUATED ABOVE OR    
BELOW THOSE AVERAGES FOR INDIVIDUAL POLICY YEARS. THEY WOULD ALSO BE DIFFERENT  
IF ANY POLICY LOANS WERE MADE DURING THE PERIOD. NO REPRESENTATIONS CAN BE MADE 
BY MINNESOTA LIFE OR THE FUNDS THAT THESE HYPOTHETICAL RATES OF RETURN CAN BE   
ACHIEVED FOR ANY ONE YEAR OR SUSTAINED OVER ANY PERIOD OF TIME.

(1)  A premium payment of $6,000 is assumed to be paid annually at the          
beginning of each policy year.                                        

(2)  The actual cost of insurance charges of a Policy depends on a variety of   
     factors as described in the prospectus. The initial assumed monthly cost of
    insurance (COI) rate per $1,000 of insurance, for a male, age 40, standard
     non-tobacco risk class used for the purposes of this illustration is $0.83.
The cost of insurance charge will increase as the insured ages.       

(3)  Assumes that no policy loans have been made, no partial surrenders have    
been made, that no transfer charges were incurred and that no optional
Agreements have been requested.                                       

THE HYPOTHETICAL INVESTMENT RATES OF RETURN SHOWN ABOVE ARE ILLUSTRATIVE ONLY   
AND SHOULD NOT BE DEEMED A REPRESENTATION OF PAST OR FUTURE INVESTMENT RATES OF 
RETURN. ACTUAL RATES OF RETURN MAY BE MORE OR LESS THAN THOSE SHOWN AND WILL    
DEPEND ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE INVESTMENT ALLOCATIONS MADE BY THE

OWNER, THE FREQUENCY OF PREMIUM PAYMENTS CHOSEN BY THE OWNER, AND THE INVESTMENT
EXPERIENCE OF THE POLICY'S SUB-ACCOUNTS. THE DEATH BENEFITS AND POLICY VALUES   
FOR A POLICY WOULD BE DIFFERENT FROM THOSE SHOWN IF THE ACTUAL RATES OF RETURN  
AVERAGED 0 AND 6 PERCENT OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS BUT ALSO FLUCTUATED ABOVE OR    
BELOW THOSE AVERAGES FOR INDIVIDUAL POLICY YEARS. THEY WOULD ALSO BE DIFFERENT  
IF ANY POLICY LOANS WERE MADE DURING THE PERIOD. NO REPRESENTATIONS CAN BE MADE 
BY MINNESOTA LIFE OR THE FUNDS THAT THESE HYPOTHETICAL RATES OF RETURN CAN BE   
ACHIEVED FOR ANY ONE YEAR OR SUSTAINED OVER ANY PERIOD OF TIME.

Unless indicated otherwise parenthetically, each of the above corporations is a 
Minnesota corporation.                                                          

Item 29. Indemnification                                                        

The State of Minnesota has an indemnification statute (Minnesota Statutes       
300.083), as amended, effective January 1, 1984, which requires indemnification 
of individuals only under the circumstances described by the statute. Expenses  
incurred in the defense of any action, including attorneys' fees, may be        
advanced to the individual after written request by the board of directors upon 
receiving an undertaking from the individual to repay any amount advanced unless
it is ultimately determined that he or she is entitled to be indemnified by the 
corporation as authorized by the statute and after a determination that the     
facts then known to those making the determination would not preclude           
indemnification.                                                                

Indemnification is required for persons made a part to a proceeding by reason of
their official capacity so long as they acted in good faith, received no        
improper personal benefit and have not been indemnified by another organization.
In the case of a criminal proceeding, they must also have had no reasonable     
cause to believe the conduct was unlawful. In respect to other acts arising out 
of official capacity: (1) where the person is acting directly for the           
corporation there must be a reasonable belief by the person that his or her     
conduct was in the best interests of the corporation or, (2) where the person is
serving another organization or plan at the request of the corporation, the     
person must have reasonably believed that his or her conduct was not opposed to 
the best interests of the corporation. In the case of persons not directors,    
officers or policy-making employees, determination of eligibility for           
indemnification may be made by a board-appointed committee of which a director  
is a member. For other employees, directors and officers, the determination of  
eligibility is made by the Board or a committee of the Board, special legal     
counsel, the shareholder of the corporation or pursuant to a judicial           
proceeding.                                                                     

Insofar as indemnification for liability arising under the Securities Act of    
1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of         
Minnesota Life Insurance Company and the Minnesota Life Individual Variable     
Universal Life Account pursuant to the foregoing provisions, or otherwise,      
Minnesota Life Insurance Company and the Minnesota Life Individual Variable     
Universal Life Account have been advised that in the opinion of the Securities  
and Exchange Commission such indemnification is against public policy as        
expressed in the Act and is, therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim
for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by         
Minnesota Life Insurance Company and the Minnesota Life                         

P-->N-673rd�Page�of�80TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust�73rd
Individual Variable Universal Life Account of expenses incurred or paid by a    
director, officer or controlling person of Minnesota Life Insurance Company and 
the Minnesota Life Individual Variable Universal Life Account in the successful 
defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer
or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered,       
Minnesota Life Insurance Company and the Minnesota Life Individual Variable     
Universal Life Account will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has
been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate         
jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification by it is against public  
policy as expressed in the Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of
such issue.                                                                     

Item 30. Principal Underwriters                                                 

       (a) Securian Financial Services, Inc. currently acts as a principal

								Universal life insurance
							
Flexibility as your life changes
Universal life insurance provides the potential for protection for your entire life, while offering the flexibility to change your premium or death benefit amounts. As your life takes twists and turns, you can modify your premium and face amount to fit your situation.
Benefits to you

Potential lifetime protection for your loved ones
Flexible premiums allow you to adjust your payments, or you can choose a fixed, consistent amount
Ability to adjust your benefit amount to align with your changing life – you may want more coverage as your family grows and later decide to reduce your benefit as your children gain independence
Ability to build and use cash value on a tax-preferred basis for unexpected expenses such as travel opportunities, supplemental retirement income or college funding

Considerations

If you do not pay enough premium, the policy may lapse
Loans and withdrawals will reduce both the death benefit and policy surrender value
Policy loans and withdrawals may create an adverse tax result in the event of lapse or policy surrender – consult your tax advisor when considering taking a policy loan
















					A financial advisor can help you determine the type of life insurance that fits your goals.

What type is right for you?
If you and your financial advisor determine universal life insurance is a good choice, Securian offers three variations to choose from – fixed, indexed and variable.
The main difference between the products is the risk/return associated with their cash value. When choosing the ideal product for your needs, you and your advisor should consider your level of risk tolerance.


Risk and expected returns














					Fixed universal life
				

					Fixed universal life provides flexible premium payments and reliable cash value growth tied to a fixed interest rate, offering stable growth over time.
				
Fixed universal life









					Indexed universal life
				

					Indexed universal life insurance offers cash value growth based on movement of an underlying index account, but does not participate directly in the market.
				
Indexed universal life









					Variable universal life
				

					Variable universal life offers the potential to build cash value based on the performance of the investment options you choose.
				
Variable universal life











You should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of a portfolio and the variable insurance product carefully before investing. The portfolio and variable insurance product prospectuses contain this and other information. You may obtain a copy of the prospectus from your representative. Please read the prospectuses carefully before investing.
 

Life insurance products contain fees, such as mortality and expense charges, and may contain restrictions, such as surrender periods. Variable life insurance products contain fees, such as management fees, fund expenses, distribution fees and mortality and expense charges. The variable investment options are subject to market risk, including loss of principal.
Policy loans and withdrawals may create an adverse tax result in the event of a lapse or policy surrender, and will reduce both the surrender value and death benefit.
This information is a general discussion of the relevant federal tax laws provided to promote ideas that may benefit a taxpayer. It is not intended for, nor can it be used by any taxpayer for the purpose of avoiding federal tax penalties. Taxpayers should seek the advice of their own advisors regarding any tax and legal issues specific to their situation.
Guarantees are based on the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company. Please keep in mind that the primary reason to purchase a life insurance product is the death benefit.

Variable universal life insurance (often shortened to VUL) is a type of life insurance that builds a cash value. In a VUL, the cash value can be invested in a wide variety of separate accounts, similar to mutual funds, and the choice of which of the available separate accounts to use is entirely up to the contract owner. The 'variable' component in the name refers to this ability to invest in separate accounts whose values vary—they vary because they are invested in stock and/or bond markets. The 'universal' component in the name refers to the flexibility the owner has in making premium payments. The premiums can vary from nothing in a given month up to maximums defined by the Internal Revenue Code for life insurance. This flexibility is in contrast to whole life insurance that has fixed premium payments that typically cannot be missed without lapsing the policy (although one may exercise an Automatic Premium Loan feature, or surrender dividends to pay a Whole Life premium).
Variable universal life is a type of permanent life insurance, because the death benefit will be paid if the insured dies any time as long as there is sufficient cash value to pay the costs of insurance in the policy. With most if not all VULs, unlike whole life, there is no endowment age (the age at which the cash value equals the death benefit amount, which for whole life is typically 100). This is yet another key advantage of VUL over Whole Life. With a typical whole life policy, the death benefit is limited to the face amount specified in the policy, and at endowment age, the face amount is all that is paid out. Thus with either death or endowment, the insurance company keeps any cash value built up over the years. However, some participating whole life policies offer riders which specify that any dividends paid on the policy be used to purchase "paid up additions" to the policy which increase both the cash value and the death benefit over time.
If investments made in the separate accounts out-perform the general account of the insurance company, a higher rate-of-return can occur than the fixed rates-of-return typical for whole life. The combination over the years of no endowment age, continually increasing death benefit, and if a high rate-of-return is earned in the separate accounts of a VUL policy, this could result in higher value to the owner or beneficiary than that of a whole life policy with the same amounts of money paid in as premiums.

Regulation of VUL providers[edit]
Because the separate accounts are securities, the representative providing a VUL must be working in accordance with the securities regulations of the country or province in which he operates. And because they are life insurance policies, VULs may only be sold by representatives who are properly licensed to sell life insurance in the areas in which they operate. The insurance company providing the policy must also be licensed as an "insurer."
This dual regulation helps protect consumers, who can look up the track record of offenses of any provider listed by the regulating SRO (Self Regulatory Organization) or provincial securities commission.

United States. VULs may only be sold in the United States by representatives who have a "producers" life insurance license in the state(s) in which he or she operates. The insurance company providing the policy must also be licensed in the state(s) as an "insurer." Because the separate accounts are securities, the representative must be working through a broker/dealer registered with the United States' SRO, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and himself be registered with FINRA. (FINRA has an online database an investor can use to look up offenses and regulatory actions of any broker or broker/dealer.) The fact of a representative's securities registration will show on his state insurance license as "Variable" as in "qualified for Life and Variable Products." (The exact wording could vary from state to state.)
Canada. VULs, as life insurance policies, may only be sold in Canada by life insurance-licensed representatives registered with the insurance regulator in their provincial jurisdiction. Representatives must comply with the life insurance regulations of their respective province (typically, a provincial "Insurance Act"). And, as VULs are life insurance policies, providers must comply with the national life insurance regulations ("Insurance Companies Act") established by The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI). Since VULs are presently not considered to be securities in Canada, they are subject to lighter regulatory scrutiny than typical securities products. In Canada, there is no real differentiation between universal life and variable universal life.mkj

Uses[edit]
Variable universal life insurance receives special tax advantages in the United States Internal Revenue Code. The cash value in life insurance is able to earn investment returns without incurring current income tax as long as it meets the definition of life insurance and the policy remains in force. The tax free investment returns could be considered to be used to pay for the costs of insurance inside the policy. See the 'Tax Benefits' section for more.
In one theory of life insurance, needs based analysis, life insurance is only needed to the extent that assets left behind by a person will not be enough to meet the income and capital needs of his or her dependents. In one form of variable universal life insurance, the cost of insurance purchased is based only on the difference between the death benefit and the cash value (defined as the net amount at risk from the perspective of the insurer). Therefore, the greater the cash value accumulation, the lesser the net amount at risk, and the less insurance that is purchased.
Another use of Variable Universal Life Insurance is among relatively wealthy persons who give money yearly to their children to put into VUL policies under the gift tax exemption. Very often persons in the United States with a net worth high enough that they will encounter the estate tax give money away to their children to protect that money being taxed. Often this is done within a VUL policy because this allows a tax deferral (for which no alternative would exist besides tuition money saved in an educational IRA or 529 plan), provides for permanent life insurance, and can usually be accessed tax-free by borrowing against the policy.
Contract features[edit]
By allowing the contract owner to choose the investments inside the policy the insured takes on the investment risk, and receives the greater potential return of the investments in return. If the investment returns are very poor this could lead to a policy lapsing (ceasing to exist as a valid policy). To avoid this, many insurers offer guaranteed death benefits up to a certain age as long as a given minimum premium is paid.
Premium flexibility[edit]
VUL policies have a great deal of flexibility in choosing how much premiums to pay for a given death benefit. The minimum premium is primarily affected by the contract features offered by the insurer. To maintain a death benefit guarantee, that specified premium level must be paid every month. To keep the policy in force, typically no premium needs to be paid as long as there is enough cash value in the policy to pay that month's cost of insurance. The maximum premium amounts are heavily influenced by the code for life insurance. Internal Revenue Code section 7702 sets limits for how much cash value can be allowed and how much premium can be paid (both in a given year, and over certain periods of time) for a given death benefit. The most efficient policy in terms of cash value growth would have the maximum premium paid for the minimum death benefit. Then the costs of insurance would have the minimum negative effect on the growth of the cash value. In the extreme would be a life insurance policy that had no life insurance component, and was entirely cash value. If it received favorable tax treatment as a life insurance policy it would be the perfect tax shelter, pure investment returns and no insurance cost. In fact when variable universal life policies first became available in 1986, contract owners were able to make very high investments into their policies and received extraordinary tax benefits. In order to curb this practice, but still encourage life insurance purchase, the IRS developed guidelines regarding allowed premiums for a given death benefit.
Maximum premiums[edit]
The standard set was twofold: to define a maximum amount of cash value per death benefit and to define a maximum premium for a given death benefit. If the maximum premium is exceeded the policy no longer qualifies for all of the benefits of a life insurance contract and is instead known as a modified endowment contract or a MEC. A MEC still receives tax free investment returns, and a tax free death benefit, but withdrawals of cash value in a MEC are on a 'LIFO' basis, where earnings are withdrawn first and taxed as ordinary income. If the cash value in a contract exceeds the specified percentage of death benefit, the policy no longer qualifies as life insurance at all and all investment earnings become immediately taxable in the year the specified percentage is exceeded. In order to avoid this, contracts define the death benefit to be the higher of the original death benefit or the amount needed to meet IRS guidelines. The maximum cash value is determined to be a certain percentage of the death benefit. The percentage ranges from 30% or so for young insured persons, declining to 0% for those reaching age 100.
The maximum premiums are set by the IRS guidelines such that the premiums paid within a seven-year period after a qualifying event (such as purchase or death benefit increase), grown at a 6% rate, and using the maximum guaranteed costs of insurance in the policy contract, would endow the policy at age 100 (i.e. the cash value would equal the death benefit). More specific rules are adjusted for premiums that are not paid in equal amounts over a seven-year period. The entire maximum premium (greater than the 7 year premium) can be paid in one year and no more premiums can be paid unless the death benefit is increased. If the 7 year level guideline premium is exceeded, then the policy becomes a MEC.
To add more confusion the seven-year MEC premium level cannot be paid in a VUL every year for 7 years, and still avoid MEC status. The MEC premium level can only be paid in practice for about 4 years before additional premiums cannot be paid if non MEC status is desired. There is another premium designed to be the maximum premium that can be paid every year a policy is in force. This premium carries different names from different insurers, one calling it the guideline maximum premium. This is the premium that often reaches the most efficient use of the policy.
Investment choices[edit]
The number and type of choices available varies from company to company, and from policy to policy. The current generation of VUL policies have a wide variety of sub-accounts for the policy owner to allocate their cash surrender values into. These newer policies often offer 50 or more separate accounts covering the entire spectrum of asset classes and management styles.
Separate accounts are organized as trusts to be managed for the benefit of the insureds, and are so named because they are kept 'separate' from the 'general account' of the life insurance company. They are similar to mutual funds, but have different regulatory requirements.
Tax advantages[edit]

Tax deferred growth of cash surrender values while a policy is in force
FIFO withdrawal status on premiums paid into the contract
Income tax free policy loans from policies that are not Modified Endowment Contracts
Income tax free death benefits (may be subject to estate tax if policy is owned by the insured)

Taxes are the main reason those in higher tax brackets (25%+) would desire to use a VUL over any other accumulation strategy. For someone in a 34% tax bracket (Federal & State), the investment return on the separate accounts may average 10%, and at say age 75 the policy's death benefit would have an internal rate of return of 9%. In order to get a 9% rate of return in an ordinary taxable account, in a 34% tax bracket, one must earn 13.64%. An alternative for this in the 34% tax bracket would be to consider using Variable Annuities which does not limit the contributions and withdraw from it without annuitizing the contract.
Other alternatives for those in the 34% tax bracket that own their own companies would be to consider SEP IRAs, company 401ks or retirement arrangements from a company perspective, or to incorporate and consult a tax specialist.
These numbers assume expenses that may vary from company to company, and it is assumed that the VUL is funded with a minimum face value for the level of premium. The cash values would also be available to fund lifestyle or personally managed investments on a tax free basis in the form of refunds of premiums paid in and policy loans (which would be paid off on death by the death benefit.)
Risks of variable universal life[edit]

Cost of insurance - the cost of insurance for VULs is generally based on term rates and as the insured ages, the risk of mortality increases, increasing the cost of insurance. If not monitored properly the cost of insurance may eventually exceed the cash outlay depleting savings. If this continues long term the savings will be depleted and insured will be given an option to increase the cash outlay to cover the higher cost of insurance or cancel the policy leaving them with no savings and either no insurance, or very expensive insurance.
Cash outlay - the cash needed to effectively use a VUL is generally much higher than other types of insurance policies. If a policy does not have the right amount of funding, it may lapse.
Investment risk - because the sub accounts in the VUL may be invested in stocks and bonds, the insured now takes on the investment risk rather than the insurance company.
Complexity - the VUL is a complex product, and can easily be used (or sold) inappropriately because of this. Proper funding, investing, and planning are usually required in order for the VUL to work as expected.

General uses of variable universal life[edit]
These are the features typically marketed by insurance companies, however the VUL in most cases will limit the insured to being able to take advantage of only one of these features listed. Each of these features can be achieved through other means.

Financial protection - as with all life insurance programs, VULs can be used to protect a family in the case of a premature death.
Tax advantages - because of its tax-deferred feature, the VUL may offer an attractive tax advantage, especially to those in higher tax brackets. To attain them, the policy must be highly funded (though still non-MEC), for the tax advantages to offset the cost of insurance. These tax advantages can be used for either...

Education planning - the cash value of a VUL can be used to help fund children's education, as long as the policy is started very early. Also, putting money into a VUL can be used to help children qualify for federal financial aid, since the federal government does not consider the cash value when calculating EFC (Expected Family Contribution).
Retirement planning - because of its tax-free policy loan feature, the VUL can also be used as tax-advantaged income source in retirement, assuming retirement is not in the near future and the policy is not a modified endowment contract. Again, the policy must be properly funded for this strategy to work.


Estate planning - those with a large estate (A filing is required for estates with combined gross assets and prior taxable gifts exceeding $5,430,000 effective for decedents dying on or after January 1, 2015[1]) can sometimes use a VUL as part of their estate planning strategy to reduce or avoid estate taxes by setting up a life insurance trust sometimes known as an ILIT.

Criticisms of variable universal life[edit]

Some general criticisms

Potentially higher costs - VUL policies may be more expensive than other types of permanent insurance, such as Whole Life and traditional Universal Life. Volatility of cash surrender values, especially at late duration, can cause a "reverse dollar cost averaging" effect that results in higher costs of insurance charges. Proper funding of a contract may reduce this risk, but it cannot be completely eliminated.
Some older VUL policies have limited sub-account choices. This issue has been greatly corrected with the current generation of policies having 50 or more sub-accounts that cover all the major asset classes, with more than one sub-account manager.
Policy administrative expenses and costs of insurance may increase at the company's whim, subject to a contractual maximum.
VUL is relatively complex compared to traditional Whole Life or Term Life.

Some criticism is not about the product, but rather the sales tactics used by some insurance agents.

Projecting the maximum illustrated assumed interest rates (generally, 12%), using current (or assumed) administrative expenses and current costs of insurance, without showing the prospective client several other assumed rates of return, creating a Blue Sky problem.

Some regulators are criticized, as well.

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) does not allow insurance companies to illustrate VUL policies using a stochastic projection (commonly called a 'Monte Carlo Simulation'), limiting agents to use 'straight line', constant interest assumptions.

Variable universal life insurance (often shortened to VUL) is a type of life insurance that builds a cash value. In a VUL, the cash value can be invested in a wide variety of separate accounts, similar to mutual funds, and the choice of which of the available separate accounts to use is entirely up to the contract owner. The 'variable' component in the name refers to this ability to invest in separate accounts whose values vary—they vary because they are invested in stock and/or bond markets. The 'universal' component in the name refers to the flexibility the owner has in making premium payments.

Variable universal life is a type of permanent life insurance, because the death benefit will be paid if the insured dies any time as long as there is sufficient cash value to pay the costs of insurance in the policy. With most if not all VULs, unlike whole life, there is no endowment age (the age at which the cash value equals the death benefit amount, which for whole life is typically 100).

To add more confusion the seven-year MEC premium level cannot be paid in a VUL every year for 7 years, and still avoid MEC status. The MEC premium level can only be paid in practice for about 4 years before additional premiums cannot be paid if non MEC status is desired. There is another premium designed to be the maximum premium that can be paid every year a policy is in force. This premium carries different names from different insurers, one calling it the guideline maximum premium. This is the premium that often reaches the most efficient use of the policy.
Investment choices[edit]
The number and type of choices available varies from company to company, and from policy to policy. The current generation of VUL policies have a wide variety of sub-accounts for the policy owner to allocate their cash surrender values into.

Cost of insurance - the cost of insurance for VULs is generally based on term rates and as the insured ages, the risk of mortality increases, increasing the cost of insurance. If not monitored properly the cost of insurance may eventually exceed the cash outlay depleting savings. If this continues long term the savings will be depleted and insured will be given an option to increase the cash outlay to cover the higher cost of insurance or cancel the policy leaving them with no savings and either no insurance, or very expensive insurance.
Cash outlay - the cash needed to effectively use a VUL is generally much higher than other types of insurance policies. If a policy does not have the right amount of funding, it may lapse.
Investment risk - because the sub accounts in the VUL may be invested in stocks and bonds, the insured now takes on the investment risk rather than the insurance company.
Complexity - the VUL is a complex product, and can easily be used (or sold) inappropriately because of this. Proper funding, investing, and planning are usually required in order for the VUL to work as expected.

General uses of variable universal life[edit]
These are the features typically marketed by insurance companies, however the VUL in most cases will limit the insured to being able to take advantage of only one of these features listed. Each of these features can be achieved through other means.

Financial protection - as with all life insurance programs, VULs can be used to protect a family in the case of a premature death.

Also, putting money into a VUL can be used to help children qualify for federal financial aid, since the federal government does not consider the cash value when calculating EFC (Expected Family Contribution).
Retirement planning - because of its tax-free policy loan feature, the VUL can also be used as tax-advantaged income source in retirement, assuming retirement is not in the near future and the policy is not a modified endowment contract. Again, the policy must be properly funded for this strategy to work.


Estate planning - those with a large estate (A filing is required for estates with combined gross assets and prior taxable gifts exceeding $5,430,000 effective for decedents dying on or after January 1, 2015[1]) can sometimes use a VUL as part of their estate planning strategy to reduce or avoid estate taxes by setting up a life insurance trust sometimes known as an ILIT.

Criticisms of variable universal life[edit]

Some general criticisms

Potentially higher costs - VUL policies may be more expensive than other types of permanent insurance, such as Whole Life and traditional Universal Life. Volatility of cash surrender values, especially at late duration, can cause a "reverse dollar cost averaging" effect that results in higher costs of insurance charges. Proper funding of a contract may reduce this risk, but it cannot be completely eliminated.
Some older VUL policies have limited sub-account choices. This issue has been greatly corrected with the current generation of policies having 50 or more sub-accounts that cover all the major asset classes, with more than one sub-account manager.
Policy administrative expenses and costs of insurance may increase at the company's whim, subject to a contractual maximum.
VUL is relatively complex compared to traditional Whole Life or Term Life.

Some criticism is not about the product, but rather the sales tactics used by some insurance agents.

Projecting the maximum illustrated assumed interest rates (generally, 12%), using current (or assumed) administrative expenses and current costs of insurance, without showing the prospective client several other assumed rates of return, creating a Blue Sky problem.

Some regulators are criticized, as well.

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) does not allow insurance companies to illustrate VUL policies using a stochastic projection (commonly called a 'Monte Carlo Simulation'), limiting agents to use 'straight line', constant interest assumptions.

Variable universal life insurance

Variable universal life insurance (often shortened to VUL) is a type of life insurance that builds a cash value. In a VUL, the cash value can be invested in a wide variety of separate accounts, similar to mutual funds, and the choice of which of the available separate accounts to use is entirely up to the contract owner. The 'variable' component in the name refers to this ability to invest in separate accounts whose values vary—they vary because they are invested in stock and/or bond markets. The 'universal' component in the name refers to the flexibility the owner has in making premium payments. The premiums can vary from nothing in a given month up to maximums defined by the Internal Revenue Code for life insurance. This flexibility is in contrast to whole life insurance that has fixed premium payments that typically cannot be missed without lapsing the policy (although one may exercise an Automatic Premium Loan feature, or surrender dividends to pay a Whole Life premium).
Variable universal life is a type of permanent life insurance, because the death benefit will be paid if the insured dies any time as long as there is sufficient cash value to pay the costs of insurance in the policy. With most if not all VULs, unlike whole life, there is no endowment age (the age at which the cash value equals the death benefit amount, which for whole life is typically 100). This is yet another key advantage of VUL over Whole Life. With a typical whole life policy, the death benefit is limited to the face amount specified in the policy, and at endowment age, the face amount is all that is paid out. Thus with either death or endowment, the insurance company keeps any cash value built up over the years. However, some participating whole life policies offer riders which specify that any dividends paid on the policy be used to purchase "paid up additions" to the policy which increase both the cash value and the death benefit over time.
If investments made in the separate accounts out-perform the general account of the insurance company, a higher rate-of-return can occur than the fixed rates-of-return typical for whole life. The combination over the years of no endowment age, continually increasing death benefit, and if a high rate-of-return is earned in the separate accounts of a VUL policy, this could result in higher value to the owner or beneficiary than that of a whole life policy with the same amounts of money paid in as premiums.

Regulation of VUL providers[edit]
Because the separate accounts are securities, the representative providing a VUL must be working in accordance with the securities regulations of the country or province in which he operates. And because they are life insurance policies, VULs may only be sold by representatives who are properly licensed to sell life insurance in the areas in which they operate. The insurance company providing the policy must also be licensed as an "insurer."
This dual regulation helps protect consumers, who can look up the track record of offenses of any provider listed by the regulating SRO (Self Regulatory Organization) or provincial securities commission.

United States. VULs may only be sold in the United States by representatives who have a "producers" life insurance license in the state(s) in which he or she operates. The insurance company providing the policy must also be licensed in the state(s) as an "insurer." Because the separate accounts are securities, the representative must be working through a broker/dealer registered with the United States' SRO, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and himself be registered with FINRA. (FINRA has an online database an investor can use to look up offenses and regulatory actions of any broker or broker/dealer.) The fact of a representative's securities registration will show on his state insurance license as "Variable" as in "qualified for Life and Variable Products." (The exact wording could vary from state to state.)
Canada. VULs, as life insurance policies, may only be sold in Canada by life insurance-licensed representatives registered with the insurance regulator in their provincial jurisdiction. Representatives must comply with the life insurance regulations of their respective province (typically, a provincial "Insurance Act"). And, as VULs are life insurance policies, providers must comply with the national life insurance regulations ("Insurance Companies Act") established by The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI). Since VULs are presently not considered to be securities in Canada, they are subject to lighter regulatory scrutiny than typical securities products. In Canada, there is no real differentiation between universal life and variable universal life.mkj

Uses[edit]
Variable universal life insurance receives special tax advantages in the United States Internal Revenue Code. The cash value in life insurance is able to earn investment returns without incurring current income tax as long as it meets the definition of life insurance and the policy remains in force. The tax free investment returns could be considered to be used to pay for the costs of insurance inside the policy. See the 'Tax Benefits' section for more.
In one theory of life insurance, needs based analysis, life insurance is only needed to the extent that assets left behind by a person will not be enough to meet the income and capital needs of his or her dependents. In one form of variable universal life insurance, the cost of insurance purchased is based only on the difference between the death benefit and the cash value (defined as the net amount at risk from the perspective of the insurer). Therefore, the greater the cash value accumulation, the lesser the net amount at risk, and the less insurance that is purchased.
Another use of Variable Universal Life Insurance is among relatively wealthy persons who give money yearly to their children to put into VUL policies under the gift tax exemption. Very often persons in the United States with a net worth high enough that they will encounter the estate tax give money away to their children to protect that money being taxed. Often this is done within a VUL policy because this allows a tax deferral (for which no alternative would exist besides tuition money saved in an educational IRA or 529 plan), provides for permanent life insurance, and can usually be accessed tax-free by borrowing against the policy.
Contract features[edit]
By allowing the contract owner to choose the investments inside the policy the insured takes on the investment risk, and receives the greater potential return of the investments in return. If the investment returns are very poor this could lead to a policy lapsing (ceasing to exist as a valid policy). To avoid this, many insurers offer guaranteed death benefits up to a certain age as long as a given minimum premium is paid.
Premium flexibility[edit]
VUL policies have a great deal of flexibility in choosing how much premiums to pay for a given death benefit. The minimum premium is primarily affected by the contract features offered by the insurer. To maintain a death benefit guarantee, that specified premium level must be paid every month. To keep the policy in force, typically no premium needs to be paid as long as there is enough cash value in the policy to pay that month's cost of insurance. The maximum premium amounts are heavily influenced by the code for life insurance. Internal Revenue Code section 7702 sets limits for how much cash value can be allowed and how much premium can be paid (both in a given year, and over certain periods of time) for a given death benefit. The most efficient policy in terms of cash value growth would have the maximum premium paid for the minimum death benefit. Then the costs of insurance would have the minimum negative effect on the growth of the cash value. In the extreme would be a life insurance policy that had no life insurance component, and was entirely cash value. If it received favorable tax treatment as a life insurance policy it would be the perfect tax shelter, pure investment returns and no insurance cost. In fact when variable universal life policies first became available in 1986, contract owners were able to make very high investments into their policies and received extraordinary tax benefits. In order to curb this practice, but still encourage life insurance purchase, the IRS developed guidelines regarding allowed premiums for a given death benefit.
Maximum premiums[edit]
The standard set was twofold: to define a maximum amount of cash value per death benefit and to define a maximum premium for a given death benefit. If the maximum premium is exceeded the policy no longer qualifies for all of the benefits of a life insurance contract and is instead known as a modified endowment contract or a MEC. A MEC still receives tax free investment returns, and a tax free death benefit, but withdrawals of cash value in a MEC are on a 'LIFO' basis, where earnings are withdrawn first and taxed as ordinary income. If the cash value in a contract exceeds the specified percentage of death benefit, the policy no longer qualifies as life insurance at all and all investment earnings become immediately taxable in the year the specified percentage is exceeded. In order to avoid this, contracts define the death benefit to be the higher of the original death benefit or the amount needed to meet IRS guidelines. The maximum cash value is determined to be a certain percentage of the death benefit. The percentage ranges from 30% or so for young insured persons, declining to 0% for those reaching age 100.
The maximum premiums are set by the IRS guidelines such that the premiums paid within a seven-year period after a qualifying event (such as purchase or death benefit increase), grown at a 6% rate, and using the maximum guaranteed costs of insurance in the policy contract, would endow the policy at age 100 (i.e. the cash value would equal the death benefit). More specific rules are adjusted for premiums that are not paid in equal amounts over a seven-year period. The entire maximum premium (greater than the 7 year premium) can be paid in one year and no more premiums can be paid unless the death benefit is increased. If the 7 year level guideline premium is exceeded, then the policy becomes a MEC.
To add more confusion the seven-year MEC premium level cannot be paid in a VUL every year for 7 years, and still avoid MEC status. The MEC premium level can only be paid in practice for about 4 years before additional premiums cannot be paid if non MEC status is desired. There is another premium designed to be the maximum premium that can be paid every year a policy is in force. This premium carries different names from different insurers, one calling it the guideline maximum premium. This is the premium that often reaches the most efficient use of the policy.
Investment choices[edit]
The number and type of choices available varies from company to company, and from policy to policy. The current generation of VUL policies have a wide variety of sub-accounts for the policy owner to allocate their cash surrender values into. These newer policies often offer 50 or more separate accounts covering the entire spectrum of asset classes and management styles.
Separate accounts are organized as trusts to be managed for the benefit of the insureds, and are so named because they are kept 'separate' from the 'general account' of the life insurance company. They are similar to mutual funds, but have different regulatory requirements.
Tax advantages[edit]

Tax deferred growth of cash surrender values while a policy is in force
FIFO withdrawal status on premiums paid into the contract
Income tax free policy loans from policies that are not Modified Endowment Contracts
Income tax free death benefits (may be subject to estate tax if policy is owned by the insured)

Taxes are the main reason those in higher tax brackets (25%+) would desire to use a VUL over any other accumulation strategy. For someone in a 34% tax bracket (Federal & State), the investment return on the separate accounts may average 10%, and at say age 75 the policy's death benefit would have an internal rate of return of 9%. In order to get a 9% rate of return in an ordinary taxable account, in a 34% tax bracket, one must earn 13.64%. An alternative for this in the 34% tax bracket would be to consider using Variable Annuities which does not limit the contributions and withdraw from it without annuitizing the contract.
Other alternatives for those in the 34% tax bracket that own their own companies would be to consider SEP IRAs, company 401ks or retirement arrangements from a company perspective, or to incorporate and consult a tax specialist.
These numbers assume expenses that may vary from company to company, and it is assumed that the VUL is funded with a minimum face value for the level of premium. The cash values would also be available to fund lifestyle or personally managed investments on a tax free basis in the form of refunds of premiums paid in and policy loans (which would be paid off on death by the death benefit.)
Risks of variable universal life[edit]

Cost of insurance - the cost of insurance for VULs is generally based on term rates and as the insured ages, the risk of mortality increases, increasing the cost of insurance. If not monitored properly the cost of insurance may eventually exceed the cash outlay depleting savings. If this continues long term the savings will be depleted and insured will be given an option to increase the cash outlay to cover the higher cost of insurance or cancel the policy leaving them with no savings and either no insurance, or very expensive insurance.
Cash outlay - the cash needed to effectively use a VUL is generally much higher than other types of insurance policies. If a policy does not have the right amount of funding, it may lapse.
Investment risk - because the sub accounts in the VUL may be invested in stocks and bonds, the insured now takes on the investment risk rather than the insurance company.
Complexity - the VUL is a complex product, and can easily be used (or sold) inappropriately because of this. Proper funding, investing, and planning are usually required in order for the VUL to work as expected.

General uses of variable universal life[edit]
These are the features typically marketed by insurance companies, however the VUL in most cases will limit the insured to being able to take advantage of only one of these features listed. Each of these features can be achieved through other means.

Financial protection - as with all life insurance programs, VULs can be used to protect a family in the case of a premature death.
Tax advantages - because of its tax-deferred feature, the VUL may offer an attractive tax advantage, especially to those in higher tax brackets. To attain them, the policy must be highly funded (though still non-MEC), for the tax advantages to offset the cost of insurance. These tax advantages can be used for either...

Education planning - the cash value of a VUL can be used to help fund children's education, as long as the policy is started very early. Also, putting money into a VUL can be used to help children qualify for federal financial aid, since the federal government does not consider the cash value when calculating EFC (Expected Family Contribution).
Retirement planning - because of its tax-free policy loan feature, the VUL can also be used as tax-advantaged income source in retirement, assuming retirement is not in the near future and the policy is not a modified endowment contract. Again, the policy must be properly funded for this strategy to work.


Estate planning - those with a large estate (A filing is required for estates with combined gross assets and prior taxable gifts exceeding $5,430,000 effective for decedents dying on or after January 1, 2015[1]) can sometimes use a VUL as part of their estate planning strategy to reduce or avoid estate taxes by setting up a life insurance trust sometimes known as an ILIT.

Potentially higher costs - VUL policies may be more expensive than other types of permanent insurance, such as Whole Life and traditional Universal Life. Volatility of cash surrender values, especially at late duration, can cause a "reverse dollar cost averaging" effect that results in higher costs of insurance charges. Proper funding of a contract may reduce this risk, but it cannot be completely eliminated.

VUL is relatively complex compared to traditional Whole Life or Term Life.

Some criticism is not about the product, but rather the sales tactics used by some insurance agents.

Projecting the maximum illustrated assumed interest rates (generally, 12%), using current (or assumed) administrative expenses and current costs of insurance, without showing the prospective client several other assumed rates of return, creating a Blue Sky problem.

Some regulators are criticized, as well.

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) does not allow insurance companies to illustrate VUL policies using a stochastic projection (commonly called a 'Monte Carlo Simulation'), limiting agents to use 'straight line', constant interest assumptions.

Variable universal life insurance (often shortened to VUL) is a type of life insurance that builds a cash value. In a VUL, the cash value can be invested in a wide variety of separate accounts, similar to mutual funds, and the choice of which of the available separate accounts to use is entirely up to the contract owner. The 'variable' component in the name refers to this ability to invest in separate accounts whose values vary—they vary because they are invested in stock and/or bond markets. The 'universal' component in the name refers to the flexibility the owner has in making premium payments.

This flexibility is in contrast to whole life insurance that has fixed premium payments that typically cannot be missed without lapsing the policy (although one may exercise an Automatic Premium Loan feature, or surrender dividends to pay a Whole Life premium).
Variable universal life is a type of permanent life insurance, because the death benefit will be paid if the insured dies any time as long as there is sufficient cash value to pay the costs of insurance in the policy.

Very often persons in the United States with a net worth high enough that they will encounter the estate tax give money away to their children to protect that money being taxed.

The maximum cash value is determined to be a certain percentage of the death benefit. The percentage ranges from 30% or so for young insured persons, declining to 0% for those reaching age 100.
The maximum premiums are set by the IRS guidelines such that the premiums paid within a seven-year period after a qualifying event (such as purchase or death benefit increase), grown at a 6% rate, and using the maximum guaranteed costs of insurance in the policy contract, would endow the policy at age 100 (i.e. the cash value would equal the death benefit). More specific rules are adjusted for premiums that are not paid in equal amounts over a seven-year period. The entire maximum premium (greater than the 7 year premium) can be paid in one year and no more premiums can be paid unless the death benefit is increased. If the 7 year level guideline premium is exceeded, then the policy becomes a MEC.
To add more confusion the seven-year MEC premium level cannot be paid in a VUL every year for 7 years, and still avoid MEC status. The MEC premium level can only be paid in practice for about 4 years before additional premiums cannot be paid if non MEC status is desired. There is another premium designed to be the maximum premium that can be paid every year a policy is in force. This premium carries different names from different insurers, one calling it the guideline maximum premium. This is the premium that often reaches the most efficient use of the policy.
Investment choices[edit]
The number and type of choices available varies from company to company, and from policy to policy. The current generation of VUL policies have a wide variety of sub-accounts for the policy owner to allocate their cash surrender values into. These newer policies often offer 50 or more separate accounts covering the entire spectrum of asset classes and management styles.
Separate accounts are organized as trusts to be managed for the benefit of the insureds, and are so named because they are kept 'separate' from the 'general account' of the life insurance company. They are similar to mutual funds, but have different regulatory requirements.
Tax advantages[edit]

Tax deferred growth of cash surrender values while a policy is in force
FIFO withdrawal status on premiums paid into the contract
Income tax free policy loans from policies that are not Modified Endowment Contracts
Income tax free death benefits (may be subject to estate tax if policy is owned by the insured)

Taxes are the main reason those in higher tax brackets (25%+) would desire to use a VUL over any other accumulation strategy. For someone in a 34% tax bracket (Federal & State), the investment return on the separate accounts may average 10%, and at say age 75 the policy's death benefit would have an internal rate of return of 9%. In order to get a 9% rate of return in an ordinary taxable account, in a 34% tax bracket, one must earn 13.64%. An alternative for this in the 34% tax bracket would be to consider using Variable Annuities which does not limit the contributions and withdraw from it without annuitizing the contract.
Other alternatives for those in the 34% tax bracket that own their own companies would be to consider SEP IRAs, company 401ks or retirement arrangements from a company perspective, or to incorporate and consult a tax specialist.
These numbers assume expenses that may vary from company to company, and it is assumed that the VUL is funded with a minimum face value for the level of premium. The cash values would also be available to fund lifestyle or personally managed investments on a tax free basis in the form of refunds of premiums paid in and policy loans (which would be paid off on death by the death benefit.)
Risks of variable universal life[edit]

Cost of insurance - the cost of insurance for VULs is generally based on term rates and as the insured ages, the risk of mortality increases, increasing the cost of insurance. If not monitored properly the cost of insurance may eventually exceed the cash outlay depleting savings. If this continues long term the savings will be depleted and insured will be given an option to increase the cash outlay to cover the higher cost of insurance or cancel the policy leaving them with no savings and either no insurance, or very expensive insurance.
Cash outlay - the cash needed to effectively use a VUL is generally much higher than other types of insurance policies. If a policy does not have the right amount of funding, it may lapse.
Investment risk - because the sub accounts in the VUL may be invested in stocks and bonds, the insured now takes on the investment risk rather than the insurance company.
Complexity - the VUL is a complex product, and can easily be used (or sold) inappropriately because of this. Proper funding, investing, and planning are usually required in order for the VUL to work as expected.

General uses of variable universal life[edit]
These are the features typically marketed by insurance companies, however the VUL in most cases will limit the insured to being able to take advantage of only one of these features listed. Each of these features can be achieved through other means.

Financial protection - as with all life insurance programs, VULs can be used to protect a family in the case of a premature death.
Tax advantages - because of its tax-deferred feature, the VUL may offer an attractive tax advantage, especially to those in higher tax brackets. To attain them, the policy must be highly funded (though still non-MEC), for the tax advantages to offset the cost of insurance. These tax advantages can be used for either...

Education planning - the cash value of a VUL can be used to help fund children's education, as long as the policy is started very early. Also, putting money into a VUL can be used to help children qualify for federal financial aid, since the federal government does not consider the cash value when calculating EFC (Expected Family Contribution).
Retirement planning - because of its tax-free policy loan feature, the VUL can also be used as tax-advantaged income source in retirement, assuming retirement is not in the near future and the policy is not a modified endowment contract. Again, the policy must be properly funded for this strategy to work.


Estate planning - those with a large estate (A filing is required for estates with combined gross assets and prior taxable gifts exceeding $5,430,000 effective for decedents dying on or after January 1, 2015[1]) can sometimes use a VUL as part of their estate planning strategy to reduce or avoid estate taxes by setting up a life insurance trust sometimes known as an ILIT.

Criticisms of variable universal life[edit]

Some general criticisms

Potentially higher costs - VUL policies may be more expensive than other types of permanent insurance, such as Whole Life and traditional Universal Life. Volatility of cash surrender values, especially at late duration, can cause a "reverse dollar cost averaging" effect that results in higher costs of insurance charges. Proper funding of a contract may reduce this risk, but it cannot be completely eliminated.
Some older VUL policies have limited sub-account choices. This issue has been greatly corrected with the current generation of policies having 50 or more sub-accounts that cover all the major asset classes, with more than one sub-account manager.
Policy administrative expenses and costs of insurance may increase at the company's whim, subject to a contractual maximum.
VUL is relatively complex compared to traditional Whole Life or Term Life.

Some criticism is not about the product, but rather the sales tactics used by some insurance agents.

Projecting the maximum illustrated assumed interest rates (generally, 12%), using current (or assumed) administrative expenses and current costs of insurance, without showing the prospective client several other assumed rates of return, creating a Blue Sky problem.

Some regulators are criticized, as well.

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) does not allow insurance companies to illustrate VUL policies using a stochastic projection (commonly called a 'Monte Carlo Simulation'), limiting agents to use 'straight line', constant interest assumptions.

Variable universal life insurance

Variable universal life insurance (often shortened to VUL) is a type of life insurance that builds a cash value. In a VUL, the cash value can be invested in a wide variety of separate accounts, similar to mutual funds, and the choice of which of the available separate accounts to use is entirely up to the contract owner. The 'variable' component in the name refers to this ability to invest in separate accounts whose values vary—they vary because they are invested in stock and/or bond markets. The 'universal' component in the name refers to the flexibility the owner has in making premium payments. The premiums can vary from nothing in a given month up to maximums defined by the Internal Revenue Code for life insurance. This flexibility is in contrast to whole life insurance that has fixed premium payments that typically cannot be missed without lapsing the policy (although one may exercise an Automatic Premium Loan feature, or surrender dividends to pay a Whole Life premium).
Variable universal life is a type of permanent life insurance, because the death benefit will be paid if the insured dies any time as long as there is sufficient cash value to pay the costs of insurance in the policy. With most if not all VULs, unlike whole life, there is no endowment age (the age at which the cash value equals the death benefit amount, which for whole life is typically 100). This is yet another key advantage of VUL over Whole Life. With a typical whole life policy, the death benefit is limited to the face amount specified in the policy, and at endowment age, the face amount is all that is paid out. Thus with either death or endowment, the insurance company keeps any cash value built up over the years. However, some participating whole life policies offer riders which specify that any dividends paid on the policy be used to purchase "paid up additions" to the policy which increase both the cash value and the death benefit over time.
If investments made in the separate accounts out-perform the general account of the insurance company, a higher rate-of-return can occur than the fixed rates-of-return typical for whole life. The combination over the years of no endowment age, continually increasing death benefit, and if a high rate-of-return is earned in the separate accounts of a VUL policy, this could result in higher value to the owner or beneficiary than that of a whole life policy with the same amounts of money paid in as premiums.

Regulation of VUL providers[edit]
Because the separate accounts are securities, the representative providing a VUL must be working in accordance with the securities regulations of the country or province in which he operates. And because they are life insurance policies, VULs may only be sold by representatives who are properly licensed to sell life insurance in the areas in which they operate. The insurance company providing the policy must also be licensed as an "insurer."
This dual regulation helps protect consumers, who can look up the track record of offenses of any provider listed by the regulating SRO (Self Regulatory Organization) or provincial securities commission.

United States. VULs may only be sold in the United States by representatives who have a "producers" life insurance license in the state(s) in which he or she operates. The insurance company providing the policy must also be licensed in the state(s) as an "insurer." Because the separate accounts are securities, the representative must be working through a broker/dealer registered with the United States' SRO, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and himself be registered with FINRA. (FINRA has an online database an investor can use to look up offenses and regulatory actions of any broker or broker/dealer.) The fact of a representative's securities registration will show on his state insurance license as "Variable" as in "qualified for Life and Variable Products." (The exact wording could vary from state to state.)
Canada. VULs, as life insurance policies, may only be sold in Canada by life insurance-licensed representatives registered with the insurance regulator in their provincial jurisdiction. Representatives must comply with the life insurance regulations of their respective province (typically, a provincial "Insurance Act"). And, as VULs are life insurance policies, providers must comply with the national life insurance regulations ("Insurance Companies Act") established by The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI). Since VULs are presently not considered to be securities in Canada, they are subject to lighter regulatory scrutiny than typical securities products. In Canada, there is no real differentiation between universal life and variable universal life.mkj

Uses[edit]
Variable universal life insurance receives special tax advantages in the United States Internal Revenue Code. The cash value in life insurance is able to earn investment returns without incurring current income tax as long as it meets the definition of life insurance and the policy remains in force. The tax free investment returns could be considered to be used to pay for the costs of insurance inside the policy. See the 'Tax Benefits' section for more.
In one theory of life insurance, needs based analysis, life insurance is only needed to the extent that assets left behind by a person will not be enough to meet the income and capital needs of his or her dependents. In one form of variable universal life insurance, the cost of insurance purchased is based only on the difference between the death benefit and the cash value (defined as the net amount at risk from the perspective of the insurer). Therefore, the greater the cash value accumulation, the lesser the net amount at risk, and the less insurance that is purchased.
Another use of Variable Universal Life Insurance is among relatively wealthy persons who give money yearly to their children to put into VUL policies under the gift tax exemption. Very often persons in the United States with a net worth high enough that they will encounter the estate tax give money away to their children to protect that money being taxed. Often this is done within a VUL policy because this allows a tax deferral (for which no alternative would exist besides tuition money saved in an educational IRA or 529 plan), provides for permanent life insurance, and can usually be accessed tax-free by borrowing against the policy.
Contract features[edit]
By allowing the contract owner to choose the investments inside the policy the insured takes on the investment risk, and receives the greater potential return of the investments in return. If the investment returns are very poor this could lead to a policy lapsing (ceasing to exist as a valid policy). To avoid this, many insurers offer guaranteed death benefits up to a certain age as long as a given minimum premium is paid.
Premium flexibility[edit]
VUL policies have a great deal of flexibility in choosing how much premiums to pay for a given death benefit. The minimum premium is primarily affected by the contract features offered by the insurer. To maintain a death benefit guarantee, that specified premium level must be paid every month. To keep the policy in force, typically no premium needs to be paid as long as there is enough cash value in the policy to pay that month's cost of insurance. The maximum premium amounts are heavily influenced by the code for life insurance. Internal Revenue Code section 7702 sets limits for how much cash value can be allowed and how much premium can be paid (both in a given year, and over certain periods of time) for a given death benefit. The most efficient policy in terms of cash value growth would have the maximum premium paid for the minimum death benefit. Then the costs of insurance would have the minimum negative effect on the growth of the cash value. In the extreme would be a life insurance policy that had no life insurance component, and was entirely cash value. If it received favorable tax treatment as a life insurance policy it would be the perfect tax shelter, pure investment returns and no insurance cost. In fact when variable universal life policies first became available in 1986, contract owners were able to make very high investments into their policies and received extraordinary tax benefits. In order to curb this practice, but still encourage life insurance purchase, the IRS developed guidelines regarding allowed premiums for a given death benefit.
Maximum premiums[edit]
The standard set was twofold: to define a maximum amount of cash value per death benefit and to define a maximum premium for a given death benefit. If the maximum premium is exceeded the policy no longer qualifies for all of the benefits of a life insurance contract and is instead known as a modified endowment contract or a MEC. A MEC still receives tax free investment returns, and a tax free death benefit, but withdrawals of cash value in a MEC are on a 'LIFO' basis, where earnings are withdrawn first and taxed as ordinary income. If the cash value in a contract exceeds the specified percentage of death benefit, the policy no longer qualifies as life insurance at all and all investment earnings become immediately taxable in the year the specified percentage is exceeded. In order to avoid this, contracts define the death benefit to be the higher of the original death benefit or the amount needed to meet IRS guidelines. The maximum cash value is determined to be a certain percentage of the death benefit. The percentage ranges from 30% or so for young insured persons, declining to 0% for those reaching age 100.
The maximum premiums are set by the IRS guidelines such that the premiums paid within a seven-year period after a qualifying event (such as purchase or death benefit increase), grown at a 6% rate, and using the maximum guaranteed costs of insurance in the policy contract, would endow the policy at age 100 (i.e. the cash value would equal the death benefit). More specific rules are adjusted for premiums that are not paid in equal amounts over a seven-year period. The entire maximum premium (greater than the 7 year premium) can be paid in one year and no more premiums can be paid unless the death benefit is increased. If the 7 year level guideline premium is exceeded, then the policy becomes a MEC.
To add more confusion the seven-year MEC premium level cannot be paid in a VUL every year for 7 years, and still avoid MEC status. The MEC premium level can only be paid in practice for about 4 years before additional premiums cannot be paid if non MEC status is desired. There is another premium designed to be the maximum premium that can be paid every year a policy is in force. This premium carries different names from different insurers, one calling it the guideline maximum premium. This is the premium that often reaches the most efficient use of the policy.
Investment choices[edit]
The number and type of choices available varies from company to company, and from policy to policy. The current generation of VUL policies have a wide variety of sub-accounts for the policy owner to allocate their cash surrender values into. These newer policies often offer 50 or more separate accounts covering the entire spectrum of asset classes and management styles.
Separate accounts are organized as trusts to be managed for the benefit of the insureds, and are so named because they are kept 'separate' from the 'general account' of the life insurance company. They are similar to mutual funds, but have different regulatory requirements.
Tax advantages[edit]

Tax deferred growth of cash surrender values while a policy is in force
FIFO withdrawal status on premiums paid into the contract
Income tax free policy loans from policies that are not Modified Endowment Contracts
Income tax free death benefits (may be subject to estate tax if policy is owned by the insured)

Taxes are the main reason those in higher tax brackets (25%+) would desire to use a VUL over any other accumulation strategy. For someone in a 34% tax bracket (Federal & State), the investment return on the separate accounts may average 10%, and at say age 75 the policy's death benefit would have an internal rate of return of 9%. In order to get a 9% rate of return in an ordinary taxable account, in a 34% tax bracket, one must earn 13.64%. An alternative for this in the 34% tax bracket would be to consider using Variable Annuities which does not limit the contributions and withdraw from it without annuitizing the contract.
Other alternatives for those in the 34% tax bracket that own their own companies would be to consider SEP IRAs, company 401ks or retirement arrangements from a company perspective, or to incorporate and consult a tax specialist.
These numbers assume expenses that may vary from company to company, and it is assumed that the VUL is funded with a minimum face value for the level of premium. The cash values would also be available to fund lifestyle or personally managed investments on a tax free basis in the form of refunds of premiums paid in and policy loans (which would be paid off on death by the death benefit.)
Risks of variable universal life[edit]

If not monitored properly the cost of insurance may eventually exceed the cash outlay depleting savings. If this continues long term the savings will be depleted and insured will be given an option to increase the cash outlay to cover the higher cost of insurance or cancel the policy leaving them with no savings and either no insurance, or very expensive insurance.
