    Chicago, Illinois-- Straits Financial Fund Management LLC ("SFFM"), a commodity pool operator (“CPO”) registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission ("CFTC") and a member of the National Futures Association ("NFA"), is pleased to announce today the launch of the Straits Financial Premier (Offshore Feeder) Fund I, Ltd., which is the company's first managed pool offering for non-U.S. investors.     SFFM, together with other subsidiaries under Straits Financial Group ("SF Group"), offers a wide range of services, including execution, brokerage, clearing and electronic trading, which provide clients with a gateway to trade at the world’s leading futures exchanges.  SF Group is the brokering division of CWT Limited, one of the largest publicly-listed logistics companies in South East Asia.
