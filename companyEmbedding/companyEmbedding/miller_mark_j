Hart Miller
MARK is led by its founders, Anna Hart and John Miller, who met in Cornwall in 2007 through a shared passion for furniture, design and a belief in British manufacturing craft.
Pouring their energy, perception and experience from the worlds of furniture and interior design, manufacturing, healthcare, technology and education into countless conversations and ideas, they conceived a vision for a new furniture company.
MARK blends Anna and John’s different but complimentary approaches, personal service with high-volume capacity, and Cornish and urban perspectives. Drawing on talent from across Cornwall and the UK, skilled craftspeople from the creative, automotive, marine and textiles industries bring the MARK vision to life.
From the National Gallery to Price Waterhouse Cooper, Google to the World Wildlife Fund for Nature, Novotel to boutique hotels, MARK furniture – and Anna and John’s design expertise – is making its mark.




ANNA’s design career has embraced the interior and furniture design worlds, encompassing a vast range of perspectives and projects from large multinationals to small start-ups. Her interior design experience helps her see the bigger picture, understanding the vital role that furniture plays in the experience of a space, and the way that furniture can define the spaces it inhabits.
After training as a furniture designer at Leeds Metropolitan University (under the direction of Ab Rogers, Paul Logan and Pam Oswin), she joined leading furniture dealer Coexistence, broadening her knowledge of furniture within commercial interiors – a passion she’s built on ever since.
Moving on to DEGW in 2000 (now part of Aecom), she began her career as an interior designer, going on to lead projects for the BBC, the Crown Estate and BP before relocating to Cornwall to head up the interior design arm of hospitality design specialists Absolute Design. Her work there culminated in creating Fifteen Cornwall and the first phase of works for the Hotel at Watergate Bay. Leaving to establish her own design studio, she also joined forces with John to create MARK.
JOHN’s passions lie in the manufacturing side of the industry, the interface between design and technology, and connecting people and skills to create better products, outcomes and experiences.
Like Anna, he’s a furniture design graduate of Leeds Metropolitan University. He went on to do an MA in Design Research for Disability at the London College of Furniture before working as a design consultant in healthcare design and point of sale design. John established Design Strength in 1994 to manufacture furniture for the home healthcare market, which he ran for four years until moving into leading the Furniture Design and Technology BA at London Metropolitan University.
Next up (John has boundless energy and insatiable drive!), he established Furniture Works – a resource centre and series of projects linking designers with manufacturers – closely followed by the Metropolitan Works Digital Manufacturing Centre, both fuelled by his conviction of the need to improve dialogue between designers, manufacturers and technologists.
Relocating to Cornwall with his family in 2005, John then joined Falmouth University, as the Director of its School of Design, before meeting Anna and starting on the project that was to become MARK.
Today we have two brands: Hart Miller Design is our design studio working on interior and furniture projects. MARK Product is our established furniture manufacturing brand.

The Chemist's Companion Guide to Patent Law

Chris P. Miller, Mark J. Evans 
ISBN: 978-0-471-78243-8
344 pages
August 2010



















Description
Written by an individual with experience as both a chemist and a patent attorney, The Chemist's Companion Guide to Patent Law covers everything the student or working chemist needs to know about patentability, explaining important concepts of patent law (such as novelty, non-obviousness, and freedom-to-operate) in easy-to-understand terms. Through abundant examples from case law as well as real-world situations with which a researcher might be faced, this book provides readers with a better understanding of how to put that knowledge into practice.

Reviews
"For anyone involved in patents or the patenting process, this book
will help clarify what must go on in every step, from musing over a
problem in an office, through the laboratory work, the many steps
involving patent agents and attorneys, through gaining and
maintaining a viable patent." (Anal Bioanal Chem, 2011) 
"The book is suitably encyclopaedic and covers a substantial
fraction of the patent process. A compromise is struck between
suitable content and use as a student referral aid and the book
seems to get this exactly right." (Reviews, December
2010)“Authors Chris Miller and Mark Evans are practicing
chemists as well as patent law enthusiasts, and their
appreciation  of both ends of the inventor–attorney axis
makes them ideally placed to advise researchers.” (Nature
Chemistry, January 2011)
"This well-priced, up-to-date publication is attractively
printed and produced by the publisher. . . this book is especially
recommended for chemists and other members of drug discovery teams,
for graduate students, postdocs, for faculty members who have
interests in drug discovery, for others who would like a one-volume
review of U.S. patent law, and for the libraries that serve these
groups". (TMCnet.com, November 2010)
"This well-priced, up-to-date publication is attractively
printed and produced by the publisher. . . .this book is especially
recommended for chemists and other members of drug discovery teams,
for graduate students, postdocs, for faculty members who have
interests in drug discovery, for others who would like a one-volume
review of U.S. patent law, and for the libraries that serve these
groups". (TMCnet.com, 23 November 2010) "This well-priced,
up-to-date publication is attractively printed and produced by the
publisher. . . .This book is especially recommended for chemists
and other members of drug discovery teams, for graduate students,
postdocs, for faculty members who have interests in drug discovery,
for others who would like a one-volume review of U.S. patent law,
and for the libraries that serve these groups." (Journal
of Medicinal Chemistry, 2010)"
The title is accurate; it's a top-to-bottom look at the major
features of patent law as it applies to the business of
chemistry....... There's a lot of good stuff in this book. It's not
always light reading, but it's the most readable treatment of some
very complex patent issues that I've seen." (In the
Pipeline, September 13, 2010)

Molded plywood carries an immediate association with classic Herman Miller designs, and Mark Goetz skillfully and creatively incorporates this material in his sofa design. While traditional construction consists of a wooden frame with padding and upholstery applied over it, the Goetz sofa turns tradition inside out, since its plywood shell is clearly visible as both an aesthetic element and a structural frame. 

The sofa's practicality extends to one of its most important features--comfort. Goetz conducted his own research and consulted with other experts to arrive at a seat depth that gives ergonomic support as well as room to lie down.

By using common materials and processes in innovative ways, designer Mark Goetz achieves a clean, crisp aesthetic. The Goetz complements contemporary, informal lifestyles while echoing Herman Miller's classic heritage.

The Goetz sofa features a dramatic profile with molded veneer which wraps completely around the sides and back with polished cast aluminum legs. The frame finishes include walnut, white ash, natural cherry or ebony veneers. The upholstery is available in your choice of a wide range of fabrics and leathers.								 																	84" w | 31" d | 32" h | seat: 17.5" h									 																																			$5,355.00 + free threshold delivery in the continental U.S.										(usually ships in 6 weeks)																								  reviews     there are no reviews of this product yet.     write a review      Mark Goetz Mark Goetz�s love for product development and his understanding of manufacturing began while working in his family�s plastic injection molding business. Born outside of Pittsburgh, he was educated at Pratt Institute and graduated with a degree in Industrial Design. In addition, he spent a semester abroad to focus on furniture design and architecture at the Danish Royal Academy in Copenhagen.
    Herman Miller was a West Michigan businessman who helped his son-in-law, D.J. De Pree, buy the Michigan Star Furniture Company in 1923. De Pree had been working at the company, which opened in 1905, since he was hired in 1909 as a clerk. De Pree knew his father-in-law was a man of integrity, so he decided to rename the company after him.  By the middle of the 20th century, the name Herman Miller had become synonymous with �modern� furniture. Working with legendary designers George Nelson and Charles and Ray Eames, the company produced pieces that would become classics of industrial design.
