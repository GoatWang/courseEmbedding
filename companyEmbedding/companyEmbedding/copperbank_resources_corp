                            About                            
CopperBank was created by a group of well respected investors, geologists and engineers to consolidate world-class copper properties and offer a unique “pounds in the ground” copper investment vehicle. Our strategy is to accretively advance our portfolio while managing the core business like owner operators and vehemently protecting our value offering on a per share basis. Due to our low overhead model and established suite of projects, CopperBank has one of the lowest G&A operating budgets of any publicly listed company in Canada. The management of CopperBank have demonstrated intensive insider buying distinguishing our brand as one of the most insider supported companies in North America.

Currently CopperBank holds three projects, Contact Copper located in Elko County, Nevada and the Pyramid and San Diego Bay projects located on the Aleutian Islands chain in Alaska. The companies initial public flotation at 0.10 per share was on November 7, 2014 and now trades on The Canadian Stock Exchange, Frankfurt Main Boerse and OTC in the USA.
Highlights of Contact:
• 100% consolidated ownership
• 5,900 acres of patented and unpatented mining claims (Plenty of blue sky exploration potential at the Copper Ridge and New York prospects, only 1km from main project.)
• 2013 PFS design for 50 million pounds per year of copper cathode production
• Heap leaching with SX-EW to make copper cathode at site
• Located in NE Nevada near the border with Idaho, one mile west of Highway 93
• Excellent infrastructure with available roads, grid power, and water
• Extensively drilled with over 250,000 feet of drilling (329 core and RC holes)
Highlights of Pyramid:
• Porphyry Cu-Mo-Au discovery with maiden resource
• Extensive Supergene Cu enrichment blanket
• Near surface mineralization
• Adjacent to tidewater, 25km from SandPoint, Alaska. One of the best situated copper porphyry’s in the world.
• Completed 7,486 meters of drilling in three years totalling 30 holes
• Established an open ended mineralized footprint of 1,800 meters by 1,050 meters
• Situated on private property, Native owned lands (The Aleut Corporation).
Highlights of San Diego Bay:
• San Diego Bay is a massive 60 square km area of gossan and pervasive argillic, physic, potassic alteration
• Largest colour anomaly in Southern Alaska (tier 1 porphyry target)
• Located 7 km’s West of Pyramid and part of the same option agreement
• Historic sampling returned high-grade Au-Ag-Cu-Pb-Zn
• Very limited exploration for the size of the project (only 2 man weeks)
• Adjacent to tidewater, 25km from SandPoint, Alaska
