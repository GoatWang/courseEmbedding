The Trouble with Private Placements
Reg D Private placements, like Steben & Company Futures Portfolio Fund LP, generally involve a much greater degree of risk compared to traditional investments, such as stocks, bonds or mutual funds. Interests in private placements are often sold as unregistered securities and lack the same regulatory oversight as more traditional investment products.
Unfortunately, some brokers may have downplayed the risks associated with alternative investments and misled investors into thinking that they are “safe” investment products. The high sales commission brokers earn for selling interests in private placements may have provided some brokers with enough incentive to push the product to unsuspecting investors.
Broker dealers that sell alternative investments are required to perform adequate due diligence on all investment recommendations to ensure that each investment is suitable for the investor in light of the investor’s age, risk tolerance, net worth, financial needs, and investment experience.
If a broker makes an unsuitable investment recommendations or fails to adequately disclose the risks associated with an investment they may be liable for investment losses.
The White Law Group is investigating the liability that brokerage firms may have for recommending Steben & Company Futures Portfolio Fund LP to their clients.
