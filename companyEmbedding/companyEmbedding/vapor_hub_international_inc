										Vapor Hub International, Inc. - Electronic Cigarette Products Provider Discusses Vaping and E-Liquid Markets

Vapor Hub International Inc. (OTC: VHUB) is a California-based company engaged in the development, production and sales of electronic cigarette products, including high quality e-liquids, custom mechanical mod e-cigarettes, and unique personal modifications, according to the company’s website (see here: http://www.vapor-hub.com/). SNNLive spoke with Kyle Winther, CEO of Vapor Hub International, Inc. at the LD Micro Invitational 2015 in Bel Air, CA.
“VHUB was started in 2008 under the corporate name, Delight Producs. We started selling electronic cigarettes in 2008. We forecasted that the electronic cigarette industry was going to be transitioning to a vaping market. A vaping market is more the high-end electronic cigarettes that have bigger batteries and they use e-liquid,” he begins, “So in 2013, we opened up our first retail vapor store, and in 2013, we also developed our first, what we call a ‘Mod’…a bigger electronic cigarette. We did this in order to control the profit margins. We wanted to be able to have profit margins that we can have to sustain to distributors, wholesalers and retailers.”
When asked who are the pre-dominant users of VHUB products, he explains, “So it starts out as users who are actually smoking cigarettes. They taper down from cigarettes when they switch to electronic cigarettes. They started at a higher nicotine level and then they transition down to a lower nicotine level. Then, what they find is that the power of the electronic cigarette doesn’t work as well for them, so they transition to the higher devices, what we call, ‘Mods.’”
Mr. Winther goes on to discuss why the electronic cigarette doesn’t work as well as the ‘Mod’, the size and scale of the ‘Vaping’ industry, where the company’s growth comes from, the ‘Limitless Mod’ brand, his background, where the company makes the product, and an explanation of ‘E-liquid.’ For more information about Vapor Hub International, Inc., go to: www.Vapor-Hub.com
