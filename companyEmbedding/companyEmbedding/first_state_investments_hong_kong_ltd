Investment involves risks. Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Refer to the offering documents of the respective funds for details, including risk factors. Investors may not get back the full amount invested. Fund performance data is sourced from Lipper. The computation basis of the performance is based on the calendar year end, NAV to NAV, with dividend reinvested. These figures show by how much the fund increased or decreased in value during the calendar year being shown. Performance data has been calculated in USD, including ongoing charges and excluding subscription fee and redemption fee you might have to pay. Where no past performance is shown there was insufficient data available in that year to provide performance. Acc represents share class with dividends accumulated. M Dist represents share class with monthly distribution of dividends. H Dist represents share class with half-yearly distribution of dividends. Q Dist represents share class with quarterly distribution of dividends. Dividends are not guaranteed and may be paid out of capital. All prices are for indication only. 

 

a As at 6 September 2016, the investment policy of First State Asia Innovation Fund has been clarified to better align with the market. The name First State Asia Innovation Fund has been changed to First State Asia Opportunities Fund to reflect the change. 

 

b First State Japan Equity Fund – Class I (Acc) was launched on 6 September 2016. Performance data will be available in due course.

d First State Asian Property Securities Fund is authorised under SFC Code on Unit Trusts and Mutual Funds but not authorised under SFC Code on REITs. First State Asian Property Securities Fund does not invest in real estate property directly. SFC authorisation is not a recommendation or endorsement of a scheme nor does it guarantee the commercial merits of a scheme or its performance. It does not mean the scheme is suitable for all investors nor is it an endorsement of its suitability for any particular investor or class of investors.

First State business leaders work with the University of Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership (CISL) to make the case for Responsible investment.

Investment involves risks. Past performance is not indicative of future performance. Refer to the offering documents of the respective funds for details, including risk factors. Investors may not get back the full amount invested. Fund performance data is sourced from Lipper. The computation basis of the performance is based on the calendar year end, NAV to NAV, with dividend reinvested. These figures show by how much the fund increased or decreased in value during the calendar year being shown. Performance data has been calculated in USD, including ongoing charges and excluding subscription fee and redemption fee you might have to pay. Where no past performance is shown there was insufficient data available in that year to provide performance. Acc represents share class with dividends accumulated. M Dist represents share class with monthly distribution of dividends. H Dist represents share class with half-yearly distribution of dividends. Q Dist represents share class with quarterly distribution of dividends. Dividends are not guaranteed and may be paid out of capital. All prices are for indication only. 

 

a As at 6 September 2016, the investment policy of First State Asia Innovation Fund has been clarified to better align with the market. The name First State Asia Innovation Fund has been changed to First State Asia Opportunities Fund to reflect the change. 

 

b First State Japan Equity Fund – Class I (Acc) was launched on 6 September 2016. Performance data will be available in due course. 

 

c With effect from 24 April 2015, First State Global Emerging Markets Select Fund was merged into First State Global Emerging Markets Leaders Fund. On 2 November 2015, First State Global Emerging Markets Leaders Fund was rebranded as Stewart Investors Global Emerging Markets Leaders Fund.

d First State Asian Property Securities Fund is authorised under SFC Code on Unit Trusts and Mutual Funds but not authorised under SFC Code on REITs. First State Asian Property Securities Fund does not invest in real estate property directly. SFC authorisation is not a recommendation or endorsement of a scheme nor does it guarantee the commercial merits of a scheme or its performance. It does not mean the scheme is suitable for all investors nor is it an endorsement of its suitability for any particular investor or class of investors. 

 

^ Stewart Investors Global Emerging Markets Leaders Fund is now closed for new subscription.  

 

▲ Benchmark is changed from Market Cap Weighted of MSCI Malaysia/MSCI Singapore Indices to MSCI Singapore & Malaysia Net Index effective on 1 May 2017.
