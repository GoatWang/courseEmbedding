Copy URL above and paste away!honest1003again03/19/2013OverallI saw Dr. Lovoi several years ago, regrettably to have my teeth pulled. Like the previous reviewer, I was referred by another dentist with whom I had a far worse experience with than Dr. Lovoi however I would like to make a few comments about my experience as Dr. Lovoi's patient.  Firstly, I found the doctor and his staff to be personable & friendly. However, just prior (as in a few minutes) to my surgery, Dr. Lovoi had a conversation with me concerning "anchor teeth" and a warning about sinus issues. Granted this is a conversation that needed to occur but these are topics that should have been discussed during my consultation, NOT, as it was, AFTER I HAD BEEN MEDICATED! As it has turned out, the "anchor teeth" which he told me to choose (during my med-induced stupor) were not good choices and had to be removed (by another dentist) later, which of course means I am without the very necessary "anchor" for my lower dentures. In addition, due to my medicated state I have very little memory of the sinus issues he "warned" me about that "may" occur after having teeth removed but am certainly living proof that sinus issues "can be" and are in fact an issue because I've had sinus problems ever since my teeth were removed. If Dr. Lovoi's office reads these reviews, I strongly recommend that he revise his process and include important matters such as these in the consultation visit, or at least BEFORE the patient is medicated.Helpful(0)ShareFlagg2_xyz02/08/2010OverallA dentist only interested in MONEYI have finally found in all my years with dentists, one who's only interest is MONEY. I went in late December fI went to Dr. Lovoi for a &amp;quot;consulation&amp;quot; because my denist sent me there. My dentist sent a xerox copy of an xray. Dr. Lovoi's office insisted on a $68 payment and made me sign a form that allows for unrestricted access to my credit card if a bill isn't paid. Which I found out later that it is impossible to have a open bill. They took a panaramic xray that was a piece of junk. It wasn't a complete xray. Instead of Dr. Lovoi retaking it he made his diagnosis on the xerox. Showed me a video of the how &amp;quot;dangerous&amp;quot; and that they would not be responsible for any problems with implants. Leaving me to believe that he is very irresponsible with his patients, but of course its about the MONEY.I was then sent to the &amp;quot;billing/scheduling&amp;quot; person and was told that payment for the surgery must be made at the time of the scheduling. Now $700 doesn't come easily and if the appt. was over a month they would make interest on my money. Also the form I was given states &amp;quot;If you are more than 15 minutes late (for surgery), your appointment may be cancelled&amp;quot; And &amp;quot; if you fail to cancel or reschedule your appointment at least 24 hours in advance, you will NOT be rescheduled without special approval.&amp;quot; Leading me to believe that this is a crowded surgery schedule. And they do them every day according to Dr. Lovoi. I would not reccomend this dentist unless you want to be a number and have lots of MONEY to leave in someone else's hands and not treated as a person.Helpful(1)ShareFlagMap & DirectionsAdRoman Dental(3)14535 Memorial Dr, Houston, TX 77079(281) 769-5625Marvelous new technologies, materials & techniquesPut your ad here >People Also ViewedClear Lake Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery(1)17448 Highway 3 Ste 170, Webster, TXBright Now Dental2321 Bay Area Blvd, Houston, TXOral Surgery Associates(1)595 E Medical Center Blvd, Webster, TXEugene L Aaron DDS PA2095 W Main St Ste A, League City, TXSignature Smiles Dentistry Inc.2200 Space Park Dr Ste 300, Houston, TXPaid AdvertisementRelated ArticlesTop 10 Questions to Ask an OrthodontistBefore you invest time and hard-earned cash in this long-term medical affair, ask all the important questions of your potential orthodontist, so there are no unpleasant surprises…How to Choose the Right OrthodontistIt’s important to choose the right match when you or your child needs orthodontic treatment.

Like the previous reviewer, I was referred by another dentist with whom I had a far worse experience with than Dr. Lovoi however… I would like to make a few comments about my experience as Dr. Lovoi's patient. Firstly, I found the doctor and his staff to be personable & friendly. However, just prior (as in a few minutes) to my surgery, Dr. Lovoi had a conversation with me concerning "anchor teeth" and a warning about sinus issues. Granted this is a conversation that needed to occur but these are topics that should have been discussed during my consultation, NOT, as it was, AFTER I HAD BEEN MEDICATED! As it has turned out, the "anchor teeth" which he told me to choose (during my med-induced stupor) were not good choices and had to be removed (by another dentist) later, which of course means I am without the very necessary "anchor" for my lower dentures. In addition, due to my medicated state I have very little memory of the sinus issues he "warned" me about that "may" occur after having teeth removed but am certainly living proof that sinus issues "can be" and are in fact an issue because I've had sinus problems ever since my teeth were removed. If Dr. Lovoi's office reads these reviews, I strongly recommend that he revise his process and include important matters such as these in the consultation visit, or at least BEFORE the patient is medicated. more » I saw Dr. Lovoi several years ago, regrettably to have my teeth pulled.

Dr. Lovoi's office insisted on a $68 payment and made me sign a form that allows for unrestricted access to my credit card if a bill isn't paid. Which I found out later that it is impossible to have a open bill. They took a panaramic xray that was a piece of junk. It wasn't a complete xray. Instead of Dr. Lovoi retaking it he made his diagnosis on the xerox. Showed me a video of the how &quot;dangerous&quot; and that they would not be responsible for any problems with implants. Leaving me to believe that he is very irresponsible with his patients, but of course its about the MONEY.I was then sent to the &quot;billing/scheduling&quot; person and was told that payment for the surgery must be made at the time of the scheduling. Now $700 doesn't come easily and if the appt. was over a month they would make interest on my money. Also the form I was given states &quot;If you are more than 15 minutes late (for surgery), your appointment may be cancelled&quot; And &quot; if you fail to cancel or reschedule your appointment at least 24 hours in advance, you will NOT be rescheduled without special approval.&quot; Leading me to believe that this is a crowded surgery schedule.
