Located in a quiet Northern San Gabriel neighborhood, this home was thoughtfully & completely renovated by the current owner in 2010. Included were new copper plumbing, central AC/heat, tankless water heater, 220V electric system & recessed lights throughout. The property is minutes from Wilson Elementary and also attends Jefferson Middle & Gabrielino High, all California Distinguished Schools. The tastefully remodeled kitchen has high-end stainless steel appliances, quartz counters, custom built cabinets & travertine flooring. The central courtyard and professionally designed backyard are like an extension of living space, with large outdoor dining and seating zones! The brick walkway connects to a charming brick patio for further flexible outdoor entertaining.

                    This City has a long historical significance with the Mission San Gabriel Arcangel landmark. San Gabriel is known for it's Native American and Spanish roots along with it's more recent (last 40 years) popularity of Chinese businesses.  The city's mostly modest homes many which were built in the 1930's - 1950's are reminiscent of the styles of those periods. You will find Spanish, Craftsman, Colonial, Mid-Century Modern, Ranch, Cottage and Tudor styles. Larger homes border the San Gabriel Country Club and golf course.  San Gabriel is known for its established neighborhoods which have mature trees. Many of the residents' families have lived in the neighborhoods for several generations. 

Many of the homes interiors have been renovated to update to today's standards. Several condominium projects have been developed, along with mixed use buildings (condo/commercial).

Located between two major freeways, the 10 and 210 freeway, it is convenient for commuting to jobs in downtown LA.
