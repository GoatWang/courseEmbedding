Our true purpose?Making your life better through insurance.

	Our Company
 Schiff Insurance (John J. & Thomas R. Schiff & Co., Inc.) is an insurance agency focused on property, casualty and life insurance for commercial and personal purposes. We are a group of independent agents devoting our individual and collective resources to our client’s best interests. 
Jack Schiff Sr., our founder, sold his first insurance policy in 1938. Today, his high standards define our best practices: work hard and care about your customer. We appreciate that competition will improve coverage while advances in technology will benefit better underwriting. The heart of insurance, though, will remain in the trusted value of the independent insurance agent’s commitment to serve you diligently and wisely.
Our goal is to ensure that you sleep well knowing your risk management objectives have been met. More than just dependability, you’ll find strength in our service and empowerment in the program of protection your agent provides. It’s about you—your business, your family and your financial security.

This is our job. We’ll take the information, provide the appropriate advice, and contact the insurance company on your behalf. The insurance company will take over from there and settle the claim directly with you.
In the meantime, take the necessary steps to protect your property from further injury. It’s important that you try to keep the loss to a minimum. Take pictures to document the worst of it if you can. Remember, our goal is to get your life back to normal as quickly as possible.

	“Accountability is the natural result of taking pride in your work.It means working hard and being there for you”

	– D. Scott Lindsay, Vice President
 
	Personal Insurance
 The financial hardship caused by a catastrophe, whether it’s in the form of natural disaster or negligent behavior, can be a major disruption to your life. Being unprepared only compounds the stress.
You buy an insurance policy to minimize the financial impact of this misfortune. Our independent insurance professionals provide the comfort and strength of a well thought-out solution to protect what you hold dear.

  Engineered for You
 You are unique. You deserve an agent who will understand your family’s personal priorities, goals, and life-style. They will work with you to develop an appropriate strategy of coverage terms and limits that covers your unique exposure to risk.
  Installed with Confidence
 We will negotiate with insurance companies to find the best value in terms of coverage and limits. We will facilitate the coverage being issued and provide council to ensure that the contractual covenants required to keep the coverage effective are fulfilled.
  Serviced for Value
 Life does not remain static once your coverage is issued. Instead, life evolves, things change and so do your exposures. Our agents remain a constant for you, fully invested in your best interests: protecting your assets. How? By checking in with you periodically and fine-tuning your strategy to keep your coverage in concert with your life-style. 
  Distress Minimized
 Your insurance coverage will provide the funds necessary to replace or protect your assets with as little negative consequences on your lifestyle as realistic. Using a financially sound company with a dignified claims process and adopting life-style practices that minimize your exposures are simple preventative measures that ease the trauma in the event of misfortune.

	Our Life Insurance
 Life insurance is an extremely useful tool that has a variety of applications depending on your needs. The life insurance agents from Schiff Insurance are your trusted resource for developing a program to suit your specific needs. Life changes and business adapt, consider your life insurance agent as a partner to keep your financial protection in step with your growing business and lifestyle.
Most commonly, families rely on life insurance to protect their finances in the event of a wageearner’s death. This can provide protection for your mortgage, childcare costs, estate or even to fund a retirement.
The business applications of life insurance are equally valuable. Insuring your ability to keep your business intact in the event of a partner’s death or incapacitation is vitally important. Key Person coverage and/or a Life Policy in conjunction with a Buy/Sell agreement are an essential component of any business’s protection strategy.

			John J. Schiff, Jr., CPCU, age 73, has been a director of the company since 1968. He is a member of the investment committee. Mr. Schiff is not a nominee for re-election at the 2017 Annual Meeting of Shareholders.

Mr. Schiff's long service in our executive and board leadership strongly links us to the mission and values established by our founding agents in 1950. As our former chairman of the board, chief executive officer and a licensed insurance agent, he brings a blended perspective, assuring leadership and cultural continuity through agent-centered decisions that differentiate us from competitors. His insights gained from years of service on multiple public company boards help preserve our business model's long-term approach to creating shareholder value. He also brings the perspective of a large shareholder to our board discussions and decisions.

From 1986 to 2011, Mr. Schiff was chairman of the company's board of directors and, except from 2006 to 2008, chairman of its lead subsidiary, The Cincinnati Insurance Company. He also was president and chief executive officer of the company and of its lead subsidiary from 1999 to 2006. He retained only the company-level chairman and chief executive officer roles from 2006 to 2008 when he resumed the subsidiary chairman title. From 1983 to 1996, Mr. Schiff was chairman, chief executive officer and an agent with John J. & Thomas R. Schiff & Co. Inc., a privately owned, Cincinnati-based independent insurance agency. Prior to 1983, he was an agent, vice president and secretary of John J. Schiff & Company Inc., which he joined in 1965 after earning a Bachelor of Science in risk and insurance management from The Ohio State University. He earned the Chartered Property Casualty Underwriter designation in 1972 and is a member of The American Institute for Chartered Property Casualty Underwriters, serving as a trustee from 1992 to 2004 and as an executive committee member. 

Mr. Schiff also has experience as a director of publicly traded Cincinnati-based companies: The Standard Register Company, a document management services company, from 1982 to 2015, with service on its audit and pension advisory committees; Fifth Third Bancorp and The Fifth Third Bank, from 1983 to 2014, with periods of service on the compensation, executive and trust committees; Cinergy Corporation, from 1994 to 2005 when it was acquired by Duke Energy Corporation; and Cinergy's predecessor, Cincinnati Gas & Electric Company, from 1986 to 1995. He served at various times on Cinergy's audit and compensation committees. Mr. Schiff also is a director of two privately owned companies, the Cincinnati Bengals Inc. and the independent insurance agency named above. His activities have included leadership and service to nonprofit community boards and foundations that support arts education, high school and university education, a hospital and general philanthropy.

OBITUARY John Schiff was insurance giant, philanthropist Friday, October 16, 1998BY PHILLIP PINA The Cincinnati Enquirer 







   John J. "Jack" Schiff, who helped start what would become Cincinnati Financial Corp. and was a leader in local arts and civic groups, died Wednesday at Deaconess Hospital. He was 82. 
   Mr. Schiff of Western Hills was an honored man in the insurance industry as well as the community. He is credited with guiding a firm that started with $200,000 in capital into a corporation with $9.5 billion in assets. And he was recognized for his community service in 1997 when the Greater Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce named him a Great Living Cincinnatian. 
   "His business achievements and philanthropic acts left a lasting impression on everyone who knew him," said Robert B. Morgan, chief executive officer at Cincinnati Financial. The company Mr. Schiff co-founded will continue to let his vision guide it into the future, Mr. Morgan added. 
   Born in Cincinnati, Mr. Schiff graduated from Western Hills High School in 1934 and Ohio State University in 1938. He then attended Harvard University's Navy Supply Corps School. 
   He took a position with Travelers Group Inc. in 1938, his first journey into the insurance industry. He opened his own independent agency the same year. During World War II, he served as an assistant logistics officer with the U.S. Navy in Germany, and earned the rank of lieutenant commander before his discharge. 
   He returned to Cincinnati to an independent agency. In 1950, with three other insurance agents, he established The Cincinnati Insurance Co. Starting with 18 agents, the company grew into the nation's 21st largest publicly traded property and casualty insurance company. 
   Mr. Schiff served as the company's chairman and chief executive officer for years. After retiring in 1991, he remained active with the company, serving on the company's board of directors and was chairman of the executive committee. 
   Named the Cincinnati Insurance Board's 1976 Man of the Year, Mr. Schiff played a vital role in the industry. He was active with the International Insurance Society, International Insurance Hall of Fame, Griffith Foundation for Insurance Education, Ohio Insurance Institute and the American Institute for Property and Liability Underwriters. 
   He maintained strong ties with the U.S. Navy, serving on the National Board of Directors of the Navy League of the United States, as a trustee of the USS Constitution Museum and provided vital support for the commissioning of the USS Cincinnati, a Navy nuclear attack submarine. He was appointed an Honorary Commodore of the U.S. Naval Institute and received the Secretary of the Navy's Superior Public Service Award. 
   Mr. Schiff, an ardent fan of Ohio State, his alma mater, was known to have orchestras performing at corporate banquets end the evening with the school's fight song. He also served on the school's Business Advisory Council, President's Club and Development Committee. He received the university's Distinguished Service Award in 1996. Some of his community contributions include posts on the boards of directors at Deaconess Hospital, Greater Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce and the Cincinnati Museum Association. 
   "Everyone knows his leadership at Cincinnati Financial and their success," said Fifth Third Bank CEO George Schaefer. "However, Jack also contributed significantly to the growth and development of our entire community. His lists of achievements and recognitions are both lengthy and legendary in the Greater Cincinnati area." Mr. Schiff served on the Cincinnati-based bank's board of directors for 12 years. 
   Mr. Schiff also held leadership posts with the Cincinnati Junior Chamber of Commerce, the Queen City Association and the Ohio State Alumni Association of Cincinnati. He was active with the Cincinnati Music Hall Association, the 1788 Club-Cincinnati Historical Society, Salvation Army and Shiloh Community Methodist Church. The Cincinnati Art Academy in 1990 gave him an Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degree. Xavier University recognized Mr. Schiff with an Honorary Doctor of Humanities degree in 1992 and, last month, presented Mr. Schiff and his family with the 1998 Xavier Founders' Day Award. 
   "My father's business legacy is a strong insurance company focused on close personal relationships, an unwavering work ethic and an intense sense of loyalty to people and organizations," said John J. Schiff Jr., his son and chairman and chief operating officer of Cincinnati Financial. 
   Mr. Schiff was preceded in death by his wife, Mary Reid Schiff. Survivors include three children, John J. Schiff Jr. of Indian Hill, Thomas R. Schiff of Glendale and Suzanne S. Reid of Barnstable, Mass.; a brother, Robert C. Schiff of Indian Hill; eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. 
   Services will be 11 a.m. Saturday at Shiloh United Methodist Church, Anderson Ferry and Foley roads, Delhi Township. Visitation will be at the church Saturday beginning at 9 a.m. and lasting until time of services. 
   Burial will be in Spring Grove Cemetery, Winton Place. 
   Memorial contributions may be made to the charity of one's choice.
