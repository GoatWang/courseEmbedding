                           As arrogant and brash as he was talented and innovative, Ben Jonson lived a life as rife with drama as any of his many plays.
                              He was jailed more than once for staging dramas that satirized the powers that be, and nearly had his ears and nose mutilated
                              after collaborating on a play that lampooned King James I. Friend and colleague of Shakespeare, he is considered by many to
                              have been the first poet laureate of England. This program examines how Jonson's poetry, masques, and plays brought a level
                              of humor, intellect, and formal discipline to English letters that had rarely been seen before. Excerpts from The Alchemist;
                              Every Man in His Humor; Volpone, or the Fox; and Jonson's poetry are included. (22 minutes)

                           Though he courted controversy in politics, Ezra Pound wielded tremendous influence on the 20th century's literature. His challenge,
                              "make it new," became Modernism's touchstone. This program follows his life's extraordinary course, from his collaborations
                              with Yeats and Eliot through his years of detention at St. Elizabeths Hospital. Using a wealth of photographs and manuscripts,
                              there are readings from his letters, essays, and selected poems, including "Meditatio," "In a Station of the Metro," and selections
                              from his epic, "The Cantos."

                           Synonymous with metaphysical poetry, John Donne combined wit with passion, startling diction with curious contrasts. This
                              program chronicles his extraordinary life as lawyer, lover, sailor, father, preacher, and poet. Manuscripts and paintings
                              are combined with readings from many of Donne's most famous writings, including "The Flea," "Elegy XX," "A Valediction: Forbidding
                              Mourning," "The Calm," "Progress of the Soul," "Holy Sonnet XVII," "Meditation XVII," and "Hymn to God, My God, in My Sickness."

                              Abstract: February 2000 - Some say that democracy is more likely to survive under parliamentary governments. That result is
                                 not robust to the use of different variables from the Database of Political Institutions, a large new cross-country database
                                 that may illuminate many other issues affecting and affected by political institutions. This paper introduces a large new
                                 cross-country database on political institutions: the Database on Political Institutions (DPI). Beck, Clarke, Groff, Keefer,
                                 and Walsh summarize key variables (many of them new), compare this data set with others, and explore the range of issues for
                                 which the data should prove invaluable. Among the novel variables they introduce: Several measures of tenure, stability, and
                                 checks and balances; Identification of parties with the government coalition or the opposition; Fragmentation of opposition
                                 and government parties in legislatures. The authors illustrate the application of DPI variables to several problems in political
                                 economy. Stepan and Skach, for example, find that democracy is more likely to survive under parliamentary governments than
                                 presidential systems. But this result is not robust to the use of different variables from the DPI, which raises puzzles for
                                 future research. Similarly, Roubini and Sachs find that divided governments in the OECD run higher budget deficits after fiscal
                                 shocks. Replication of their work using DPI indicators of divided government indicates otherwise, again suggesting issues
                                 for future research. Among questions in political science and economics that this database may illuminate: the determinants
                                 of democratic consolidation, the political conditions for economic reform, the political and institutional roots of corruption,
                                 and the elements of appropriate and institutionally sensitive design of economic policy. This paper - a product of Regulation
                                 and Competition Policy, Development Research Group - is part of a larger effort in the group to understand the institutional
                                 bases of poverty alleviation and economic reform. The study was funded by the Bank's Research Support Budget under the research
                                 project Database on Institutions for Government Decisionmaking (RPO 682-79). The authors may be contacted at tbeck@worldbank.org,

                                 of his favourite fishing tales from the pages of <Outdoor Canada</ magazine. Whether he's tackling giant northern pike or
                                 tiny trout, Walsh's love of angling shines through in this collection of often self-deprecating travelogues'as does his fascination
                                 with the history, geography and people of the far-flung destinations he has visited.>

        it is provided by manufacturers,
        suppliers and others, and has not been verified by us. See our disclaimer. DR. PATRICK WALSH'S GUIDE TO SURVIVING PROSTATE CANCER Publishers Weekly,Walsh, professor of urology at Johns Hopkins University, and Worthington, a medical writer, offer a thorough guide to one of the most frightening diseases for men. Starting with an explanation of how the prostrate works surprisingly, it's not an essential organ Walsh then discusses why prostate cancer is prevalent in the U.S. and other developed Western countries, but not in Asia. He also detail the reasons men develop prostate cancer, including age, race, family history and diet. The book describes a variety of symptoms, some of which indicate ailments other than cancer, and what steps should be taken to get a proper diagnosis. Complete with diagrams and charts detailing the results of biopsy, the book provides an exceptionally complete (albeit worrisome, for squeamish readers) overview of the disease. Many of these details not taking aspirin prior to a biopsy, taking antibiotics ahead of time should obviously be included in the information doctors routinely provide to patients, but given the state of today's medical system, having such information available in this ready guide is useful and reassuring. Similarly comprehensive and easy-to-understand explanations are provided for surgical and other types of treatment, side effects, postsurgical complications and more, as well as a glossary of medical terms, along with a brief resource section. While people shouldn't use this book as a substitute for a medical check-up, it is one of the best all-inclusive books on this subject. All men and their loved ones battling or concerned about prostate cancer should read this book. (Aug. 28) (c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Our world was turned up-side down. His biopsy results were grim and we eventually discovered that the cancer was locally advanced. Several people recommended book titles or mailed us resources, so I read many volumes. This book was, in my opinion, the best of them all. It was clearly written and the research in the 2012 edition was fresh. The author did not appear to hustle men into one particular treatment option, but explains them all and affirms that each treatment plan will be unique to each man. Because his cancer is advanced, my husband is receiving surgery, hormone therapy and radiation. After my initial first reading, I have gone back to thoroughly re-read each chapter as we begin each new phase of treatment.

Dr. Walsh is on staff at Johns Hopkins. The hospital is ranked #2 in the nation for cancer care and for decades was #1 for urology; they specialize in prostate cancer. The material in the book seems medically accurate based on all my other research.

This copy that I purchased from Wal-mart was a gift for someone else who was recently diagnosed with prostate cancer. It is the one book I would most recommend.Was this review helpful?Yes (7)No (0)ReportRead all  reviews11-1 of 1  reviewsSee allCloseShared by Added Policies & PlansSee any care plans, options and policies that may be associated with this product.BackGifting plansGift options are not available for this item.Pricing policyAbout our pricesWe're committed to providing low prices every day, on everything.
