What are analysts saying about Maxim Integrated Products stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Maxim Integrated Products stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "Maxim is an OEM of analog and mixed signal ICs. The fiscal third-quarter earnings of the company were above the Zacks Consensus Estimate.  However, over the last one year, the stock has underperformed the Zacks characterized Semi- Analog & Mixed industry. Maxim has a solid portfolio that generates steady design wins, a highly profitable and well-diversified core business, a policy of maintaining efficiency that has led to cost cutting measures and regular cash returns.  Maxim’s exposure to the consumer and communications markets increases risks. However, the diversification of the consumer revenue across a variety of tablets, wearables, peripherals and smartphones is adding stability to the company’s business profile." (6/28/2017)
2. Maxim Group analysts commented, "MXIM delivered another round of beat/raise results with F3Q (March) sales/EPS of $581M/$0.56 besting the Street’s $576M/$0.52, and F4Q (June) guidance of $610M/ $0.62 easily ahead of consensus $598M/$0.58. Auto/industrial (~50% of sales) is driving upside. GM of 65.2% was just ahead of mgmt’s LT target and expected up another 100bps Q/Q in F4Q. Investors would typically cheer such a solid upside result/ outlook; however, mgmt commentary concerning slowing auto orders could temper enthusiasm near term. In addition to MXIM, semiconductor auto bellwethers include NXPI, ADI, and TXN." (4/21/2017)

Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 1 Sell Rating, 7 Hold Ratings, 9 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.47)Consensus Price Target: $47.13 (4.49% upside)
