Just the FAQs
We’re here to help troubleshoot and solve any speed bumps you may encounter. We're available via chat Monday-Friday between 9 AM to 6 PM Pacific Standard Time. Outside of those times, we are pretty quick with  email.




Create your Joy Wedding










How much does Joy cost?
Joy is completely free to use for you and your guests.


What's the catch? How do you make money?
It may sound too good to be true, but it is. We promise! At this stage, our focus is to spread the word about Joy to become the core backbone of weddings around the world. We may, in the future, monetize via premium offerings and/or collaborations but rest assured, your data is safe and all current features of Joy are free. In the meantime, if you like what we do, the best thing you can do is tell someone who is getting married about Joy.


What do I need to open a Joy account?
You can create a Joy account using Facebook or Google. You can also create a Joy account using your email address.


How secure is this app?
You can choose whether your wedding website is guest-only or open. If your wedding website is guest-only, users will need to create an account to access your wedding information. Your personal data is always encrypted between the Joy app and our servers, as well as between different subsystems on Joy servers. In other words, Joy is really, really secure. Also, we will never sell your personal information. (We are good people.)


I already have a website. Can I just use the app?
Absolutely. Though Joy automatically creates a website for you when you enter all your wedding information, you don't have to use it or share it. When you invite people to use your app, you can choose to exclude sharing your website.


I just need a website and not an app.
You can use Joy to create your wedding website and not share the download links to install your app. When sending out your invites, you can choose whether or not to include links to download your app. However, if you want people to upload photos to your wedding or browse your guest list, you will only be able to do that with the app.


What devices does Joy support?
Joy wedding app is available on iOS and Android devices. Your website works perfectly on all modern web browsers and is also compatible with iOS and Android mobile browsers.




Do guests need to create an account to RSVP?
No. Your guests do not have to create an account to RSVP. Creating an account is totally optional and the prompt comes after guests complete their RSVP. Creating an account and password lets guests easily update their RSVP answers at a later date and also allows them to like and comment on your photos in Moments.


Can I limit the number of +1s per guest?
Yes! You can limit the number of +1s per guest. The default number of +1s for a guest is 0. If you want to allow a person to RSVP for an additional guest, it's super easy! Simply select the number of additional guests from the dropdown menu on the +1 column. For example you can invite husband and wife, Michael and Alison, by giving Michael a +1 and sending him an invite. This allows him to RSVP for himself and Alison!


Can I pick and choose what to use?
Most definitely. We designed Joy to accommodate weddings of all shapes and sizes. You can remove any section of Joy that does not apply to your wedding. Don't have a wedding party? Simply remove it from your dashboard and it will automatically be removed from your website and app. You've discovered Joy and just want to use it to collect photos from your guests? Easy. Remove all the sections you don't want and Joy transforms into your simple wedding photo collection and sharing app.


How does Joy handle things when there is little to no cell or WiFi coverage?
We are working hard to make Joy work in remote areas without reception. Currently, guests will not get notifications or be able to upload photos to your timeline without a connection. In that case, we will let the user know that they should wait and upload photos at a later time.


Is Joy available in other languages?
Although couples all over the world can use and download Joy, it's only available in English. We are working hard to support other languages. If you would like to see your language supported, send us an email and let us know.


How do I get immediate help when I have a question?
If you can't find an answer here or on our product help section, you can reach us through our in-app chat. To access the chat, login into your account and click on the "?" on the lower right hand side of the screen. You'll always be talking to a real person. You can also send us an email at hello@withjoy.com.












            We're working hard to make sure your wedding is a special one. If you have any ideas on what we can do better, reach out and say hello.

Jesslyn & Daniel      By Lad & Lass




We’re here for you from will you to I do.
The free wedding website & app that does more.


Get Started


Have a question? Ask Joy










Before During And After
It's everything about your wedding in one place.








Create the perfect wedding website and app that makes sharing and coordinating all the details of your wedding a breeze. From managing your guests and RSVPs to capturing the joy of your special day for years to come - It's all here in one place.




























The Details
From your wedding schedule to hotel and shuttle listings - Let Joy organize it all for you and your guests.



Wedding Party
Showcase your wedding party and make it a joy for everyone to learn what makes your wedding party special.





Collect Photos
Collect the photos the photographer doesn't see. Joy lets all of your guests share the photos they capture on your private timeline, so you can see your wedding day from their perspective.



Questions & Answers
Create your own Questions and Answers to best communicate the common questions asked by your guests. Make it easy for guests to ask without needing to know your email address.





Guests and RSVPs
Create your guest list with Joy. Digitally collect mailing addresses, RSVPs and more. Assign +1s to guests to allow them to RSVP for themselves and guests they are bringing.



Control over who sees what
Joy gives you complete control over the privacy of your wedding. Choose which parts of your website is visible to everyone and what requires your wedding code for access.

























Print Matching Wedding Suites
 With the help of our friends at Elli, in a few clicks - instantly order beautifully printed invitations, save the dates, menus, itineraries and more that perfectly match your website and app. Watch The Video








Design the Perfect Announcement
From your perfect photo, font and colors to beautiful cover templates and backgrounds, Joy helps you share your story with style. And for the adventurous - access to code. 





















See it in action







Make your guests' lives easier. (And yours too.)
Raise your hand if you’ve misplaced a wedding invite or missed an RSVP deadline! Let’s make that a thing of the past. With Joy, inviting and organizing your guest list, communicating, and coordinating all your wedding details is a breeze.



See it in action





















Throw out those spreadsheets
Or import them! Keep all your guests and their information in a single place. Invite guests, send custom messages, and get responses—directly in Joy.


Get RSVPs On-Time (Finally)
Easily ask your guests about dietary restrictions, +1s, mailing addresses, and more. Responses are automatically stored. It’s easy to ask and simple to answer.




Automatically Notify Guests
Want to remind your guests to silence their phones or announce the cake-cutting? Send automatic and triggered notifications that let everybody know what’s happening when.


Multiple Admins
Add as many admins as you need to help manage your Joy wedding and update your schedule, guest list, content, and more.








People
Bring everyone closer together
Joy makes it fun for your family and friends to get to know each other even before the special day. Put names to faces - it's the the ultimate icebreaker. Your wedding comes to life with every photo, comment and like captured by family and friends into a beautiful visual timeline.













PHOTOS AND MEMORIES
Capture and preserve the moments your guests see
Relive your wedding from hundreds of points of views. It’s your personal wedding timeline that makes it fun for your guests to follow along. 



See it in action
















Photos
Capture the In-Betweens
Professional photographers take beautiful photos of key parts of the wedding. But you don’t want to miss the candid shots, like selfies on the dance floor! Joy lets all of your guests share the photos they capture on your private timeline, so you can see your wedding day from their perspective.


Timeline
Follow along
From a photo of your first kiss to Grandma and Grandpa’s love advice—your Moments timeline is the best way for everyone to watch your wedding unfold and be an intimate part of the journey.




Guestbook
A living guestbook
Joy offers a real, live place for your guests to share their love and well-wishes. Post messages directly to your moments timeline or attach them to photos. Send the author some love by commenting or tapping the ‘heart’ on any photo.


Slideshow
Live Slideshow
Joy's LiveShow mode lets you display the your timeline during the wedding so everybody can watch it unfold as it's happening. (Or for those who can't make it - it's a great way to watch from home.)

HAPPY PEOPLE




















Jacklyn & Jared
“My fiancé and I really love this app and we've been getting great feedback from our close friends and family. This is exactly what I wanted, I know anyone can easily just make an account on the Knot but I'm going to have friends and family coming in from all places and this helps so much.”
View Wedding



Bob & Cassie
“We really enjoyed the ability to connect our guests and their experiences with our own immediately after the wedding. It was great to see what they saw.”
View Wedding



Adam & Mary
“It was so fun seeing all my friends post on the app before the wedding. They posted details that they would have never shared on Instagram to their wider group - I got to see my friends arriving in town, getting ready for the wedding, and even pictures as they were walking in.”

Scott M.

“Thanks to Joy, I felt like the wedding started weeks before the actual ceremony. And as a member of the wedding party, it was so much fun to see the guests document their own pre-wedding festivities!”
