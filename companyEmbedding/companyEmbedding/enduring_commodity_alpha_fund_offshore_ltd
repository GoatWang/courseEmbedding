HedgeZ Fund Profile
































Numeric Absolute Return Fund
Offshore, Ltd.

















Fund Investment Objectives











                                        Numeric Absolute Return Fund Offshore, Ltd. (the Fund) is an equity-oriented fund that combines innovative and established alpha sources with dynamic beta exposures. The Fund is comprised of diversified, uncorrelated market-neutral security selection strategies and a dynamic model-driven asset allocation process investing in equities, bonds, and gold: 1) Diversified Market Neutral: This traditional value-with-a-catalyst market neutral component uses multi-faceted value plus information flow. 2) World Fundamental Statistical Arbitrage: This portfolio is a higher frequency trading strategy that attempts to earn alpha from the short-term reversal of individual stocks after adjusting price moves for changes in fundamentals. 3) Innovation Portfolio: This portfolio is comprised of eleven sleeves (as of 12/31/2013) that exploit Numeric's latest innovations and is designed to be uncorrelated with traditional quant concepts. These sleeves range from broad factor-based strategies to industry-specific portfolios. 4) Dynamic Beta: This portfolio generates returns of a diversified beta portfolio, but at a lower risk. The Fund targets 12% annual returns on average, after fees, over a full market cycle with an average volatility of 7%. The Fund is designed to provide positive absolute returns in all environments.  Given the product's long equity bias, the most difficult periods for the strategy will be when the market struggles significantly.
