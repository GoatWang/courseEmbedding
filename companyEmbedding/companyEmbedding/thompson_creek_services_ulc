Robert Baillieul | August 4, 2014 | More on:  MCP TC TCM








 




Thompson Creek Metals Company Inc (TSX: TCM)(NYSE: TC) is scheduled to report its quarterly earnings on Tuesday. After years of losses, things are finally starting to look up for the troubled miner. With the ramp-up of the company’s Mt. Milligan copper and gold mine, the company is poised to return to profitability.

Let’s take a look at what has been happening at the company over the past quarter and what we’re likely to see in the upcoming report.

Has Thompson Creek Metals finally turned the corner?
Molybdenum has been one of the few bright spots of the resource sector over the past few months. Prices have soared more than 30% for the year to date as production cuts began to crimp supplies. As any armchair mining analyst could tell you, higher spot rates have had a positive impact on Thompson Creek’s bottom line.
In recent months, Bay Street has been ratcheting up its expectations of its earnings, going from a $0.03 per share loss for the second quarter to a current $0.10 per share profit. For the full year, the street is looking for the company to earn about $0.28 per share, more than double the consensus estimate only 60 days ago. However, in spite of the company’s improving fundamentals, the stock has been relatively tame, up a meager 7% over the past three months.
While Thompson Creek Metals is known for molybdenum, the company is transforming into a more diversified miner. The company’s second-quarter results showed the transition, as Mt. Milligan produced more than 29,700 dry tonnes of copper-gold-silver concentrate. With mining production expected to ramp up through the rest of the year and 2015, it should continue to post stellar earnings growth.
The key question for investors is how much Mt. Milligan will affect the company’s production mix. Given that the mine has 2.1 billion pounds of copper reserves and management has sold off streaming interests to more than 50% of its gold production, it’s evident that copper will drive the bulk of the company’s earnings in the near future. Eventually, Thompson Creek Metals is likely to join Molycorp Minerals Canada ULC  (TSX: NEM)(NYSE: MCP) in having molybdenum make up only a small portion of its overall revenue stream.
In Thompson Creek’s upcoming report, watch for the miner to give its latest update on Mt. Milligan’s development and plans for further production increases. Investors will also want to get a sense for what management plans to do as payments from the mine’s production start rolling in. Shareholders should expect that executives will use the proceeds to pay down debt and shore up its balance sheet, but they may have other plans.

NEW! This Stock Could Be Like Buying Amazon In 1997

For only the 5th time in over 14 years, Motley Fool co-founder David Gardner just issued a Buy Recommendation on this recent Canadian IPO. 
Stock Advisor Canada’s Chief Investment Adviser, Iain Butler, also recommended this company back in March – and it’s already up a whopping 57%!

This Recent “Buy” Alert Is Already Up 235% -- But It’s Not
Too Late To Get In! -- Click Here To Find Out More!

 




Why are over 15,130 well-positioned and in-the-know Canadian investors all counting down to two very specific days this month at 4 p.m.?

It has to do with an amazingly telling profit signal we’ve come to call a “Ground Floor Event” (even though it’s completely unrelated to an IPO)…
And one that’s made a few lucky investors who’ve paid close attention to under-the-radar events like these gains of 832%... 5,480%... and even 7,902% over the past 5 to 10 years. 
You can join the roughly 0.03% of Canadians who’ve already positioned themselves to capitalize on this next “Ground Floor Event” – but you must act soon…

Thompson Creek did a great job.


                The Thompson Creek crew was professional and quick. We had 17 windows and 3 doors replaced and they were done in two days.The windows and doors are excellent. We have a quieter house, with no drafts. The windows and doors close securely, and work easily.We are very happy with the Thompson Creek Window Company.

Here is the reason I did not give a 5 …


                Here is the reason I did not give a 5 rating. The day of installation they showed up and the door and side panels were wrong. I would have been aggravated if someone had called me the day before and told me that there had been a mistake. I was really aggravated when they were in my driveway and no one at Thompson Creek knew about the error. It seems like it would be a good idea to check what is being sent to a customer rather than have the customer discover the error. I was in a time crunch and needed this done before I left for vacation. In all fairness, TCWC did get the right product and did get it installed in time, so I was grateful, but a bit harried. As a final point, it may help to have some PR training for the installers. I was standing in my driveway looking at the wrong item, aggravated, and thinking I would have to cancel my vacation because I could not leave my house without the front door. There were 2 installers. One was on the phone trying to resolve the issue and the other was complaining to me about how far they had driven that morning and the fact that that they had a long ride back. Obviously, I did not care how far they had driven.

Instruction on use operation of windows


                Our only complaint was that our job lasted until late in the day, and the demonstration on use and care of Windows was very rushed.  When I called after a few days, they sent out a technician to go over details! Overall we were very pleased and love our new windows.

Patio Door Lock Broken, After One Month


                The technicians were very professional. The lead on my project was very professional and helpful. However; I've had my doors for a month and already the lock is broken or one of my patio doors. My problem with Thompson Creek is their turnaround time to come back and repair/replace  the lock on the patio door. They cannot get anyone to come out for three weeks. I think thist is terrible; fortunately, the top lock is working. The person taking my call thought that was enough and that I could wait.

                I was very please with the service from start to finish. I love my door. Just wanted to know what they cleaned the glass with because my  glass has not been that clean since. Everyone was professional and I did not feel I was taken advantage of. Will contact again in a heartbeat if I need anything else done.

                Thompson Creek installed 3 outer doors for us.  They brought samples for us to choose the doors we wanted, showed us how the doors would appear on our house and measured each door to make sure they would fit properly.  The doors were installed as promised with the help of their project coordinator.  The installers were very neat, efficient and cleaned up behind themselves, even wiping up any residue left from the installation.  We were also given small repair containers of the paint color of the doors.  Thompsons Creek has also installed the hooded oversized gutters and downspouts and come back yearly to make sure everything is good to go and do any maintaince if needed.   Yes I would absolutely give them 5 stars.

Very professional installation of 10 …


                Very professional installation of 10 windows and front door in one day. Employees covered the furniture and floors in work area before work began. Did a great job cleaning up after the job was done. After installation, was shown operation of windows and screens. Would recommend Thompson Creek for anyone looking for replacement windows. The job was done on a cold day of winter and felt the difference right away. We can now open the curtains to let in light and not have the cold air in.

                Thompson Creek came in and installed our new windows quickly and professionally.  Cleaned up as they went along.  I believe my house was cleaner after they left than before they came.  Very professional, good job and great windows.

BBB Reports On









Licensing









                        Licensing information is provided in the BBB Business Profiles to inform the public about industries that may require professional licensing, bonding, or registration. Better Business Bureau encourages you to check with the appropriate agency to be certain any requirements are currently being met.
                    





Advertising Review









                        BBB promotes truth in advertising by contacting advertisers whose claims conflict with the BBB Code of Advertising.  These claims come to our attention from our internal review of advertising, consumer complaints and competitor challenges.  BBB asks advertisers to substantiate their claims, change ads to make offers more clear to consumers, and remove misleading or deceptive statements.
                    





Government Actions









                        BBB reports on known significant government actions involving the business's marketplace conduct.
                    





Out of Business









                        BBB reports on a company that is out of business for three years from the date the company closes its doors or ceases to do business.
                    





Misuse of Better Business Bureau Name/Logo









                        BBB reports on unauthorized use of the Better Business Bureau's name and/or logo for as long as the business continues to use it in any advertising, or for one year after the business ceases any repeated unauthorized uses.
                    





Bankruptcy









                        BBB reports on a business’s bankruptcy as long as the business remains in bankruptcy.

BBB Rating System Overview














Customer Review Rating:









                        The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business.
                        The Customer Review Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive,
                        neutral, and negative reviews posted.

Composite Score:





                        Thompson Creek Window Company has received 4.06 out of 5 stars based on 7 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.

Best Customer Service! 



 







Candy, from Arlington, VA had the Thompson Creek Gutter System installed on her home.  She will never have to worry about clogged gutters again! 
She said they “picked Thompson Creek due to their customer service years ago, and we have used them for other things and don’t even look elsewhere.”
When asked where she was most satisfied, she replied “Customer Service.  By far, hands down was the best customer service.  I will not use anyone else because of their customer service was so great.”
