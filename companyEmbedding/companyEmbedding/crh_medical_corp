Fact Sheet



 
CRH Medical Corporation is poised for growth. Initially a one-product company focused on the CRH O’Regan System for hemorrhoid treatment, we’ve now expanded to servicing the gastroenterology community (one that we’ve built solid relationships with), with CRH Anesthesia Management.
Over the years, there has been a significant rise in the use of anesthesiology assisted endoscopy.
Right now, there is a large but fragmented GI anesthesia market in the U.S. and with 25 million endoscopies being performed nationwide annually, there is significant opportunity for consolidation.
CRH has established strong relationships with 2,000 GIs across the country, creating a large platform from which to leverage.
The Office of Inspector General released an opinion in 2012 indicating that GI practices who utilize anesthesia groups owned by the associated GIs and service only their practice violate self-referral laws.
Today, we’ve trained just over 1,700 of the more than 8,000 gastroenterologists in the United States – and we’re quickly training more, making this the ideal time to invest in a company poised for substantial growth.
Today, 15 million patients receive colonoscopies each year in the U.S., and around 20% are found to have hemorrhoids – creating 3 million potential recipients of the CRH O’Regan System.
With patients typically needing 2-3 treatments and CRH receiving $65 per treatment, the revenue potential is high.
CRH is covered by most insurance and much easier and less invasive than other treatment methods, meaning it’s great for patients, too.

CRH Medical Corporation
CRH has spent years servicing the GI community through the CRH O’Regan System, a platform that provides GI’s with a turn-key business for the treatment of hemorrhoids. With that background, we were interested in what other innovative solutions we could bring our partners. Through consultation with key opinion leaders, and a comprehensive analysis of the GI market, we determined that anesthesia services was an ideal fit for our corporate strategy. We entered into the anesthesia services business in December 2014 with the acquisition of one of the largest providers of anesthesia services to gastroenterologists in the U.S.
The end of 2015 marked our first full year of our new anesthesia services line of business, and we were encouraged to have experienced substantial growth as we engaged both existing and new GI partners.
Anesthesia services for endoscopic procedures is a large and growing market. The use of anesthesia during these procedures (as opposed to moderate sedation), has several advantages for both the patient, physician, and the ambulatory surgery center. As part of the effort to increase preventative healthcare in the U.S., the use of anesthesia during endoscopic procedures has grown from roughly 15% in 2003 to over 50% in 2015.
One of the most common endoscopic procedures is colonoscopy, which is considered the gold standard for colorectal cancer screening and detection and the mainstay of most GI practices. Major initiatives in the US, such as 80% by 2018 aim to increase the number of adults over 50 who are regularly screened for colorectal cancer, leading to an increasing number of procedures performed nationwide. CRH is now at the forefront by providing high quality anesthesia services for both colonoscopies and other endoscopic procedures.
Our model of partnering with GI practices and acquiring all or majority control in their anesthesia business has proven successful. CRH Medical’s solid reputation in the GI community makes a partnership in anesthesia a natural progression for a GI practice. We will continue to leverage the trust and goodwill we have developed over the past several years to consolidate the GI anesthesia services space. Our ability to expand this footprint is greatly aided by the competitive advantage we have built through our long history as a trusted partner to GI’s.
It is becoming increasingly apparent that our CRH O’Regan trained GI’s represent a natural conduit for engagement, and ultimately acquisition growth for our anesthesia services business. This is reinforced by the fact that the majority of the anesthesia acquisitions completed to date, have with existing O’Regan customers.
Ensuring our existing operations perform efficiently and that our physician partners receive a high level of service is key to maintaining strong relationships and a sustainable business. Our pipeline of practices showing an interest in partnering with CRH continues to grow, and our willingness to find a structure that works for all parties has resonated with the GI community.
We believe we are emerging as a leading service provider of anesthesia services within the GI community. Our mandate is to continue to grow in a sustainable and accretive way and we will keep all of our stakeholders informed as we progress with our strategy.

CRH Medical: Serving Patients Since 2000
Founded in 2000, CRH Medical Corporation is dedicated to providing compassionate care and informative educational resources to patients. 
Back in 2002, we first encountered what is now known as the CRH O’Regan System, and immediately saw its potential for improving life for the millions of people who suffer from hemorrhoids.
We began training doctors across the United States to offer this patented, FDA-approved procedure in 2008, allowing us to make this important treatment available to people across the country. Today, hundreds of physicians’ offices offer the CRH solution, with thousands of patients getting complete relief from their hemorrhoids each year.
 
Leadership Team 
CRH Medical Corporation is led by an experienced, passionate team of executives:
Edward Wright, Chief Executive Officer
Mr. Wright joined CRH in 2006 after an extensive career in the luxury retail and wholesale sectors, most recently as the Executive Vice President of Retail in North America for Cartier. His background includes considerable success in developing and operating the North American divisions of some of the world’s leading luxury brands. Today, Mr. Wright is proud to bring his leadership and vision to a team dedicated to improving life for millions of Americans.
 
Richard Bear, Chief Financial Officer
Mr. Bear has served as one of our officers since March 2006. Prior to CRH, he served as first the Vice President, Finance and then the Chief Financial Officer of ID Biomedical Corporation. He received his degree in Business Administration from the University of Washington and is a Certified Public Accountant (CPA).
 
Mitchel Guttenplan, MD, FACS, Medical Director
