Hard Money Lender in Queens, Brooklyn, Bronx, SI, Manhattan

 Manhattan  Bridge Capital specializes in hard money loans to professional real estate  investors, focusing on three types of properties:

                

Loans to finance purchases and repairs for  the purpose of quick sales (also knows as fix and flip)

                In addition,  we request, as  added collateral, the equity  position of the borrower’s principals in the borrower.
                We will lend up to 65% of the appraised  value of asset collateral. We have never had a loan default.

Services
Hard Money Lender in Queens, Brooklyn, Bronx, SI, Manhattan

 Manhattan  Bridge Capital specializes in hard money loans to professional real estate  investors, focusing on three types of properties:

                

Loans to finance purchases and repairs for  the purpose of quick sales (also knows as fix and flip)
 Loans for new construction of one to three  family homes
 Bridge loans to purchase small income  producing properties


                  Loans  typically range from $100,000 to $2,000,000, and mature in less than one year. 
                  Borrowers  are required to pay interest only on a monthly basis and the principal at maturity. 
                  We insist on a first mortgage position and personal guarantees from the principals of the borrower.
                In addition,  we request, as  added collateral, the equity  position of the borrower’s principals in the borrower.
                We will lend up to 65% of the appraised  value of asset collateral. We have never had a loan default.

Manhattan Bridge Capital, Inc. Announces Payment Of An Increased Quarterly $0.1025 Per Share Dividend






LOAN Named Top 10 REIT at Dividend Channel With 8.21% Yield













Manhattan Bridge Capital Named Top Dividend Stock With Insider Buying and 8.12% Yield (LOAN)
In this series, we look through the most recent Dividend Channel ''DividendRank'' report, and then we cherry pick only those companies that have experienced insider buying within the past six months. The officers and directors of a company tend to have a unique insider's view of the business, and presumably the only reason an insider would choose to take their hard-earned cash and use it to buy stock in the open market, is that they expect to make money — maybe they find the stock very undervalued, or maybe they see exciting progress within the company, or maybe both.

HIGH RISK INVESTMENT WARNING:

                End-users of the NetDania software that make use of the trading integration features as direct clients of integrated brokers, should be aware of the level of risk carried by trading in financial markets. Trading foreign exchange and or other financial instruments on margin carries a high level of risk, and may not be suitable for all investors. The high degree of leverage can work against you as well as for you. Before deciding to invest you should carefully consider your investment objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a loss of some or more of your initial investment, and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with trading, and seek advice from your broker and or an independent financial advisor if you have any doubts. Anyone opening a live trading account needs to adhere to the laws of their local country as such laws may differ from country to country.

Manhattan Bridge Capital, Inc. Company Profile

   Manhattan Bridge Capital (formerly DAG Media) knew that when it came to a bridge it had to cross it. In 2008 it renamed itself when its DAG Funding Solutions commercial lending subsidiary, which the company started in 2007, became its most profitable unit. The company offers short-term, secured, commercial loans to small businesses. It also offers an online service, Nextyellow.com, that lets consumers search for a product or service. The consumer's request is matched with appropriate businesses, and the matched businesses then call or email the customer. Vendor partners pay the company monthly fees to be featured in the matching process.

Manhattan Bridge Capital, Inc. Revenue and Financial Data

   Manhattan Bridge Capital (formerly DAG Media) knew that when it came to a bridge it had to cross it. In 2008 it renamed itself when its DAG Funding Solutions commercial lending subsidiary, which the company started in 2007, became its most profitable unit. The company offers short-term, secured, commercial loans to small businesses. It also offers an online service, Nextyellow.com, that lets consumers search for a product or service. The consumer's request is matched with appropriate businesses, and the matched businesses then call or email the customer. Vendor partners pay the company monthly fees to be featured in the matching process.
