Home About Daniel 
				Stern Lighting Products
Tech
Automotive Lighting 
				FAQ NHTSA 
				Alert!
 
Products!
Lots of lights, bulbs, and prices 
				below. But first:







How do I buy?Where's the shopping 
				cart...?


 There isn't 
				one. 

Send me an email and I'll be happy to get your 
needs handled. Ordering isn't hard; I accept credit cards and various 
other forms of money, and we'll discuss it once we've worked out your order.
Why do I do it this way? Because choosing automotive lighting 
				devices and bulbs is a good bit more 
				complex than it might seem, and a great 
				deal more complex than some vendors would 
				have you believe. Prewrap, one-for-all 
				offerings generally don't give results as 
				satisfactory as solutions specifically put 
				together for your needs on 
				your vehicles under your 
				driving conditions. Often, the products 
				you want because you've seen them, heard 
				or read about them, are in fact not the 
				ones that'll do the best job of 
				accomplishing your actual lighting 
				goals.  So, I've opted to carry on 
				providing personal, one-on-one 
				consultation ("How can I help 
				you?) rather than installing a shopping 
				cart ("Gimme yer money and get outta 
				my face!"). Old-fashioned? A little 
				slower? Yep, especially if you're 
				experienced and knowledgeable, and I 
				realize that. But, I really feel my 
				enviable reputation for customer 
				satisfaction is worth it. If you don't 
				agree, you may choose to shop elsewhere, 
				and that's OK. But if you agree with me, 
				please feel free to 
send me an email ( tech@danielsternlighting.com )and I'll be happy to get your 
needs handled.




					Important Notes  
				All products below are clearly marked as 
				to their regulatory-approval status. All 
				products are sold and intended only for 
				legal uses. Anybody selling headlamps who 
				doesn't tell you this (and answer your

Shipping is available at any 
service level offered by any common carrier—FedEx ground is 
standard to US addresses, Postal shipping to Canadian addresses. On 
orders under $100, please specify if a signature is required for 
delivery. On orders over $100, signature is mandatory. 
Returns 
are accepted within 30 days of merchandise delivery only with
				prior approval, and only on unused, 
				uninstalled items in original 
				packaging. A restocking fee (20% within 20 days; 30% within 30 days) will apply, unless the return is due 
				to an error on our part. Most special orders are non-returnable. Bulb returns 
				cannot be accepted. If an item
is received in damaged or faulty condition, please keep hold of all packaging 
and alert us immediately; we will work with you and the shipping carrier 
to make it right. Items returned as defective may be replaced or
				the appropriate refund may be issued, at 
				our option.

							enquire.
  

H1 bulbs These 
					single-filament bulbs are for 
					low-beam headlamps, high-beam 
					headlamps, auxiliary fog and 
					driving lamps. Fun facts: The H1 
					was the world's first-ever halogen 
					automotive bulb, and may well be 
					the most widely used type 
					worldwide. It was introduced in 
					Europe in 1962, and immediately 
					revolutionized car lighting and 
					roadway safety with its compact 
					size and high output. It was 
					finally legalized in the US...in 
					1997, three and a half decades 
					later! 
55W Narva or Flösser Plus+30:

55W Narva or Flösser Plus+50 
						$15.59/ea 
 100W Narva or Flösser: 
						$17.59/ea 
 About +30 & +50 Bulbs:
						"+30" and "+50" bulbs are standard-wattage items with higher filament luminance and tighter filament focus. They give better headlight performance than standard bulbs, with an attendant shorter bulb lifespan. They have colourless clear glass so all the filament's light reaches the road. There is no significant difference to be found among bulbs of any given type made by the reputable makers (Philips/Narva, Osram, Tungsram/GE, Fl?sser, in no particular order).  
  H2 
						bulbs These 
						single-filament bulbs are 
						primarily found in 
						auxiliary fog and driving 
						lamps, though there have 
						been a few low-beam and a 
						few high-beam headlamps 
						over the years that used 
						them.

							$11.59/ea 
100W Narva or Flösser:

H3 bulbs These 
						single-filament bulbs are 
						primarily used in 
						auxiliary fog and driving 
						lamps, but they've also 
						been used in some 
						headlamps, such as certain 
						variants of the Marchal 
						Amplilux. Fun Facts: The 
						H3 was the world's first 
						transverse-filament 
						halogen car bulb, 
						introduced in 1966. The 
						transverse filament and 
						short focal length 
						facilitated the design of 
						certain kinds of lamps 
						that were difficult or 
						impossible to make with 
						axial-filament bulbs. H3 
						was legalized in the US in 
						1997, thirty-one years 
						after its European 
						introduction.

    H4 
						bulbs These 
						2-filament bulbs with P43t 
						base are for high/low beam 
						headlamps and Cibie 
						BiOscar fog/drive beam 
						lamps. Fun facts: The H4 
						was the world's first 
						2-filament halogen 
						automotive bulb. It was 
						introduced in Europe in 
						1971, and was used in many 
						millions of European and 
						Japanese headlamps 
						starting in that year, but 
						wasn't legalized in the US 
						(where it was designated 
						HB2 or 9003) until over 
						two decades later, in 
						1992!

							bulbs are found in 
							the low beams, 
							high beams and fog 
							lamps of many 
							European and 
							Japanese vehicles 
							made since the 
							1990s. Fun Fact: 
							The H7, introduced 
							in 1993, was the 
							first new halogen 
							headlamp bulb 
							design 
							type-approved to 
							Europe's Regulation 
							37 in twenty 
							years. It touched 
							off a wave of 
							research and 
							development that 
							saw a dozen new 
							halogen bulb types 
							introduced over 
							the next 15 
							years. 
65W 
								Osram 
								Ultra High 
								Output 
								(2100 
								lumen, H9 
								burner on 
								H7 base, 
								race and 
								special-purpose 
								use): 
								

 
							This bulb is no longer manufactured.
All stocks have been exhausted (there are some 
poor-quality counterfeits flushing around, but those don't count) and the 
proposed alternatives are not equivalent. Notably, the 80w bulbs run too 
hot and draw too much current to be safely used in most headlamps. I am 
working on new availability of 
these bulbs from a proven German manufacturer, but there's no timeline yet. For now, the 
best H7—which will work safely in any H7 lamp—is this one.
