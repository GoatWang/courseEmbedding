Products[edit]




ASML’s corporate headquarters in Veldhoven


The photolithography machines manufactured by ASML are used in the production of computer chips. In these machines, patterns are optically imaged onto a silicon wafer that is covered with a film of light-sensitive material (photoresist). This procedure is repeated dozens of times on a single wafer. The photoresist is then further processed to create the actual electronic circuits on the silicon. The optical imaging that ASML's machines deal with is used in the fabrication of nearly all integrated circuits, and as of 2010, ASML has 67 percent of the worldwide sales of lithography machines,[2] with the competition consisting of Ultratech, Canon and Nikon.
Immersion lithography[edit]
As of 2011, their high-end Twinscan NXT:1950i system is used for producing features down to 32 nanometres (and outlook for 22 nm) at up to 200 wafers per hour,[3] using a water immersion lens and an argon fluoride laser that produces light at a wavelength of 193 nm. As of 2011, an average lithography machine costs 27 million euros.[4]
EUV lithography[edit]
ASML manufactures extreme ultraviolet lithography machines that produce 13.5 nm wavelength light. A high-energy laser is focused on microscopic droplets of molten tin to produce a plasma, which emits EUV light. In 2009, the IMEC research center in Belgium produced the world’s first functional 22 nm CMOS SRAM memory cells with a prototype EUV lithography machine.[5] Series-produced (non-prototype) EUV machines were shipped in 2011.[4]
Other[edit]
In addition to immersion-based lithography and EUV lithography, ASML has a substantial intellectual property portfolio covering imprint lithography.[6]
Company[edit]
ASML’s corporate headquarters is in Veldhoven, Netherlands. It is also the location for research, development, manufacturing and assembly. ASML has a worldwide customer base and over sixty service points in sixteen countries. The company is listed on both the AEX and NASDAQ Stock Exchanges, as ASML.
The company (originally named ASM Lithography)[7] was founded in 1984 as a joint venture between the Dutch companies Advanced Semiconductor Materials International (ASMI) and Philips. Nowadays it is a public company with only a minority of the shares owned by Philips.[8] When the company became independent in 1988, it was decided that changing the name was not desirable, and the abbreviation ASML became the official company name.[9] In 2000, ASML acquired the Silicon Valley Group (SVG), a US lithography equipment manufacturer, in a bid to supply 193 nm scanners to Intel Corp.[10][11]
ASML is subject to cyclical industrial dynamics. For example, at the end of 2008, ASML experienced a large drop in sales, which led management to cut the workforce by about 1000 worldwide—mostly contract workers[12]—and to apply for support from the Dutch national unemployment fund to prevent even larger layoffs .[13] Two and a half years later, ASML expected a record-high revenue.[14]
In July 2012, Intel announced a deal to invest $4.1 billion into ASML in exchange for 15% ownership, in order to speed up the transition from 300 mm to 450 mm wafers and further development of EUV lithography.[15][16] This deal is without exclusive rights to future ASML products and, as of July 2012, ASML is offering another 10% of the shares to other companies.[17] In November 2013, ASML paused development of 450-mm lithography equipment, citing uncertain timing of chipmaker demand.[18] As part of their EUV strategy, ASML announced the acquisition of DUV and EUV sources manufacturer Cymer in October 2012.[19] In June 2016, ASML announced their plans to acquire Taiwan-based Hermes Microvision Inc. for about $3.1 billion to add technology for creating smaller and more advanced semiconductors.[20]

For example, at the end of 2008, ASML experienced a large drop in sales, which led management to cut the workforce by about 1000 worldwide—mostly contract workers[12]—and to apply for support from the Dutch national unemployment fund to prevent even larger layoffs .[13] Two and a half years later, ASML expected a record-high revenue.[14]
In July 2012, Intel announced a deal to invest $4.1 billion into ASML in exchange for 15% ownership, in order to speed up the transition from 300 mm to 450 mm wafers and further development of EUV lithography.[15][16] This deal is without exclusive rights to future ASML products and, as of July 2012, ASML is offering another 10% of the shares to other companies.[17] In November 2013, ASML paused development of 450-mm lithography equipment, citing uncertain timing of chipmaker demand.[18] As part of their EUV strategy, ASML announced the acquisition of DUV and EUV sources manufacturer Cymer in October 2012.[19] In June 2016, ASML announced their plans to acquire Taiwan-based Hermes Microvision Inc. for about $3.1 billion to add technology for creating smaller and more advanced semiconductors.[20]

ASML`s Holistic Lithography integrates a set of products that enables chip makers to develop, optimize and control the production process at the 7/5 nanometer (nm) logic and 16 nm DRAM nodes.With process nodes continuing to shrink, ASML`s TWINSCAN NXE:3400B EUV lithography system offers the resolution that chip makers need for the most critical layers of a chip, while the new TWINSCAN NXT:2000i DUV immersion system features several hardware innovations, such as redesigned leveling and alignment sensors. This enables DUV/EUV cross-matching on-product overlay of 2.5 nm that addresses a mix-and-match production environment for the most advanced nodes. The lithography systems are complemented by ASML`s new YieldStar 375F metrology system, featuring new optics technology that generates more accurate metrology data faster to support our patterning control loop. Additionally, Hermes Microvision (HMI), which was acquired by ASML last year, expects to ship the new HMI eP5 e-beam metrology system later this year. This system features higher resolution and larger field of view electron optics technology that supports OPC model calibration and pattern fidelity metrology."While each product brings independent value to the chip manufacturing process, their true strength lies with working together as part of a well-integrated patterning ecosystem," said Martin van den Brink, ASML President and Chief Technology Officer. "Our Holistic Lithography products generate fast, accurate and continuous data that chip makers use to drive improved overlay and imaging performance, ultimately enabling the production of affordable semiconductor chips well into single digit process nodes."The TWINSCAN NXE:3400B and YieldStar 375F are currently shipping to logic and memory customers worldwide. The HMI eP5 is expected to ship in the second half of this year. The TWINSCAN NXT:2000i has an ongoing early access program that includes key hardware innovations as field upgrades. The first TWINSCAN NXT:2000i that is completely built in our factory is expected to ship in 2018.

ASML Holding N.V., incorporated on October 3, 1994, is a holding company. The Company is a manufacturer of chip-making equipment. The Company is engaged in the development, production, marketing, selling and servicing of semiconductor equipment systems, consisting of lithography systems. The Company's products include systems, and installed base products and services. The Company's principal operations are in the Netherlands, the United States and Asia. Its subsidiaries include ASML Netherlands B.V., ASML Systems B.V., ASML Hong Kong Ltd. and ASML US Inc.SystemsThe Company offers TWINSCAN systems, equipped with lithography system with a mercury lamp as light source (i-line), Krypton Fluoride (KrF) and Argon Fluoride (ArF) light sources for 300 millimeter processing wafers for manufacturing environments for which imaging at a small resolution is required. TWINSCAN systems also include immersion lithography systems (TWINSCAN immersion systems). The TWINSCAN NXT platform enables semiconductors through the multiple patterning (MPT), which requires two or more exposures per layer on a chip, enabling imaging patterns and lines by using its TWINSCAN NXT planar wafer stage and grid metrology. The Company also offers NXE systems, which are equipped with extreme ultraviolet (EUV) light source technology.The Company's lithography system product portfolio includes TWINSCAN Deep Ultra Violet (DUV) Systems, such as TWINSCAN XT:400, TWINSCAN XT:800, TWINSCAN XT:860 and TWINSCAN XT:1460, and TWINSCAN EUV Systems, such as NXE:3300, NXE:3350 and NXE:3400. The Company's Mature Products and Services (MPS) business refurbishes PAS 5500 and TWINSCAN lithography equipment, and offers associated services. As of December 31, 2016, the Company's PAS 5500 product family included wafer steppers, and Step and Scan systems equipped with i-line, KrF and ArF light sources for processing wafers of up to 200 millimeters in diameter.Installed base products and servicesThe Company develops and sells a range of product options and enhancements to its systems. The Company complements its scanner products with a holistic lithography portfolio of software and metrology products. Its computational lithography products capture knowledge of scanner design and real performance, which enables its systems to predict real-life manufacturing performance. The Company's computational lithography portfolio consists of both traditional products, as well as solutions that directly interface with various calibration controls in its scanner.

ASML announces Holistic Lithography product suite for the 7/5 nanometer node at SEMICON West

Link to Press Release.pdf



 SAN FRANCISCO, United States, 10 July 2017 - ASML Holding NV (ASML) today announced lithography, metrology and software innovations at SEMICON West. ASML's Holistic Lithography integrates a set of products that enables chip makers to develop, optimize and control the production process at the 7/5 nanometer (nm) logic and 16 nm DRAM nodes.With process nodes continuing to shrink, ASML's TWINSCAN NXE:3400B EUV lithography system offers the resolution that chip makers need for the most critical layers of a chip, while the new TWINSCAN NXT:2000i DUV immersion system features several hardware innovations, such as redesigned leveling and alignment sensors. This enables DUV/EUV cross-matching on-product overlay of 2.5 nm that addresses a mix-and-match production environment for the most advanced nodes. The lithography systems are complemented by ASML's new YieldStar 375F metrology system, featuring new optics technology that generates more accurate metrology data faster to support our patterning control loop. Additionally, Hermes Microvision (HMI), which was acquired by ASML last year, expects to ship the new HMI eP5 e-beam metrology system later this year. This system features higher resolution and larger field of view electron optics technology that supports OPC model calibration and pattern fidelity metrology. "While each product brings independent value to the chip manufacturing process, their true strength lies with working together as part of a well-integrated patterning ecosystem," said Martin van den Brink, ASML President and Chief Technology Officer. "Our Holistic Lithography products generate fast, accurate and continuous data that chip makers use to drive improved overlay and imaging performance, ultimately enabling the production of affordable semiconductor chips well into single digit process nodes." The TWINSCAN NXE:3400B and YieldStar 375F are currently shipping to logic and memory customers worldwide. The HMI eP5 is expected to ship in the second half of this year. The TWINSCAN NXT:2000i has an ongoing early access program that includes key hardware innovations as field upgrades. The first TWINSCAN NXT:2000i that is completely built in our factory is expected to ship in 2018.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Products[edit]




ASML’s corporate headquarters in Veldhoven


The photolithography machines manufactured by ASML are used in the production of computer chips. In these machines, patterns are optically imaged onto a silicon wafer that is covered with a film of light-sensitive material (photoresist). This procedure is repeated dozens of times on a single wafer. The photoresist is then further processed to create the actual electronic circuits on the silicon. The optical imaging that ASML's machines deal with is used in the fabrication of nearly all integrated circuits, and as of 2010, ASML has 67 percent of the worldwide sales of lithography machines,[2] with the competition consisting of Ultratech, Canon and Nikon.
Immersion lithography[edit]
As of 2011, their high-end Twinscan NXT:1950i system is used for producing features down to 32 nanometres (and outlook for 22 nm) at up to 200 wafers per hour,[3] using a water immersion lens and an argon fluoride laser that produces light at a wavelength of 193 nm. As of 2011, an average lithography machine costs 27 million euros.[4]
EUV lithography[edit]
ASML manufactures extreme ultraviolet lithography machines that produce 13.5 nm wavelength light. A high-energy laser is focused on microscopic droplets of molten tin to produce a plasma, which emits EUV light. In 2009, the IMEC research center in Belgium produced the world’s first functional 22 nm CMOS SRAM memory cells with a prototype EUV lithography machine.[5] Series-produced (non-prototype) EUV machines were shipped in 2011.[4]
Other[edit]
In addition to immersion-based lithography and EUV lithography, ASML has a substantial intellectual property portfolio covering imprint lithography.[6]
Company[edit]
ASML’s corporate headquarters is in Veldhoven, Netherlands. It is also the location for research, development, manufacturing and assembly. ASML has a worldwide customer base and over sixty service points in sixteen countries. The company is listed on both the AEX and NASDAQ Stock Exchanges, as ASML.
The company (originally named ASM Lithography)[7] was founded in 1984 as a joint venture between the Dutch companies Advanced Semiconductor Materials International (ASMI) and Philips. Nowadays it is a public company with only a minority of the shares owned by Philips.[8] When the company became independent in 1988, it was decided that changing the name was not desirable, and the abbreviation ASML became the official company name.[9] In 2000, ASML acquired the Silicon Valley Group (SVG), a US lithography equipment manufacturer, in a bid to supply 193 nm scanners to Intel Corp.[10][11]
ASML is subject to cyclical industrial dynamics. For example, at the end of 2008, ASML experienced a large drop in sales, which led management to cut the workforce by about 1000 worldwide—mostly contract workers[12]—and to apply for support from the Dutch national unemployment fund to prevent even larger layoffs .[13] Two and a half years later, ASML expected a record-high revenue.[14]
In July 2012, Intel announced a deal to invest $4.1 billion into ASML in exchange for 15% ownership, in order to speed up the transition from 300 mm to 450 mm wafers and further development of EUV lithography.[15][16] This deal is without exclusive rights to future ASML products and, as of July 2012, ASML is offering another 10% of the shares to other companies.[17] In November 2013, ASML paused development of 450-mm lithography equipment, citing uncertain timing of chipmaker demand.[18] As part of their EUV strategy, ASML announced the acquisition of DUV and EUV sources manufacturer Cymer in October 2012.[19] In June 2016, ASML announced their plans to acquire Taiwan-based Hermes Microvision Inc. for about $3.1 billion to add technology for creating smaller and more advanced semiconductors.[20]

ASML is a Dutch company and currently the largest supplier in the world of photolithography systems for the semiconductor industry. The company manufactures machines for the production of integrated circuits (ICs), such as CPUs, DRAM memory, flash memory. The company is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.[1]

Products[edit]




ASML’s corporate headquarters in Veldhoven


The photolithography machines manufactured by ASML are used in the production of computer chips. In these machines, patterns are optically imaged onto a silicon wafer that is covered with a film of light-sensitive material (photoresist). This procedure is repeated dozens of times on a single wafer. The photoresist is then further processed to create the actual electronic circuits on the silicon. The optical imaging that ASML's machines deal with is used in the fabrication of nearly all integrated circuits, and as of 2010, ASML has 67 percent of the worldwide sales of lithography machines,[2] with the competition consisting of Ultratech, Canon and Nikon.
Immersion lithography[edit]
As of 2011, their high-end Twinscan NXT:1950i system is used for producing features down to 32 nanometres (and outlook for 22 nm) at up to 200 wafers per hour,[3] using a water immersion lens and an argon fluoride laser that produces light at a wavelength of 193 nm. As of 2011, an average lithography machine costs 27 million euros.[4]
EUV lithography[edit]
ASML manufactures extreme ultraviolet lithography machines that produce 13.5 nm wavelength light. A high-energy laser is focused on microscopic droplets of molten tin to produce a plasma, which emits EUV light. In 2009, the IMEC research center in Belgium produced the world’s first functional 22 nm CMOS SRAM memory cells with a prototype EUV lithography machine.[5] Series-produced (non-prototype) EUV machines were shipped in 2011.[4]
Other[edit]
In addition to immersion-based lithography and EUV lithography, ASML has a substantial intellectual property portfolio covering imprint lithography.[6]
Company[edit]
ASML’s corporate headquarters is in Veldhoven, Netherlands. It is also the location for research, development, manufacturing and assembly. ASML has a worldwide customer base and over sixty service points in sixteen countries. The company is listed on both the AEX and NASDAQ Stock Exchanges, as ASML.
The company (originally named ASM Lithography)[7] was founded in 1984 as a joint venture between the Dutch companies Advanced Semiconductor Materials International (ASMI) and Philips. Nowadays it is a public company with only a minority of the shares owned by Philips.[8] When the company became independent in 1988, it was decided that changing the name was not desirable, and the abbreviation ASML became the official company name.[9] In 2000, ASML acquired the Silicon Valley Group (SVG), a US lithography equipment manufacturer, in a bid to supply 193 nm scanners to Intel Corp.[10][11]
ASML is subject to cyclical industrial dynamics. For example, at the end of 2008, ASML experienced a large drop in sales, which led management to cut the workforce by about 1000 worldwide—mostly contract workers[12]—and to apply for support from the Dutch national unemployment fund to prevent even larger layoffs .[13] Two and a half years later, ASML expected a record-high revenue.[14]
In July 2012, Intel announced a deal to invest $4.1 billion into ASML in exchange for 15% ownership, in order to speed up the transition from 300 mm to 450 mm wafers and further development of EUV lithography.[15][16] This deal is without exclusive rights to future ASML products and, as of July 2012, ASML is offering another 10% of the shares to other companies.[17] In November 2013, ASML paused development of 450-mm lithography equipment, citing uncertain timing of chipmaker demand.[18] As part of their EUV strategy, ASML announced the acquisition of DUV and EUV sources manufacturer Cymer in October 2012.[19] In June 2016, ASML announced their plans to acquire Taiwan-based Hermes Microvision Inc. for about $3.1 billion to add technology for creating smaller and more advanced semiconductors.[20]
