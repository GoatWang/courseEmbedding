Dr. Swett's Root Beer was originated by Dr. George W. Swett (1834-1924).
He owned two large wholesale and retail pharmacies in the 1800's, one in
Boston and the other in New York City. His root beer was first sold in
little packets of dry ingredients, and as a fountain drink in his pharmacies;
then it was shipped to other pharmacies as a syrup to be mixed with soda
water; and later it was pre-mixed and sold in bottles. It was not fermented,
and contained no alcohol. Starting in the late 1800's, Dr. Swett's Root
Beer was available throughout the United States. It was produced by franchised
bottling companies until the 1950's.
1834. George W. Swett was born in October 1834 in St. Stephen, Charlotte
County, New Brunswick, Canada, son of Nathaniel Swett and Amelia L. Hall.
[Compiled from Stackpole's Swett Genealogy, the 1851 St. Stephen Census,
the 1900 Boston Census, and his death certificate] St. Stephen is just
across the international boundary (St. Croix River) from Calais, Washington
County, Maine.
1845. Many examples of company advertising state that Dr. Swett's Root
Beer was established in 1845 when he was 11 years old, and although this
claim has not been proved, it seems likely that he was experimenting with
various concoctions when he was a boy and perhaps even selling something
like root beer.
1858. His death notice says George W. Swett graduated from New York
University in 1858, but I have not been able to confirm it. The 1900 Boston
Census states that he immigrated to the United States in 1860.
1860. On 18 February 1860 he was presented with a beautiful silver-plated
ornamental goblet at the Boston Music Hall. [auctioned on eBay, photo sent

The Gift of Fortune

He was listed in the 1859-60 Boston directory, occupation "botanic medicine,"
living at 106 Hanover Street. The business directory includes a large ad
for the New England Botanic Depot at the same address. [Boston Directory

Directory Of The Citizens, And A Business Directory,sent by Tom Cardaropoli,
2006]


1862. George W. Swett married Ella. E. Harding 25 September 1862 in
Boston. [LDS International Genealogy Index]
1866. The Bureau of Internal Revenue was created in 1862 to collect
stamp taxes and internal duties. The next year it administered the nation's
first income tax. It also issued Revenue Stamps. These were legal tender
notes not backed by specie. The 4 cent Private Die Medicine Stamp advertising
"Dr. J. W. Poland's White Pine Compound" for sale by "Dr. G. W. Swett,
Boston, Mass." was printed and in use from 1866 to 1879. [Eric Johnson,
Revenue Stamps]


Dr. Swett published a brochure entitled "The Illuminated White Pine
Alphabet" about 1867. It is 5 inches wide, 6 3/4 inches high, and has 16
pages plus the paper covers for a total of 20 pages. [Auctioned on eBay]
It looks like a book intended for children. The cover shows a woman reading
to children. One page has the alphabet in capital letters and small-case
letters. Eight pages have letters of the alphabet (each letter is accompanied
by a drawing and a poem) -- but the entire brochure is advertising for
patent medicines sold by The New England Botanic Depot.


One example of the "alphabet" pages in this brochure will suffice.


The following paragraphs are condensed extracts of the advertising in
this brochure. I have omitted the testimonials by satisfied customers and
endorsements by physicians. The price for each of these four medicines
was one dollar per bottle or six bottles for five dollars. All four medicines
were prepared at the New England Botanic Depot, 106 Hanover Street, Boston,
Mass., under the supervision of Geo. W. Swett, M.D., Proprietor.
Dr. J. W. Poland's White Pine Compound, the great New England
remedy, cures sore throat, colds, cough, diphtheria, bronchitis, spitting
of blood, and pulmonary affections generally. It is a remarkable remedy
for kidney complaints, diabetes, difficulty in voiding urine, bleeding
from the kidneys and bladder, gravel, and other complaints.
Dr. J. W. Poland's Humor Doctor, an invaluable medicine for purifying
the blood, is a positive remedy for all kinds of humors, particularly erysipelas,
nettle rash, scrofula, salt-rheum, carbuncles, boils and piles, ulcers
and all obstinate affections of the skin; inflammatory or chronic rheumatism,
chronic diarrhea, mercurial diseases, and every taint of the system; dyspepsia,
and those affections originating in the derangement of the digestive organs,
viz.: bilious complaints, neuralgia, and nervous affections, headache,
languor, and depression of spirits, loss of appetite, constipation.
Fellow's Worm Lozenges are a remarkable power in expelling worms, with
pleasant taste and perfect safety. They contain no mercury, no mineral,
no turpentine, no oil of wormseed, no poison, nothing injurious. They are
entirely vegetable, and prepared with great care from the concentrated
extracts of two plants. They do not act as a purgative or emetic, will
not debilitate, and are so simple an infant may devour a whole box without
harm, and will at the same time expel the worms in an extraordinary manner.
Removes the Long Thread Worm, the Maw or Threadworm, the Long Round Worm,
and the Long Tape Worm (each type of worm is briefly described).
Dr. Geo. W. Swett's Female Strengthening Cordial, a specific remedy
for diseases of the reproductive organs, imparts tone and vigor to the
uterus, and gives renewed vitality to the whole system. All cases of debility
peculiar to females will find a sovereign remedy in this compound. The
following affections are among those for which it is peculiarly adapted,
-- painful menstrual discharges, suppression of the menses, profuse menstruation,
leucorrhoea or whites, ulcerated uterus, &c.
It is worth noting that "The Illuminated White Pine Alphabet" doesn't mention
root beer. Of course, Dr. Swett may have been selling such a drink at that
time, and perhaps calling it something other than root beer.
This drawing is from a black-and-white edition of "The Illuminated White
Pine Alphabet" published about 1870.


1876. Hires Root Beer made its debut in 1876 at the U. S. Centennial
Exposition in Philadelphia, along with Alexander Graham Bell's telephone,
the Remington typewriter, and Heinz Ketchup. At that time, Charles Elmer
Hires (1851-1937) was a young pharmacist in Philadelphia. There are several
legends about when and how he discovered or invented his formula for "Hires
Herb Tea" as early as 1866 (when he was 15 years old). All of these legends
are questionable, but he did obtain a patent for "Hires Root Beer" during
or prior to 1876.
This seems to be the one point in the Hires story on which
all parties seem to agree: marketing it as "beer" instead of a "tea" was
a key to its success. [Eileen Bennett, article in The Press of Atlantic
City, New Jersey, 28 June 1998]
Hires began selling his root beer at the 1876 Philadelphia Centennial
Exposition in tiny packages that contained the various herbs, barks, and
berries. You still had to boil these ingredients, strain the mixture, add
the correct amount of sugar and yeast, ferment the brew, and then bottle.
But you didn't have to collect the ingredients, and buying the ingredients
in one package was cheaper than buying all the ingredients separately.
The pre-mixed ingredients were primarily sold to housewives, but were also
marketed to druggists and soda fountains. [History of Hires, © 2000,
2001, Soda Museum, LLC. Used by permission.]
The Hires Root Beer Co. lost the patent for the name "root beer" in
1879. That's when Congress passed a law stating that no word in the dictionary
could be registered -- a law that was repealed in 1920. [Eileen Bennett,
article in The Press of Atlantic City, New Jersey, 28 June 1998]
1880. The 1880 Boston Census has George W. Swett, wholesale druggist, and
his wife Ella, living with her parents, Lemon and Elizabeth Harding. [National

George W. Swett & Co., Wholesale and Retail Druggists, No.
29 Park Row
An important business in this city is that conducted by George W. Swett
& Co., as wholesale and retail dealers in drugs. The business dates
its inception from 1836 and controls a trade which, already large, is constantly
increasing. The establishment is conducted as a branch of the New England
Botanic Depot of Boston. The firm is composed of Messrs. George W. Swett,
M.D., and Alfred B. Mitchell, the latter gentleman conducting the New York
business. The building occupied is large and well adapted for the business,
and contains a very full and complete line of drugs, chemicals, medicines,
etc. Special attention is given to the selection of medicinal roots, herbs,
barks, leaves and flowers, and physicians' prescriptions are accurately
compounded of the best materials. A specialty is also made of natural mineral
waters, the establishment being provided with a splendid fountain. The
trade is both wholesale and retail. Messrs. Swett and Mitchell are both
active business men and their success is but the outgrowth of untiring
energy, perseverance and strict integrity. [New York's Great Industries.

1888. Dr. Swett's Root Beer was advertised by trading cards showing men
and women tennis players in rather comic poses. I have three different
pictures, and have heard there may have been as many as six. Each card
is a little over 5 by 3 1/4 inches. On the front of each card, in the lower
left corner, in very small print, is the notice: "Copyright 1888 by the
Buffords Sons Lith. Co."




On the back of each card is a poem that will never take a prize for
poetry but does establish the fact that Dr. Swett's Root Beer was sold
on draught at the New England Botanic Depot in 1888. Note that it doesn't
say anything about selling ready-to-drink root beer in bottles, and the
implication that Dr. Swett's Root Beer was previously known as Dr. Swett's
Excelsior Beer.

Another type of trading card has a picture of a small white dog sitting
up with a toy rifle leaning against its shoulder. This card measures 3
inches wide by 4 & 1/2 inches tall. The back of these cards has a list
of the ingredients. (I have replaced the text with Photoshop because it
was so faded that it didn't scan well.)


The statement "material put up by the gallon or barrel" indicates that
distribution of a liquid concentrate (syrup) had replaced the packets of
dry ingredients. Use of the word "temperance" dates this trading card no
earlier than 1873 and no later than 1919. The Women's Christian Temperance
Union (WCTU) developed out of the Women's Temperance Crusade of 1873. During
this campaign, women church members went into saloons, sang hymns, prayed,
and asked the saloonkeepers to stop selling liquor. The Temperance Crusade
swept over 23 states, and resulted in the closing of thousands of places
that sold liquor throughout the nation. The WCTU grew rapidly, and its
influence increased with its growth. It worked through schools, churches,
and other groups, toward the total prohibition of alcoholic beverages.
1890. The Boston Directory for 1890 has: George W. Swett, drugs and
medicines, 245 Washington Street, Boston, 28 Worchester Square, Boston,
and 29 Park Row, New York.
The liquid concentrate (syrup) was mixed with soda water at drugstores
and soda fountains. This stoneware syrup dispenser would be readily available
behind the counter, and can probably be dated to about 1890.


Waitresses brought the root beer to customers seated at tables. This
tin tray is 4 inches in diameter, just large enough to carry one mug of
root beer and receive a tip for the waitress. [Photo by Morphy Auctions,
from the collection of Bob Averill]


This Dr. Swett's Root Beer pottery mug was found in a Rockville, Connecticut,
dump that was closed in 1910. It was found under 10 feet of debris. [auctioned
on eBay] Although it can only be positively dated as "no later than 1910,"
it probably was made about 1890.


1892. William Painter, a Baltimore machine shop operator, was awarded
a patent on the crown-cork bottle seal, an invention that quickly became
a standard for the industry and replaced over a thousand different types
of bottle sealing devices in use at the time. [The Museum of Beverage Containers
and Advertising, Soda Bottle History] Someone started calling the crimped
metal crown-corks "bottle-caps" and the name stuck.
The ready-to-drink version of Dr. Swett's Root Beer was sold in earthenware
(also called stoneware or ceramic) bottles, probably before 1892, because
I have two of them with wire-clamp cork retainers instead of bottle-caps.
Precise dating of these bottles is difficult. I keep hoping to find one
that has the date of manufacture on it. Their characteristic buff-colored
body and caramel-colored upper part identify them as Bristol-style bottles.
Bristol-style glazed bottles were developed by the Powell family
in Bristol, [England], in 1835. The texture of the ware was coarse to moderately
coarse. The ware was characterized by a buff-colored fabric and a clear,
glossy glaze. The upper part of the vessel was dipped in iron oxide glaze,
producing a caramel color. [Southern Methodist University Archaeology Laboratory,
Ceramics Database]

Bristol-style bottles were widely used until the late 1870's. Thereafter,
they were gradually replaced by glass bottles, but they were still being
used in England in the 1920's. The label on Dr. Swett's earthenware bottles
is simply black lines and lettering -- an oval within an oval, with the
words "Dr. Swett's original root beer, registered, Boston, Mass., contents
8 fluid ounces."
1893. The ready-to-drink version of Hires Root Beer was sold in bottles
in 1893. [Eileen Bennett, article in The Press of Atlantic City, New Jersey,
28 June 1998]
As shown by the back of this three-inch diameter celluloid mirror, Dr.
Swett's Root Beer was sold in earthenware bottles with bottle caps. Because
company advertising said it was established in 1845, the statement "Over
fifty years on the market" indicates that these bottles with bottle caps
should be dated after 1895.


1900. The 1900 Boston Census has George W. Swett, physician, widower,
born October 1834 in Canada, age 65, living in the home of his widowed
sister Emma A. Waldron at 579 Columbia Road. [National Archives: U. S.
Census, 1 June 1900, Massachusetts, Suffolk, Boston, Enumeration District
1453, Microfilm Roll # 686]
1903. The first successful automatic bottle blowing machine was put
in operation by its inventor, Michael J. Owens, an employee of Libby Glass
Company. By 1910, the new machines were producing over 57,000 bottles a
day, a dramatic improvement over the 1500 bottles per day produced by hand
a few years earlier. [The Museum of Beverage Containers and Advertising,
Soda Bottle History]
1906. Congress passed the first Pure Food and Drug Act in 1906, including
provisions that were intended to stop the fraudulent advertising of patent
medicines and require open disclosure of their ingredients, because so
many patent medicines included drugs such as opium, cocaine, and arsenic.
Dr. George W. Swett was 72 years old at that time and had sold patent medicines
since 1860, so some response from him to the passage of these laws might
be expected. The following four-page brochure can be dated about 1906 because
it includes the statement: "This [Root Beer] will stand the test of all
the pure food laws in existence."


This is the earliest example I have seen of the motto "From Childhood
to Old Age" and the logo of a shadowy old man in the background drinking
from a glass, with a young boy in the foreground holding a glass and looking
at you. The claim: "On the market sixty years" is part of the legend that
Dr. Swett created his root beer in 1845 when he was 11 years old.

Reasons Why You Should
Drink Dr. Swett's Original
ROOT BEER
Made from the juices of such beneficial berries, barks, roots
and herbs as Checkerberry, Sweet Birch, Sassafras, Sarsaparilla, Spikenard,
Juniper, Wintergreen, Ginger and Hops.
Beer made from this extract is in every respect the most refreshing
and beneficial drink of its kind manufactured. Its medicinal properties
render it exceedingly valuable in any disorder of the Stomach, Liver and
Kidneys, a free use of it keeping those important organs in a healthy condition.
This Root Beer was first offered to the public of Boston more than 60
years ago; each year adds to its popularity and reputation for being the
purest and most healthful of all temperance drinks.
The medicinal properties of these roots and herbs are perhaps not generally
known.
The medicinal properties of the ingredients from which this extract
is made are given on the last page of this folder.
The statement "This Root Beer was first offered to the public of Boston
more than 60 years ago" is highly questionable, even if he did create it
in 1845, because the 1900 Census states that he immigrated to the United
States in 1860.

"How It Was Found"


The above was the heading of an article published in the Boston
Post and will
especially interest those who in childhood had their thirst
quenched by home made Root Beer.
A half century and more ago a little youngster roamed the Massachusetts
hills with an odd fancy for collecting herbs and carrying them home to
his mother.
Sometimes his patient mother insisted that the herbs might be of doubtful
origin, but the little fellow always insisted that they may be cooked up
into some sort of brew that would be better even than the one he had the
last time.
Every day he went farther into the hills, and once in a long time he
came upon a new thing that seemed a savory bit to add to his brew. He knew
the home of all the checkerberries, and when they grew ripest. He could
tell the shadowy little hill where the sassafras grew, and the pleasure
to be derived from digging into the soil for the red-brown roots.
He found the dandelion with its fuzzy yellow top, and it came under
his eye for the herb brew. And the juniper held its special charm. All
these went into the little basket that the youngster carried under his
arm, and it wasn't very long until the mother found that she was becoming
almost as much interested in the "root beer" as the little boy.
It wasn't long before it was more than an experiment, and the neighbors
from far and wide recounted the beverage that little George Swett had found
out himself in the woods.
Of course there were many village people who indulged in these quiet
mixtures of the hills, but they were most of them for medicinal use, and
not one of them had the sharp refreshing taste that the little boy's had.
This is the story of the beginning of Swett's root beer, and one would
almost say, after hearing it first hand from the kindly old doctor, that
there is a flavor of all the wood plants in it. Elsewhere there may be
rivals in the field, but New England is faithful to Dr. Swett. He has never
advertised greatly, and the others have perhaps outstripped him in the
race for notoriety in the West, but in his native country the herb brew
that contains the essence of his boyhood days is still the favorite.
When the youngster grew up he went to college, and then with a liking
for medicine, graduated in New York as a physician.
Dr. Swett said yesterday, in talking of the beverage, "This will stand
the test of all the pure food laws in existence," and at the factory one
may get a glimpse of Dr. Swett himself overseeing things, and still looking
after the oldest root beer in existence.
He wasn't born or raised in Massachusetts, and I have found no evidence
that he graduated in New York as a physician, but the legend of "How It
Was Found" apparently was told by Dr. Swett himself. Of course, there was
no law that required open disclosure of one's personal background -- and
patent medicine salesmen were famous for concocting legends as well as
medicines.
The last page of this little brochure has drawings of eight plants,
with brief descriptions of their uses.
Hop Flowers have been commonly used as a tonic for the
nerves and have also been used in the treatment of Dyspepsia.
Spikenard is a New England plant and was much used by the Indians
and through them became a home remedy. It is a very pleasant aromatic stimulant
and helps digestion.
Birch bark depends for its activity on its volatile oil -- has
been largely used in domestic practice for its domestic properties. It
is also widely employed as a flavoring agent.
The bark of Sassafras Root is an aromatic stimulant and is used
as an adjuvant to other ingredients to improve their flavor and render
them most acceptable to the stomach
Checkerberry leaves, found throughout New England, have an aromatic
odor and taste due to the Volatile Oil of Wintergreen which they contain
and act as a mild stimulant.
Juniper is very valuable as a stimulant, stomachic and carminative,
also in mild forms of kidney affections. Juniper Berries are gently
stimulating and diuretic and like sassafras are largely used as adjuvants.
Wintergreen is a diuretic, acting mildly on the kidneys.
Sarsaparilla has a world-wide reputation and the American variety
which is used in this root beer is considered by many physicians to be
far superior to the imported variety. "It is an excellent blood purifier."

None of the above are so pronounced as to make it
disagreeable or suggest the taking of medicine.
The intention of the Doctor was to make a good,
healthful drink, agreeable to the taste
while quenching the thirst.

1906. This ad from the "Wonderland Souvenir Magazine" published by Walter
Jacob Music Company of Boston in 1906 shows a two-spigot version of a soda-fountain
dispenser. The right spigot was probably for the syrup and the left spigot
for the soda water.


1907. This ad appeared in the August 1907 issue of Everyday Housekeeping
magazine [sent by Christopher Weide]. Dr. Swett looks to be about 50 years
old, which was in 1884, so he apparently sent a younger picture of himself
for this ad in 1907. Also note that the same picture was used for the pottery
mug that was made about 1890 and the two-spigot soda fountain dispenser
in 1906.

1908. The Boston City Directories for 1908 to 1917 have Dr. George W.
Swett (Root Beer) at 87 Albany Street. There is no listing for the New
England Botanic Depot.

1918. The Boston City Directory for 1918 has Dr. Swett Root Beer Co.,
940-946 Columbus Ave., Sales 10 Post Office Square, Bottling Company 1169
Tremont; Archibald L. Stark president and Frederick E. Houghton treasurer
at 10 Post Office Square, Frederick W. Dunn secretary and manager at 940
Columbus Ave., William Y. Ireland treasurer at 1169 Tremont. These listings
continue to 1925.
1919. A&W Root Beer began in June 1919 in California.
1919. Dr. Swett's Root Beer was sold by the Tri-State Beverage Company,
El Paso, Texas, which was in business from 1919 to 1923. "These bottles
are quite unusual in that they are the only ceramic bottles known to have
carried the name of an El Paso firm. Ceramic bottles were much more common
in the 1830s - 1880 period, although they were still in use in England
in the 1920s. Label: under-glaze ink stamp (black). The bottle was marked
with a rubber inkpad stamp before it was glazed. The glaze became transparent
after firing, allowing the mark to be easily visible. Manufacturer: unknown.
Dating: 1919-1923." [Bill Lockhart, Dating Soft Drink Bottles © 2000]
Photographs show that these were Bristol-style bottles, identical to the
Dr. Swett's earthenware bottles sold elsewhere, except there was also a
label on the back -- a triangle within a triangle, with the words "Bottled
by Tri-State Beverage Co., El Paso, Tex."
Even though root beer was sold in bottles, draft root beer continued
to be popular at drugstores and soda-fountains. This dispenser seems to
have a pump for the syrup, and at the end of the pump-stroke, a button
to release the soda water. Because company advertising said Dr. Swett originated
his root beer in 1845, "On the market 75 years" indicates this dispenser
should be dated 1920. [Photo by Morphy Auctions, from the collection of
Bob Averill]


1920.  Prohibition. The Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution
of the United States (passed in 1919) prohibited the manufacture, import,
export and sale of alcoholic beverages. One of the results was a huge upsurge
in demand for non-alcoholic beverages such as root beer. Another result
was that many breweries bought franchises to produce non-alcoholic beverages.
1920. The Dr. Swett Root Beer Company of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania,
placed a full-page ad in the Philadelphia Record newspaper on 17 June 1920.
It shows a clear glass bottle with bottle-cap and paper lable. This is
the earliest example of Dr. Swett's Root Beer sold in glass bottles that
I have found. Apparently, paper lables have not survived on bottles, but
some of the lables have survived because they were never used (auctioned
on ebay).


1921. The Dr. Swett Root Beer Company of Portland, Maine, first appears
in the city directory of 1921 and disappears from the directories after
1928. The manager was John F. Crane, 60-62 Cross Street. Advertising states
that the company was incorporated in June 1900 and was the successor of
the C. E. Odiorne Bottling Company.
1924. George W. Swett died 12 March 1924 in Malden, Middlesex, Massachusetts.
His death certificate gives his age as 93 years, 21 days (born 20 February
1831), but the 1851 St. Stephen Census has him born in 1834, and the 1900
Boston Census states that he was born in October 1834. Thus he was 89 years
old when he died.

ORIGINATED ROOT BEER
Dr. George Washington Swett Had Been a Boston Pharmacist
Dr. George W. Swett, originator of the root beer named after him, and
a former Boston pharmacist, died yesterday at his home, 35 Williams street,
Malden. He was ninety-three years of age. Dr. Swett was born in St. Stephens,
N. B. He was graduated from New York University in 1858, and is believed
to have been the oldest alumnus of that institution. Later he came to Boston,
where he kept a drugstore on Washington street for many years. He retired
several years ago. His wife died some years ago. For two years he had made
his home in Malden. A sister, Mrs. Augusta Kimball, and a niece, Mrs. Fred
Thompson, both of Portland, Me., survive. [Death notice in The Boston
Evening Transcript, 16 March 1924]
A petition presented to the Probate Court in New Brunswick by his mother
in 1856 after his father died has George William Swett as one of
their sons, but his death notice has George Washington Swett. Additional
research has shown that he changed his middle name to "Washington" and
created the legend that he was born on the 99th anniversary of George Washington's
birthday.
1925. Dr. Swett Root Beer Inc., 940 Columbus Avenue, Roxbury, Massachusetts
[a suburb of Boston],  was incorporated in 1925 under new ownership:
George R. Dunham, president; Walter H. Foster, secretary; and Joseph J.
Hassett, treasurer. It was listed in the Boston City Directory every year
from 1926 to 1937. George R. Dunham was also treasurer and later president
of The Greenleaf Company, an advertising firm in Boston. [Thanks to his
grandson, Ben Dunham, for pointing me to these entries in the Boston City
Directories, by email in 2012.]
1925 May 16. This letter, typewritten on the letterhead of the Dr. Swett
Root Beer Company of Portland, Maine, lists offices in Boston, Chicago,
Philadelphia, Oakland, New Orleans and Montreal. The logo is still the
shadowy old man in the background and a young boy in the foreground. The
motto is "From Childhood to Old Age" and the claim is "On the market sixty
years" [originated 1865, which is reasonable and possibly accurate]. The
left margin has drawings and names of some of the herbs used in Dr. Swett's
Root Beer -- Hops, Birch, Sassafras Root, Wintergreen, Juniper and Checkerberry.

1928. In the Portland, Maine, directory of 1928, the Dirigo Bottling
Company is listed at 60-62 Cross Street, which was previously the location
of Dr. Swett Root Beer Company. [Portland Room, Portland Public Library]
Whether Dirigo continued to produce Dr. Swett's Root Beer is presently
unknown.
1929. The Great Depression. Many of the little companies that bottled
non-alcoholic beverages, pressed by competition from the breweries since
1920 and hit by the Depression in 1929, went out of business in 1929 or
shortly thereafter.
1932. The Baker and Malaspina Company of Danbury, Connecticut, was listed
in the city directory as a manufacturer of Dr. Swett's Root Beer (among
other beverages) from 1924 to 1932.
1934. The End of Prohibition. The 21st Amendment (passed in 1933) repealed
the 18th Amendment, thus permitting (again) the legal manufacture, import,
export and sale of alcoholic beverages. One result was that breweries went
back to making beer and stopped producing non-alcoholic beverages. Another
result was that demand for non-alcoholic beverages suddenly declined as
people went back to drinking beer.
1934. Applied Color Labeling (ACL) is a baked enamel process. Each color
is applied separately and then baked, so the cost of labeling is proportional
to the number of colors used, but total cost of manufacture is reduced
because ACL is mechanized. It is a benchmark for dating bottles because
it was developed in 1934.
1937. Dad's Old Fashioned Root Beer began about 1937 in Chicago (perhaps
as early as 1933).
1938. George R. Dunham and his associates sold the Dr. Swett Root Beer
Company to a group of four stockholders including Nelson Rockefeller. The
new owners retained the Boston facilities as Dr. Swett Root Beer Bottling
Company of Boston, Inc., but moved the headquarters to New York City.
1939. Franchises for Dr. Swett's Root Beer were advertised in the First
Annual Blue Book of the National Carbonators and Bottlers Association,
February 1939. This book contained detailed information on what was available
to the bottlers of soft drinks.


1940. Advertisement in the Second Annual Blue Book of the National Carbonators
and Bottlers Association, February 1940. Note the change of address from
Boston to Rockefeller Plaza, New York. Nelson Rockefeller was the main
shareholder in the new company.


The 1939 and 1940 advertisements in the National Carbonators Association
Blue Book show manufactured glass bottles with five rings at the shoulder,
bottle-caps, and paper labels. The logo of the shadowy old man and the
young boy remained unchanged.
1940. New logo. The next illustration is the top part of a one-page
advertising handout. A scanned copy of the entire page was sent to me by
Peter Hannon, who found it among his mother's souvenirs of the 1940 New
York World's Fair. The layout probably was based on the 1925 letterhead
-- the left margin has five drawings of herbs used in Dr. Swett's Root
Beer, each with a brief description of its medicinal properties. The modernized
logo is a middle-aged man and a boy drinking from glasses. The motto "From
Childhood to Old Age" is inside the top of the logo. I have copied the
text of the handout, because the type is too small to read online.



The hero of our story, and this is a true story, was born upon
a little farm near Calais, Maine, on February 22, 1831. He was christened
by his happy parents, George Washington Swett, for it was upon this same
date ninety-nine years earlier that his illustrious namesake, George Washington,
was born.


Strange though it may seem, the origin of this delicious and
refreshing beverage was largely due to the love of a small boy for his
Mother.
When this little fellow was but eleven years old his Mother was taken
ill, and the village doctor in this small, sparsely settled town prescribed
certain roots and herbs which were to be steeped or brewed and taken at
frequent intervals during the day. Her speedy recovery made such a strong
impression upon the boy's mind, that he determined to become more familiar
with the uses and beneficial properties of these roots and herbs with which
the nearby woods and fields abounded.
He acquired an almost uncanny knack for discovering their hiding places.
None knew so well as he where the checkerberries grew best or where to
dig for the choicest roots of the sassafras. At last, he was satisfied
that he had discovered the right combination and in a little store, fitted
up in a corner of his home, he brewed and dispensed his "Root Beer".
By the time he had finished with such schools as his native town afforded,
he had saved sufficient money to pay his way through college and he graduated
several years later from New York University as a full-fledged physician.
Pursuing his boyhood interest in botanical medicines, he made several
changes in his "Root Beer" until its formula was pronounced "perfect".
The fact that you can still obtain "DR. SWETT'S ORIGINAL ROOT BEER" which
he put on the market over sixty-eight years ago and which is made just
as Dr. Swett made it is absolute proof of its merit.

It would be interesting to know where the author got this legend in 1940.
George W. Swett was born "near" Calais, Maine (just across the St. Croix
River in Canada), but he wasn't born on 22 February 1831. His brother Sullivan
Clarke Swett was born on 26 April 1831. The statement "on the market over
sixty-eight years ago" (that is, before 1872) is reasonable because he
was a pharmacist in 1860.
1940. This 7 ounce, clear glass, machine-manufactured Dr. Swett's Root
Beer bottle has 3-1-0 embossed on the bottom, which probably means March
1, 1940. It has a narrow ring embossed around the neck, and five such rings
around the shoulder superimposed at three points 120 degrees apart by the
letter "S" in a circle. This particular bottle is probably a prototype,
because it is empty, the cap is in place and shows no sign of ever having
been removed, and the line on the back "bottled by" has nothing below it.
Interestingly enough, the cap still has the old Dr. Swett's logo. I also
have a 28 ounce bottle of identical design that was produced in April 1940
for the Dr. Swett's Root Beer Bottling Company of Philadelphia. These bottles
have red and yellow Applied Color Labeling: "Dr. Swett's Original Root
Beer" on the neck, the label, and the back. A circle at the top of the
label surrounds the new logo of a middle-aged man and a boy drinking from
glasses. Below the circle is a curved banner with the motto "From Childhood
to Old Age" (this motto is also on the back). The bottom of the label has
the words "America's Favorite Since 1845."



Dr. Swett's Original Root Beer
 [Statement advertising sale of these bottles to bottle collectors
about 1970]
Dr. Swett's Original Root Beer started about 1845 and was in business
to about 1890. The Diamond Ginger Ale Co. was the last known distributor
for Dr. Swett's Root Beer in 1890.
There are no records of what happened to the company, if he died or
what. Also, the formula was lost and not found until the late thirties
when Dr. Swett's Root Beer Co. was started again. There were four stock
holders in the new company. One was Dr. Gadey from whom this bottle was
acquired (he lost $60,000). Nelson Rockefeller was a stock holder with
over $100,000 invested.
They made the Dr. Swett's Root Beer and the new, modern bottle shown
here, until the outbreak of World War II put them out of business because
of the lack of sugar.
The new bottle, believe it or not, cost the company nearly a dollar
a piece. So, if a bottle starts off with a two cent deposit and is destroyed,
it costs the company nearly a dollar. At this rate a bottle had to be used
about 50 times before it started to make money for the company (drinks
sold at that time for five cents).
The bottlers had all these expensive bottles on hand but had no sugar
in which to make the root beer. Since they could not do business, they
wanted the money back for the bottles. So the Dr. Swett's Root Beer Co.,
trying to satisfy the bottlers, attempted to buy up the bottles. This caused
the company to go bankrupt. Then Rockefeller bought the other stock holders
out at his price and sold the company to Corn Products Co., thereby abolishing
the Dr. Swett's Root Beer Company.
The statement that Dr. Swett's Root Beer wasn't distributed after 1890
is false. Whoever wrote that didn't know what he was talking about. However,
I have no reason to doubt this description of what happened to the company
during World War II.
1942. The letter "S" logo was a trademark for Dr. Swett's Root Beer.
Filing date 26 February 1942. Registration date 4 August 1942. Status:
expired. Last listed owner Dr. Swett's Root Beer Co., Inc., New York, New
York. [Soda and Carbonated Beverage Trademarks 1940. Compiled by Digger
Odell 2004. www.bottlebooks.com]


The 1942 "S" bottle has the label "Dr. Swett's Early American Root Beer,
Rich In Dextose." The statement "rich in dextrose" was an attempt to make
a virtue out of necessity. During and for some time after World War II,
manufacturers of soft drinks couldn't get cane sugar or beet sugar, so
they used dextrose.
Dextrose is produced commercially by putting starch in water
mixed with dilute hydrochloric acid. When the starch-acid mixture is heated
under steam pressure in a converter, it changes to glucose. Glucose can
be purified and dried to fine granules called dextrose. Dextrose is not
as sweet as sucrose (common table sugar). [World Book Encyclopedia]
The sale of Dr. Swett's Root Beer Company to Corn Products Company is significant
because corn starch was one of their products.
1945. The Pilgrim Boy logo was the last renewal of trademark for Dr.
Swett's Root Beer. Application date 6 June 1945. Filing date 2 August 1945.
Registration date 22 October 1946. Status: expired. Last listed owner Dr.
Swett's Root Beer Co., Inc., New Jersey. [Soda and Carbonated Beverage
Trademarks 1940. Compiled by Digger Odell 2004. www.bottlebooks.com] Registration
No. 0424716. Prior Registrations No. 0379782, 0384646, 0396830. The application
states: "Used in another form, the mark DR. SWETT'S was first used by applicant's
predecessor in or about 1845." [U. S. Patent Office website]
1946. This 10 ounce bottle with red and yellow Applied Color Labeling
was manufactured 3 January 1946. The oval at the top of the label surrounds
a simplified drawing of a boy wearing a Pilgrim hat. The label has: "Dr.
Swett's Early American Root Beer. Rich in dextrose." The back has: "Dr.
Swett's. The famous root beer recipe of Dr. George Washington Swett has
been improved to make this pure delicious beverage. Rich in dextrose food-energy
sugar." Another 10 ounce bottle of the same design, manufactured 23 March
1946 by Rodgers Bottling Company, Vallejo, California, has yellow Applied
Color Labeling. (All the letters on the front label are transparent.) The
use of only one color was an obvious attempt to reduce costs.


Advertising artwork kept up with the times. This poster is 10 x 17 inches
and can be dated after 1945 because it has the Pilgrim Boy logo.


1948. The American Carbonator and Bottler magazine for September 1948
has a full-page ad by Dr. Swett's Root Beer Company, 17 Battery Place,
New York 4, N.Y. It shows a drawing of the bottle with the Pilgrim Boy
logo and the label "Dr. Swett's Early American Root Beer, Rich in Dextrose."
1949. Dr. Swett's Root Beer Company was sold to the O-So Grape Company
between September 1948 and March 1949. The American Carbonator and Bottler
magazine for March 1949 has a full-page ad with drawings of both bottles
and the statement "Now, since our recent acquisition of Dr. Swett's Root
Beer Co., bottlers of both lines find themselves in an exceptionally strong
position ..." The Dr. Swetts bottle is identical to the 1946-1948 bottles,
and the O-So Grape bottle also has "Rich in Dextrose" on the label. The
address of the combined company was 134 South LaSalle St., Chicago 3, Illinois.
1950. Origin of Dr. Swett's Early American Beverages. The American Carbonator
and Bottler magazine for September 1950 has a full-page ad with the heading
"One Name ... One Quality ... One Bottle ... Ten Flavors." It shows a drawing
of a bottle with the Pilgrim Boy logo and the label "Dr. Swett's Early
American Beverages." It doesn't list the flavors, and it doesn't mention
dextrose. The address is Dr. Swett's Root Beer Co., 1931 West 63rd, Chigago
36, Illinois.
1951. This ad in the American Carbonator and Bottler magazine for March
1951 is the latest known attempt to franchise Dr. Swett's Root Beer. It
sets the origin back to 1836, when he was two years old, and features a
photograph that may be him but has not been verified. Like the 1946-1949
ads, it has the bottle with the Pilgrim Boy logo and the label "Dr. Swett's
Early American Root Beer, Rich in Dextrose." The address is Dr. Swett's
Root Beer Co., 1931 West 63rd, Chigago 36, Illinois -- the same company
that originated Dr. Swett's Early American Beverages in 1950. They apparently
tried to revive Dr. Swett's Root Beer as a separate brand name and not
merely one of their ten flavors.
 
 




1953. A 10 ounce bottle embossed with the year 1953 has red and yellow
Applied Color Labeling: "Dr. Swett's Early American Beverage. Bottled under
authority of Dr. Swett's Root Beer Co., Chicago, Ill." It doesn't mention
dextrose. It has the Pilgrim boy, but the word "Beverage" means the contents
may not have been root beer. Another 10 ounce bottle, manufactured by Anchor
Hocking in 1953 for Dr. Swett's Beverages, Westbrook, Maine, has the Pilgrim
boy, and the cap has the old Dr. Swett's logo, but according to the seller,
the contents were orange soda.
1957. I have seen advertised for sale, but not fully described, a Dr.
Swett's Early American Beverage bottle dated 1957.
1959. The most recent example I have seen is a 10 ounce bottle embossed
with the year 1959. It has red and yellow Applied Color Labeling: "Dr.
Swett's Early American Beverage. Bottled under authority of Dr. Swett's
Root Beer Co., Chicago, Ill." It has the Pilgrim boy, but the contents
may not have been root beer.
1990. Trademark status for Dr. Swett's Root Beer: DEAD. Last listed
owner: Dr. Swett's Root Beer Co., Inc., New Jersey, Chicago. [U. S. Patent

DR. GEORGE W. SWETT (1834 - 1924)
Originator of Dr. Swett's Root Beer
Everett S. Stackpole's Swett Genealogy lists among the children of Stephen
Swett [#133] and Hannah Knight: "Nathaniel, b. 7 Feb. 1804; m. Amelia,
dau. of Capt. John Hall. Ch, George, Emma Amanda, Augusta who m. 24
Oct. 1866 James Reed Kimball, and Clark." [Emphasis added] The 1990
Boston Census shows Dr. George W. Swett living with his widowed sister
Emma A. Waldron, and his sister Augusta Kimball is mentioned in his death
notice.
1829. George W. Swett's parents were married in St. Stephen, Charlotte
County, New Brunswick, Canada.
Nathaniel Sweet of this Parish, Cabinet Maker, and Amelia Hall
of this Parish, Spinster, were married in the Parish by License with consent
of Parents and Guardians this 29th day of November 1829 by me [--] Thomson,
LLD, Rector. This marriage was solemnized between us, Nathaniel Swett and
Amelia Hall or Swett. In the presence of Joseph H. McAllister, Hugh Mackie.
Registered 27 June 1831. [RS 148 Charlotte Co., NB Records, page 327]
Notice that the Rector spelled their surname SWEET whereas they spelled
it SWETT. This pattern occurs many times.
1834. George W. Swett was born in October 1834 in St. Stephen, Charlotte
County, New Brunswick, Canada, son of Nathaniel Swett and Amelia L. Hall.
[Compiled from Stackpole's Swett Genealogy, the 1851 St. Stephen Census,
the 1900 Boston Census, and his death certificate] St. Stephen is just
across the international boundary (St. Croix River) from Calais, Washington
County, Maine.
1845. Many examples of company advertising state that Dr. Swett's Root
Beer was established in 1845, but this claim has not been proved, and it
seems unlikely that he established it when he was 11 years old.
1851. The 1851 Census for St. Stephen, Charlotte County, New Brunswick,
Canada [p. 62] has Nathaniel Sweet, aged 49, as head of a household consisting
of his wife Amelia (39) and their children: Clarke (20), George (17), Maria
(15), Amanda (10), Augusta (7), Charles M. (4) and Henry M. (2). This would
indicate that Nathaniel was born in 1802, but other records have his birth
in 1804, so "aged 49" is almost certainly a transcription error for "aged
47".
1855. Nathaniel Sweet died in October 1855, aged 51, in Milltown, just
a few miles up-river from St. Stephen, Charlotte, New Brunswick, Canada.
[Newspapers of New Brunswick, Vol. 15 #2398 HQ 14 November 1855] This shows
he was born in 1804.
1856. His widow's petition for administration of the estate of Nathaniel
Swett.
To the Honourable Harris Hatch LLB, Surrogate Judge of Probate
in the County of Charlotte in the Province of NB. The Petition of Amelia
Swett of the Parish of Saint Stephen in the said County of Charlotte, Widow,
Humbly Shewith: That Nathaniel Swett late of the Parish of Saint Stephen,
Cabinet Maker, departed this life on the 29th day of October in the year
of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifty five at the Parish of
Saint Stephen, without having, to the best of the knowledge and belief
of your Petitioner, made any will. That the said Nathaniel Swett immediately
before his death was inhabitant of the said county of Charlotte and that
he died seized or otherwise entitled to real estate of the value of 675
pounds in the said county and personal estate or other value of 125 pounds.
That the said Nathaniel Swett left a widow, namely your Petitioner, and
four sons Sullivan Clarke Swett, cabinet maker, George William Swett, Charles
Nathaniel Swett and Henry Franklin Swett, and three daughters namely Amelia
Maria, wife of Edgar McAlister, Emma Amanda Swett and Lucinda Augusta Swett.
Given surv[--] and that your Petitioner and the said children all reside
at Saint Stephen in the said county. Your Petitioner prays that letters
of administration of the estate and effect of the said Nathaniel Swett
may be granted to her in the form of [--] and [she] in duty bound will
[--]. Dated the sixth day of August, 1856.
To the Honourable Harris Hatch, Surrogate Judge of Probate in the County
of Charlotte. Whereas Nathaniel Swett late of Saint Stephen in the said
County of Charlotte departed this life intestate, I, Sullivan Clarke Swett
the oldest son and heir at law of the said Nathaniel Swett do hereby denounce
all right and title to administration on the said estate. [Provincial Archives
of New Brunswick; Probate Court Records -- Charlotte County]
1860. His death notice says that George W. Swett graduated from New York
University in 1858, but I have not been able to conform it. The 1900 Boston
Census states that he immigrated to the United States in 1860.
1860. He was a pharmacist in Boston in 1860. [The Boston Directory has
him living at 106 Hanover Street, occupation "botanic medicine" and the
Business Directory has a large ad for the "New England Botanic Depot, George
W. Swett, Wholesale Dealer of Eclectic & Botanic Medicines, Chemicals,
&c," at the same address.
1862. George W. Swett married Ella E. Harding 25 September 1862 in Boston
[LDS International Genealogy Index}. She was born in Massachusetts, probably
Boston, 1842-1843, daughter of Lemon P. and Elizabeth B. Harding. [1850
and 1860 Boston Census]
1870. Ella E. Harding, age 27, was living with her parents. No children
were listed. [1870 Boston Census]
1880. The 1880 Boston Census has:
Harding, Lemon, P., head of family, paper dealer, married,
age 64, born in Massachusetts [Vermont], father born in Vermont, mother
born in Massachusetts.
Harding, Elizabeth B., wife, keeping house, married, age 62, born in
Maine [Massachusetts], parents born in Maine.
Swett, Ella E., daughter, at home, married, age 31 [37], born in Massachusetts,
father born in Vermont, mother born in Massachusetts.
Swett, George W., son-in-law, wholesale druggist, married, age 40 [46],
born in Maine [New Brunswick, Canada], parents born in Maine.
Doane, Lilla E., daughter, at home, married, age 27 [31], born in Massachusetts,
parents born in Massachusetts.
Doane, Seth S., son-in-law, insurance broker, married, age 33, born
in Massachusetts.
[National Archives: U. S. Census, 1880, Massachusetts, Suffolk, Boston,
Film # T9-0057, p. 73D]
1885. George W. Swett & Co., Wholesale and Retail Druggists, 29 Park
Row, New York City, was a branch of the New England Botanic Depot of Boston.
"The firm is composed of Messrs. George W. Swett. M. D., and Alfred B.
Mitchell, the latter gentleman conducting the New York Business." [Edwards
& Critten, New York's Great Industries, Historical Publishing Company,
New York, 1885, p. 245]
1890. The Boston Directory for 1890 has George W. Swett, drugs and medicines,
245 Washington Street, Boston, 28 Worchester Square, Boston, and 29 Park
Row, New York.
1900. The 1900 Boston Census has, living at 579 Columbia Road:
Waldron, Emma A., head of family, housekeeper, widow, mother
of two living children, born August 1841 in Canada, age 58, father and
mother born in Maine, year of immigration to United States 1865, Naturalization
N/A.
Seitchfield, Walter D., son, electrician, married, born October 1869
in California, age 30, father born in Maine, mother born in Canada.
Seitchfield, Nathaniel A., son, traveling salesman, single, born October
1873 in California, age 26, father born in Maine, mother born in Canada.
Swett, George W., brother, physician, widower, born October 1834 in
Canada, age 65, father and mother born in Maine, year of immigration to
United States 1860, Naturalization N/A.
[National Archives: U. S. Census, 1 June 1900, Massachusetts, Suffolk,
Boston, Ward 20, Enumeration District 1453, Microfilm Roll # 686]
Note that George W. Swett and his sister Emma didn't have to be naturalized
when they immigrated to the United States. This probably means they were
considered U. S. citizens because their father and mother were born in
Maine and kept their U. S. citizenship while living just across the St.
Croix River in Canada.
1922. George W. Swett moved to Malden, Massachusetts, in 1922. [death
notice] He apparently lived alone.
1924. George W. Swett died 12 March 1924 in Malden, Middlesex, Massachusetts.
His death certificate gives his age as 93 years, 21 days (born 20 February
1831), but the 1851 St. Stephen Census has him born in 1834, and the 1900
Boston Census states that he was born in October 1834. Thus he was 89 years
old when he died.

Miss McLeod, the informant who provided information for his death certificate,
didn't know much about him. She gave a wrong birth date (20 February 1831)
from which his age at death was calculated, didn't know his wife's maiden
name, had the wrong maiden name for his mother, and said his parents were
born in England. All this goes to show that death certificates are not
necessarily accurate. However, she had his birth place, approximate birth
date, his father's name and his mother's first name. Together with the
St. Stephen, New Brunswick, records, that is enough to verify his parentage.

ORIGINATED ROOT BEER
Dr. George Washington Swett Had Been a Boston Pharmacist
Dr. George W. Swett, originator of the root beer named after him, and
a former Boston pharmacist, died yesterday at his home, 35 Williams street,
Malden. He was ninety-three years of age. Dr. Swett was born in St. Stephens,
N. B. He was graduated from New York University in 1858, and is believed
to have been the oldest alumnus of that institution. Later he came to Boston,
where he kept a drugstore on Washington street for many years. He retired
several years ago. His wife died some years ago. For two years he had made
his home in Malden. A sister, Mrs. Augusta Kimball, and a niece, Mrs. Fred
Thompson, both of Portland, Me., survive. [Death notice in The Boston
Evening Transcript, 16 March 1924]
The petition presented to the Probate Court in New Brunswick by his mother
in 1856 after his father died has George William Swett as one of
their sons, but his own death notice has George Washington Swett.
Additional research has shown that he changed his middle name to "Washington"
and concocted the legend that he was born on the 99th anniversary of George
Washington's birthday.
