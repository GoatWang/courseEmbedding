PINGDINGSHAN, China, April 5, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Yulong Eco-Materials Ltd. (NASDAQ:    YECO) ("Yulong" or the "Company"), a vertically integrated manufacturer of eco-friendly building products located in Henan Province, today announced that on March 31, 2017, the Company received a determination letter (the "Letter") from the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (the "NASDAQ") notifying the Company of the NASDAQ Staff's determination (the "Determination") to delist the Company's securities from The NASDAQ Capital Market due to its failure to regain compliance with Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) (the "Rule") because it had not filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended June 30, and Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-Q for the periods ended September 30, and December 31, 2016, respectively (the "Delinquent Reports"). Pursuant to the Letter, unless the Company requests an appeal of the Determination by 4:00 Eastern Time on April 7, 2017, trading of the Company's common stock will be suspended at the opening of business on April 11, 2017, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), causing the Company's securities to be removed from listing and registration on The NASDAQ Stock Market.








On October 14 and November 22, 2016, the Company received two notification letters (the "Notice") from NASDAQ advising the Company that it did not comply with the "Rule" because it had not filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended June 30, and Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-Q for the periods ended September 30, and December 31, 2016, respectively. The Company was provided an exception until April 12, 2017, to regain compliance with the Rule. On March 24, 2017, the Company advised that it would be unable to regain compliance with the Rule by April 12, 2017. As of the date of this press release, the Company has not regained compliance with the Rule though it is in the process of preparing its annual report. 
The Company intends to evaluate available options to resolve the deficiency and regain compliance with the Rule. The Company currently intends to request a hearing before a Hearings Panel (the "Panel"). Such a request will stay the suspension of the Company's securities and the filing of the Form 25-NSE pending the Panel's decision. At the hearing, the Company intends to present a plan to regain compliance with the Rule and request that the Panel allow the Company additional time within which to regain compliance. While the Company believes that it will be able to present a viable plan to regain compliance, there can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company's request for a suspension of delisting or continued listing on NASDAQ.

Comment Guidelines
 

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

I Agree

(YECO) ("Yulong" or the "Company"), a vertically integrated manufacturer of eco-friendly building products located in Henan Province, today announced that on March 31, 2017, the Company received a determination letter (the "Letter") from the NASDAQ Stock Market LLC (the "NASDAQ") notifying the Company of the NASDAQ Staff's determination (the "Determination") to delist the Company's securities from The NASDAQ Capital Market due to its failure to regain compliance with Listing Rule 5250(c)(1) (the "Rule") because it had not filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended June 30, and Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-Q for the periods ended September 30, and December 31, 2016, respectively (the "Delinquent Reports"). Pursuant to the Letter, unless the Company requests an appeal of the Determination by 4:00 Eastern Time on April 7, 2017, trading of the Company's common stock will be suspended at the opening of business on April 11, 2017, and a Form 25-NSE will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), causing the Company's securities to be removed from listing and registration on The NASDAQ Stock Market.On October 14 and November 22, 2016, the Company received two notification letters (the "Notice") from NASDAQ advising the Company that it did not comply with the "Rule" because it had not filed its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the period ended June 30, and Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-Q for the periods ended September 30, and December 31, 2016, respectively. The Company was provided an exception until April 12, 2017, to regain compliance with the Rule. On March 24, 2017, the Company advised that it would be unable to regain compliance with the Rule by April 12, 2017. As of the date of this press release, the Company has not regained compliance with the Rule though it is in the process of preparing its annual report.The Company intends to evaluate available options to resolve the deficiency and regain compliance with the Rule. The Company currently intends to request a hearing before a Hearings Panel (the "Panel"). Such a request will stay the suspension of the Company's securities and the filing of the Form 25-NSE pending the Panel's decision. At the hearing, the Company intends to present a plan to regain compliance with the Rule and request that the Panel allow the Company additional time within which to regain compliance. While the Company believes that it will be able to present a viable plan to regain compliance, there can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company's request for a suspension of delisting or continued listing on NASDAQ.About Yulong Eco-Materials Ltd.Yulong Eco-Materials Ltd.

We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from this offering of
approximately $11.8 million, after deducting $1.0 million in estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions in connection with this offering and $1.1
million in estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering as follows:

. approximately $11.8 million in connection with Yulong Renewable’s      
  operations, to add another production line for the new brick plant, and
  acquire 70 additional hauling trucks to support the new recycling plant; and

. the balance for general corporate purposes.
 
The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and
business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering. Our
management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to apply
the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or business
conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently than as
described in this prospectus.

In using the proceeds of this offering, as an offshore holding company, we are
permitted, under PRC laws and regulations, to provide funding to Yulong WFOE
only through loans or capital contributions, subject to satisfaction of
applicable government registration and approval requirements. Based upon the
advice of our PRC counsel, we will contribute the proceeds to Yulong WFOE as a
capital contribution, and intend to commence such registration immediately after
the completion of this offering. We anticipate the registration process to take
two to three months, and as the process is administrative, we do not anticipate
any issue when we apply. We will then finance the activities of our consolidated
affiliated entities with the proceeds in RMB from Yulong WFOE to our
consolidated affiliated entities.

To the extent that a certain portion or all of the net proceeds we receive from
this offering are not immediately applied for the above purposes, we plan to
invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing debt instruments or bank
deposits. These investments may have a material adverse effect on the U.S.
federal income tax consequences of your investment in our ordinary shares. 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, we have agreed with the representative of our
underwriters to deposit $600,000 from the net proceeds that we will receive in
this offering into an account for the sole purpose of indemnifying the
representative against liability in connection with this offering, which amount
will remain in such account for two years from the closing of this offering.


Based on internal research of published government data and our customers’
purchases, and including the bricks and concrete produced for us by third-party
manufacturers, we commanded approximately 51% of the brick market and 30% of the
concrete market in Pingdingshan in both fiscal 2013 and 2014. Of the numerous
manufacturers currently doing business in the city, we believe that only two
brick manufacturers and two concrete manufacturers have the capabilities to
effectively compete against us. Our principal brick competitors are Pingdingshan
Zhengrui Industry Co, Ltd., and Pingdingshan Yinghao Building Materials Co.,
Ltd. Our principal concrete competitors are Pingdingshan Xinruiqi Concrete Co.,
Ltd., and Pingdingshan Shijixing Concrete Co., Ltd.

Competitors having lower operating costs than we do or having the financial
resources to enable them to accept lower margins than we do will have a
competitive advantage over us. Competitors having greater financial resources or
less financial leverage than we do may be able to invest more in production
equipment or pay for acquisitions which could provide them a competitive
advantage over us.


Company Description
We are a vertically integrated manufacturer of eco-friendly building products
located in the city of Pingdingshan in Henan Province, China. Our primary
operating entities, Yulong Concrete and Yulong Brick, began operations in 2004
and 2006, respectively, and since that time have become


 Pingdingshan’s leading
producers of fly-ash bricks and concrete. For our fiscal year ended June 30,
2014, our consolidated revenue from continuing operations was $44.5 million, of
which we derived approximately 33.6% from bricks and 66.4% from concrete, while
our income from operations was $15.2 million. Our consolidated revenue from
continuing operations for the nine months ended March 31, 2015 was $33.6
million, of which we derived approximately 35.0% from bricks and 65.0% from
concrete. For more information on our consolidated revenue and results of
operations for the years ended June 30, 2014 and 2013, and the nine months ended
March 31, 2015 and 2014, please see our consolidated financial statements
included elsewhere in this prospectus. 

Based on internal research of published government data and our customers’
purchases (including the bricks and concrete produced for us by third-party
manufacturers), we commanded approximately 51% of the brick market and 30% of
the concrete market in Pingdingshan in both fiscal 2014 and fiscal 2013. Because
of the nature of our products, new customers come to us either because of our
reputation or by referral from our existing customers, and our selling efforts
emphasize personal relationships over product marketing. Further, we believe
that our fly-ash bricks are eco-friendly as they contain at least 30% of
reclaimed fly-ash in place of traditional cement, thereby reducing raw material
consumption. Our fly-ash bricks also consume less energy during manufacturing
than their traditional counterparts, thereby producing less greenhouse gas
emissions.

In connection with our plans to establish waste hauling operations and to
produce bricks from construction waste, we have: (i) been granted exclusive
right by the Pingdingshan municipal government to transport and process
construction waste in the built-up area of Pingdingshan consisting of the four
districts (Shilong, Weidong, Xinhua and Zhanhe) and two special districts
(Gaoxing and Xincheng) under the administration of the municipal government
(subject to exclusions imposed by special municipal regulations), which
exclusive right has commenced concurrently with the formal operations of our
waste recycling plant; (ii) contracted to acquire an additional 70 haul trucks
to augment our current fleet of 50 trucks for a total of 120 haul trucks to
transport the waste; and (iii) built a state-of-the-art recycling plant to
process the waste, and a brick plant to utilize the processed waste. We
commenced our hauling operations in late April 2015, in conjunction with formal
operations at the recycling plant and one production line of our new brick
plant.
