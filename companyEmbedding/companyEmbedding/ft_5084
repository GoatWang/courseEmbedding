Important Information



  All sales on house plans and customization/modifications are final. No refunds or exchanges can be given once your order has started the fulfillment process.


  All house plans from Houseplans are designed to conform to the local codes when and where the original house was constructed.


  In addition to the house plans you order, you may also need a site plan that shows where the house is going to be located on the property. You might also need beams sized to accommodate roof loads specific to your region. Your home builder can usually help you with this. You may also need a septic design unless your lot is served by a sanitary sewer system. Many areas now have area-specific energy codes that also have to be followed. This normally involves filling out a simple form providing documentation that your house plans are in compliance.


  In some regions, there is a second step you will need to take to insure your house plans are in compliance with local codes. Some areas of North America have very strict engineering requirements. Examples of this would be, but not limited to, earthquake-prone areas of California and the Pacific Coast, hurricane risk areas of the Florida, Gulf & Carolina Coasts. New York, New Jersey, Nevada, and parts of Illinois require review by a local professional as well. If you are building in these areas, it is most likely you will need to hire a state licensed structural engineer to analyze the design and provide additional drawings and calculations required by your building department. If you aren’t sure, building departments typically have a handout they will give you listing all of the items they require to submit for and obtain a building permit.


  Additionally, stock plans do not have a professional stamp attached. If your building department requires one, they will only accept a stamp from a professional licensed in the state where you plan to build. In this case, you will need to take your house plans to a local engineer or architect for review and stamping. In addition, plans which are used to construct homes in Nevada are required to be drawn by a licensed Nevada architect.

Best Price Policy



  Some of our plans are also available on other websites and in printed catalogs. We are committed to selling these plans at or below the lowest price available elsewhere. If you find a regularly priced plan (not “on-sale”) for a lower price, we'll beat the advertised price by 5%. We will match the price for any on-sale plans.


  Once our staff is able to verify that the same plan is offered at a lower published price, Houseplans will offer the plan for sale at the lower published price less 5%. Our discount is available for immediate plan purchase only. Please call us at 1-800-913-2350.


  The advertised item must be the same plan as the product being purchased, including set type (5-copy, 8-copy, Reproducible, or CAD Set), foundation options, and any miscellaneous details. Advertised prices must be in the same currency that the original product was purchased in. Our Price Guarantee does not apply to advertising errors or misprints, special prices, restricted offers, mail order offers, rebates, coupons, premiums, free or bonus offers, OEM products, limited or minimum quantity or limited time offers, close-outs, liquidations, clearances, and special financing offers.


  Full sets of plans only, such as PDF, 5-copy, 8-copy, Reproducible, or CAD, are eligible for this offer. 1-copy Sets, Study Sets, Additional Sets, Materials Lists are not eligible for this offer.

More From This Designer »


Reminiscent of the grand homes of the Old South, this elegantly appointed home 
is a beauty inside and out. A centerpiece stairway rises gracefully from the 
two-story grand foyer and features balcony overlooks to the foyer and living 
room. The kitchen, breakfast room, and family room provide open space for the 
gathering of family and friends. The beam-ceilinged study and the dining room 
flank the grand foyer and each includes a fireplace. The master bedroom 
features a cozy sitting area and a luxury master bath with His and Hers 
vanities and walk-in closets. Three large bedrooms and a game room complete the 
second floor. A large expandable area is available at the top of the rear 
stair.

Different plans for every need
All plan types, except 1 Copy Study Sets (which are stamped "not for construction"), include license to build the home once, per copyright law (unless explicitly stated otherwise).


MODIFIABLE PLANS
All modifiable plans include a copyright release allowing you to perform modifications and print up to 12 copies (on average). Most plan buyers make at least one modification, and we strongly recommend purchasing a modifiable plan.
PDF (Most Popular)
Delivered via email in digital format, this is the fastest way to receive your plan. Avoid processing delays and shipping costs. PDFs are the easiest format to share with others, since no special software is required (only Adobe Reader, available via free download).
CAD
The most versatile format for making extensive modifications to your plan.  With CAD, your builder/architect will have the ability to make small changes or very specialized ones with ease. Typically delivered in CD-ROM format or via email; requires Auto-CAD software or Soft Plan software (see specific plan for details).
Reproducible Master (Repro)
A single set of blueprints typically printed on mylar, sepia, vellum, or in some instances, regular bond paper. Modifications can be drawn directly onto the blueprint itself. A reproducible master is sometimes priced lower than PDF or CAD for a given plan, but offers less flexibility than electronic formats.


UNMODIFIABLE PLANS
Unmodifiable plans may not be modified or copied. Additional sets can be purchased if needed.
8-Set Construction Package
8 full sets of blueprints delivered on bond paper.  Most construction projects require 8 separate sets for contractors/subcontractors and lenders.  If you are sure you are not going to make any modifications, this is the recommended package.
5-Set Construction Package
5 full sets of blueprints delivered on bond paper.  Most construction projects require more than 5 sets.  Consider purchasing the 8-copy construction set or a modifiable plan to avoid the hassle and expense of ordering additional copies later.
1-Set Planning Package (not for construction)
1 set of blueprints delivered on bond paper. Typically stamped “not for construction”, this option is used for providing estimations and for lending purposes.  Does not include a license to build the home. Design modifications/copying are not allowed.  May be exchanged for a buildable set within 90 days of purchase.




What comes with a plan

For details about what is included with a particular plan, please call 888.447.1946.

All blueprint sets will include the following:
Detailed Floor Plans
Detailed floor plans showing the layout of each level of the house.  Rooms and interior spaces are carefully dimensioned, doors and windows are identified. Floor plans will reference cross-section details provided elsewhere in the plans.
Exterior Elevations
Your blueprint set will include an elevation drawing of the front exterior, and in most cases the rear and sides of the house.  These drawings may provide notes for exterior materials and finishes.  Particular attention is given to cornice detail, brick and stone accents, and other finish items that make your home unique.
Foundation Plans
This sheet shows the foundation layout including concrete walls, footings, pads, posts, beams, bearing walls, and foundation notes. If the home features a basement, the first floor framing details may also be included on this sheet.  If your plan features a slab foundation, the plan shows footings and details for a monolithic or floating slab.  This page, or another within the set, may include a sample plot plan for locating your house on a building site. Additional sheets focus on foundation cross-sections and other relevant details.


Most blueprint sets also include the following:
Front Perspective
The artist's sketch of the exterior of the house gives you an idea of how the house will look when built and landscaped.
Detailed Cross Sections
Large-scale views show sections or cutaways of the foundation, interior walls, exterior walls, floors, stairways, and roof details. Additional cross-sections may show important changes in floor, ceiling, or roof heights, or the relationship of one level to another. These sections show exactly how the various parts of the house fit together and are extremely valuable during construction. Additional sheets may include enlarged wall, floor, and roof construction details.
Floor Structural Supports
Floor framing details come with plans that have basements and/or crawlspace foundations and second/third floors.  Each includes spacing, direction, span, and specifications for floor joists. Beam and window headers, along with necessary details for framing connections, stairways, and dormers are also included.
Plans may also include roof plans, and suggested electrical/plumbing plans. Call 888.447.1946 for details about specific plans.




Engineering and Code Compliance
All plans were drawn to meet national building codes at the time of their creation. Local building codes may vary. Local engineering may be required before construction can begin.
 

 







Planning Guides

Materials List
A materials list tailored exactly to your plan.
Lighting Design
Customize the home of your dreams with professional lighting design and lighting controls. While your home plans will provide suggested locations for light switches and fixtures, our lighting package provides a better solution by offering more detailed lighting designs, including fixture layouts, switch/dimmer layout, zoning and lighting control panels. You'll also receive a Bill of Materials for basic lighting fixtures, dimmers, switches and optional automated lighting controls. We've pre-negotiated low rates from select fixture manufacturers, so you can shop from the convenience of your home and receive excellent service from industry professionals.
Lighting Design requires the purchase of a PDF or CAD version of the plan.
Audio/Video Design
Customize the home of your dreams with built-in speakers and controls specially-designed for your house plan. Imagine the entire family's media all brought together in a single system. Turn any room in your home into a state-of-the-art home theater. Our 12 room package consists of a master pre-wire plan, including a Bill of Materials based on the size of your home, intercom design, infrastructure design and CCTV design. Take advantage of our pre-negotiated low rates on 40 different system designs from select manufacturers.
Audio/Video Design requires the purchase of a PDF or CAD version of the plan.
Construction Engineering Guide
Get educated about basic building concepts. Includes four sets of detailed diagrams about electrical, plumbing, mechanical, and structural details of home building.
Home Furniture Planner
A unique peel-and-stick product to help you visualize your new floor plan, fully furnished.


Alternate Plan Views

Right Reading Reverse
Your plan (all sets, if ordering 5-set or 8-set) will appear in mirror reverse, relative to what you see on the web site, but all letters and numbers will read properly.
Mirror Reverse
Only one copy of your plans will arrive in mirror reverse. The others will arrive in normal view. If you wish to receive additional copies in mirror reverse, please call customer service. In all cases, you should make sure to receive at least one copy in normal view, so that letters and numbers can be ready easily.
Mirror Reverse is only available with the purchase of a 5-set or an 8-set.



Custom Options
The custom options listed below have been pre-selected for certain plans. For any custom option not listed below, please call 888.447.1946 for a custom quote.

Alternate Foundations
Some plans have pre-drawn alternate foundations available. If an alternate foundation is not listed for your plan, please call 888.447.1946 for a custom quote. Alternate foundations may include:

Basement
Slab
Float Slab
Monolithic Slab
Crawlspace
Unfinished Walkout Basement
Unfinished Daylight Basement




2 x 6 Construction
2 x 6 framing, rather than 2 x 4, will enable your walls to hold extra insulation. For other framing types, please call 888.447.1946 for a custom quote.


Additional Plans/Licenses

Additional Plans
Additional plan sets can be purchased. This may be useful if you are purchasing a 5-set and find that you need additional sets later.
Additional Use Reproducible License
Most plans come with a license to build only one home. If you wish to build from the plan multiple times, you can purchase additional licenses for some plans. Depending on the plan, additional use licenses may be available as follows:

Additional Use Reproducible License (one additional use)
Multiple Use Reproducible License (multiple additional uses - call 888.447.1946 for details)
Unlimited Use Reproducible License
