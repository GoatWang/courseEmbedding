If you own the mineral rights in one or more of these areas, and if your rights are not leased or currently producing, you may well qualify.Q: What kind of dollar amount can I expect to receive for a lump sum one time payment from my mineral rights interest?A: The final amount depends on several variables. Each of these is subject to your particular property. Unleased and open mineral acreage is always of greater worth. If that is the current status of your acreage, you currently stand at a greater advantage to profit.Oklahoma Oil and Gas Mineral Rights Buyer offers TOP PAYMENT  for their client's mineral rights. Call us today to see what that means to you.If your mineral rights are currently Leased we must review your current langued of the negotiated lease. How much was your bonus per acre, How much did you negotiate for the royalty interest if they ever drill a will how much will you receive from the production.If it is Leased or Unleased the main factor can be the are of your minerals. For example their are areas of intrest in oklahoma and in texas at this time the can bring 3 or 4 times of some areas that may only have a value of $300 or $400 per net mineral acre.Oklahoma oil and gas mineral rights buyers and Oil Gas investors also have a team of experts including a world renowned geologists.

Their is no risk you the mineral owner we incur all risk we pass no cost on to you we will review and evaluate if we can make an offer completely at are own cost. Q: Are there any limits to the amount of acreage you're interested in?A: Whether you have a few acres or several thousand, we are interested in talking with you. Call us for a free no-obligation consultation.Q: If I have only a few acres, will I get the same type treatment as a large mineral owner?A: Regardless of the size of your Net mineral acreage or royalty income position, we treat every clientwith the same importance and respect. Oklahoma Oil and Gas Mineral Rights Buyer prides themselves on their professional approach in serving their many clients.Q: How long of a wait should I expect before seeing any profits?A: If you prefer a quick turnaround, it is best to sell your oil, gas, and mineral rights for their current per acre value. This is fastest way to receive a profit for your mineral ownership. Leasing your mineral rights is another way to profit for your mineral ownership, but that return is subject to future exploration and production volumes.Q: Why can't I represent my own oil, gas, and mineral rights interests?A: Maximizing your mineral rights profits requires an advanced knowledge of the oil, gas, and gas liquids industry. This includes being knowledgeable with each aspect of preproduction, production, transportation, and sales. Being unfamiliar with these issues will grossly affect the ability to maximize your available mineral rights profits. As far as self-production, keep in mind that Oil and gas companies pay a proportionate share of the cost of every well. This usually equates to hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars. You may be in a position to dothe very same thing, but for the vast majority of mineral rights owners that type of investment is out of the question. The best choice is having Oklahoma Oil and Gas Mineral Rights Buyer act as your expert. Our involvement will help insure that you receive the highest profits from your mineral rights.Purchasing your rights is worth more to us. This is because my call us today and find out what' we could pay now for your rights.Q: Is there any tax benefits to selling your oil, gas, and mineral rights versus collecting royalty income?A: One of the things we hear more than any other is weighing the taxation pros and cons regarding selling minerals verses waiting on the royalty income. Selling these rights is considered a sale of real property, and is taxed at capital gains rates. An example of how this works is found in for 2012 capital gains taxes. These taxes have a 15 cap, and if you happen to be in the bottom 2 brackets you will not pay any taxes. Given the current tax law, the capital gains cap is set to increase in 2013 as much as 20 Regardless of whether you are in the lowestincome tax brackets, the capital gains tax will be raised up to 10. Any royalty income is taxed according to ordinary income tax rates, which in many cases can more than double your tax liability. Consequently, there are real, significant tax advantages associated with selling minerals, compared to the greater burden and liabilities created with simply collecting royalty income.Q: Will my bonus and royalty income exceed the proceeds of selling to become a consistent source of income?A: The answer to that question depends solely on the following five points: (1) If you can lease your interest, and lease it every 3-5 years, so you could collect a new signing bonus each time. (2) If a well is drilled. (3) If that well is not a dry hole. (4) If that well is operated in a prudent manner. (5) And, most importantly, if oil, natural gas, and gas liquids pricing sustains both continued production and the risk of new exploration. Please, remember that no one person or company has control over these variables.Q: What about "pooling"?A: Pooling issues are best answered on an individual basis. Call us at this number for additional answers to this issue: (405) 819-6170Q: Don't I need legal counsel before making such a decision?A: Legal counsel is generally indispensable, however, Attorneys tend to drag their feet, thereby causing their clients to miss valuable, time sensitive opportunities. We have seen this happen more times than not. Usually after waiting several weeks or months, we finally receive a phone call asking if the opportunity in question is still available. Sadly, 99 of the time, too much time has elapsed and the monies available back then are no longer appropriated. In this type case, the Attorney profits, not the mineral owner. However, leasing directly with Oklahoma Oil and Gas Mineral Rights Buyer allows for the negotiation of terms that might otherwise not be possible.Q: What makes your company any better than the others doing the same thing?A: First and foremost because of our many years of experience. How this helps you is that we know what it takes to achieve the best possible profits for your mineral rights. We know about the many factors associated with mineral leasing and royalty payments. This knowledge doesn't come through guesswork, but through our many years of hands-on experience.

Sadly, 99% of the time, I have to tell them it is not.If a lease is to be negotiated in this case, then the terms would be competitive, relative to the options above, however, there are some unavoidable and pertinent questions that must be asked:Will your bonus and royalty income exceed the proceeds of selling, and be a consistent source of income. The answer to that question depends solely on the answers to the next 5.- If you can lease your interest, and lease it every 3-5 years, so you could collect a new signing bonus each time.- If a well is drilled.- If that well is not a dry hole.- If that well is operated in a prudent manner.- And, most importantly, IF oil, natural gas, and gas liquids prices will sustain continued production, and the risk of new exploration.These are questions that are often not asked, and not one, or any combination of these is guaranteed, and no one person or company has control of these variables.Here are some of the tax benefits of selling versus collecting royalty income:One of the things I hear more than any other is weighing the pros/cons regarding taxation when selling minerals vs. waiting on the royalty income. Selling is considered a sale of real property, and is taxed at capital gains rates.Things to Consider:- For 2012, capital gains taxes have a 15% cap, and if you happen to be in the bottom 2 brackets you will not pay any taxes.- Given the current tax law, the capital gains cap is set to increase in 2013 as much as 20% Regardless of whether you are in the lowest income tax brackets, the capital gains tax will be raised up to 10%.- Any royalty income is taxed according to ordinary income tax rates, which in many cases, can more than double your tax liability.- Consequently, there are real, significant tax advantages associated with selling minerals, compared to the greater burden and liabilities created with simply collecting royalty income.​Again, unleased, open mineral acreage is always worth more, and that is the current status of your acreage in Section 32. If you are asking yourself why it would be worth more to my company, then that is because my company would then pay it's proportionate share of the cost of a well, which is usually hundreds of thousands, if not millions to participate. You may be in a position to do the very same thing, but most are not.    call us today and find out what' we could  pay now for your rights     Mineral Rights and RoyaltiesWe can convert your mineral rights now into a lump sum Call (405) 819-6170Sell Your Oil and Gas Royalties and Mineral Rights:Oklahoma mineral rights and royalty Buyers are experts and will guide you through the often complex procedure of selling your royalties OIL AND GAS  Mineral Rights will evaluate your property ( Land ,Lease terms  ) in a friendly, professional manner .

About us
History





Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd. was created following the friendly $4.3B acquisition of Osisko Mining Corporation by Agnico Eagle and Yamana Gold in June 2014. The Canadian Malartic Mine lies at the heart of Osisko’s history, having been its cornerstone asset through the company’s growth from an exploration company to a mid-tier gold producer. Osisko can also rely on another world-class asset, the Éléonore royalty, acquired following the business combination between Osisko and Virginia in February 2015.
Here are the main highlights in Osisko Gold Royalties History
				
				 
				
			
			
				
2004
Aquisition



Using an innovative geological analysis model and applying it to publicly available data stored in the Quebec government’s geomining information system (SIGEOM), Robert Wares recognizes the potential for an open pit mining operation on the Canadian Malartic site. Osisko acquires the rights to the site in 2004.


2005
Urban drilling



When Osisko begins exploration in 2005, there are roughly 200 households in the area of interest. If the potential for an open pit mine is confirmed, the neighbourhood will need to be relocated. While sure to be a tricky operation, it also promises to be a great opportunity for the town and its residents: the neighbourhood’s infrastructure is in serious need of attention, with some streets in danger of collapsing into the old underground mine workings. In fact, a number of houses had already been relocated in the 1980s for safety reasons.


2006
The Gathering



In May 2006, Osisko greets the population of Malartic in a local church. Management explains the company’s plans for the future open pit mine, the relocation of the South neighbourhood, and its drilling program.


2007
Assembling the mining team



In order to develop and operate the Canadian Malartic Mine, Osisko recruits an experienced team that will guide the transition from an exploration company to join the ranks of producers and become a leading mid-tier gold producer on the Canadian mining scene.


2008
Feasibility and environmental impact studies



In September 2008, Osisko tables the environmental impact study for the Canadian Malartic mining project. The study was deemed admissible in January 2009 by the Quebec Ministry of Sustainable Development, Environment and Parks.
A positive feasibility study is published in November 2008, declaring 6.28 million ounces of gold in proven and probable reserves.


2008
Framework agreement for rehabilitating East Malartic


Osisko concludes a framework agreement with the Ministry of Natural Resources and Wildlife providing for the rehabilitation of the abandoned East Malartic site. The goal is to remedy the negative impact from decades of mining by past generations.


2008 - 2009
Resettlement



In July 2008, Osisko launches its resettlement program, which will involve moving about 150 homes to a new neighbourhood being developed in Malartic. The project also involves the construction of an elementary school, a daycare centre, an adult education centre, and subsidized housing, which are then transferred to the relevant institutional authorities. The ceremonial keys to the new neighbourhood are handed over to the Town of Malartic in October 2009.


2009
Authorization to mine



Following public hearings held by the BAPE and numerous consultation sessions with the citizens of Malartic, the Québec government authorizes the construction of the Canadian Malartic mine. After raising more than $1 billion in financing to fund the construction phase of the project, work begins in earnest in late August 2009.


2010
Laying the groundwork



Osisko’s plans involve enormous machinery that is critical to a large-scale mining project such as Canadian Malartic. Pre-production operations prepare the material needed to build the green wall and the ROM pad (the ore stockpiling area), which is needed to start up the processing plant.


2010
Construction



From August 2009 to May 2011, Osisko built its large-scale mining complex representing more than $1 billion in capital expenditures, more than half of which were spent directly in the Abitibi-Témiscamingue region. Today, the Canadian Malartic Mine employs more than 700 people, most of them from Quebec, and they are the face of Osisko.


2011
First Gold pour



In April 2011, after more than 800,000 metres of drilling and intense preparation, financing, and community relations work, in addition to obtaining hundreds of permits and constructing the mine, the first gold bar is poured at the “new” Canadian Malartic mine—a sight that has not been seen in Malartic for twenty-eight years!


2013
Production of the 1,000,000 th ounce of gold in November 2013






2014
Record monthly gold production achieved during the month of May



Record monthly gold production of 51,114 ounces
Record monthly mill throughput of 1,709,572 tonnes
Record average daily throughput of 55,147 tonnes per calendar day


2014
Friendly acquisition of Osisko by Agnico Eagle and Yamana Gold



In June 2014, Agnico Eagle Mines Limited and Yamana Gold Inc. acquire Osisko Mining Corporation. A new Osisko is created, Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd, which retains a 5% net smelter return (NSR) on the Canadian Malartic Mine.


2015
Business combination between Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd. and Virginia Mines Inc.



On November 17, 2014, Osisko and Virginia announced a proposed business combination, structured by way of a plan of arrangement. On January 12, 2015, shareholders of both Osisko and Virginia approved the business combination and the transaction is scheduled to close mid-February, 2015

Osisko is a Canadian precious-metals mining company headquartered in Montreal, Quebec. It operates in Canada with a focus on gold mines in the Abitibi gold belt[2] of Quebec.[3] The company was known as Osisko Exploration LTD. before changing its name in May 2008. It owns at least 17.41 million troy ounces (1,194,000 lb; 542,000 kg) of gold reserves (including 10.71 in malartic and 6.7 at Hammond Reef, malartic reserves up 20% in March 2011 due to higher gold prices)[4][5] and over 230 square kilometres (89 sq mi) of land in the Malartic-Cadillac area.[6] Based on market capitalization, it is one of Canada's largest Canadian gold mining companies. The Canadian Malartic mine will be the biggest gold mine ever in Quebec and one of the biggest gold mines in Canada.[7] Commercial production at Canadian Malartic (its flagship gold mine) began May 19, 2011.
The company is named after Quebec's Osisko Lake because of its historical significance. The lake, located within Quebec's portion of the Abitibi gold belt in the region of Rouyn-Noranda is where, in 1920, Noranda founder Edmond Henry Horne made his first major mineral discovery, a deposit that became known as the Horne Mine.

Acquisitions[edit]
On July 3, 2009 Osisko purchased 49.1% of Bowmore Exploration Ltd. a month before Goldcorp acquired a 3.2% interest in Osisko (at the time Goldcorp owned 12.9% of company shares); On February 9, 2011 Goldcorp sold its 10.1% equity interest in Osisko for $530 million.[8][9][10][11] Later that year in December, in a joint venture with Clifton Star Resources Osisko acquired Quebec's Duparquet mining project, an area that produced 1 million troy ounces (69,000 lb; 31,000 kg) of gold between 1931 and 1957, when it was operated by Beattie Gold Mine.[12] So far the Company has infused $66.83 million into the venture.[6][13] On June 17, 2011, it withdrew from Duparquet.
In March 2010 Osisko filed a takeover offer for Brett Resources that proved to be success on May 19, 2010 (initially 77% of the company was purchased, on August 13 it purchased the other 23%).[14][15][16] The deal, valued at more than $372 million, enabled Osisko to acquire the Hammond Reef Gold Project in Atikokan near Thunder Bay, Ontario and its 6.70 million troy ounces (208,000 kg) of gold.[17][18][19][20] If all regulatory approvals are met, the mine was expected to open in 2015 when it would be capable of producing 463,000 troy ounces (14,400 kg) of gold annually.[21]
In December 2012 Osisko Mining completed the $550 million takeover of Ontario mining company Queenston Resources.[22] Just three months earlier Queenston announced a 112% increase in gold resource. Queenston's main property is the Upper Beaver project located near Kirkland Lake, Ontario. The Upper Beaver mine will have a mine life of ten years and is projected to start operating in 2016.[23]
In April 2014, it was revealed in the media that Yamana Gold and Agnico Eagle Mines Limited could acquire Osisko’s flagship Canadian Malartic mine for around $3.5 billion.[24]
Production[edit]
In 2012 gold production totaled 388,478 ozt (12,083.0 kg), up 188,341 ozt (5,858.1 kg) from the year before. During the three months from June 30 to September 30, 2011, the company produced 73,814 troy ounces (2,295.9 kg) of gold up from 27,100 ozt (840 kg) the previous quarter, and 40,715 ozt (1,266.4 kg) of silver (up from 16,432 the quarter prior). Gold was produced at a cash cost of US$939/oz (quarter). In terms of sales, 72,100 ozt (2,240 kg) of gold and 49,100 ozt (1,530 kg) of silver were sold during the quarter. Operating costs account for 79% of total costs. For the first time since 2008, the company had positive earnings ($9.3m)[25]
In January 2017 Osisko reported it earned record gold equivalent ounces totaling 38,270 from its royalties and streams, along with record revenue from gold sales of CA$62.7 million, in 2016.[26] As of December 31, 2016 the company had cash and cash equivalents totaling $499.2 million.
Malartic mine[edit]




plan of the malartic mine



The Canadian Malartic mine is located in Malartic, a community about 550 km northwest of Montreal in the administrative region of Abitibi-Témiscamingue. The gold deposit, which extends a couple km along the Cadillac fault and includes porphyry gold has a resource of up to 348 tonnes.[27] Only areas considered to have more than 3g/ton of gold will be mined. Expansion projects near Malartic were considered after successful drilling results in Southern Barnat, however new licenses were needed.[27] 204 of the 205 homeowners in the area representing about 1/7 of the town's population, were bought out but the 1 remaining tried to use his interest in the area to keep the company from going ahead despite support for it from the mayor who estimates that it will create 880 direct and indirect jobs. In August 2010 a superior court judge awarded the property to Osisko Mining Corporation after determining it was an obstacle for important preparation work at the project.[28] Production at the mine was scheduled to begin in June 2011.[29] The Malartic mine reached commercial production in May/June 2011 after processing averaged 33,300 tonnes (32,800 long tons) per day in the four weeks ended June 17, 2011.[30]
In March 2008, Osisko created Le Fonds Essor Malartic Osisko, a 3 million dollar fund to be used in support of Malartic economic development projects, public facilities and infrastructure.[31] Also, a project follow-up committee was established to oversee the operation and bring up any concerns the community might have such as those regarding the environment. Its members were chosen with the intent that the committee be completely independent of the Company to avoid conflicts of interest.[32]
Gold mining in Malartic produced about 5 million troy ounces (340,000 lb; 160,000 kg) between 1935 and 1983.[33] The last major mining in the area was done by Barrick Gold in 2002.
Exploration projects[edit]
The company is also involved in other exploration projects in eastern Canada. They include the Dunn, Mount Joy, and Goldboro properties. The Dunn property is located 35 kilometres (22 mi) NE of Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec; it involves 1,990 hectares (4,900 acres) of land in Clericy and La Pause and ownership is shared with Midland Exploration, a tsx venture exchange listed exploration company focused on mining opportunities in Quebec. The stake in the Mount Joy property in Timmins, Ontario is minor however, it has the option of becoming majority owner (up to 70%) by incurring project expenditures of 4-5 million dollars total in installments made on specific dates, by delivering a bankable feasibility study, and by securing additional financing. The project, which covers 1,500 hectares (3,700 acres) of land, is controlled by Claim Post Resources, a company that in which Osisko owns stock. Over the last century, 68 thousand troy ounces (2,100 kg) of gold have been mined in Timmins, Ontario.[34] The Goldboro property is located in Goldboro, Nova Scotia in the region of Guysborough County. Because of an agreement made in November 2009 with Orex Exploration, which currently controls the project, Osisko can obtain a 50% stake by incurring project expenditures. Gold production in the area goes back to the time period of 1893-1912, when over 50,000 ozt (1,600 kg) of gold was recovered.[35]
On March 21, 2011 Osisko finalized an agreement with Sparton Resources to acquire 60-70% of a gold property 7,500 hectares (19,000 acres) in area, in Atikokan, Ontario. The property is next to Osisko's Hammond Reef project which the company is trying to expand. The deal requires Osisko to spend $1 million on exploration in 2011.[36] Currently there are no gold mining operations in Atikokan but the Hammond Reef project could begin production as early as 2015.[37]
On November 22, 2011 Osisko signed an option agreement with Midland Exploration giving Osisko the ability to acquire a 50% interest in Ontario's Casault gold property. The property is just 40 km east of Detour Gold's Detour Lake gold project (one of Canada's largest deposits).[38]
Other[edit]

In December 2009, the Company and Robert Wares, Osisko's COO, together donated 4.1 million dollars' worth of shares in the company to the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at McGill University.[39]
In 2009, the Company's management received the Northern Miner's Mining Persons of the Year award[40]

Acquisitions[edit]
On July 3, 2009 Osisko purchased 49.1% of Bowmore Exploration Ltd. a month before Goldcorp acquired a 3.2% interest in Osisko (at the time Goldcorp owned 12.9% of company shares); On February 9, 2011 Goldcorp sold its 10.1% equity interest in Osisko for $530 million.[8][9][10][11] Later that year in December, in a joint venture with Clifton Star Resources Osisko acquired Quebec's Duparquet mining project, an area that produced 1 million troy ounces (69,000 lb; 31,000 kg) of gold between 1931 and 1957, when it was operated by Beattie Gold Mine.[12] So far the Company has infused $66.83 million into the venture.[6][13] On June 17, 2011, it withdrew from Duparquet.
In March 2010 Osisko filed a takeover offer for Brett Resources that proved to be success on May 19, 2010 (initially 77% of the company was purchased, on August 13 it purchased the other 23%).[14][15][16] The deal, valued at more than $372 million, enabled Osisko to acquire the Hammond Reef Gold Project in Atikokan near Thunder Bay, Ontario and its 6.70 million troy ounces (208,000 kg) of gold.[17][18][19][20] If all regulatory approvals are met, the mine was expected to open in 2015 when it would be capable of producing 463,000 troy ounces (14,400 kg) of gold annually.[21]
In December 2012 Osisko Mining completed the $550 million takeover of Ontario mining company Queenston Resources.[22] Just three months earlier Queenston announced a 112% increase in gold resource. Queenston's main property is the Upper Beaver project located near Kirkland Lake, Ontario. The Upper Beaver mine will have a mine life of ten years and is projected to start operating in 2016.[23]
In April 2014, it was revealed in the media that Yamana Gold and Agnico Eagle Mines Limited could acquire Osisko’s flagship Canadian Malartic mine for around $3.5 billion.[24]
Production[edit]
In 2012 gold production totaled 388,478 ozt (12,083.0 kg), up 188,341 ozt (5,858.1 kg) from the year before. During the three months from June 30 to September 30, 2011, the company produced 73,814 troy ounces (2,295.9 kg) of gold up from 27,100 ozt (840 kg) the previous quarter, and 40,715 ozt (1,266.4 kg) of silver (up from 16,432 the quarter prior). Gold was produced at a cash cost of US$939/oz (quarter). In terms of sales, 72,100 ozt (2,240 kg) of gold and 49,100 ozt (1,530 kg) of silver were sold during the quarter. Operating costs account for 79% of total costs. For the first time since 2008, the company had positive earnings ($9.3m)[25]
In January 2017 Osisko reported it earned record gold equivalent ounces totaling 38,270 from its royalties and streams, along with record revenue from gold sales of CA$62.7 million, in 2016.[26] As of December 31, 2016 the company had cash and cash equivalents totaling $499.2 million.
Malartic mine[edit]




plan of the malartic mine



The Canadian Malartic mine is located in Malartic, a community about 550 km northwest of Montreal in the administrative region of Abitibi-Témiscamingue. The gold deposit, which extends a couple km along the Cadillac fault and includes porphyry gold has a resource of up to 348 tonnes.[27] Only areas considered to have more than 3g/ton of gold will be mined. Expansion projects near Malartic were considered after successful drilling results in Southern Barnat, however new licenses were needed.[27] 204 of the 205 homeowners in the area representing about 1/7 of the town's population, were bought out but the 1 remaining tried to use his interest in the area to keep the company from going ahead despite support for it from the mayor who estimates that it will create 880 direct and indirect jobs. In August 2010 a superior court judge awarded the property to Osisko Mining Corporation after determining it was an obstacle for important preparation work at the project.[28] Production at the mine was scheduled to begin in June 2011.[29] The Malartic mine reached commercial production in May/June 2011 after processing averaged 33,300 tonnes (32,800 long tons) per day in the four weeks ended June 17, 2011.[30]
In March 2008, Osisko created Le Fonds Essor Malartic Osisko, a 3 million dollar fund to be used in support of Malartic economic development projects, public facilities and infrastructure.[31] Also, a project follow-up committee was established to oversee the operation and bring up any concerns the community might have such as those regarding the environment. Its members were chosen with the intent that the committee be completely independent of the Company to avoid conflicts of interest.[32]
Gold mining in Malartic produced about 5 million troy ounces (340,000 lb; 160,000 kg) between 1935 and 1983.[33] The last major mining in the area was done by Barrick Gold in 2002.
Exploration projects[edit]
The company is also involved in other exploration projects in eastern Canada. They include the Dunn, Mount Joy, and Goldboro properties. The Dunn property is located 35 kilometres (22 mi) NE of Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec; it involves 1,990 hectares (4,900 acres) of land in Clericy and La Pause and ownership is shared with Midland Exploration, a tsx venture exchange listed exploration company focused on mining opportunities in Quebec. The stake in the Mount Joy property in Timmins, Ontario is minor however, it has the option of becoming majority owner (up to 70%) by incurring project expenditures of 4-5 million dollars total in installments made on specific dates, by delivering a bankable feasibility study, and by securing additional financing. The project, which covers 1,500 hectares (3,700 acres) of land, is controlled by Claim Post Resources, a company that in which Osisko owns stock. Over the last century, 68 thousand troy ounces (2,100 kg) of gold have been mined in Timmins, Ontario.[34] The Goldboro property is located in Goldboro, Nova Scotia in the region of Guysborough County. Because of an agreement made in November 2009 with Orex Exploration, which currently controls the project, Osisko can obtain a 50% stake by incurring project expenditures. Gold production in the area goes back to the time period of 1893-1912, when over 50,000 ozt (1,600 kg) of gold was recovered.[35]
On March 21, 2011 Osisko finalized an agreement with Sparton Resources to acquire 60-70% of a gold property 7,500 hectares (19,000 acres) in area, in Atikokan, Ontario. The property is next to Osisko's Hammond Reef project which the company is trying to expand. The deal requires Osisko to spend $1 million on exploration in 2011.[36] Currently there are no gold mining operations in Atikokan but the Hammond Reef project could begin production as early as 2015.[37]
On November 22, 2011 Osisko signed an option agreement with Midland Exploration giving Osisko the ability to acquire a 50% interest in Ontario's Casault gold property. The property is just 40 km east of Detour Gold's Detour Lake gold project (one of Canada's largest deposits).[38]
Other[edit]

In December 2009, the Company and Robert Wares, Osisko's COO, together donated 4.1 million dollars' worth of shares in the company to the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at McGill University.[39]
In 2009, the Company's management received the Northern Miner's Mining Persons of the Year award[40]

Osisko is a Canadian precious-metals mining company headquartered in Montreal, Quebec. It operates in Canada with a focus on gold mines in the Abitibi gold belt[2] of Quebec.[3] The company was known as Osisko Exploration LTD. before changing its name in May 2008. It owns at least 17.41 million troy ounces (1,194,000 lb; 542,000 kg) of gold reserves (including 10.71 in malartic and 6.7 at Hammond Reef, malartic reserves up 20% in March 2011 due to higher gold prices)[4][5] and over 230 square kilometres (89 sq mi) of land in the Malartic-Cadillac area.[6] Based on market capitalization, it is one of Canada's largest Canadian gold mining companies. The Canadian Malartic mine will be the biggest gold mine ever in Quebec and one of the biggest gold mines in Canada.[7] Commercial production at Canadian Malartic (its flagship gold mine) began May 19, 2011.
The company is named after Quebec's Osisko Lake because of its historical significance. The lake, located within Quebec's portion of the Abitibi gold belt in the region of Rouyn-Noranda is where, in 1920, Noranda founder Edmond Henry Horne made his first major mineral discovery, a deposit that became known as the Horne Mine.

In 2012 gold production totaled 388,478 ozt (12,083.0 kg), up 188,341 ozt (5,858.1 kg) from the year before. During the three months from June 30 to September 30, 2011, the company produced 73,814 troy ounces (2,295.9 kg) of gold up from 27,100 ozt (840 kg) the previous quarter, and 40,715 ozt (1,266.4 kg) of silver (up from 16,432 the quarter prior).

On March 21, 2011 Osisko finalized an agreement with Sparton Resources to acquire 60-70% of a gold property 7,500 hectares (19,000 acres) in area, in Atikokan, Ontario. The property is next to Osisko's Hammond Reef project which the company is trying to expand. The deal requires Osisko to spend $1 million on exploration in 2011.[36] Currently there are no gold mining operations in Atikokan but the Hammond Reef project could begin production as early as 2015.[37]

Osisko is a Canadian precious-metals mining company headquartered in Montreal, Quebec. It operates in Canada with a focus on gold mines in the Abitibi gold belt[2] of Quebec.[3] The company was known as Osisko Exploration LTD. before changing its name in May 2008. It owns at least 17.41 million troy ounces (1,194,000 lb; 542,000 kg) of gold reserves (including 10.71 in malartic and 6.7 at Hammond Reef, malartic reserves up 20% in March 2011 due to higher gold prices)[4][5] and over 230 square kilometres (89 sq mi) of land in the Malartic-Cadillac area.[6] Based on market capitalization, it is one of Canada's largest Canadian gold mining companies. The Canadian Malartic mine will be the biggest gold mine ever in Quebec and one of the biggest gold mines in Canada.[7] Commercial production at Canadian Malartic (its flagship gold mine) began May 19, 2011.
The company is named after Quebec's Osisko Lake because of its historical significance. The lake, located within Quebec's portion of the Abitibi gold belt in the region of Rouyn-Noranda is where, in 1920, Noranda founder Edmond Henry Horne made his first major mineral discovery, a deposit that became known as the Horne Mine.

Acquisitions[edit]
On July 3, 2009 Osisko purchased 49.1% of Bowmore Exploration Ltd. a month before Goldcorp acquired a 3.2% interest in Osisko (at the time Goldcorp owned 12.9% of company shares); On February 9, 2011 Goldcorp sold its 10.1% equity interest in Osisko for $530 million.[8][9][10][11] Later that year in December, in a joint venture with Clifton Star Resources Osisko acquired Quebec's Duparquet mining project, an area that produced 1 million troy ounces (69,000 lb; 31,000 kg) of gold between 1931 and 1957, when it was operated by Beattie Gold Mine.[12] So far the Company has infused $66.83 million into the venture.[6][13] On June 17, 2011, it withdrew from Duparquet.
In March 2010 Osisko filed a takeover offer for Brett Resources that proved to be success on May 19, 2010 (initially 77% of the company was purchased, on August 13 it purchased the other 23%).[14][15][16] The deal, valued at more than $372 million, enabled Osisko to acquire the Hammond Reef Gold Project in Atikokan near Thunder Bay, Ontario and its 6.70 million troy ounces (208,000 kg) of gold.[17][18][19][20] If all regulatory approvals are met, the mine was expected to open in 2015 when it would be capable of producing 463,000 troy ounces (14,400 kg) of gold annually.[21]
In December 2012 Osisko Mining completed the $550 million takeover of Ontario mining company Queenston Resources.[22] Just three months earlier Queenston announced a 112% increase in gold resource. Queenston's main property is the Upper Beaver project located near Kirkland Lake, Ontario. The Upper Beaver mine will have a mine life of ten years and is projected to start operating in 2016.[23]
In April 2014, it was revealed in the media that Yamana Gold and Agnico Eagle Mines Limited could acquire Osisko’s flagship Canadian Malartic mine for around $3.5 billion.[24]
Production[edit]
In 2012 gold production totaled 388,478 ozt (12,083.0 kg), up 188,341 ozt (5,858.1 kg) from the year before. During the three months from June 30 to September 30, 2011, the company produced 73,814 troy ounces (2,295.9 kg) of gold up from 27,100 ozt (840 kg) the previous quarter, and 40,715 ozt (1,266.4 kg) of silver (up from 16,432 the quarter prior). Gold was produced at a cash cost of US$939/oz (quarter). In terms of sales, 72,100 ozt (2,240 kg) of gold and 49,100 ozt (1,530 kg) of silver were sold during the quarter. Operating costs account for 79% of total costs. For the first time since 2008, the company had positive earnings ($9.3m)[25]
In January 2017 Osisko reported it earned record gold equivalent ounces totaling 38,270 from its royalties and streams, along with record revenue from gold sales of CA$62.7 million, in 2016.[26] As of December 31, 2016 the company had cash and cash equivalents totaling $499.2 million.
Malartic mine[edit]




plan of the malartic mine



The Canadian Malartic mine is located in Malartic, a community about 550 km northwest of Montreal in the administrative region of Abitibi-Témiscamingue. The gold deposit, which extends a couple km along the Cadillac fault and includes porphyry gold has a resource of up to 348 tonnes.[27] Only areas considered to have more than 3g/ton of gold will be mined. Expansion projects near Malartic were considered after successful drilling results in Southern Barnat, however new licenses were needed.[27] 204 of the 205 homeowners in the area representing about 1/7 of the town's population, were bought out but the 1 remaining tried to use his interest in the area to keep the company from going ahead despite support for it from the mayor who estimates that it will create 880 direct and indirect jobs. In August 2010 a superior court judge awarded the property to Osisko Mining Corporation after determining it was an obstacle for important preparation work at the project.[28] Production at the mine was scheduled to begin in June 2011.[29] The Malartic mine reached commercial production in May/June 2011 after processing averaged 33,300 tonnes (32,800 long tons) per day in the four weeks ended June 17, 2011.[30]
In March 2008, Osisko created Le Fonds Essor Malartic Osisko, a 3 million dollar fund to be used in support of Malartic economic development projects, public facilities and infrastructure.[31] Also, a project follow-up committee was established to oversee the operation and bring up any concerns the community might have such as those regarding the environment. Its members were chosen with the intent that the committee be completely independent of the Company to avoid conflicts of interest.[32]
Gold mining in Malartic produced about 5 million troy ounces (340,000 lb; 160,000 kg) between 1935 and 1983.[33] The last major mining in the area was done by Barrick Gold in 2002.
Exploration projects[edit]
The company is also involved in other exploration projects in eastern Canada. They include the Dunn, Mount Joy, and Goldboro properties. The Dunn property is located 35 kilometres (22 mi) NE of Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec; it involves 1,990 hectares (4,900 acres) of land in Clericy and La Pause and ownership is shared with Midland Exploration, a tsx venture exchange listed exploration company focused on mining opportunities in Quebec. The stake in the Mount Joy property in Timmins, Ontario is minor however, it has the option of becoming majority owner (up to 70%) by incurring project expenditures of 4-5 million dollars total in installments made on specific dates, by delivering a bankable feasibility study, and by securing additional financing. The project, which covers 1,500 hectares (3,700 acres) of land, is controlled by Claim Post Resources, a company that in which Osisko owns stock. Over the last century, 68 thousand troy ounces (2,100 kg) of gold have been mined in Timmins, Ontario.[34] The Goldboro property is located in Goldboro, Nova Scotia in the region of Guysborough County. Because of an agreement made in November 2009 with Orex Exploration, which currently controls the project, Osisko can obtain a 50% stake by incurring project expenditures. Gold production in the area goes back to the time period of 1893-1912, when over 50,000 ozt (1,600 kg) of gold was recovered.[35]
On March 21, 2011 Osisko finalized an agreement with Sparton Resources to acquire 60-70% of a gold property 7,500 hectares (19,000 acres) in area, in Atikokan, Ontario. The property is next to Osisko's Hammond Reef project which the company is trying to expand. The deal requires Osisko to spend $1 million on exploration in 2011.[36] Currently there are no gold mining operations in Atikokan but the Hammond Reef project could begin production as early as 2015.[37]
On November 22, 2011 Osisko signed an option agreement with Midland Exploration giving Osisko the ability to acquire a 50% interest in Ontario's Casault gold property. The property is just 40 km east of Detour Gold's Detour Lake gold project (one of Canada's largest deposits).[38]
Other[edit]

In December 2009, the Company and Robert Wares, Osisko's COO, together donated 4.1 million dollars' worth of shares in the company to the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at McGill University.[39]
In 2009, the Company's management received the Northern Miner's Mining Persons of the Year award[40]

Osisko is a Canadian precious-metals mining company headquartered in Montreal, Quebec. It operates in Canada with a focus on gold mines in the Abitibi gold belt[2] of Quebec.[3] The company was known as Osisko Exploration LTD. before changing its name in May 2008. It owns at least 17.41 million troy ounces (1,194,000 lb; 542,000 kg) of gold reserves (including 10.71 in malartic and 6.7 at Hammond Reef, malartic reserves up 20% in March 2011 due to higher gold prices)[4][5] and over 230 square kilometres (89 sq mi) of land in the Malartic-Cadillac area.[6] Based on market capitalization, it is one of Canada's largest Canadian gold mining companies. The Canadian Malartic mine will be the biggest gold mine ever in Quebec and one of the biggest gold mines in Canada.[7] Commercial production at Canadian Malartic (its flagship gold mine) began May 19, 2011.
The company is named after Quebec's Osisko Lake because of its historical significance. The lake, located within Quebec's portion of the Abitibi gold belt in the region of Rouyn-Noranda is where, in 1920, Noranda founder Edmond Henry Horne made his first major mineral discovery, a deposit that became known as the Horne Mine.

Acquisitions[edit]
On July 3, 2009 Osisko purchased 49.1% of Bowmore Exploration Ltd. a month before Goldcorp acquired a 3.2% interest in Osisko (at the time Goldcorp owned 12.9% of company shares); On February 9, 2011 Goldcorp sold its 10.1% equity interest in Osisko for $530 million.[8][9][10][11] Later that year in December, in a joint venture with Clifton Star Resources Osisko acquired Quebec's Duparquet mining project, an area that produced 1 million troy ounces (69,000 lb; 31,000 kg) of gold between 1931 and 1957, when it was operated by Beattie Gold Mine.[12] So far the Company has infused $66.83 million into the venture.[6][13] On June 17, 2011, it withdrew from Duparquet.
In March 2010 Osisko filed a takeover offer for Brett Resources that proved to be success on May 19, 2010 (initially 77% of the company was purchased, on August 13 it purchased the other 23%).[14][15][16] The deal, valued at more than $372 million, enabled Osisko to acquire the Hammond Reef Gold Project in Atikokan near Thunder Bay, Ontario and its 6.70 million troy ounces (208,000 kg) of gold.[17][18][19][20] If all regulatory approvals are met, the mine was expected to open in 2015 when it would be capable of producing 463,000 troy ounces (14,400 kg) of gold annually.[21]
In December 2012 Osisko Mining completed the $550 million takeover of Ontario mining company Queenston Resources.[22] Just three months earlier Queenston announced a 112% increase in gold resource. Queenston's main property is the Upper Beaver project located near Kirkland Lake, Ontario. The Upper Beaver mine will have a mine life of ten years and is projected to start operating in 2016.[23]
In April 2014, it was revealed in the media that Yamana Gold and Agnico Eagle Mines Limited could acquire Osisko’s flagship Canadian Malartic mine for around $3.5 billion.[24]
Production[edit]
In 2012 gold production totaled 388,478 ozt (12,083.0 kg), up 188,341 ozt (5,858.1 kg) from the year before. During the three months from June 30 to September 30, 2011, the company produced 73,814 troy ounces (2,295.9 kg) of gold up from 27,100 ozt (840 kg) the previous quarter, and 40,715 ozt (1,266.4 kg) of silver (up from 16,432 the quarter prior). Gold was produced at a cash cost of US$939/oz (quarter). In terms of sales, 72,100 ozt (2,240 kg) of gold and 49,100 ozt (1,530 kg) of silver were sold during the quarter. Operating costs account for 79% of total costs. For the first time since 2008, the company had positive earnings ($9.3m)[25]
In January 2017 Osisko reported it earned record gold equivalent ounces totaling 38,270 from its royalties and streams, along with record revenue from gold sales of CA$62.7 million, in 2016.[26] As of December 31, 2016 the company had cash and cash equivalents totaling $499.2 million.
Malartic mine[edit]




plan of the malartic mine



The Canadian Malartic mine is located in Malartic, a community about 550 km northwest of Montreal in the administrative region of Abitibi-Témiscamingue. The gold deposit, which extends a couple km along the Cadillac fault and includes porphyry gold has a resource of up to 348 tonnes.[27] Only areas considered to have more than 3g/ton of gold will be mined. Expansion projects near Malartic were considered after successful drilling results in Southern Barnat, however new licenses were needed.[27] 204 of the 205 homeowners in the area representing about 1/7 of the town's population, were bought out but the 1 remaining tried to use his interest in the area to keep the company from going ahead despite support for it from the mayor who estimates that it will create 880 direct and indirect jobs. In August 2010 a superior court judge awarded the property to Osisko Mining Corporation after determining it was an obstacle for important preparation work at the project.[28] Production at the mine was scheduled to begin in June 2011.[29] The Malartic mine reached commercial production in May/June 2011 after processing averaged 33,300 tonnes (32,800 long tons) per day in the four weeks ended June 17, 2011.[30]
In March 2008, Osisko created Le Fonds Essor Malartic Osisko, a 3 million dollar fund to be used in support of Malartic economic development projects, public facilities and infrastructure.[31] Also, a project follow-up committee was established to oversee the operation and bring up any concerns the community might have such as those regarding the environment. Its members were chosen with the intent that the committee be completely independent of the Company to avoid conflicts of interest.[32]
Gold mining in Malartic produced about 5 million troy ounces (340,000 lb; 160,000 kg) between 1935 and 1983.[33] The last major mining in the area was done by Barrick Gold in 2002.
Exploration projects[edit]
The company is also involved in other exploration projects in eastern Canada. They include the Dunn, Mount Joy, and Goldboro properties. The Dunn property is located 35 kilometres (22 mi) NE of Rouyn-Noranda, Quebec; it involves 1,990 hectares (4,900 acres) of land in Clericy and La Pause and ownership is shared with Midland Exploration, a tsx venture exchange listed exploration company focused on mining opportunities in Quebec. The stake in the Mount Joy property in Timmins, Ontario is minor however, it has the option of becoming majority owner (up to 70%) by incurring project expenditures of 4-5 million dollars total in installments made on specific dates, by delivering a bankable feasibility study, and by securing additional financing. The project, which covers 1,500 hectares (3,700 acres) of land, is controlled by Claim Post Resources, a company that in which Osisko owns stock. Over the last century, 68 thousand troy ounces (2,100 kg) of gold have been mined in Timmins, Ontario.[34] The Goldboro property is located in Goldboro, Nova Scotia in the region of Guysborough County. Because of an agreement made in November 2009 with Orex Exploration, which currently controls the project, Osisko can obtain a 50% stake by incurring project expenditures. Gold production in the area goes back to the time period of 1893-1912, when over 50,000 ozt (1,600 kg) of gold was recovered.[35]
On March 21, 2011 Osisko finalized an agreement with Sparton Resources to acquire 60-70% of a gold property 7,500 hectares (19,000 acres) in area, in Atikokan, Ontario. The property is next to Osisko's Hammond Reef project which the company is trying to expand. The deal requires Osisko to spend $1 million on exploration in 2011.[36] Currently there are no gold mining operations in Atikokan but the Hammond Reef project could begin production as early as 2015.[37]
On November 22, 2011 Osisko signed an option agreement with Midland Exploration giving Osisko the ability to acquire a 50% interest in Ontario's Casault gold property. The property is just 40 km east of Detour Gold's Detour Lake gold project (one of Canada's largest deposits).[38]
Other[edit]

In December 2009, the Company and Robert Wares, Osisko's COO, together donated 4.1 million dollars' worth of shares in the company to the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences at McGill University.[39]
In 2009, the Company's management received the Northern Miner's Mining Persons of the Year award[40]

Osisko Gold Royalties: Independent Proxy Advisory Firms Glass Lewis and ISS Recommend Proposed Acquisition of Orion Mine Finance Royalty Portfolio - Junior Mining Network











































































			Osisko Gold Royalties: Independent Proxy Advisory Firms Glass Lewis and ISS Recommend Proposed Acquisition of Orion Mine Finance Royalty Portfolio		



                        Royalties & Streams                    




MONTRÉAL, QUÉBEC--(Marketwired - July 18, 2017) - Osisko Gold Royalties Ltd (TSX:OR)(NYSE:OR) ("Osisko" or the "Company") is pleased to announce that Glass Lewis and Co. ("Glass Lewis") and Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. ("ISS"), two leading independent proxy advisory firms that provide voting recommendations to institutional investors, have recommended that shareholders of Osisko vote IN FAVOUR of the proposed acquisition of the Orion Mine Finance royalty portfolio dated June 5, 2017 ("Transaction").
Sean Roosen, Chair of the Board and Chief Executive Office of Osisko noted "We are pleased to receive the positive endorsement for our transformational transaction to acquire the 74 royalty, metals stream, and offtake agreement assets from Orion Mine Finance. We believe this transaction complements our current portfolio extremely well and provides our shareholders with increasing near-term cash flows."
Glass Lewis stated the Transaction to be "based on sound rationale". In reaching its conclusion, Glass Lewis commented that the Transaction "would provide the Company with significantly greater size, scale and mineral diversification, which in turn could enhance the Company's competitive position and access to capital" and as such recommended that Osisko shareholders vote FOR the share issuance resolution associated with the Transaction.1
ISS has also recommended that Osisko shareholders vote FOR the share issuance resolution associated with the Transaction for a number of reasons, including the fact "the proposed transaction makes strategic sense as shareholders might benefit from upside potential of the large royalty package with different advancement levels that maintains the Company's precious metals focus and diversifies the Company's portfolio while keeping low geopolitical risk. Moreover, the proposed transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to the Company's cash flow per share and to double the Company's near-term cash flow."1
We encourage all Osisko shareholders to read the management information circular with respect to the Transaction, which was filed on Osisko's issuer profiles on SEDAR and EDGAR on June 30, 2017. The management information circular is available on SEDAR at www.sedar.com and on EDGAR at www.sec.gov and contains a detailed description of the Transaction.

Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. This is done because, generally speaking, if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release, it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago.
The crux of this approach is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, although the Zacks Rank is also an important feature of the ESP metric. Combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report, and hopefully surge higher in price too.
In fact, when combining a Zacks Rank #3 or better and a positive Earnings ESP, stocks produced a positive surprise 70% of the time. And best of all, by using these parameters, investors have seen 28.3% annual returns on average, according to our 10 year backtest.

The Style Scores  are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style.
The scores are based on the trading styles of Value, Growth, and Momentum. There's also a VGM Score ('V' for Value, 'G' for Growth and 'M' for Momentum), which combines the weighted average of the individual style scores into one score.

Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A, is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B in your personal trading style.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.

The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Zacks Industry Rank assigns a rating to each of the 265 X (Expanded) Industries based on their average Zacks Rank.
An industry with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #1's and #2's will have a better average Zacks Rank than one with a larger percentage of Zacks Rank #4's and #5's.
The industry with the best average Zacks Rank would be considered the top industry (1 out of 265), which would place it in the top 1% of Zacks Ranked Industries. The industry with the worst average Zacks Rank (265 out of 265) would place in the bottom 1%.

The Style Scores are a complementary set of indicators to use alongside the Zacks Rank. It allows the user to better focus on the stocks that are the best fit for his or her personal trading style. 
The three scores are based on the trading styles of Growth, Value, and Momentum.


Growth Score
A


Value Score
A


Momentum Score
A


Within each Score, stocks are graded into five groups: A, B, C, D and F. As you might remember from your school days, an A is better than a B; a B is better than a C; a C is better than a D; and a D is better than an F.
As an investor, you want to buy stocks with the highest probability of success. That means you want to buy stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or #2, Strong Buy or Buy, which also has a Score of an A or a B.

If you own the mineral rights in one or more of these areas, and if your rights are not leased or currently producing, you may well qualify.Q: What kind of dollar amount can I expect to receive for a lump sum one time payment from my mineral rights interest?A: The final amount depends on several variables. Each of these is subject to your particular property. Unleased and open mineral acreage is always of greater worth. If that is the current status of your acreage, you currently stand at a greater advantage to profit.Oklahoma Oil and Gas Mineral Rights Buyer offers TOP PAYMENT  for their client's mineral rights.

How much was your bonus per acre, How much did you negotiate for the royalty interest if they ever drill a will how much will you receive from the production.If it is Leased or Unleased the main factor can be the are of your minerals. For example their are areas of intrest in oklahoma and in texas at this time the can bring 3 or 4 times of some areas that may only have a value of $300 or $400 per net mineral acre.Oklahoma oil and gas mineral rights buyers and Oil Gas investors also have a team of experts including a world renowned geologists.

Call us for a free no-obligation consultation.Q: If I have only a few acres, will I get the same type treatment as a large mineral owner?A: Regardless of the size of your Net mineral acreage or royalty income position, we treat every clientwith the same importance and respect. Oklahoma Oil and Gas Mineral Rights Buyer prides themselves on their professional approach in serving their many clients.Q: How long of a wait should I expect before seeing any profits?A: If you prefer a quick turnaround, it is best to sell your oil, gas, and mineral rights for their current per acre value. This is fastest way to receive a profit for your mineral ownership. Leasing your mineral rights is another way to profit for your mineral ownership, but that return is subject to future exploration and production volumes.Q: Why can't I represent my own oil, gas, and mineral rights interests?A: Maximizing your mineral rights profits requires an advanced knowledge of the oil, gas, and gas liquids industry. This includes being knowledgeable with each aspect of preproduction, production, transportation, and sales. Being unfamiliar with these issues will grossly affect the ability to maximize your available mineral rights profits. As far as self-production, keep in mind that Oil and gas companies pay a proportionate share of the cost of every well. This usually equates to hundreds of thousands, if not millions of dollars. You may be in a position to dothe very same thing, but for the vast majority of mineral rights owners that type of investment is out of the question. The best choice is having Oklahoma Oil and Gas Mineral Rights Buyer act as your expert. Our involvement will help insure that you receive the highest profits from your mineral rights.Purchasing your rights is worth more to us. This is because my call us today and find out what' we could pay now for your rights.Q: Is there any tax benefits to selling your oil, gas, and mineral rights versus collecting royalty income?A: One of the things we hear more than any other is weighing the taxation pros and cons regarding selling minerals verses waiting on the royalty income. Selling these rights is considered a sale of real property, and is taxed at capital gains rates. An example of how this works is found in for 2012 capital gains taxes. These taxes have a 15 cap, and if you happen to be in the bottom 2 brackets you will not pay any taxes. Given the current tax law, the capital gains cap is set to increase in 2013 as much as 20 Regardless of whether you are in the lowestincome tax brackets, the capital gains tax will be raised up to 10. Any royalty income is taxed according to ordinary income tax rates, which in many cases can more than double your tax liability. Consequently, there are real, significant tax advantages associated with selling minerals, compared to the greater burden and liabilities created with simply collecting royalty income.Q: Will my bonus and royalty income exceed the proceeds of selling to become a consistent source of income?A: The answer to that question depends solely on the following five points: (1) If you can lease your interest, and lease it every 3-5 years, so you could collect a new signing bonus each time. (2) If a well is drilled. (3) If that well is not a dry hole. (4) If that well is operated in a prudent manner. (5) And, most importantly, if oil, natural gas, and gas liquids pricing sustains both continued production and the risk of new exploration. Please, remember that no one person or company has control over these variables.Q: What about "pooling"?A: Pooling issues are best answered on an individual basis. Call us at this number for additional answers to this issue: (405) 819-6170Q: Don't I need legal counsel before making such a decision?A: Legal counsel is generally indispensable, however, Attorneys tend to drag their feet, thereby causing their clients to miss valuable, time sensitive opportunities. We have seen this happen more times than not. Usually after waiting several weeks or months, we finally receive a phone call asking if the opportunity in question is still available. Sadly, 99 of the time, too much time has elapsed and the monies available back then are no longer appropriated. In this type case, the Attorney profits, not the mineral owner. However, leasing directly with Oklahoma Oil and Gas Mineral Rights Buyer allows for the negotiation of terms that might otherwise not be possible.Q: What makes your company any better than the others doing the same thing?A: First and foremost because of our many years of experience. How this helps you is that we know what it takes to achieve the best possible profits for your mineral rights. We know about the many factors associated with mineral leasing and royalty payments. This knowledge doesn't come through guesswork, but through our many years of hands-on experience.

Sadly, 99% of the time, I have to tell them it is not.If a lease is to be negotiated in this case, then the terms would be competitive, relative to the options above, however, there are some unavoidable and pertinent questions that must be asked:Will your bonus and royalty income exceed the proceeds of selling, and be a consistent source of income. The answer to that question depends solely on the answers to the next 5.- If you can lease your interest, and lease it every 3-5 years, so you could collect a new signing bonus each time.- If a well is drilled.- If that well is not a dry hole.- If that well is operated in a prudent manner.- And, most importantly, IF oil, natural gas, and gas liquids prices will sustain continued production, and the risk of new exploration.These are questions that are often not asked, and not one, or any combination of these is guaranteed, and no one person or company has control of these variables.Here are some of the tax benefits of selling versus collecting royalty income:One of the things I hear more than any other is weighing the pros/cons regarding taxation when selling minerals vs. waiting on the royalty income. Selling is considered a sale of real property, and is taxed at capital gains rates.Things to Consider:- For 2012, capital gains taxes have a 15% cap, and if you happen to be in the bottom 2 brackets you will not pay any taxes.- Given the current tax law, the capital gains cap is set to increase in 2013 as much as 20% Regardless of whether you are in the lowest income tax brackets, the capital gains tax will be raised up to 10%.- Any royalty income is taxed according to ordinary income tax rates, which in many cases, can more than double your tax liability.- Consequently, there are real, significant tax advantages associated with selling minerals, compared to the greater burden and liabilities created with simply collecting royalty income.​Again, unleased, open mineral acreage is always worth more, and that is the current status of your acreage in Section 32. If you are asking yourself why it would be worth more to my company, then that is because my company would then pay it's proportionate share of the cost of a well, which is usually hundreds of thousands, if not millions to participate.
