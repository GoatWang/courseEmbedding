Who We Are
Olden Lane Advisors LLC ("Olden Lane") is developing the next generation of liquid alternative investment products. We seek to bring new options to the liquid alternatives movement, offering potential advantages including liquidity, transparency, lower costs and faster development times.
We work closely with clients including institutional investors, private banks and wealth managers. Our Target Outcome Funds can be offered as '40 Act registered funds or customized private trusts, both of which can be tailored to meet investor requirements for specific exposures or target outcomes.
Traditionally alternative investments have allowed investors to diversify their portfolios with return streams less correlated to equities and fixed income investments. Our products hope to add a new set of options for investors beyond simple diversification.
Established in 2015, Olden Lane has built a team with decades of experience in alternative investments, liquid alternatives, product structuring and distribution – experience which has been central to our ability to innovate.

Olden Lane is grounded in a culture of high performance, operational excellence, and close partnership. We seek to provide a premium service to a select number of financial institutions.

Olden Lane believes that a well-structured investment must include a clear statement of risks. We understand that many of our structures, even those which employ credit enhancements, have additional risks that must be considered before investment. To assist investors in understanding the risks inherent in an investment, Olden Lane is committed to a process of careful attention in construction and design and is highly focused on the presentation of risks in marketing and sales materials. We believe strongly that an investor should enter every investment decision with an accurate, clear and balanced articulation of how the product works.

Our Strategies
Our business responds to the growing demand for more liquid and regulated alternative investment products. Olden Lane works with institutional clients to provide solutions that might benefit individual and institutional clients alike. Growth is being driven by investor demand for strategies and asset classes that can diversify portfolios through income streams less correlated to equity and fixed income investments.
In working with clients, Olden Lane generally classifies alternative investment return streams into two categories.

Access products
Delivering exposure to a specific asset class or risk factor.
— For example, many of today’s investors are interested in accessing the return streams of asset classes traditionally beyond the reach of all but the most sophisticated investors.


Outcome products
Targeting a specific return unattainable though a traditional equity or fixed income investment.
— For example, an investor may desire an enhanced level of equity market upside or some protection against downside loss.


Next



Our Target Outcome Funds
 
Olden Lane’s Target Outcome Funds bring a new combination of capability and convenience to portfolio and risk management. This new family of innovative funds provides investors a broad set of alternatives to build more robust and resilient portfolios. Each Target Outcome Fund allows investors to participate in the return of a benchmark market index or other reference asset over a certain period of time and within specific risk constraints. These funds generally offer some measure of principal protection in exchange for a limit on participation in price appreciation. Some funds may also include features that leverage a particular return profile. In all cases, Target Outcome Funds are designed to provide an investor with the means to target an investment outcome aligned with his/her objectives and risk tolerance.
Target Outcome Funds are designed to reduce the risk and uncertainty inherent in the capital markets. The range of outcomes over a certain interval of time is defined when the fund is brought to market. The outcome orientation of these funds brings a new dimension to the rapidly growing market for index investing.  In a Target Outcome Fund, the uncertainty of an unconstrained allocation is replaced by a confidence in a controlled allocation. Target Outcome Funds encourage investors to consider how both positive and negative markets might affect their portfolios, allowing for better planning and portfolio management.

Startup Uses Novel Vehicle for Liquid Alts
An alumnus of mutual-fund manager Equinox Funds has started a business that will develop alternative-investment vehicles structured as unit investment trusts.Michel Serieyssol, who spent four years as a sales executive at Equinox, is operating under the banner Olden Lane from an office in Princeton, N.J. He is planning a variety of offerings aimed primarily at retail investors.First up is a unit investment trust dubbed Olden Lane Outcome Series Capped Performance Portfolio with Contingent Protection, designed for investors who want to hedge against a correction in the S&P 500 Index while capturing market gains. Unit investment trusts are closed-end vehicles that maintain static portfolios of securities, liquidating the positions and cashing out investors after a finite holding period that typically lasts a few years.Olden Lane’s debut vehicle, currently under review by the SEC, would have a three-year life. It would invest in S&P 500 options with the aim of protecting investor capital against drops in the index of up to 20% while maintaining exposure to the market’s upside. Thus if the market rose by 20% during the fund’s lifetime, shareholders would receive their initial capital plus a 20% cumulative return. If the market fell by 20%, investors at least would be guaranteed to get their principal back. Only if the S&P 500 dropped by more than 20% would investors lose money.A key feature of the unit investment trust structure is low trading and administrative costs, since the portfolios aren’t actively managed. Investors in the planned Olden Lane vehicle, for example, would pay fees equal to roughly 0.7% of assets over the lifetime of the fund.Olden Lane also anticipates launching commodity-focused vehicles based on strategies developed both in-house and by third-party managers, as well as private offerings that would invest in a variety of instruments including stocks, bonds and derivatives.Serieyssol is Olden Lane’s majority owner. A minority interest in the firm is held by Matthew Allain, who runs a Chatham, N.J., wealth-management firm called Leo Group.Equinox, with offices in Denver and Princeton, specializes in repackaging alternative-investment strategies for retail investors. Among its offerings is a first-of-its-kind mutual fund that takes a multi-strategy approach to managed futures.Serieyssol left Equinox in September 2014. His resume also includes stints at EIM Securities, Morgan Stanley and Societe General.

Financial Group, LLC (member of FINRA and SIPC, and an indirect majority owned subsidiary of Institutional Financial Markets, Inc. (NYSE MKT: IFMI)) ("JVB Financial") today announced that it has partnered with Olden Lane Securities LLC ("Olden Lane") to launch a new series of innovative unit investment trusts (UITs) called Target Outcome Funds.    Target Outcome Funds are a new category of UITs developed by Olden Lane and designed to offer a liquid, transparent and cost-effective vehicle for outcome-driven returns.  Through combining US Treasuries and exchange-listed option contracts which reference ETFs tracking broad-based equity indexes, Target Outcome Funds can offer efficient exposure to equity-market benchmarks within certain risk parameters, such as protection against downside risk.  UITs developed on Olden Lane's platform are designed to provide better liquidity and transparency, and lower counterparty risk, versus similar products currently offered as structured notes. The first series, offered by JVB Financial, is titled "Capped Performance Portfolio with Buffer Protection Linked to the SPDR® S&P 500® ETF Trust" and seeks leveraged capital appreciation based on the three year price performance of the SPDR® S&P 500® ETF Trust. The Trust's return will be subject to a cap of 25% and will seek to provide protection against the first 15% of any decline in the price of the reference fund, in each case, before fees and expenses."The leveraged buffered strategy has been a very popular structure used in wealth management channels for years. We've seen advisors and portfolio managers invest hundreds of millions of dollars in this strategy in the form of structured notes," said John G. Tessar III, CFP®, Head of Structured Investments at JVB Financial. "Through our partnership with Olden Lane, we can now offer a similar strategy in UIT form with improved price transparency, daily pricing and liquidity, and reduced counterparty risk." "We are excited to partner with JVB Financial to launch our first product in what will be the next generation of liquid alternatives," said Michel S. Serieyssol, Olden Lane Founding Partner.  "Our firm was founded on the belief that UITs offer a superior structure for outcome-driven investments. We've refined and improved the UIT architecture so that it can be utilized as an innovative portfolio management tool to help investors manage their portfolios with greater discipline, purpose and risk management.  UITs developed on our platform offer strong liquidity and transparency, reduced counterparty risk, and '40 Act registration, resulting in more compelling and effective products for investors."Olden Lane, established in 2015, has assembled a team with decades of experience in alternative investments, liquid alternatives, product structuring and distribution – experience which has been central to the firm's ability to innovate.For more information about JVB Financial and Olden Lane, please visit www.jvbfinancial.com and www.oldenlane.com, respectively.____________________________________________________Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) are sold only by prospectus.
