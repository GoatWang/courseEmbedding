 Martin R. Cohen
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Mr. Cohen founded Martin Roth Cohen and Associates in February, 2008. In his first case, he filed testimony on behalf of the Citizens Utility Board in Docket 07-0566, a ComEd rate proceeding before
the Illinois Commerce Commission (ICC), advocating creation of a smart grid collaborative to engage a broad spectrum of stakeholders in development of a specific set of policies, costs, and benefits.
He made a similar recommendation in ICC Docket 07-0585, an Ameren-Illinois Utilities rate proceeding. Relying on Mr. Cohen’s testimony, the ICC ordered creation of the Illinois Statewide Smart Grid
Collaborative (ISSGC).

EnerNex Corporation was selected by the ICC to direct the ISSGC and Mr. Cohen was retained by EnerNex as lead facilitator of the process, which included more than 300 stakeholders. The 356-page ISSGC
report was filed with the ICC in 2010.

Mr. Cohen's past work includes:  
Expert testimony on behalf of the Maine Office of Public Advocate in Dockets 2010-00267, 2013-00519 and 2016-00049 regarding the appointment of one or more Smart Grid Coordinators in Maine
Expert testimony on behalf of NICOR Gas Co in Docket 15-0218 regarding gas main extension policy
Expert testimony on behalf of the Citizens Utility Board in an Ameren Illinois rate proceeding, docket 13-0192, regarding a proposed Small Volume Transportation tariff
Expert testimony on behalf of the Illinois Attorney General's office and the Citizens Utility Board in a Nicor Gas tariff proceeding, Docket 12-0569
Expert testimony on behalf of RenewMissouri regarding a proposed solar energy facility in Missouri Case No. EA 2014-0136
A report for the Michigan Environmental Council projecting the effect on electricity bills of an increase the state's Renewable Energy Standard to 25% x 2025 (see: http://environmentalcouncil.org/mecReports/25by2025-ImpactonUtilityRates.pdf),
A report for Sierra Club and NRDC on the long-term net costs to customers of three proposed coal gasification plants (see: http://tenaskatax.com/docs/onhook.pdf), and
Co-authoring a paper published in September 2011, on the implications for low-income consumers of prepayment for electricity services. (see: http://www.defgllc.com/content/Publications/reports.asp)

• As an Associated Adica Professional Mr. Cohen co-authored an 88-page paper for an international client, “Integrating Distributed Energy Resources into United States Energy Markets.” In 2010, he led
an Adica-sponsored international smart grid training program in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.

• During 2009 and 2010, on behalf of the Natural Resources Defense Council, Mr. Cohen authored a series of papers detailing the economic opportunities in rural communities of renewable energy
resource development in selected states. In addition, Mr. Cohen authored a study on behalf of the Missouri Coalition for the Environment of the projected long-term rate effect of a proposed state
Renewable Energy Standard, which has subsequently been approved and is presently the subject of a rulemaking proceeding in which Mr. Cohen is participating. He has also conducted an organizational
assessment workshop for a consumer advocacy agency in a western state, and consulted on the framing of energy efficiency retrofit planning for a large municipality.

• As Director of Consumer Affairs in the Office of the Governor, Mr. Cohen helped establish the Illinois Power Agency (IPA) upon passage of its enabling legislation. He advised the IPA on the
drafting of its initial annual Procurement Plan in 2008 and its subsequent plan in 2009, under which power and energy are purchased on behalf of eligible electricity customers of ComEd and the
Ameren-Illinois Utilities. Mr. Cohen is presently a consultant on long-term planning issues to the agency.

• In August, 2008, Mr. Cohen testified in Missouri Public Service Commission Docket ER-2008-0318 on behalf of the Attorney General of Missouri in an Ameren-UE rate proceeding regarding issues related
to the proposed establishment of a fuel cost tracking mechanism.

Mr. Cohen has been a consumer advocacy leader for more than 30 years, serving as the Executive Director of the Citizens Utility Board (CUB) from 1991-2005, during which he led the
organization through the restructuring of the Illinois electricity industry. He was instrumental in negotiating language of the Electric Service Customer Choice and Rate Relief Act of 1997, including
its consumer protection and rate provisions and subsequent legislation, which reduced residential electricity rates by 20%. Mr. Cohen was CUB’s policy leader and testified on numerous occasions on
regulatory policy issues before the Illinois General Assembly, the Illinois Commerce Commission, and Committees of the United States Congress. He supervised the work of economists and other expert
witnesses as well as in-house and outside counsel in scores of utility regulatory proceedings. Mr. Cohen also served as an officer of the National Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates. He
served in Illinois government for two years, briefly as the appointed Chairman of th Illinois Commerce Commission and then as the Director of Consumer Affairs. In

LATIN PERCUSSION. WE ARE RHYTHM.

For over half a century, LP has crafted classic percussion instruments as well as patented hundreds of improvements and new designs for musical instruments that meet the exacting standards of professional musicians. Latin Percussion instruments have been featured in thousands of the world’s most famous, chart-topping recordings – from classic salsa – to classic rock. In fact, LP is such an essential part of so many musical genres, it’s nearly impossible to turn on a radio or listen to a playlist and not hear an LP instrument.







In 1956, Martin Cohen, a young mechanical engineer and avid photographer from the Bronx happened upon New York’s famous Birdland jazz club. He walked in and was immediately captivated by the sound and energy of Latin jazz.
 
1956

Martin Cohen was so taken with the infectious music that he immersed himself in the 1960’s Latin music scene and soon wanted his own set of bongos. Unfortunately, due to trade embargoes, high quality, Cuban-made bongos were unavailable in the United States. So Cohen put his engineering skills to use and created his own set of bongos. After months of study, Martin Cohen had successfully built what would eventually be heralded as, “the finest bongos the world had ever seen.”
 
1960

In 1964, Martin Cohen founded Latin Percussion (LP) and was soon delivering bongos, cowbells and other instruments in brown paper bags to musicians. Cohen utilized New York’s Latin nightclubs as his research and development labs – utilizing artist’s real world experience playing live music to craft and hone the best possible percussion instruments for live and recorded performance. Cohen’s self-described “love affair” with Latin music established a tradition still practiced at LP; the needs of performing musicians are placed ahead of everything else.
 
1964



 
 


 

In 2015, LP became part of another great American, family-run business, Drum Workshop®.  DW and LP are built on the same principles of passion and continuous collaboration with the world’s top drummers and percussionists.  DW Founder, Don Lombardi and his son, President and CEO, Chris Lombardi are committed to carrying on LP’s legacy of combining authenticity of sound with strong modern design to provide the finest percussion products available on the market today.
 
 
2015

Today, Latin Percussion instruments are put to the test by professional and amateur musicians around the globe. Year after year, LP’s legacy endures, as our talented research and development team continues working with the world’s greatest artists to create the world’s best percussion instruments.
