	and in a professional manner. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent the Employee from

	devoting reasonable time and attention to personal, public and charitable affairs, or (ii) serving on other boards of directors,
	as long as such activities do not interfere with the effective performance of his duties hereunder.


	 


	 


	 


	 








	 



	2



	 






	 



	 


	2.3.

	           


	Assignment Location; Working Period

	.

	It

	is currently expected that the Employee
	will initially fulfill his assignment up to five days per week in the New York, New York metropolitan area from Monday morning
	through the close of business on Friday. The parties anticipate that, commencing between three and 12 months following the commencement
	date, the headquarters of the Company shall be relocated to a location in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and, commencing upon
	such relocation, Employee shall be expected to fulfill his assignment from such location from Monday morning through the close
	of business on Friday.


	 


	2.4.

	           


	Extended Term

	. Unless the Company or Employee shall give notice to the other within sixty (60) days prior to the
	final day of the Term, this Agreement shall be deemed extended by an additional one year period. The extended term compensation
	and conditions mutually agreeable to the Company and Employee must be evidenced in an addendum hereto, provided, however, that
	such compensation terms shall not be less favorable to Employee than those set forth herein.


	 


	3.          

	Salary and Bonus

	.


	 


	3.1.

	           


	Salary

	. The Company shall pay a salary to the Employee at a rate of US $250,000 per year (pro-rated for periods
	of less than a full calendar year) for the period ending one year from the date hereof, payable to the Employee in equal installments
	in accordance with the Company's standard salary payment policies. The Employee also agrees to serve as a member of the Board
	without additional consideration.


	 


	3.2.          

	Bonus

	.


	 


	(a)

	            

	Employee shall be entitled to an annual (commencing on the effective date of this Agreement and ending on each anniversary
	of the effective date of this Agreement) bonus equal to 10% of all incremental gross revenue generated by the Company during the
	year in question determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistent with those utilized by the
	Company in the preparation of its annual financial statements. Such bonus shall be payable quarterly during the year by comparing
	the interim annual period in question to the corresponding interim annual period of the prior year. Each year will be reset with
	the same provisions. For sake clarity and for purposes of illustration only, assuming that the Company generated no revenue during
	the annual period ending on the date immediately prior to the effective date of this Agreement, in the event that during the quarter
	I of the Term the Company recognizes $5 million of revenue on the aforementioned basis, Employee would be entitled to a bonus
	of $500,000 (e.g., 10% of $5 million) and in the event that during the initial two quarters of the Term the Company recognizes
	$8 million of revenue on the aforementioned basis, Employee would be entitled to a bonus of $300,000 ($8 million less the prior
	$5 million equals $3 million multiplied by 10%). Any payment by the Company to Employee as bonus when determined by comparing
	successive annual periods will be adjusted at the end of such annual period.


	 


	(b)

	             

	Following each anniversary of the Commencement Date during the Term, wholly subject to the discretion of the Board based
	upon the Employee's and the Company's performance during such year, the Board may award the Employee a cash bonus. Notwithstanding
	anything to the contrary in this Section 3.2 or Section 6.4, no annual discretionary bonus shall be deemed to have accrued or
	otherwise to have become payable for the purposes of this Agreement unless this Agreement shall not have been terminated prior
	to the end of the year in respect of which such bonus was awarded.

	under the Company's 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (The

	"Stock Option Plan")

	to
	acquire an aggregate of 7,000,000 shares of common stock of the Company (the

	or cashless basis, subject to proportionate adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, reverse stock splits, and recapitalizations,
	which Options shall vest in accordance with

	Schedule 3.3

	hereto. Additional stock options or shares of common stock of
	the Company may be awarded to the Employee during the Term at the discretion of the Board or the relevant committee thereof. The
	Employee shall be entitled to participate in all stock option, restricted share, and incentive compensation plans and programs
	adopted or maintained by the Company, subject to the terms of such plans and programs and, in the case of incentive plans pursuant

	or by the Company, or by the relevant taxing authorities in any country, state, or other jurisdiction in which Employee shall
	be performing his duties at the request of the Company. The foregoing shall include reasonable communications, travel, lodging

	(B)

	            

	enter the employ of, or render any services to, any Person who or which (or any division or controlled or controlling affiliate
	of such Person) engages in a Competitive Business; provided, however, that Employee shall be permitted to become an employee of,
	or render services to, a Person that engages in a Competitive Business (or that is a controlled or controlling affiliate of any
	Person that engages in a Competitive Business) if Employee's employment or provision of services is limited to a line of business
	of such Person that does not constitute a Competitive Business, Employee does not sell or provide a Competitive Product or Service,
	and Employee does not otherwise indirectly violate the restrictive covenants set forth herein;


	 


	(C)

	own, solely as an investment, securities of any Person engaged in the business of the Company or its affiliates which are publicly

	any such employee who is at the time employed by the Company or its affiliates; provided, however, that nothing herein
	shall prevent Employee, whether on Employee's own behalf or on behalf of or in conjunction with any Person, from hiring any

	(b)

	              

	It is expressly understood and agreed that although Employee and the Company consider the restrictions contained in this
	Section 7 to be reasonable, if a final judicial determination is made by a court of competent jurisdiction that the time or territory
	or any other restriction contained in this Agreement is an unenforceable restriction against Employee, the provisions of this
	Agreement shall not be rendered void but shall be deemed amended to apply as to such maximum time and territory and to such maximum
	extent as such court may judicially determine or indicate to be enforceable. Alternatively, if any court of competent jurisdiction
	finds that any restriction contained in this Agreement is unenforceable, and such restriction cannot be amended so as to make
	it enforceable, such finding shall not affect the enforceability of any of the other restrictions contained herein.

	("Section 409A")

	(b)

	             

	For purposes of this Agreement, a termination of Employee's employment shall refer to a "separation from service,"
	and a termination of Employee's employment shall not be considered to have occurred unless such termination constitutes a "separation
	from service" (within the meaning of Treas. Reg.§

	.409A-l(h)).


	 


	(c)

	              

	Wherever payments under this Agreement are to be made in installments, each such installment shall be deemed to be a separate
	payment for purposes of Section 409A. For purposes of this Agreement, each payment is intended to be excepted from Section 409A
	to the maximum extent provided under Section 409A.


	 


	(d)

	              

	All reimbursements and in kind benefits provided under this Agreement shall be made or provided in accordance with the
	requirements of Section 409A, including, where applicable, the requirements that (i) any reimbursement is for expenses incurred
	during the Employee's lifetime (or during a shorter period of time specified in this Agreement); (ii) the amount of expenses eligible
	for reimbursement, or in kind benefits provided, during a calendar year may not affect the expenses eligible for reimbursement,
	or in kind benefits to be provided, in any other calendar year; (iii) the reimbursement of an eligible expense will be made no
	later than 2 1/2 months after the end of the calendar year in which the expense is incurred; and (iv) the right to reimbursement
	or in kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit.


	 


	(e)

	              

	Notwithstanding any other prov1s1on of this Agreement, if the Employee is a "specified employee" as defined in
	Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Internal Revenue Code at the time of the Employee's termination of employment, then the payment
	of any amount under or pursuant to this Agreement in connection with the Employee's termination of employment that is considered
	deferred compensation subject to Code Section 409A shall be deferred until six (6) months after the Employee's termination of
	employment or, if earlier, the Employee's death, (the

	"409A Deferral Period”').

	In the event payments are otherwise
	due to be made in installments or periodically during the 409A Deferral Period, the payments that would otherwise have been made
	in the 409A Deferral Period shall be accumulated and paid in a lump sum as soon as the 409A Deferral Period ends, and the balance
	of the payments shall be made as otherwise scheduled.

	PeerLogix Names Ray Colwell Chief Executive
	Officer



	 




	PeerLogix
	Enhances its Management Team




	 


	NEW YORK, NY, February 23, 2017 (Accesswire)
	– PeerLogix, Inc. (the “Company”) (OTC Markets: LOGX), an advertising technology and data aggregation provider,
	today announced that it has entered into an employment agreement with Ray Colwell to serve as Chief Executive Officer, of the Company
	commencing March 6, 2017.


	 


	“We selected Ray given our current
	phase of development, which is one of rapid growth. It is no secret that cord cutters and OTT users are growing by leaps and bounds,
	Netflix and their exponential user growth is a testament to this. Ray knows this industry inside and out and, given his background,
	provides PeerLogix with the leadership it requires as PeerLogix has become a diversified media and advertising data aggregator,”
	said Kevin A. Richardson II, Chairman of PeerLogix. “With our pending acquisition of Waywire and plans for further internal
	and acquisitive revenue growth, Ray’s ability to translate our vision and strategy into execution will be invaluable,”
	added William Gorfein, the current Chief Executive Officer who will transition to Chief Strategy Officer & Founder.


	 


	Prior to joining PeerLogix, Mr. Colwell
	served as a member of successful executive teams, most recently as VP of Partner Sales at AOL responsible for $100+ million of
	mobile demand revenue following the AOL acquisition of Millennial Media, where he was then head of Global Business Development,
	and prior to the acquisition of Nexage by Millennial Media in the same capacity. Mr. Colwell has deep experience generating digital
	media revenue in new businesses in the digital ecosystem, including his role as Chief Revenue Officer at Adelphic, recently acquired
	by Time Inc., and as Chief Revenue Officer of 4INFO, as well as SVP of Sales and BD for Third Screen Media, a pioneer in the mobile
	ad serving space acquired by AOL in 2007.


	 


	“I am thrilled to be joining PeerLogix
	at this exciting time. The Company continues to build a dynamic platform and I look forward to leading the Company into a period
	of considerable revenue growth. My focus will initially be on driving revenue from our current suite of products, but I will also
	focus on platform expansion, increased innovation, internal growth and through the evaluation of opportunities that are available
	to us now and which will become available to us as we grow.”

By utilizing its extensive data, analytics and industry leading software, PeerLogix has proven its ability to deliver marketing groups to advertisers with engagement rates that exceed 80% than that of independent Control groups.

"Ad-tech companies continue to command compelling multiples in the market, and we believe we have created a compelling, unique, and proprietary solution for this large and rapidly growing demographic. We are excited at the initial response from advertising agencies, and we look forward to further progress in the months ahead."About PeerLogix PeerLogix is an advertising technology and data aggregation company providing a proprietary software as a service, or SAAS, platform which enables the tracking and cataloguing of Torrent files and Torrent networks in order to determine consumer trends and preferences based upon media consumption.
