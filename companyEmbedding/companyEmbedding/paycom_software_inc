The right technology makes all the difference. By automating your processes with a single application, you eliminate the errors and frustration associated with manually entering data and integrating multiple systems. Because Paycom empowers businesses with one system of record for employees, any information that impacts payroll is entered one time, with the changes taking effect throughout the system. Plus, we dedicate a specialist for each customer to call for help when they need it. We don’t use an automated phone system or voicemail. You get a real person with expert insight into your business, payroll and software to answer your questions as quickly as possible.

Paycom Software Inc Has Room to Run
This provider of workforce management software has the makings of a winning investment.











                Andy Gould
            

                (CMFGouldberg)



            
            Jan 19, 2017 at 8:05PM
            
            





Paycom Software (NYSE:PAYC) targets C-suite executives and HR managers in the U.S. with its all-in-one human capital management (HCM) software solution, a convenient alternative to cobbling together products from multiple vendors. Instead of running one system to manage payroll and another to manage time entry and tracking, and still another to assist with tasks such as recruiting, training, and performance reviews, Paycom customers can log on to one integrated system -- running on a single cloud-based database -- that handles it all, including compliance with government regulations.
This lets companies focus on their own business instead of the ever-changing complexities of the tax code or various labor laws. With that as a backdrop, let's dive into why Paycom has the look of a long-term winner.

Image source: Paycom Software.
A profitable company with gangbusters growth
The total addressable market for the U.S. HCM industry will be $20 billion by 2021, according to Markets and Markets. With its $2.8 billion market cap, Paycom is a small fish in that big pond, with plenty of room to grow. And nearly any way you want to measure it, Paycom's current rate of growth is mighty impressive.
Over the last two full fiscal years (2014 and 2015), revenue, net income, and free cash flow have been on an absolute tear:

Revenue grew from $107 million to $225 million -- a 45% compound annual growth rate.
Net income grew from $0.6 million to $21 million. Starting from such a low number renders a CAGR calculation fairly meaningless (but for the record, it's 491%).
After turning free-cash-flow-positive in 2013, the company more than tripled free cash flow from $8 million in 2014 to $26.5 million in 2015.

And the company's strong performance continued throughout 2016. In its most recent earnings report, for the third quarter, which was released Nov. 1:

Third-quarter revenue was up 40% year-over-year to $77.3 million.
Adjusted EBITDA was up 68% to $18.2 million.
Management increased its full-year 2016 revenue guidance to a range of $326.5 million to $328.5 million, the midpoint of which represents 46% year-over-year growth.
Full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance was also raised to a range of $88 million to $90 million, which represents 27% year-over-year growth at the midpoint.
Management increased its long-term adjusted EBITDA margin target to a range of 30% to 33%, commenting that this will still allow the company to pursue robust growth while making substantial R&D investments.

Satisfying customers
The HCM industry is crowded. You're probably familiar with the larger competitors, including ADP, Paychex, Oracle, and SAP. But plenty of smaller, nimbler companies, such as Workday, have entered the field as well. With so many players offering overlapping solutions, price is of course a big factor. But it's not the only factor.
The idea of an all-in-one offering is especially attractive to the smaller-sized businesses that Paycom targets (generally, between 50 and 2,000 employees), since traditionally those businesses rely on multiple vendors to create their own patchwork solution, or attempt a portion of it themselves. With most of its competitors focused on the larger end of the market, Paycom also prides itself on providing superior service to companies that -- being on the smaller side -- wouldn't receive as much attention from industry giants.
So far, this approach is paying off big time. From 2011 to 2015, the company's number of clients -- currently 15,000 and counting -- increased at a 41% compound annual growth rate.
Paycom also claims it leads the industry in customer satisfaction, evidence of which can be seen in the company's fantastic retention rates. For the past three full fiscal years, the company's retention rate (percentage of revenue retained from existing clients) has held steady at 91%. Just as impressive: Recurring revenue for the third quarter increased 40% to $75.9 million, making up 98% of total revenues. With numbers like that, every new client the company signs increases not only the current quarter's sales numbers, but -- at least in theory -- all future quarters as well.





The biggest risk: Paycom's rich valuation 

PAYC data by YCharts
Make no mistake. Paycom's stock is expensive -- currently trading above a price-to-earnings ratio of 70 -- and is already pricing in many years of strong growth ahead. That's a little more palatable when you look toward the future, with the stock trading at around 46 times next year's earnings estimates. As long as Paycom maintains its torrid rate of growth, its valuation should come into a more reasonable range over the next couple of years. But at today's prices, even a whiff of disappointment can cause serious volatility.
In fact, last quarter, revenue and EPS both beat analyst estimates, but the stock dropped like a stone anyway. The best I can figure is that the company's previous two quarters featured incredible year-over-year growth rates of 63% and 51%, fueled largely by new billings from Affordable Care Act regulations. With that tailwind gone, perhaps third-quarter revenue growth of "only" 40% -- coupled with guidance for fourth-quarter revenue growth of 33% -- looked like a letdown by comparison.
One other potential overhang is the pending repeal of the ACA. The company has said that 5% of its revenue would be at risk if the ACA were to disappear overnight. But if the ACA is replaced by something else that also requires regulatory compliance, businesses would continue to require Paycom's services to navigate this transition, lessening the overall impact.
The stock has already run up more than 20% from its post-earnings low of $40 or so. Those looking to add a promising growth story to their portfolios may want to put Paycom on their watch list. Or, if you can stomach the inevitable large swings that come with the territory, even today's prices may turn out to be a decent entry point in the long run.

Paycom Software, Inc Kicks Off 2017 on a High Note
The human capital management specialist once again posted meaningful gains in revenue and profits.











                Brian Feroldi
            

                (TMFTypeoh)



            
            May 4, 2017 at 2:10PM
            
            





Businesses of all shapes and sizes need help managing their employees. In recent years an ever increasing number of those employers have been switching to Paycom Software's (NYSE:PAYC) solution. Paycom's cloud-based software helps human resources departments with basic tasks such as hiring, training, payroll processing, and more. The company's all-in-one solution has been attracting new customers at a breathtaking rate, which has allowed Paycom's revenue and profits to soar.
Coming into Tuesday's first-quarter earnings report, shareholders wanted to see Paycom meaningfully expand its revenue and profits yet again. Was the company able to live up to those lofty expectations? Let's take a closer look at the company's results to find out.

Data source: Paycom Software. 
What happened with Paycom this quarter?

Recurring revenue increased 33% year over year to $118 million while implementation and other revenue grew 30% to $1.5 million. 
Margin expansion drove 42% growth in adjusted EBITDA, which came in at $47 million for the quarter.
Non-GAAP net income was $28 million, or $0.43 per diluted share. These figures rose 43% and 42%, respectively, when compared to the year-ago period.
Paycom ended the quarter with $93 million in cash on $32 million in debt. 

During its last earnings report, Paycom had forecast that revenue this quarter would land between $114.5 million and $116.5 million while adjusted EBITDA was projected to come in between $42 million and $44 million. Meanwhile, Wall Street had expected Paycom to report $115.8 million in revenue and $0.41 in EPS this quarter. As you can tell, Paycom managed to handily beat all of these expectations.





What management had to say
CEO Chad Richison was thrilled to report that the company's quarterly revenue surpassed the $100 million mark for the first time. He credited the achievement to the company's unique product solution and terrific execution, stating: "We continue to execute at high levels across our organization and as a result we are helping more companies than ever run their businesses more efficiently with our cloud-based payroll and human capital management solution."
On the company's investor call, Richison provided several examples of companies with thousands of employees that decided to switch to Paycom's platform during the quarter. While he didn't call them out by name, the victims of that client-stealing activity are likely to be payroll processing giants such as Automatic Data Processing and Paychex.
Looking forward
Management believes that the company's momentum will continue into the second quarter. As a result, management expects the company to post yet another quarter of strong revenue and profit growth. Specifically, Paycom expects revenue to land between $94.5 million and $96.5 million, the midpoint of which represents 29% growth year over year. Meanwhile, adjusted EBITDA is expected to come in between $22 million and $24 million. The midpoint of this range represents growth of approximately 24%.
The company's strong start to the year also allowed management to raise its full-year guidance. For 2017, the company now expects revenue to grow approximately 30% and come in between $426 million and $428 million. That represents a $4 million bump over its prior outlook. Adjusted EBITDA guidance was also raised by $4 million and the new range is $117 million to $119 million, representing growth of roughly 28% at the midpoint.
The better-than-expected quarterly results and bullish outlook caused Wall Street to bid up Paycom's stock to a fresh all-time high in early morning trading following this release. With Paycom continuing to prove that its business is firing on all cylinders, perhaps that optimism is warranted.

Paycom Software, Inc Kicks Off 2017 on a High Note @themotleyfool #stocks $PAYC




































Don't Miss Out On Paycom Software's Growth - Paycom Software, Inc. (NYSE:PAYC) | Seeking AlphaSign in / Join NowGO»Don't Miss Out On Paycom Software's GrowthDec.15.16 | About: Paycom Software, (PAYC) Thomas Marano Hedge fund analyst, IPOs, long/short equity, GrowthSummarySingle service database differentiates Paycom Software in growing industry.Third quarter growth shows promising future.Superior margins to competitors and growing financials. Paycom Software (NYSE:PAYC) is a US-based online payroll and human resources technology provider located in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. Paycom is known for their multiple online services in areas such as talent acquisitions, time and labor management, payroll, talent management, and human resources. Paycom's broad cloud-based HR system overall aids corporations in managing many aspects of their company. Paycom Software is a growth company that has continued to increase revenue year after year, providing evidence that demand for their product is cultivating. The main reasons corporations partner with Paycom is for their on-site implementation, to improve talent and retention, customize and create a communication channel to employees, work efficiency with strategic organizations, and compliance by design. Plus Paycom is one of the only human resource software platforms that is together on a single database, which provides extreme ease to payroll and human capital management. Industry Outlook Throughout 2016, the software and information technology sector continued to grow. According to CompTIA, in 2015 labor within the software industry has grown by "nearly 40%" with overall confidence of continuous growth in future years. In the aggregate the US IT sector employs approximately 5.9 million workers in technical and non-technical roles. Jobs span from both technical and non-technical roles such as software developers, network administrators, human resources and marketing. Global revenue within the IT industry is expected to reach $3.8 trillion, up from 2015's $3.7 trillion, with the United States accounting for nearly 31%. The driving force within the industry is cloud computing software. Paycom's cloud computing software increases efficiency, has a disaster recovery system, and allows associates to work from anywhere. Paycom has many well-known competitors of similar size and revenue that provide a similar service, such as ADP Workforce Now, Paylocity Holdings (NASDAQ: PCTY) and Workday Inc. (NYSE: WDAY). Source:CompTIA - here Business Model/Product Differentiation Paycom provides a comprehensive cloud oriented payroll and human resources software solution that was created for companies to aid in the everyday operation of their business. With Paycom's key advantage being that their software operates on a single server base - this allows their customers to access all their data in one area rather than multiple databases. Paycom currently has 41 sales offices across the country that act as their main source of communication for demos or any errors. Management strategically places various Paycom locations in areas where their software is highly used. They plan to open more storefronts within 2017 and increase overall client numbers. Paycom's target market is mid-size corporations with approximately 2,000-8,000 employees. In the future they hope to appeal to all size corporations. Source: Paycom company website - here With the IT sector and software industry growing rapidly each year it is extremely crucial that Paycom Software differentiates itself from their competition. Most of Paycom's competition have a similar payroll processing software, but not all of them have an HCM (Human Capital Management) solution. Paycom's software offers a program that "Truly Completes Employment Life Cycle Management" making the everyday tasks of running a business much more efficient and easier. Talent acquisition provides convenience when screening for new employees. Payroll, time and labor management aids in clocking employee hours and their duties. Talent management and HR Management helps support overall business goals. Many of Paycom's competitors do not offer all of the above services and because of this Paycom easily differentiates them from their competition. According to Value Investors Club, it's proven that Paycom differentiates themselves from their competition by maintaining their "91% revenue retention rate" over the past three years. Source: here Profit Margins/Competitor Comparison Paycom Software is financially healthy. They've continued to increase return on invested capital from 2013-2015 and have continued to grow each quarter of 2016. Gross margin has steadily increased year after year and although EBITDA margin took a dip in 2013 they're on track and continue to grow going in the final quarter of 2016. Paycom also increased their operating margin year after year showing that Paycom is earning more per dollar of sales. 

 Source: Bloomberg When compared to competitors with various tools such as Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ: PANW), Adobe Systems (NASDAQ: ADBE), Intuit (NASDAQ: INTU), Paylocity Holdings (NASDAQ: ) and Workday Inc. (NYSE: ), Paycom Software is outperforming. The comparative analysis of Paycom to top competitors shows how they outperform. Moving across the chart, it's clear Paycom is well above the average in each column. 

 Source: Bloomberg 



 Source: S&P Capital IQ Paycom's ROIC/WACC is 1.69, whereas historically it has been 1.80. Although the company's ROIC/WACC is lower than its historical average, it remains well above the industry, which suggests there is more added value than its competitors. Its current ROIC is 25.7%, which is nearly five times that of its competitors. This can suggest that Paycom Software uses their funds more efficiently to generate returns. Strong Q3 Results Paycom Software's Q3 earnings came out on November 1 and showed huge signs of success.  Third quarter revenue of $77.3 million up from prior year Q3 by 40%. Third quarter GAAP net income up $6.2 million, 61% from prior year's quarter. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA up 68% to $18.2 million from Q3 2015. Projections for the quarter ending December 31 are revenues between $85 million to $87 million and adjusted EBITDA between $14 and $16 million.  Long-Term Plans  Increase relationship with current software users and seek new clients. Develop more storefronts throughout the country. Increase employment. One of Paycom's biggest issues is the number of software engineers. Paycom has a great staff, however most of the employees installing the software through the country are not developers, they're just associates. By increasing the number of software developers, this will increase the efficiency of the installment of the software in corporations, providing their customers with ease and adding to their accredited name. Keep up with Equal Employment Opportunity's annual report. As corporations throughout the country continue to grow they'll need to employ and categorize their employees based on race/ethnicity, job category and gender. As more rules and regulations come into effect, I believe that more users will seek a simplified solution to keeping these records, like Paycom Software. The software helps scan potential employees which will provide ease to human resources.  Risk As mentioned earlier by CompTIA, the IT industry has grown through 2015 and is projected to increase moving into the future. With increasing labor rates, the potential to create a better or more affordable software is high. Investing in Paycom can be very risky. Paycom has five main services, but they do not specialize or dominate one of the five. Paycom Software is not the leader of its industry and has a lot of big companies to compete with. Since their main client size is 15,000 or less, as companies expand, they will not be searching for Paycom. They will take their business elsewhere. Today Paycom's short interest skyrocketed up, which could indicate that investors believe the price will decrease these next few weeks. 

 Source: Bloomberg Conclusion I believe that Paycom Software is a growth company and that they're currently undervalued. Paycom provides a single server software that offers an extremely useful system to many complicated problems. They're financially stable and have meet past quarter goals and are on track to exceeding goals for quarter 4. Moving into the future, I expect the corporation to grow and take on larger clients leading to an increase in value and revenue.

History[edit]
Paycom was founded in 1998 by Chad Richison who had formerly worked in the payroll processing industry.[11] It began as an online payroll service provider for businesses and expanded to offer additional services including human resource management beginning in 2001.[2] In 2007 Richison sold a stake of Paycom to Welsh Carson Anderson and Stowe, a private equity group based in New York, and stayed on as the company's CEO.[2][12]
In 2011, the company moved its headquarters to a new 90,000 square foot office building, remaining in Oklahoma City.[9] The same year it released additional services including E-Verify, onboarding, expense management, and document storage.[13] In 2014, Paycom built a 90,000-square-foot addition to its headquarters—effectively doubling the size of its offices.[14] In 2016, the company completed construction on a third building, bringing the total square-footage of its office space to approximately 250,000.[15]
Awards and recognition[edit]
Paycom has been the recipient of numerous awards and recognition including the Service Bureau of the Year Award and being named to the Metro 50 List of Oklahoma companies with the largest growth from the previous two years.[1] Paycom was named a top workplace in Oklahoma by The Oklahoman for a fourth consecutive year, topping the list as Oklahoma's No. 1 workplace in 2016.[15] Paycom has also made Deloitte's Technology Fast 500 list for the previous two years.[15]
In 2010, it received a Stevie Award for Sales Department of the Year in the Financial Services category,[16] following up with another Stevie Award in 2011 for Best Sales Training Manager of the Year. Inc. has recognized Paycom as both a Top 100 Job Creator in 2012 and 2013[7] as well as one of the Fastest-Growing Private Companies for the years 2006 through 2014.[17] In 2014, Paycom was named to the inaugural Build 100, which recognizes less than 1.5 percent of U.S.-based companies that are noted as sustained-growth champions.[18]
Paycom ranked No. 28 among large businesses on Glassdoor's 2015 Best Places to Work in the U.S. list.[19] In 2013, Glassdoor named Paycom one of the Top Five Best Places to Work in the U.S.[20] and recognized Paycom again in 2014 as one of the Best Places to Work. Additionally, Paycom ranked in the Top 25 Most Difficult Companies To Interview list compiled by Glassdoor, a recognition shared with companies like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft.[21] The same year it received the EPCOR David DeMarea Payments Innovation Award.[22]
Paycom won HR.com's Leadership 500 Excellence Awards in 2015 after earning similar honors in 2014. Paycom earned its place in the midsize company rankings based on its outstanding achievements in leadership development and programs.[23]

History[edit]
Paycom was founded in 1998 by Chad Richison who had formerly worked in the payroll processing industry.[11] It began as an online payroll service provider for businesses and expanded to offer additional services including human resource management beginning in 2001.[2] In 2007 Richison sold a stake of Paycom to Welsh Carson Anderson and Stowe, a private equity group based in New York, and stayed on as the company's CEO.[2][12]
In 2011, the company moved its headquarters to a new 90,000 square foot office building, remaining in Oklahoma City.[9] The same year it released additional services including E-Verify, onboarding, expense management, and document storage.[13] In 2014, Paycom built a 90,000-square-foot addition to its headquarters—effectively doubling the size of its offices.[14] In 2016, the company completed construction on a third building, bringing the total square-footage of its office space to approximately 250,000.[15]
Awards and recognition[edit]
Paycom has been the recipient of numerous awards and recognition including the Service Bureau of the Year Award and being named to the Metro 50 List of Oklahoma companies with the largest growth from the previous two years.[1] Paycom was named a top workplace in Oklahoma by The Oklahoman for a fourth consecutive year, topping the list as Oklahoma's No. 1 workplace in 2016.[15] Paycom has also made Deloitte's Technology Fast 500 list for the previous two years.[15]
In 2010, it received a Stevie Award for Sales Department of the Year in the Financial Services category,[16] following up with another Stevie Award in 2011 for Best Sales Training Manager of the Year. Inc. has recognized Paycom as both a Top 100 Job Creator in 2012 and 2013[7] as well as one of the Fastest-Growing Private Companies for the years 2006 through 2014.[17] In 2014, Paycom was named to the inaugural Build 100, which recognizes less than 1.5 percent of U.S.-based companies that are noted as sustained-growth champions.[18]
Paycom ranked No. 28 among large businesses on Glassdoor's 2015 Best Places to Work in the U.S. list.[19] In 2013, Glassdoor named Paycom one of the Top Five Best Places to Work in the U.S.[20] and recognized Paycom again in 2014 as one of the Best Places to Work. Additionally, Paycom ranked in the Top 25 Most Difficult Companies To Interview list compiled by Glassdoor, a recognition shared with companies like Google, Facebook, and Microsoft.[21] The same year it received the EPCOR David DeMarea Payments Innovation Award.[22]
Paycom won HR.com's Leadership 500 Excellence Awards in 2015 after earning similar honors in 2014. Paycom earned its place in the midsize company rankings based on its outstanding achievements in leadership development and programs.[23]
