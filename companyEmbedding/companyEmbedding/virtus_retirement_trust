Investment Process Highlights




Step
1




Unlike many other target date vehicles, the Virtus DFA Target Date Retirement Income Funds redefine the problem in terms of income instead of account balance.  With this approach, savers and retirees may be better positioned to take the appropriate risk management measures against market volatility, inflation, and interest rate fluctuations.




Step
2




The Fund aims to provide diversification, rebalancing the portfolio as participants approach their target retirement dates. The Fund’s asset allocation gradually changes over time, holding more growth-focused assets when the target date is many years in the future, and more inflation-protected securities as it approaches.




Step
3




As retirees draw from their savings after the 2025 target date, the Fund remains focused on managing relevant risks, such as inflation or changes in interest rates.

Risk Considerations

Equity Securities: The market price of equity securities may be adversely affected by financial market, industry, or issuer-specific events. Focus on a particular style or on small or medium-sized companies may enhance that risk.
Credit & Interest: Debt securities are subject to various risks, the most prominent of which are credit and interest rate risk. The issuer of a debt security may fail to make interest and/or principal payments. Values of debt securities may rise or fall in response to changes in interest rates, and this risk may be enhanced with longer-term maturities.
Foreign & Emerging Markets: Investing internationally, especially in emerging markets, involves additional risks such as currency, political, accounting, economic, and market risk.
Inflation Protected Securities: Inflation Protected Securities may react differently from other debt securities to changes in interest rates.
Allocation: The fund's exposure to different asset classes may not be optimal for market conditions at a given time. Asset allocation does not guarantee a profit or protect against a loss in declining markets.
Fund of Funds: Because the fund can invest in other funds, it indirectly bears its proportionate share of the operating expenses and management fees of the underlying fund(s).
Prospectus: For additional information on risks, please see the fund's prospectus.

Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of any Virtus Mutual Fund before investing. The prospectus and summary prospectus contains this and other information about the fund. Please contact your financial representative, call 1-800-243-4361 or visit www.virtus.com to obtain a current prospectus and/or summary prospectus. You should read the prospectus and/or summary prospectus carefully before you invest or send money.
 Performance data quoted represents past results. Past performance is no guarantee of future results and current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Average annual total return is the annual compound return for the indicated period. It reflects the change in share price and the reinvestment of all dividends and capital gains. NAV returns do not include the effect of any applicable sales charges. POP and w/CDSC returns include the effect of maximum applicable sales charges.
Returns for periods of less than one year are cumulative total returns.
1 Yields/Distributions: Distribution Yield (at NAV) is calculated by (a) annualizing the latest distribution for fixed income funds or funds less than 1 year old (b) summing all distributions over the preceding 12 months for all other funds, and dividing the NAV on the last business date of the period. SEC Yield represents the net investment income earned by a fund over a 30-day period, expressed as an annual percentage rate based on the fund's public offering share price at the end of the 30-day period.  Gross SEC Yield represents the yield if there were no expense reimbursements.
2 Distribution History: Distributions are represented on a cash basis and may be reclassified at year end for tax purposes. The Fund will send you a Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell you how to report these distributions for federal income tax purposes. STCG: Short Term Capital Gain, LTCG: Long Term Capital Gain
3 Risk Statistics:  R2 is a statistical measure that represents the percentage of a fund or security's movements that can be explained by movements in a benchmark index. Beta is a quantitative measure of the volatility of a given portfolio to the overall market. Alpha is a risk adjusted measure of an investment's excess return relative to a benchmark. A positive Alpha indicates that the investment produced a return greater than expected for the risk (as measured by Beta) taken. Standard Deviation measures variability of returns around the average return for an investment fund. Higher standard deviation suggests greater risk. Risk Statistics are calculated using 36 monthly returns.
4 Characteristics: For Equity Funds: Trailing P/E: Per-share stock price divided by the latest12-months Earnings per Share; Price/Cash Flow: Per-share stock price divided by the per-share operating cash flow; Price/Book: Per-share stock price divided by the latest 12-month per-share Book Value; 3-Year EPS Growth Rate: Average of earnings per share growth for latest 3-year period. The 3-Year EPS Growth Rate is not a forecast of the fund's performance.  4 Characteristics: For Fixed Income Funds:  Duration represents the interest rate sensitivity of a fixed income fund. For example, if a fund's duration is five years, a 1% increase in interest rates would result in a 5% decline in the fund's price. Similarly, a 1% decline in interest rates would result in a 5% gain in the fund's price.
Morningstar Disclosures: The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

What is VIRTUS Online™?
Print



VIRTUS Online™ is the brand name that identifies a state-of-the-art, web-based 
platform that provides best practice resources 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Our system 
provides a comprehensive menu of functions for churches, religious organizations, and facilities 
from one convenient web-based resource. Through these functions we can help church organizations 
prevent wrongdoing, manage risk and improve service to community through education, training, 
and best practices. The home page (the page you are now viewing) is provided free of charge to 
anyone in the world with access to the Internet. The subscriber pages (pages requesting a user 
name and a password) are intended for users from organizations that subscribe to the 
VIRTUS® programs.


VIRTUS Online Supports Ongoing Training

Most training programs (seminars, instructor-led sessions, videos) establish awareness, but 
few change behavior. With the VIRTUS programs, the potential for successful behavioral change 
can be increased via our VIRTUS Online system. Every training program, in addition to 
instructor-led and video awareness sessions, provides ongoing web-based training. These 
regularly scheduled online bulletins and web-based training courses reinforce the knowledge 
points made during the awareness sessions. Moreover, every training program is tracked so the 
organization knows who has or has not trained. Plus, most of the online training bulletins and 
modules are interactive allowing trainees to contact and interact with a trainer.
