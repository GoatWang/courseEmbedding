Fitch Rates Ally Auto Receivables Trust 2016-2; Outlook Stable | Business Wire


























































      Fitch Rates Ally Auto Receivables Trust 2016-2; Outlook Stable
    





March 02, 2016 02:10 PM Eastern Standard Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings and Rating Outlooks to the 
      Ally Auto Receivables Trust 2016-2:
    

      --$257,000,000 class A-1 notes 'F1+sf';
    

      --$306,000,000 class A-2 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$306,000,000 class A-3 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$97,130,000 class A-4 notes 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$21,490,000 class B notes 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$17,910,000 class C notes 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$13,300,000 class D notes 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    

      Stable Collateral Quality: The 2016-2 collateral is comparable to that 
      of the last three transactions. While 2015-2016 AART pools had marginal 
      declines in weighted-average (WA) FICO scores and slightly higher annual 
      percentage rates (APRs), there have been positive shifts in certain 
      collateral characteristics, including lower loan-to-value ratios (LTVs), 
      stable new vehicle concentration and a decrease in longer term loans.
    

      Credit Enhancement: Initial hard credit enhancement (CE) is unchanged 
      from the prior three transactions, with 5.85% in hard CE for all classes 
      of notes. Excess spread per annum is 2.34%, consistent with the prior 
      AART transactions.
    

      Strong Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Ally's 2009-2015 portfolio 
      and securitization delinquencies and losses continue to perform well and 
      were at low historical levels through the fourth quarter of 2015 (4Q15).
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: Fitch currently rates 
      Ally Financial 'BB+/B' with a Stable Rating Outlook. Ally demonstrates 
      solid capabilities as an originator, underwriter, and servicer, as 
      evidenced by its historical portfolio and securitization performance. 
      Fitch deems Ally capable of adequately servicing 2016-2.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of Ally would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    

      Unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity 
      on defaulted receivables could produce loss levels higher than the base 
      case. This could result in potential rating actions on the notes. Fitch 
      evaluated the sensitivity of the ratings assigned to all classes of 
      2016-2 to increased losses over the life of the transaction. Fitch's 
      analysis found that the notes display limited sensitivity to increased 
      defaults and losses, showing no expected impact on the rating of the 
      class A notes under Fitch's moderate (1.5x base case loss) scenario. The 
      notes could experience a downgrade of one or more rating categories 
      under Fitch's severe (2.5x base case loss) scenario.
    

      DUE DILIGENCE USAGE
    

      Fitch was provided with third-party due diligence information from 
      Deloitte & Touche LLP. The third-party due diligence focused on 
      comparing or recomputing certain information with respect to 224 loans 
      from the computer generated automobile loan data file. Fitch considered 
      this information in its analysis and the findings did not have an impact 
      on our analysis. A copy of the ABS Due Diligence Form-15E received by 
      Fitch in connection with this transaction may be obtained through the 
      link contained on the bottom of the related rating action commentary.
    

      Fitch's analysis of the Representations and Warranties (R&W) of this 
      transaction can be found in the reports titled ' Ally Auto Receivables 
      Trust 2016-2 -- Appendix'. These R&W are compared to those of typical 
      R&W for the asset class as detailed in the special report 
      'Representations, Warranties, and Enforcement Mechanisms in Global 
      Structured Finance Transactions' dated Jan. 6, 2016.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
