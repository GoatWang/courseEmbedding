Comment Guidelines
 

        Comment Guidelines        


We encourage you to use comments to engage with users, share your perspective and ask questions of authors and each other. However, in order to maintain the high level of discourse we’ve all come to value and expect, please keep the following criteria in mind: 

Enrich the conversation
Stay focused and on track. Only post material that’s relevant to the topic being discussed.
Be respectful. Even negative opinions can be framed positively and diplomatically.
 Use standard writing style. Include punctuation and upper and lower cases.
NOTE: Spam and/or promotional messages and links within a comment will be removed
Avoid profanity, slander or personal attacks directed at an author or another user.
Don’t Monopolize the Conversation. We appreciate passion and conviction, but we also believe strongly in giving everyone a chance to air their thoughts. Therefore, in addition to civil interaction, we expect commenters to offer their opinions succinctly and thoughtfully, but not so repeatedly that others are annoyed or offended. If we receive complaints about individuals who take over a thread or forum, we reserve the right to ban them from the site, without recourse.
Only English comments will be allowed.

Perpetrators of spam or abuse will be deleted from the site and prohibited from future registration at Investing.com’s discretion. 
I have read Investing.com's comments guidelines and agree to the terms described.

I Agree

NABUFIT Global, Inc. Closes Equity Purchase Agreement With Kodiak Capital Group, LLC






GlobeNewswire



May 22, 2017 9:26 PM EDT













 


















































 OREM, Utah, May 22, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- On May 22, 2017, NABUFIT Global, Inc. ("NABUFIT" or the "Company"), (OTCQB:NBFT), an online fitness platform for health and well-being through physical exercise, nutrition, and lifestyle, announced that it has entered into an Equity Purchase Agreement with Kodiak Capital Group, LLC, a Newport Beach, California -based capital provider.  The Company has agreed to file a registration statement with the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission ("SEC") covering the shares that may be issued to Kodiak under the terms of the Equity Purchase Agreement.  After the SEC has declared the registration statement related to the transaction effective, the Company has the right at its sole discretion over a period of two years to sell up to 10,000,000 shares of common stock under the terms set forth in the Equity Purchase Agreement. Proceeds from this transaction will be used to fund further development of the online fitness platform and mobile application that connects to monitoring devices (commonly known as wearables). "We're very pleased to partner with Kodiak and welcome their investment and industry knowledge," commented Brian Palm Svaneeng Mertz, Chief Executive Officer of NABUFIT. "Kodiak recognizes that our product offers consumers custom workout plans created by professional athletes and nutrition experts.  Our products focus on basic, yet effective, programs that provide intelligent coaching and intensive training (alongside real-time data), that anyone can do on their own; ultimately augmenting or eliminating the need for a gym membership or personal trainer." Ryan Hodson, Managing Director of Kodiak, said, "NABUFIT's fitness technology allows users to take fitness into their own hands utilizing easy to use training guides.  Wearable adoption demand for smart devices continues to mature, especially fitness trackers, and NABUFIT has carved out a timely niche to take full advantage of the momentum and become a well-known brand.  Their proprietary training methods, application, and biometric device give users the real-time data they insist upon to accomplish weight loss, strength gain, or general healthy lifestyle objectives.  We look forward to our partnership and assisting them with their expansion."
