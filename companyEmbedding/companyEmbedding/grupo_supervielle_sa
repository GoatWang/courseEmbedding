BUENOS AIRES, Argentina--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Grupo Supervielle S.A. (NYSE: SUPV; BASE: SUPV), (“Supervielle” 
      or the “Company”) a universal financial services group headquartered in 
      Argentina with a nationwide presence, today reported unaudited results 
      for the three months period ended March 31, 2017. All figures presented 
      throughout this document are expressed in nominal Argentine pesos (AR$) 
      and all financial information has been prepared in accordance with 
      Argentine Banking GAAP.
    

First Quarter 2017 Highlights



        Net income of AR$381.9 million, up 118.6% YoY, and down 28.3% QoQ. 
        ROAE of 21.8% in 1Q17. This compares with ROAE of 27.5% in 1Q16 and 
        31.3% in 4Q16. ROAA of 2.6% in 1Q17, compared to 2.1% in 1Q16 and 4.1% 
        in 4Q16.
      

        Total gross loans, including the securitized loan portfolio, increased 
        62.5% YoY and 6.0% QoQ to AR$41.2 billion. Total balance sheet loans 
        grew at a higher rate of 71.0% YoY and 6.6% QoQ, reflecting the 
        anticipated slowdown in securitization.
      

        NIM of 18.7% in 1Q17, contracting by 130 bps YoY and 220 bps QoQ, 
        while AR$ NIM on the Company’s Loan Portfolio (excluding foreign trade 
        and US$ loans), which concentrates 85% of the portfolio, rose 240 bps 
        YoY to 23.4% in 1Q17, despite the decline in the BADLAR interest rate.
      

        Non-performing loan ratio increased 20 bps to 2.9% in 1Q17 from 2.7% 
        in 1Q16 and 10 bps from 2.8% in 4Q16.
      

        The efficiency ratio improved to 67.5% in 1Q17 compared with 73.8% in 
        1Q16, but deteriorated from 64.5% in 4Q16 due to seasonality.
      

        Proforma Consolidated Common Equity Tier 1 Ratio of 12.0% in 1Q17 
        compared to 7.2% in 1Q16 and 12.3% in 4Q16. Equity to Asset ratio of 
        11.3% in 1Q17 compared to 7.3% in 1Q16 and 13.0% in 4Q16.
      


CEO Message


      Commenting on first quarter results, Patricio Supervielle, Grupo 
      Supervielle’s Chairman and CEO, noted: "We reported solid results in 
      the first quarter, as we continued to execute our profitable growth 
      strategy. We have a healthy balance sheet and over the past year have 
      successfully raised equity and debt in international capital markets and 
      are deploying these proceeds to drive loan growth - up 62.5% YoY, 
      significantly above market.”


“As further evidence of progress achieved in implementing our 
      strategy, we more than doubled net income year-on-year. On a QoQ basis, 
      a one-time non-recurring item in each 4Q16 and 1Q17, along with 
      seasonality, impacted the comparability of results. As a reminder, our 
      results tend to be lower in the first quarter and accelerate towards the 
      second half of the year. Excluding these non-recurring items, net income 
      for the quarter would have fallen only 5.8% sequentially.”


“We are also making progress on our initiatives to step up digital 
      innovation and build out our core product leadership into integral 
      customer relationships. An important step was our launch of the first 
      SME-dedicated Check Depositing and Discounting App in Argentina, 
      introducing a new cash management solution during the quarter. Given the 
      attractiveness of this segment, we recently introduced the exclusive 
      “Visa Distribution Vinos” credit card as we took another step towards 
      developing our attractive value proposition in the dynamic winery 
      industry in the province of Mendoza, renewing our leadership commitment 
      in this province. We are also pleased with the launch of an exclusive 
      strategic alliance with the leading online real estate search portal in 
      the country to expand our reach in the mortgage segment beyond our 
      current client base.”


“Looking ahead, we remain cautiously optimistic of Argentina’s 
      economic recovery, despite slightly higher than expected inflation in 
      the first quarter, and maintain our guidance for 2017. We remain 
      vigilant on asset quality, closely monitoring our risk profile, while we 
      continue to drive profitable growth. We are confident in our ability to 
      deliver on our growth strategy as we continue to maximize opportunities 
      we see in our core businesses - SMEs, middle market, retail and consumer 
      finance while leveraging our under-utilized infrastructure.”

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar turns lower for the week following GDP report
              
              The U.S. dollar fell on Friday, erasing its gains for the week after a read on economic growth came in below expectations, though analysts said the beleaguered currency was potentially nearing a bottom.

We estimate that our net proceeds from the sale of Class B shares in the
global offering, assuming the placement of all shares offered and no exercise of
the international underwriters' option to purchase additional shares, will be
approximately US$200 million, after deducting estimated underwriting fees and
transaction expenses payable by us, based on an offering price per Class B share
of US$2.20 and per ADS of US$11.00, the price set forth in the cover of this
prospectus.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of Class B shares by the
selling shareholder.

We intend to use the net proceeds from the global offering for the following
purposes:

(i) primarily to increase the volume of assets and loans of our subsidiaries to
    sustain our expansion process and strengthen our position within the
    Argentine financial system. For example, to the extent opportunities to
    increase our assets and loans through acquisitions in the Argentine banking,
    asset management or insurance sectors arise, we may apply a portion of the
    net proceeds to harness those opportunities, although as of the date of this
    prospectus we have no current plans, arrangements or understandings to make
    any material acquisition; and

(ii) we intend to retain up to US$40.0 million at the holding company level to
     redeem or cancel at maturity each series of our outstanding notes due on or
     prior to January 28, 2017 issued by Grupo Supervielle in the Argentine
     capital markets.

The foregoing represents our current intentions with respect to the use and
allocation of the net proceeds of this offering based on our present plans and
business condition. The amounts and timing of any expenditure may vary depending
on the amount of cash generated by our operations, competitive developments, our
rate of growth and inorganic growth opportunities, if any, of our business.
Therefore, as of the date of this prospectus, we cannot estimate the amounts or
timing in respect of any of the purposes for the use of proceeds listed above.

Pending the use of the net proceeds of this offering as described above, we may
invest the net proceeds of this offering in Central Bank notes.


Retail Banking, Corporate Banking and Treasury

The Argentine financial system remains highly fragmented compared to the rest of
Latin America.

In 1999, the Argentine financial system had 116 financial entities. This number
decreased to 100 in 2002 and 89 in 2005. As of December 31, 2015, this number
stood at 78, of which 62 were banks (13 public and 49 private). In terms of 
ownership, in 1999 Argentine and foreign entities each held 41.3% of the
Argentine banks while the remaining 17.3% of the banks were held by the public
sector. As of December 31, 2015, while the participation of the public sector
remained stable at 21.0%, the portion of banks controlled by Argentine entities
represented 51.6% and the portion of banks controlled by foreign entities 
represented 27.4%.

In 1999, there were 17 financial companies, nine of which were controlled by
Argentine entities and eight of which were controlled by foreign entities, and
seven credit unions. As of December 31, 2015, the number of financial companies
had decreased to 15, six of which were controlled by Argentine entities and nine
of which were controlled by foreign entities, and only one credit union
remained.

As of December 31, 2015, the largest private bank in terms of bank assets in
Argentina held a 8.3% share of the total bank assets in the financial system and
the five largest banks (including private and public banks) in terms of assets
held a 54.6% share, higher than the 48.7% share held in 2001. Banking systems in
other Latin American countries are even more concentrated. As of December 31,
2015, the five largest banks (including private and public banks) in terms of
assets held a 69.4% share of total bank assets in Brazil, 72.8% in Chile, 61.8%
in Colombia, 71.0% in Mexico, and 78.4% in Peru.

Competitive Framework

The Bank was one of the top 15 private banks in the Argentine financial system
with respect to loans, deposits, assets and equity as of December 31, 2015, as

The Bank faces a high degree of competition in virtually all core financial
products with respect to pricing (interest rate or fee) and term. The Bank's
strategy in the face of this competition is to maintain aggressive business
policies, differentiate itself with respect to product offering and customer
service, and redesign processes for greater sales productivity.

Notwithstanding this competitive challenge, our strategy for growth, both
organic and through acquisitions, has resulted in an 85.2% increase in our
financial system market share (excluding public banks) and a 66.9% increase in
our private bank loan market share since 2005. Throughout this period, we gained
some of the market share lost by several of our larger competitors.

Consumer Financing

CCF offers its products primarily to the middle and lower-middle-income sectors.
CCF's main competitors can be divided into two groups: (1) those that are not
subject to Central Bank oversight such as Provencred, Tarjeta Naranja, Tarjetas
Cuyanas, Credial and Tarjeta Shopping and (2) those that are subject to Central
Bank oversight such as Compañía Financiera Argentina and BST CrediLogros.

With respect to its Walmart Argentina private label credit card, CCF's
primary competitors in terms of the types of products offered are Tarjeta Más
(issued at Jumbo and Easy and used in Jumbo, Easy, Disco, Vea and Blaisten),
Tarjeta Carrefour (issued and used exclusively at Carrefour) and Tarjeta Coto
(issued and used exclusively at Coto). However, unlike its competitors, CCF was
the first to also issue an open MasterCard credit card, allowing CCF to operate
in the banking and retail sectors. Currently, Tarjeta Más is the only other
competitor with a similar strategy. In addition, CCF is the sole provider of
in-store personal cash loans and consumer loans that may be granted and used
immediately at the retail stores.

Tarjeta's competitors vary in terms of region and type of product. Competitors
in the lending space include Compañía Financiera Argentina, BST CrediLogros,
Banco Columbia, Credil, Corefin and Empresur. In terms of the credit card space,
Tarjeta's main competitor is Tarjeta Naranja, followed by regional competitors
such as Nevada and Credimas.

With respect to the products offered through the Hipertehuelche channel, even
though there are no financial companies dedicated solely to the construction
sector, CCF's competitors include CETELEM, Cuota sí (CFA), DIRECTO and Cuota YA.
However, these competitors do not operate in the Patagonia region where
Hipertehuelche operates, and are competitors only with respect to the types of
products offered.

Mutual Funds and Microfinance Markets

With respect to the mutual fund market, based on third party sources we
estimate our market share is 2.6% and that SAM is ranked 16th out of 43 managers
in the industry. Our main competitors are Galicia Administradora de
Fondos S.A.S.G.F.C.I., Macro Fondos S.G.F.C.I.S.A., ICBC
Investments S.A.S.G.F.C.I., Francés Administradora de Inversiones S.A.G.F.C.I.,
Itaú Asset Management S.A.S.G.F.C.I., HSBC Administradora de
Inversiones S.A.S.G.F.C.I., BNP Paribas Asset Management Arg S.A.S.G.F.C.I. and
Santander Río Asset Management G.F.C.I.S.A.

There are no official statistics with respect to the microfinance market in
which Cordial Microfinanzas operates. According to private estimates, Cordial
Microfinanzas has one of the largest networks of branches and is first in terms
of portfolio size and number of customers. As of June 2014, there were 39
microfinance institutions in Argentina, of which non-governmental organizations
("NGOs") make up the great majority, with only a few corporations. NGOs have a
diversified geographic presence and are linked in some cases with public
institutions and the development of government policies concerning unemployment
and local development. The major players are Cordial, FIE Gran Poder,
Emprenda S.A., OMLA S.A. Provincia Microempresa S.A. and Ciudad
Microempresas S.A., which accounted for approximately 88.5% of the total current
portfolio, according to the Argentine Network of Microfinance Institutions (Red
Argentina de Instituciones de Microcrédito, "RADIM") as of June 2014.

We are a universal and integrated Financial Services platform, with a nationwide distribution network.

Business model
We offer diverse financial products and services that are specifically tailored to cover the different needs of our customers through a multi-brand and multi-channel platform. We have developed a multi-brand business model to differentiate the financial products and services we offer to a wide spectrum of individuals, small and medium-sized enterprises ("SMEs") and medium to large-sized companies in Argentina.
We deliver tailored value propositions in each of the key business segments in which we operate.


Corporate Segment
Retail Banking

Cross-Selling Segments


Corporate Segment


We have a strong value proposition with SME and middle market customers based on:

Our outstanding transactional and cash management services
The development of strategic partnerships with key industry players and their critical providers and suppliers along their value chains (agricultural, wine, energy, infrastructure)
Quick decision-making with respect to our credit evaluation process, and personal attention.





Retail Banking



Our retail segment is customer oriented, with two differentiated distribution networks:


The Bank’s branches that service retail clients, mostly located in high income locations in the City and Province of Buenos Aires, as well as in the Cuyo region.
A dedicated infrastructure of 78 senior citizens service centers enable us to be the largest player in this space, with customized offers of financial & non-financial services catered to its specific needs, low delinquency, low cost and stable funding and high customer loyalty.

                                In consumer finance, the main distribution channel is Walmart, with presence in 66 stores and over 369 thousand customers.
                            


                                    WM strategic partnership provides access to the middle and low‐income population

                                We consistently seek to leverage the strong cross-selling potential of our multi-brand and multi-channel business model and our stable pool of over two million customers. Through our multi-brand and multichannel approach, we are able to cross-sell and create synergies across our segments. Bancassurance specifically allows us to cross-sell value added insurance products in compliance with the regulations of the National Superintendency of Insurance (Superintendencia de Seguros de la Naci´on) and of the Central Bank, as applicable. Additionally, our 127 consumer finance points of sale offer an attractive platform for cross-selling certain credit cards and loans. We cross-sell non-financial services and products such as insurance products and plans, tourism packages, health insurance and health services, electric appliances and furniture, and alarm systems through Espacio Cordial and our senior citizen service centers.
                            










Our Digital Innovation Strategy

We intend to expand our digital banking channel and online banking platform. Our goal is to offer an outstanding digital experience to our clients. We intend to continue to increase the number of active online users and to migrate our services to digital channels, which we expect will allow us to increase low-cost distribution and convert service centers into full bank branches. We also intend to continue launching mobile banking applications, which will enable “one click” payment and "one click" loan functionalities, with anytime and everywhere financial services and provide alerts and messages to customers in order to achieve cost efficiencies through low-cost social network advertising.
In 2016, we created the Digital Innovation Unit. Ongoing technological evolution has given rise to a digital revolution which has a deep impact in the financial system. Changes in customer preferences indicate profound changes in the Banking industry in the future. With this view, the Digital Innovation Unit aims at establishing a deep and dynamic research process for the creation of value for new generations and profiles of users. The Digital Innovation Unit participates in the development of new tools (products or services) generated internally and/or with the participation in the so-called FINTECH companies.
