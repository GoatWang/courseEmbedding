Rodda, and J.A. SavidgeSuggested Citation: Christy, M.T., R. Bischof, G.H. Rodda, and J.A. Savidge. 2007. Can temperature be used as a tool for limiting Brown Treesnake invasion via transportation pathways?. Managing Vertebrate Invasive Species – Proceedings of a Symposium, Fort Collins, Colorado, August 7-9, 2007. Fort Collins, CO: National Wildlife Research Center. p. 246-256. The use of extreme temperatures is one of the few chemical residue-free techniques available for control of pest species and has proven fast and effective in a variety of applications. We determined the upper and lower lethal temperatures for the brown treesnake. We also investigated whether gender, size, body condition and exposure time influenced survival at temperature extremes…

Description


Additional Information


Product Information PDFs







Generac Guardian 16kW Standby Generator NG/LP Single Phase Steel | 6459
Provides essential circuit power protection for your home, ensuring the necessities remain powered during an outage or up to whole house coverage when paired with one of Generac’s load- shedding switches. Capable of backing up a five ton air conditioner.  (Transfer Switches Sold Separately.)
Features & Benefits:
Generac OHVI® Engine:  Your Guardian Series generator might have to get you through days—or weeks—without utility power. Generac’s OHVI® engine, specifically designed for generator use, provides the reliability to power through the most severe outages.
Evolution™ Controller:  The next generation of intuitive controllers featuring a multilingual, two-line LCD text display with color-coded, backlit buttons.
Certified for 18″ Installation to the Home:  Third-party certified to NFPA standards to be installed as close as 18” from the home’s exterior wall, provided it is located away from doors, windows, and fresh-air intakes, and unless otherwise directed by local codes.
Easy Installation:  When combined with a pre-wired transfer switch or Smart Switch, re-engineered connection points, and composite mounting pad that eliminates the need for a poured concrete base (unless specified by local codes), the Guardian Series 16 kW generator is easy to install.
Rated for Operation in Areas with Low Natural Gas Pressure:  In areas with low natural gas pressure, the Guardian Series 16 kW generator can operate on natural gas pressures of only 3.5” of water column.
All-Weather Steel Enclosure:  Our durable powder-coat finish helps make the sturdy, galvanneal steel enclosure perfect for all weather confitions. It’s also able to withstand 150 mph winds. Optional aluminum available on Model 6721, recommended for salt-air locations.
Tool-less Fuel Conversion:  Switch between natural gas and LP fuel in the field in a few seconds, without the need for any tools.
True Power™ Technology:  Best-in-class power quality with less than 5% total harmonic distortion means clean, smooth operation of your sensitive electronics and appliances.
Quick, Quiet Exercise Test:  Standby generators require a short run-time periodically, known as exercise, to test and ensure the system is functioning properly and ready for an emergency. The Guardian 16 kW self-test runs for only twelve minutes. Choose your schedule – weekly, bi-weekly or monthly.
Mobile Link™ Compatible:  Take advantage of Generac’s Mobile Link cellular remote monitoring system and check on your generator’s status using your computer, tablet or smartphone, even when you are away. Sold separately.
24/7/365 Customer Support:  Power outages don’t always occur during normal working hours. That’s why Generac’s customer care call center—right here in Wisconsin—provides support any time of day or night, all year long. Generac is standing by 24/7, every minute of every day, to answer your questions.
