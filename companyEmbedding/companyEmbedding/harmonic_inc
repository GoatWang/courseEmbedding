Harmonic Inc. is an American technology company that develops and markets video routing, server, and storage products for companies that produce, process, and distribute video content for television and the Internet.[1]

4 References



History[edit]
Harmonic was initially incorporated in California in June 1988 as Harmonic Lightwaves, and reincorporated into Delaware in May 1995. Anthony J. Ley became chief executive in November 1988. Co-founder Moshe Nazarathy led a research and development center named "Harmonic Data" in Israel starting in 1993, funded in part by the Israel-U.S. Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation.[2]
Harmonic acquired the DiviCom business of C-Cube Microsystems in 2000 for about $1.7 billion in stock.[3] It acquired the video networking software business of Entone Technologies in 2006 for about $45 million,[4] Rhozet Corporation in 2007, and Scopus Video Networks, Ltd. in 2009.[5]
Omneon Video Networks was founded in May 1998, with investors including Advanced Technology Ventures, Norwest Venture Partners, Accel Partners and Invesco.[6] Omneon co-founder Donald M. Craig designed products that won Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards in 1988 and 1996. On December 29, 2006 Omneon filed for an initial public offering,[7][8] and tried again several times in 2007[9][10] and 2008 after dropping the "Video Networks" from its name,[11] but remained private.[12] On May 6, 2010 Omneon announced it agreed to be acquired by Harmonic for an estimated $274 million.[13]
Harmonic sold its line of fiber-optic access products to Aurora Networks in February 2013 for $46 million in cash.[14][15]
In March 2016 Harmonic acquired Thomson Video Networks.[16]
Products[edit]
Harmonic’s products fall into four principal categories; video production products, video server products for playout, video processing products, and cable edge products. Video production products are used to support video editing, post-production and finishing. Server systems are used to assemble and play out one or more channel systems. Video processing products are used by media companies, broadcasters, telcos, satellite operators, cable operators, and OTT operators to acquire and use different types and sources of video signals. Cable edge products are used by cable operators to deliver customized broadcast or on-demand and data services to their subscribers.[17]
The company supplies cable television headend or hub devices that receive digital video or data from the operator network, re-packetizes the video or data into an MPEG transport stream, then digitally modulates the MPEG transport stream onto a downstream RF channel using quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM).[18]
Harmonic sells its products to cable, satellite and telco, and broadcast and media companies. In 2012, United States customers included Cablevision Systems, CenturyLink, Charter Communications, Comcast Corporation, Cox Communications, DirecTV, EchoStar Holding, TRC Integration, Time Warner Cable, and Turner Broadcasting. Customers outside the United States include Alcatel-Lucent, Bell TV, Capella Telecommunications, Huawei Technologies, Klonex – VCS, Netorium, Rogers Communications, SKY Perfect JSAT Corporation, Virgin Media, and Ziggo.[19]
Competitors[edit]
Harmonic’s video infrastructure competitors include vertically integrated system suppliers, such as Motorola, Cisco Systems, Ericsson, and, in certain product lines, a number of smaller companies, including Envivio, RGB Networks (now Imagine Communications), Elemental Technologies and Appear TV and ATEME. In production and playout products, competitors include Harris (now Imagine Communications), Grass Valley, Miranda and Avid Technology. In edge devices, competitors include Motorola Mobility (acquired by Google in 2012), Cisco Systems, and Arris.

Harmonic Inc. is an American technology company that develops and markets video routing, server, and storage products for companies that produce, process, and distribute video content for television and the Internet.[1]

History[edit]
Harmonic was initially incorporated in California in June 1988 as Harmonic Lightwaves, and reincorporated into Delaware in May 1995. Anthony J. Ley became chief executive in November 1988. Co-founder Moshe Nazarathy led a research and development center named "Harmonic Data" in Israel starting in 1993, funded in part by the Israel-U.S. Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation.[2]
Harmonic acquired the DiviCom business of C-Cube Microsystems in 2000 for about $1.7 billion in stock.[3] It acquired the video networking software business of Entone Technologies in 2006 for about $45 million,[4] Rhozet Corporation in 2007, and Scopus Video Networks, Ltd. in 2009.[5]
Omneon Video Networks was founded in May 1998, with investors including Advanced Technology Ventures, Norwest Venture Partners, Accel Partners and Invesco.[6] Omneon co-founder Donald M. Craig designed products that won Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards in 1988 and 1996. On December 29, 2006 Omneon filed for an initial public offering,[7][8] and tried again several times in 2007[9][10] and 2008 after dropping the "Video Networks" from its name,[11] but remained private.[12] On May 6, 2010 Omneon announced it agreed to be acquired by Harmonic for an estimated $274 million.[13]
Harmonic sold its line of fiber-optic access products to Aurora Networks in February 2013 for $46 million in cash.[14][15]
In March 2016 Harmonic acquired Thomson Video Networks.[16]
Products[edit]
Harmonic’s products fall into four principal categories; video production products, video server products for playout, video processing products, and cable edge products. Video production products are used to support video editing, post-production and finishing. Server systems are used to assemble and play out one or more channel systems. Video processing products are used by media companies, broadcasters, telcos, satellite operators, cable operators, and OTT operators to acquire and use different types and sources of video signals. Cable edge products are used by cable operators to deliver customized broadcast or on-demand and data services to their subscribers.[17]
The company supplies cable television headend or hub devices that receive digital video or data from the operator network, re-packetizes the video or data into an MPEG transport stream, then digitally modulates the MPEG transport stream onto a downstream RF channel using quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM).[18]
Harmonic sells its products to cable, satellite and telco, and broadcast and media companies. In 2012, United States customers included Cablevision Systems, CenturyLink, Charter Communications, Comcast Corporation, Cox Communications, DirecTV, EchoStar Holding, TRC Integration, Time Warner Cable, and Turner Broadcasting. Customers outside the United States include Alcatel-Lucent, Bell TV, Capella Telecommunications, Huawei Technologies, Klonex – VCS, Netorium, Rogers Communications, SKY Perfect JSAT Corporation, Virgin Media, and Ziggo.[19]
Competitors[edit]
Harmonic’s video infrastructure competitors include vertically integrated system suppliers, such as Motorola, Cisco Systems, Ericsson, and, in certain product lines, a number of smaller companies, including Envivio, RGB Networks (now Imagine Communications), Elemental Technologies and Appear TV and ATEME. In production and playout products, competitors include Harris (now Imagine Communications), Grass Valley, Miranda and Avid Technology. In edge devices, competitors include Motorola Mobility (acquired by Google in 2012), Cisco Systems, and Arris.

Harmonic's stock tumbles 11% to 7 1/2-month low after slashing Q2 outlook
Harmonic's stock tumbles 11% to 7 1/2-month low after slashing Q2 outlook

Harmonic slashes Q2 outlook
Harmonic Inc.  slashed its outlook for second-quarter results, as an acceleration in its over-the-top software-as-a-service (OTT SaaS) business weighed on results. The video delivery infrastructure company said it now expects an adjusted per-share loss in the range of 21 cents to 19 cents, compared with a previous outlook provided in May of a per-share loss of 4 cents to breakeven. Revenue is now expected to be $80.0 million to $82.0 million, down from previous guidance of $94.5 million to $102.5 million. The FactSet consensus was for a per-share loss of 2 cents and revenue of $98.3 million. "Market demand for video infrastructure delivered through software subscription and cloud services is accelerating," said Chief Executive Patrick Harshman. "While this improvement in OTT SaaS activity reduced revenue and profitability for the quarter, we believe it will establish a trajectory for more predictable future financial performance in our Video segment." The stock, which was still inactive in premarket trade, has shed 6.4% over the past three months, while the S&P 500  has gained 5.1%.

Harmonic shares plunge on weak first-quarter results
Shares of Harmonic Inc.  skidded in Monday's extended session after the video services company posted quarterly results that fell short of Wall Street's expectations. Harmonic reported its first-quarter loss narrowed fractionally to $24.3 million, or 30 cents a share, from a loss of $25.2 million, or 33 cents a share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company would have lost 14 cents a share. Revenue edged up to $82.9 million from $81.8 million a year ago. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast a loss of 5 cents a share on revenue of $93.1 million. Harmonic projected a loss of 4 cents a share to break even, on an adjusted basis, in the second quarter, below analysts' estimates. Shares sank 12% after hours.

History[edit]
Harmonic was initially incorporated in California in June 1988 as Harmonic Lightwaves, and reincorporated into Delaware in May 1995. Anthony J. Ley became chief executive in November 1988. Co-founder Moshe Nazarathy led a research and development center named "Harmonic Data" in Israel starting in 1993, funded in part by the Israel-U.S. Binational Industrial Research and Development Foundation.[2]
Harmonic acquired the DiviCom business of C-Cube Microsystems in 2000 for about $1.7 billion in stock.[3] It acquired the video networking software business of Entone Technologies in 2006 for about $45 million,[4] Rhozet Corporation in 2007, and Scopus Video Networks, Ltd. in 2009.[5]
Omneon Video Networks was founded in May 1998, with investors including Advanced Technology Ventures, Norwest Venture Partners, Accel Partners and Invesco.[6] Omneon co-founder Donald M. Craig designed products that won Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards in 1988 and 1996. On December 29, 2006 Omneon filed for an initial public offering,[7][8] and tried again several times in 2007[9][10] and 2008 after dropping the "Video Networks" from its name,[11] but remained private.[12] On May 6, 2010 Omneon announced it agreed to be acquired by Harmonic for an estimated $274 million.[13]
Harmonic sold its line of fiber-optic access products to Aurora Networks in February 2013 for $46 million in cash.[14][15]
In March 2016 Harmonic acquired Thomson Video Networks.[16]
Products[edit]
Harmonic’s products fall into four principal categories; video production products, video server products for playout, video processing products, and cable edge products. Video production products are used to support video editing, post-production and finishing. Server systems are used to assemble and play out one or more channel systems. Video processing products are used by media companies, broadcasters, telcos, satellite operators, cable operators, and OTT operators to acquire and use different types and sources of video signals. Cable edge products are used by cable operators to deliver customized broadcast or on-demand and data services to their subscribers.[17]
The company supplies cable television headend or hub devices that receive digital video or data from the operator network, re-packetizes the video or data into an MPEG transport stream, then digitally modulates the MPEG transport stream onto a downstream RF channel using quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM).[18]
Harmonic sells its products to cable, satellite and telco, and broadcast and media companies. In 2012, United States customers included Cablevision Systems, CenturyLink, Charter Communications, Comcast Corporation, Cox Communications, DirecTV, EchoStar Holding, TRC Integration, Time Warner Cable, and Turner Broadcasting. Customers outside the United States include Alcatel-Lucent, Bell TV, Capella Telecommunications, Huawei Technologies, Klonex – VCS, Netorium, Rogers Communications, SKY Perfect JSAT Corporation, Virgin Media, and Ziggo.[19]
Competitors[edit]
Harmonic’s video infrastructure competitors include vertically integrated system suppliers, such as Motorola, Cisco Systems, Ericsson, and, in certain product lines, a number of smaller companies, including Envivio, RGB Networks (now Imagine Communications), Elemental Technologies and Appear TV and ATEME. In production and playout products, competitors include Harris (now Imagine Communications), Grass Valley, Miranda and Avid Technology. In edge devices, competitors include Motorola Mobility (acquired by Google in 2012), Cisco Systems, and Arris.

Harmonic's stock tumbles 11% to 7 1/2-month low after slashing Q2 outlook
Harmonic's stock tumbles 11% to 7 1/2-month low after slashing Q2 outlook

Jul. 14, 2017 at 9:33 a.m. ET

Harmonic slashes Q2 outlook
Harmonic Inc.  slashed its outlook for second-quarter results, as an acceleration in its over-the-top software-as-a-service (OTT SaaS) business weighed on results. The video delivery infrastructure company said it now expects an adjusted per-share loss in the range of 21 cents to 19 cents, compared with a previous outlook provided in May of a per-share loss of 4 cents to breakeven. Revenue is now expected to be $80.0 million to $82.0 million, down from previous guidance of $94.5 million to $102.5 million. The FactSet consensus was for a per-share loss of 2 cents and revenue of $98.3 million. "Market demand for video infrastructure delivered through software subscription and cloud services is accelerating," said Chief Executive Patrick Harshman. "While this improvement in OTT SaaS activity reduced revenue and profitability for the quarter, we believe it will establish a trajectory for more predictable future financial performance in our Video segment." The stock, which was still inactive in premarket trade, has shed 6.4% over the past three months, while the S&P 500  has gained 5.1%.

Harmonic shares plunge on weak first-quarter results
Shares of Harmonic Inc.  skidded in Monday's extended session after the video services company posted quarterly results that fell short of Wall Street's expectations. Harmonic reported its first-quarter loss narrowed fractionally to $24.3 million, or 30 cents a share, from a loss of $25.2 million, or 33 cents a share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company would have lost 14 cents a share. Revenue edged up to $82.9 million from $81.8 million a year ago. Analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast a loss of 5 cents a share on revenue of $93.1 million. Harmonic projected a loss of 4 cents a share to break even, on an adjusted basis, in the second quarter, below analysts' estimates. Shares sank 12% after hours.

File-Based Workflow Engine
WFS Take control of your high-volume transcoding tasks

 






The WFS™ file-based workflow engine from Harmonic delivers powerful, intuitive control of carrier-grade transcoding farms for broadcast and over-the-top video production and delivery.
The software-based WFS system is used to control multiple ProMedia™ Carbon and ProMedia Xpress transcoding nodes. Open and extensible, WFS possesses a distributed nature that grants reliability and scalability while allowing the automated processing of transcoding tasks, failover support, job distribution management, job prioritization, load balancing, file transfer, status monitoring, and job notification. With the addition of the Conditional Workflows (CWF) service module, users can add an automated and scalable condition-check process to their transcoding farm.


Highlights


Controls ProMedia Carbon and ProMedia Xpress transcoding farms

Enables cloud transcoding via Encoding.com


Supports failover to a backup system in case of a system outage or physical server failure


Transfer files over FTP, HTTP, CIFS and Amazon S3


Monitors FTP, CIFS and Amazon S3 storage locations to trigger new workflow event

WFS Features


Advanced Architecture
WFS separates the workflow and automation processes from the transcoder, allowing a much more robust and scalable architecture than previously available. An open API allows traditional outside integration, as well as the ability for third-party applications to integrate into WFS.
Integration and Management
WFS allows a set of tasks to be executed in any order with full visibility into the entire process. It can be used for the simplest tasks to complicated workflows that include multiple transcodes and condition checks, file transfers, and the triggering of external scripts and notifications.


Simplified File-Based Workflows
WFS can manage the movement of files over FTP, HTTP and CIFS, and via the Amazon S3 cloud file-storage service. It includes a broad range of built-in functionality to optimize workflows, including the ability to monitor FTP, CFS and Amazon S3 storage locations, trigger new workflow events, and provide notifications.

Electra 9200 Features


Advanced Compression Performance
The Harmonic Hierarchical LookAhead™ multi-pass encoding architecture employs market-leading ASIC and programmable DSP/FPGA technologies to provide superior video quality at the lowest possible bitrates. This silicon architecture also provides high-quality deinterlacing.
Integrated Secondary Output
A secondary output on Electra 9200 effectively doubles encoder capacity while offering support for hybrid applications such as down-converting the main channel from HD to SD, or providing a primary VBR channel and a secondary CBR channel (or vice versa).
Internal Video Crosspoint Router
A flexible internal video router can feed any Electra 9200 processing module from any SDI or compressed source, reducing system complexity and increasing operational flexibility.




Integrated Statmux
The Electra 9200 streamlines system architectures and reduces the hardware footprint with Flextream MX (formerly DiviTrackMX™), Harmonic’s widely deployed integrated statistical multiplexing solution.
High-Quality Integrated Decoding Option
The FLEX® dual decoder option delivers highly flexible video and audio decoding capabilities for Electra and Ion™ encoders. A single FLEX module decodes up to two incoming channels of H.264 or MPEG-2 in either SD or HD 4:2:0 formats, eliminating dependency on ingress formats.
Comprehensive Audio Tools
The Electra 9200 supports embedded audio and natively encodes up to three stereo pairs (or a single multichannel encode) of MPEG-1 Layer II audio. Optional audio input modules extend the Electra 9200’s functionality and density to address a variety of audio processing scenarios.

ViBE CP3000 Features


Pristine Video Quality
The ability to encode 1080p60 content in AVC 4:2:2 10-bit enables the transmission of exceptionally vivid video, augmenting your ability to offer customers the highest video quality available.

Low CAPEX, Reduced OPEX
The integrated modulator in the ViBE CP3200 and 3202 eliminates the need to purchase costly external stand-alone devices for satellite uplink. Second-generation DVB-S2X support on the Ellipse 3202 offers improved performance for DSNG and contribution applications, and enables efficient migration to emerging technologies such as HEVC and Ultra HD.

Integrated Broadcast Satellite Modulator
The on-board modulator on the ViBE CP3200 offers DVB-S/S2/DSNG transmission modes; the ViBE CP3202 supports DVB-S2X as well. Both the devices offer QPSK, 8PSK, 16QAM and 16APSK modulation. The encoders support IF or L-band outputs, which can directly feed the up-converter, providing a very compact uplink package.








Contribution Over the Internet

With support for broadcast-quality video contribution over unmanaged networks, ViBE CP3000 dramatically alters the economics of gathering and distributing news and sports content from locations with Internet access.


Content Protection

ViBE CP3000 encoders help prevent signal interception with industry-standard BISS mode 1 and BISS-E encryption. The devices support the new Carrier ID system (DVB-CID) currently under development, making it easier to identify interfering carriers and respond to a radio frequency interference event — improving quality of service and reducing operating costs.


End-to-End High-Quality Contribution
ViBE CP3000 encoders are the perfect complement to Harmonic’s ProView™ 7100 and ProView 8100 integrated receiver-decoders. Compress AVC HD 4:2:2 10-bit video with the ViBE CP3000, then use the ProView 7100 for decompression at the same sampling and bitrate, resulting in a contribution workflow with nearly lossless video quality.
