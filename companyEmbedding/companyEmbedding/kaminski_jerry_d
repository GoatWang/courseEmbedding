 WISCONSIN RAPIDS, Wis., June 4 /PRNewswire/ -- Northland
Cranberries, Inc. (Nasdaq: CBRYA), the world's largest cranberry
grower and manufacturer of Northland brand 100% juice cranberry blends,
today announced the appointment of board member and General Mills
executive Jerold D. Kaminski to the position of company president and
chief operating officer. John Swendrowski will remain chairman of the
board and chief executive officer.

 According to Swendrowski, "The appointment of Jerry Kaminski
to the position of president and chief operating officer of Northland
represents the next logical step in our 'marsh to market'
vertical integration strategy. Our branded 100% juice product line is
approaching national distribution and our focus must now turn to
implementing a comprehensive tactical marketing plan over the long term.
Mr. Kaminski has the depth of experience and demonstrated expertise in
the marketing of consumer food products to guide our efforts in the
branded juice arena, as well as to oversee our entry into the private
label juice products market. For the past three years, we were able to
benefit immensely from his contributions as an integral member of
Northland's Board of Directors. Today, we are very pleased to make
the announcement of his acceptance of the presidency position."

 Mr. Kaminski stated that he felt "... honored and privileged
to be considered for the presidency of Northland. The company has a
remarkable performance record to date and an even greater potential for
future growth. I'm looking forward to joining John Swendrowski and
his management team. Together, we will work toward building Northland
into one of the leaders in the food and beverage products
industry."

 Jerry D. Kaminski joins Northland directly from his position as
Corporate Vice President and Director of Marketing for the Gold Medal
Division of General Mills Corporation (NYSE: GIS), based in Minneapolis.
A Wisconsin native, Mr. Kaminski received his Bachelor of Arts Degree in
Accounting and Finance from the University of Wisconsin - Madison in
1979 and his MBA from Kellogg Graduate School of Management at
Northwestern University in 1986. He joined General Mills, Inc. in 1979
as a financial analyst and subsequently advanced through various
marketing positions within most of General Mills divisions, managing
such businesses as Gold Medal Flour, Bisquick, Golden Grahams and
Cinnamon Toast Crunch Cereals. In 1991, he was named Director of
Marketing for the Sperry Division's Packaged Products Business Unit
and, in 1993, he was appointed Director of Marketing for the Food
Service Division. Following a distinguished career path, which included
being a three-time recipient of the General Mills Chairman's Eagle
Award for Overall Superior Performance, he was promoted to Corporate
Vice President in 1996.

 Northland Cranberries, Inc., a publicly owned company since 1987,
is the largest grower of cranberries in the world, operating 21
cranberry growing properties in the central and northern parts of
Wisconsin and four in the state of Massachusetts. The company is
currently finalizing the previously announced planned acquisition of
Atoka Cranberries, Inc. of Quebec, Canada, which owns the largest
cranberry marsh in North America. Upon successful completion of that
acquisition, Northland's total cranberry acreage under cultivation
will be approximately 2,972 acres, with nearly 27,000 acres of
additional support land.

 The company manufactures and markets Northland brand 100% juice
cranberry blend products, which are distributed through major U.S.
retail grocery chains and wholesale grocers. Northland also markets its
own brand of fresh cranberries on a seasonal basis to produce
distributors and supermarkets throughout the U.S., as well as to
selected European markets. The company also produces and sells
cranberry concentrate to selected industrial accounts in the U.S. and
overseas.

 Northland is the only publicly owned, regularly traded cranberry
company in the United States, with shares traded on the Nasdaq Stock
Market under the listing symbol CBRYA.
