Forward-Looking Statements This joint press release contains forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements may include: management plans relating to the transaction; the expected timing of the completion of the transaction; the ability to complete the transaction; the ability to satisfy customary closing conditions; any statements of the plans and objectives of management for future operations, products or services, including the execution of integration plans; any statements of expectation or belief; projections related to certain financial metrics; and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "outlook," "estimate," "forecast," "project" and other similar words and expressions. Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous assumptions, risks and uncertainties, which change over time and are beyond our control. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made. Neither OceanFirst nor Ocean Shore assumes any duty and does not undertake to update forward-looking statements. Because forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions and uncertainties, actual results or future events could differ, possibly materially, from those that OceanFirst or Ocean Shore anticipated in its forward-looking statements and future results could differ materially from historical performance. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those included under Item 1A "Risk Factors" in OceanFirst's Annual Report on Form 10-K, those included under Item 1A "Risk Factors" in Ocean Shore's Annual Report on Form 10-K, those disclosed in OceanFirst's and Ocean Shore's respective other periodic reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"), those included in the joint proxy statement/prospectus that OceanFirst and Ocean Shore have mailed to their respective stockholders, as well as the possibility that expected benefits may not materialize in the timeframe expected or at all, or may be more costly to achieve; that the transaction may not be timely completed, if at all; that prior to the completion of the transaction or thereafter, OceanFirst's and Ocean Shore's respective businesses may not perform as expected due to transaction-related uncertainty or other factors; that the parties are unable to successfully implement integration strategies; that customary closing conditions are not satisfied in a timely manner or at all; reputational risks and the reaction of the companies' customers, employees and other constituents to the transaction; and diversion of management time on merger-related matters. For any forward-looking statements made in this press release or in any documents, OceanFirst and Ocean Shore claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Annualized, pro forma, projected and estimated numbers are used for illustrative purpose only, are not forecasts and may not reflect actual results.

Definition
Accounts Receivable is money owed to a business by customers and shown on its Balance Sheet as an asset.

Explanation
1. Accounts Receivable are created when a customer has received a product but has not yet paid for that product. Days sales outstanding measures of the average number of days that a company takes to collect revenue after a sale has been made. It is a financial ratio that illustrates how well a company's accounts receivables are being managed.
Ocean Shore Holding Co's Days Sales Outstanding for the quarter that ended in Sep. 2016 is calculated as:



Days Sales Outstanding


=Account Receivable/Revenue*Days in Period

=2.402/8.324*91


=26.33



2. In Ben Grahams calculation of liquidation value, Ocean Shore Holding Co's accounts receivable are only considered to be worth 75% of book value:
Ocean Shore Holding Co's liquidation value for the quarter that ended in Sep. 2016 is calculated as:



Liquidation value


=Cash and Cash Equivalents-Total Liabilities+(0.75 * Account Receivable)+(0.5 * Inventory)


=145.469-978.634+0.75 * 2.402+0.5 * 0


=-831.36



* All numbers are in millions except for per share data and ratio. All numbers are in their local exchange's currency.

Be Aware
Net receivables tells us a great deal about the different competitors in the same industry. In competitive industries, some attempt to gain advantage by offering better credit terms, causing increase in sales and receivables.
If company consistently shows lower % Net receivables to gross sales than competitors, then it usually has some kind of competitive advantage which requires further digging.
Average Days Sales Outstanding is a good indicator for measuring a companys sales channel and customers. A company may book great revenue and earnings growth but never receive payment from their customers. This may force a write-off in the future and depress future earnings.

Hotel Deals: Up To 60% Off Hotels!
Our advertising partners offer great deals at savings of up to 60%. 


Priceline.com offers savings of up to 60% using their 'Name Your Own Price' program. Priceline's 'Name Your Own Price' reservation system is different from other online travel sites. With Priceline's 'Name Your Own Price' reservation system, the exact hotel is shown only after purchase. Over the last 12 months, a substantial percentage of accepted offers have resulted in savings of up to 60% in comparison to the lowest published rates on other leading online travel sites for the same itinerary. There is no guarantee that hotels, dates or prices will be available and savings are not guaranteed. Actual prices and availability are always subject to change.
You can also save up to 60% at Hotwire with 'Hotwire Hot Rates'. 
These are just two examples of amazing offers our partners are offering. Visit Booking.com, Hotels.com, and many more sites for other super deals.

OneTime allows you to search various partner sites at once so you can compare the prices and options offered. Offers and savings are based on information available on these sites. There is no guarantee that these prices, savings, hotels, or dates will be available at the time of booking. Please check the site for the most recent details. When you book travel, your booking is handled by one of those sites directly, not by OneTime. Transactions, and all subsequent customer care, are directly handled by the site where you booked your travel. OneTime does not control the price, rules, regulations, or restrictions surrounding the price. Please read all rules and regulations before booking.

Hotel Deals: Up To 60% Off Hotels!
Our advertising partners offer great deals at savings of up to 60%. 


Priceline.com offers savings of up to 60% using their 'Name Your Own Price' program. Priceline's 'Name Your Own Price' reservation system is different from other online travel sites. With Priceline's 'Name Your Own Price' reservation system, the exact hotel is shown only after purchase. Over the last 12 months, a substantial percentage of accepted offers have resulted in savings of up to 60% in comparison to the lowest published rates on other leading online travel sites for the same itinerary. There is no guarantee that hotels, dates or prices will be available and savings are not guaranteed. Actual prices and availability are always subject to change.
You can also save up to 60% at Hotwire with 'Hotwire Hot Rates'. 
These are just two examples of amazing offers our partners are offering. Visit Booking.com, Hotels.com, and many more sites for other super deals.

OneTime allows you to search various partner sites at once so you can compare the prices and options offered. Offers and savings are based on information available on these sites. There is no guarantee that these prices, savings, hotels, or dates will be available at the time of booking. Please check the site for the most recent details. When you book travel, your booking is handled by one of those sites directly, not by OneTime. Transactions, and all subsequent customer care, are directly handled by the site where you booked your travel. OneTime does not control the price, rules, regulations, or restrictions surrounding the price. Please read all rules and regulations before booking.
