  Blackstone Group is winding down its "big bet" hedge fund
  Senfina Advisors LLC after it faced mounting double-digit losses
  on its investments this year, a spokeswoman confirmed on Tuesday.


  It is a rare setback for the private equity titan, which invests
  roughly $70 billion in hedge funds, and launched Senfina, which
  means "everlasting" in Esperanto, to great fanfare in 2014.


  The fund was one of last year's top performers, gaining 20
  percent, but is down 24 percent this year through November after
  wrong-way bets in its so-called center book where declines were
  most pronounced.


  Other "multi-manager" hedge funds, which make leveraged
  concentrated bets on a range of securities, have also suffered
  this year after being wrong-footed by the pace of U.S. interest
  rate hikes and the post-election rally in the United States.


  "The market environment in 2016 for long/short hedge funds was
  unprecedented. We did what was in the best interest of our
  investors to preserve their capital," said Paula Chirhart, a
  Blackstone spokeswoman.

  A number of Senfina's nearly one dozen portfolio managers,
  including Parag Pande, who joined Blackstone in 2014 and now
  heads Senfina, will be leaving the firm, said a source familiar
  with the decision who asked not to be named because the
  discussions are private.


  Pande ran Senfina's so-called center book, featuring fund
  managers' best ideas.


  Some Senfina managers are expected to stay on at Blackstone and
  much of the $1.8 billion that Senfina invests for large clients,
  including state pension funds, is expected to stay at Blackstone,
  the source said.


  Blackstone's Alternative Asset Management arm (BAAM), headed by
  J. Tomilson Hill, saw inflows of $1.65 billion this year and
  overall performance for BAAM has been positive, Chirhart said.


  BAAM began laying the groundwork for Senfina years ago as demand
  for multi-manager funds picked up. Blackstone started hiring fund
  managers, including Pande, who came from Ziff Brothers, in 2014.


  By the end of last year, Senfina was one of Blackstone's crown
  jewels. But after 2015's strong gains, some Senfina managers
  struggled early in 2016 as worries about slower growth in China
  and the pace of U.S. rate hikes sent stocks spiraling lower.
  Losses at the start of the year were deepest in the center
  book.

  In the January-June period, Senfina lost 15 percent after a 12
  percent gain in the second half of 2015. Things appeared to
  stabilize some in the second quarter with a 2 percent gain.
  Adjustments were made in the center book.


  Losses mounted anew in November with a 6 percent drop. Again the
  majority of losses were seen in the center book which was caught
  off guard by Donald Trump's unexpected White House victory and
  the ensuing stock market rally. Some managers betting on
  industrial and consumer companies were also hurt as markets
  repositioned.


  Since its launch Senfina's performance has slightly negative but
  redemption requests have been minimal, the spokeswoman said.


  Senfina isn't the only multi-manager hedge fund to struggle this
  year. Folger Hill Asset Management, founded by former SAC Capital
  Advisors chief operating officer Sol Kumin, is off 15.3 percent
  through November.


  Managers like Senfina use large numbers of small investment teams
  and centralized risk oversight to keep bets on securities
  increasing in value, or long positions, roughly in balance with
  those on them declining, or shorts.


  The strategy also uses leverage, or borrowed money, which can
  exacerbate losses if risks are not properly controlled. The
  so-called market-neutral approach is supposed to preserve client
  money in any market environment.
