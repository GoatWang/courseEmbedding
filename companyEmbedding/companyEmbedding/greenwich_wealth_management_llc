Investment Procedures and Methods of Analysis
GWM uses fundamental, technical, and macro-economic analysis to formulate an investment strategy tailored to each client. Our research includes the following information resources:

Financial Newspapers and Magazines
Independent Research Materials
Ratings Agency Services
Annual Reports
Prospectuses
Filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission Press Releases. 

GWM works with each client to agree upon the appropriate asset allocation based on the following considerations:

Income and liquidity requirements
Investment time horizon
Risk profile
Financial goals
Special needs

The investment strategies we use to implement any advice given to clients include the following: Long-term purchases (securities held at least one year), short-term purchases (securities held less than one year), and trading (securities sold within 30 days). GWM may also recommend the use of short sales, margin loans and options investment strategies for the management of our clients’ portfolios. Because these types of investment strategies involve additional degrees of risk, they will only be recommended when consistent with the client’s stated investment objectives and tolerance for risk.
GWM implements a disciplined approach to total portfolio management and diversification using the following tools:

Exchange-listed Securities
Securities Traded Over-The-Counter
Foreign Issuers
Corporate Debt Securities (Other Than Commercial Paper)
Certificates of Deposits
Municipal Securities
Mutual Fund Shares
United States Government Securities
Options Contracts on Securities and Commodities
Futures Contracts on Tangibles and Intangibles
Interests in Partnerships Investing in Real Estate
Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)
Structured Products
Alternative Investments
Foreign Exchange
High Frequency Trading Algorithms

Investment Strategy Risks and Recommendations
Recommendations for new investments in accounts managed by GWM will typically be limited to the above items and any investments transferred into the managed account. Non-security classes of investments, e.g., futures and commodities, involve certain additional degrees of risk, they will be recommended and managed only when consistent with a client’s stated investment objectives and tolerance for risk.
Investing in securities involves risk of loss that clients should be prepared to bear.
Types of Securities GWM Invests In
GWM is comfortable investing across the full breadth of the market. However, the backbone of many of our investment portfolios has increasingly been supported by the use of Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). ETFs are extremely liquid as well as cost and tax efficient.
Investing in securities involves risk of loss that clients should be prepared to bear.
