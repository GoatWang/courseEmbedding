         10-Q: HEMCARE HEALTH SERVICES INC.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation. Shareholders' Equity  Plan of Operations  The Company was organized January 17, 2007 (Date of Inception) under the laws of the State of Nevada, as DBL Senior Care, Inc. and subsequently changed its name to HemCare Health Services Inc. on March 2, 2015.  Under previous management, the initial business of the Company was to provide personal care services to elderly, physically disabled or other home-bound individuals suffering infirmity. During the year ended December 31, 2009, the board of directors changed the Company's focus toward the manufacture and sale of fire retardant products. The Company then changed its focus to the licensing of certain technologies related to rare earth minerals then to having the exclusive rights to the use of Optimum Performance (a proprietary formulation of a highly potent all-in-one daily feed supplement for the Horse industry. The Company while still keeping within the health and wellness industries, narrowed its focus to hemorrhoid medical procedures and entered into a license agreement to open hemorrhoid treatment centers and promote the Ultroid Hemorrhoid System globally during the year ended December 31, 2015 which was ceased in late 2016 due to numerous issues and concerns with the Licensor's business, technology and principals. With the business focus potentially shifting the board asked for the former chief executive officer's resignation and Mr. John Wilkes returned to his former role as chief executive. Under Mr. Wilkes leadership, the company has been developing a new business strategy and objective still within the health care space but now focusing on the information Exchange sector.  To this end management working together with significant shareholders, have been developing strategies and alliances to fulfil this objective. At the close of the fiscal year management began to develop a platform and portal for the Information Exchange with aim to completion and market launch in the 2nd quarter of 2017.  HemCare Health Services is developing a Centralized System for Patients, Lawyers & Insurers to Retrieve and Access Medical Records. The centralized system and portal is a cloud-based PIPEDA & HIPAA compliant network of Providers and Record Requestors. Utilizing a secure platform, providers will be able to securely exchange records electronically with third-party requestors. Health care providers with proper authorization can also share records with each other.  Addressing a $7 Billion a year problem  In national terms, across the U.S., hospitals spend more than $7 billion annually on customer intake. More than $7 billion, before any sort of medical procedure is done; before a patient even steps out of a waiting room, representing an incredible amount of time and money spent on intake administration.  Despite the adoption of electronic health records (EHR) and health information exchanges (HIE), providers are still mailing and faxing paper records because they have no PIPEDA or HIPAA compliant method to exchange records electronically with these third-party requestors. A recent study found that the current method of exchanging patient health information cost a single clinician practice $17,160 per year.  The Company aims to remove these substantial burdens both on an administrative and financial basis. People or firms simply use our secure online request form, pay a small service fee and the Company retrieves, digitizes and stores the records. At this point the requesting client can access the record globally 24 hours a day - 7 days a week to view it or transfer it securely. In fact clients can upload any new records to consolidate and keep all of their records securely in one place.  Limited Operating History; Need for Additional Capital  There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. Our assets and business have not yet generated substantial or recurring revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services.  We will require additional financing to cover costs that we expect to incur over the next twelve months. We believe that debt financing will not be an alternative for funding our operations as we do not have tangible assets to secure any debt financing. We anticipate that additional funding will be in the form of equity financing from the sale of our common stock or other securities. However, we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to raise sufficient funding from the sale of our common stock to fund our plan of operations. In the absence of such financing, we will not be able to continue and our business plan will fail.  Table of Contents  Results of Operations  Revenues  Revenues during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 were $0. The timing of generating revenues from the execution of the Company's current business plan is presently undeterminable.  Operating Expenses  Total operating expenses were $2,490 and 8,656 during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. The decrease in operating expenses relate to the timing of fees incurred for the audit of the Company's financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. Where audit fees were incurred for the audit of our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2015 during the three months ended March 31, 2016, we did not incur audit fees for the our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 until the second quarter of 2017.  Other Income (Loss)  The Company had net other income of $22,586 during the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to net other expense of $18,139 during the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in net other income is the result of debt forgiveness totaling $26,306 during the three months ended March 31, 2017 that did not exist in the prior period and the amortization of debt discounts associated with convertible notes payable there were outstanding during the three months ended March 31, 2016 and not during the three months ended March 31, 2017.  Net Income (Loss)  The Company had net income of $20,096 during the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to a net loss of $29,224 during the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in net income is the result of timing of professional fees, forgiveness of outstanding debts and the amortization of debt discounts as discussed previously.  Liquidity and Capital Resources  As of March 31, 2017 we had $0 of cash, total current assets of $0 and current liabilities of $229,007 creating a working capital deficit of $229,007. Current liabilities as of March 31, 2017 consisted of $7 of bank overdrafts, $79,360 of accounts payable and accrued liabilities, $42,692 of related party payables, $25,448 of dividends payable and notes payable of $81,500.  Cash Used in Operating Activities  Net cash used in operating activities was $0 during the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $8,753 used for the same period in 2016. The decrease in cash used in operating activities is from an increase in non-cash gains realized and a lesser change in working capital during the three months ended March 31, 2017 when compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016.  Cash from Financing Activities  We have funded our business to date primarily from loans from directors or other related parties. There are no assurances that we will be able to achieve further sales of our common stock or any other form of additional financing. If we are unable to achieve the financing necessary to continue our plan of operations, then we will not be able to continue our operations and our business will fail.  Table of Contents  Going Concern  Through March 31, 2017, management has devoted most of its activities to developing a market for its products and services. We have yet to generate revenues from our planned business activities, have no cash on hand and have a working capital deficit of $229,007 which raises substantial doubt for the entity to be able to continue as a going concern.  Future Financing  We anticipate continuing to rely on equity sales of our common stock in order to continue to fund our business operations. Issuances of additional shares will result in dilution to our existing shareholders. There is no assurance that we will achieve any additional sales of our equity securities or arrange for debt or other financing to fund our planned operations.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements  We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders.  Lawsuits  To management's knowledge there is no pending, or threatened lawsuit against the Company  May 22, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

HemCare Health Services to Acquire Access to National Insurance Providers through Strategic Acquisition

Sep 03, 2015, 08:30 ET
		  		  				
									 from   HemCare Health Services, Inc. 











 
















































 

 




















 


TAMPA, Fla., Sep. 3, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- HemCare Health Services, Inc. (OTC; HCRE) – HemCare Health Services has signed a binding letter of intent to acquire 95% of John Isaac Delgado, M.D., P.A.
The acquisition will provide HemCare with access to over 200 insurance agreements from various national PPO and HMO insurance providers.  The concept is referred to as a single member EIN, and is very common with large multi-location medical offices.  
HemCare's CEO James Cao commented "Many insurance providers no longer offer open registration to new medical clinics.  This purchase will permit every new HemCare clinic opened in the United States the ability to immediately accept and bill those insurance providers for services rendered.  This is accomplished through a Management Services Organization agreement with each new HemCare franchise location."
On May 19, 2015 the Company announced it had licensed the perpetual rights to use Ultroid Marketing Development Corp's products and the trade name "Ultroid System".   The rights will allow the Company to enter into a clinical treatment of Hemorrhoidal Maladies. Amongst several other attributes, the Products are non-invasive and provide fast and effective relief in the treatment of Hemorrhoids.  
HemCare will acquire the controlling interest through the issuance of 2,000,000 restricted common shares.  Management expects to conclude the acquisition following due diligence and an audit of the business.  
About HemCare
HemCare Health Services, Inc. (HCRE) is a public health care and technology company.  The company's mission is to become an integrated provider of systems to treat and cure Hemorrhoidal Disease through franchising a successful clinical model and use of proprietary devices.   
This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Act of 1934.  These forward-looking statements are based largely on the expectations or forecasts of future events, can be affected by inaccurate assumptions, and are subject to various business risks and known and unknown uncertainties, a number of which are beyond the control of management.  Therefore, actual results could differ materially from the forward-looking statements contained in this press release.  Additional information respecting the factors that could materially affect the Company and its operations are contained in its annual report on Form 10K and Form 10-Q as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The Company undertakes no obligation to publically update or revise any forward-looking statement.

The correct blend of ingredients is fundamental for achieving optimal vascular health and getting rid of hemorrhoids. We liked the fact that HemClear contains no additives, preservatives or synthetic ingredients and that it was formulated by medical experts and doctors. Furthermore, their rave customer reviews and testimonials confirmed what we already thought – this is a great product with many happy satisfied customers.

Nothing is more painful than suffering through hemorrhoids, unsure if there’s even a cure. You struggle going through your day with the constant pains and burns. All you need is a treatment that works.
Trust me, we know how you feel. After helping thousands of people heal their hemorrhoids, we discovered the only 7 ways to treat it – and even cure it. Which is why we compiled this helpful list for you below.


Here’s Our #1 Pick To Effectively Cure Hemorrhoids, Naturally
Discover Hemorrhoid.Center’s top pick for a 100% natural and very effective cure to hemorrhoids.
Made with all natural ingredients that work through the blood stream to effectively shrink blood vessels to heal hemorrhoids.

Click Here To Discover Our #1 Top Pick



Over-the-Counter Hemorrhoid Remedies
There are a few popular methods to treat hemorrhoids with over-the-counter options. And how do these remedies reduce the severity of hemorrhoids? By shrinking tissues.
Most treatments available work for both internal and external hemorrhoids and can be very helpful in resolving hemorrhoids. Especially if the hemorrhoids are new or mild in nature.
The Available Treatments Include:
1. Hemorrhoid Cream
Hemorrhoid cream typically utilizes a vasoconstrictor to shrink blood vessels.
2. Astringents
Astringents are common remedies containing ingredients like witch hazel that reduce swelling. They typically work for about 2 to 3 hours before they need to be reapplied.
3. Medicated Wipes or Pads
These are very good for carrying around while you on the go. Wipes typically use protectants that condition the skin and add necessary nutrients. Some of these pads contain astringents.
4. Herbal Remedies
Some of the most effective treatments for hemorrhoids contain herbal remedies that shrink hemorrhoids naturally. Most hemorrhoid remedies use a blend of herbs. To locate an effective herbal remedy for hemorrhoids, look for ingredients like witch hazel, butcher’s broom, and horse chestnut.
Medical Procedures for Hemorrhoids
For severe cases of hemorrhoids, you may need to consider medical intervention. Before considering a medical procedure, take a look at the following alternatives and talk to the doctor about your options.
5. Sclerotherapy
Sclerotherapy is performed by a doctor. An injection is administered into the hemorrhoidal tissue. This procedure uses a chemical hardener to break down hemorrhoid tissue.
At times, repeated treatments may be needed to successfully shrink the hemorrhoids. After proper treatment, the hemorrhoid should fall off during a normal bowel movement. Because of this, continued therapy can permanently get rid of hemorrhoids.
Typically,sclerotherapy is used to treat internal hemorrhoids that are considered bleeding hemorrhoids. It is one of the least invasive procedures that are available for this type of hemorrhoid. The chemical solution that is injected hardens the tissue and causes it to wither away. Typically, the solution used is phenol-based together with almond oil or saline solution as a buffer.
If the hemorrhoids are unusually large, then Sclerotherapy is not the best option.
The main drawback of sclerotherapy is that it does not permanently get rid of hemorrhoids, and they can return in about a year. The second drawback is that if the surgeon is not very skilled in this procedure, mild to severe complications can arise.
6. Rubber Band Ligation
Rubber band ligation is one of the most recommended hemorrhoidal remedies in the medical profession. This is because it reduces the recurrence of hemorrhoids.
This procedure uses rubber bands to shrink hemorrhoids by cutting off the blood flow.
After hemorrhoids have time to wither away, they fall off, typically in about a week. This procedure is one of the most popular treatments available because it is minimally invasive as compared to other remedies. The downside of the treatment is that it causes pain in the rectal area and the lower abdomen. This is because of the restrictions imposed on the live tissue in the hemorrhoid. However, if you are willing to put up with the initial pain, you will have relief in about a week’s time.
Rubber band ligation is a great treatment for hemorrhoids and can work for more than one hemorrhoid at a time. Your doctor may recommend treating more than two hemorrhoids at a time. In this case, you will be placed under general anesthesia. Rubber band ligation is one of the more heavily used hemorrhoid remedies. It provides long-lasting relief and there is less recurrence. It is also one of the least expensive options.
7. Infrared Photocoagulation
This treatment is typically referred to as coagulation therapy. It is typically used to treat small to medium-sized hemorrhoids that are internal. The procedure is sometimes used for external hemorrhoids as well.
This therapy employs an intense beam of infrared light to shrink hemorrhoids. Infrared light cuts off the blood supply and causes the hemorrhoid to wither away. The downside is the extreme pain experienced right after the procedure. Make sure that your doctor is comfortable with prescribing pain medication immediately following the procedure before you agree to it. Like sclerotherapy, this remedy has developed a lot of attention over the last five to seven years, which should eventually lead to better procedures with less associated pain.
