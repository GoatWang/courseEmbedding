        Awesome Cleanser!
This is a great product! I always use Simple products and had never heard of this until the company sent me free sample in the mail and i was very excited to try it out, it leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean. I even used it after using makeup remover wipes to remove my makeup and thought i got all the makeup off but this cleanser took off more that i had no idea was left behind. I really love this product and will be purchasing it and would highly recommend it!

        FANTASTIC NEW PRODUCT!
I was very pleasantly surprised to find a package from Simple in my mailbox on the last day of 2014. Inside I found a FULL sized bottle of their new Micellar Cleansing water, cotton rounds, and very generous samples of their Moisturizing Facial Wash, and Replenishing Rich Moisturizer.
I was VERY skeptical as I read the information and directions for the Cleansing Water. I've tried cleansing wipes in the past and always found that they irritated my skin and left behind a film that needed to be rinsed off which defeated the purpose of a quick easy wipe.I thought what the heck, I've been battling dry skin and a cold and barely made it through my New Year's Eve festivities so the idea of being able to wash my face in one step without even having to leave my bed was very appealing.I wet the cotton round and wiped it all over my face and eyes. It felt cool and refreshing. I was very surprised to look in the mirror and find that all my makeup had been removed,my skin looked clean ,felt soft & there was no residue! I have since been alternating using the Cleansing Water, Facial Wash and Moisturizer every night and in less than a week I have soft, glowing skin!
I am really interested to see how the water will work this summer when I tend to get super sensitive, weirdly dry yet oily skin due to the humidity and heat. I will also be interested to try their lighter moisturizers as well.
Thanks so much Simple for sending me this package and giving me the gift of gorgeous skin!

        Great product!
I received this product in order to try it and write a review. I've been using it for the past week (probably for longer than a week, since I can't recall the day it surprised me in the mail.) I should mention that I have combination to oily skin, with a very sensitive eye area,, and I get the usual monthly mini breakout (and I live in the Caribbean). This product performs as advertised: leaves skin feeling clean and hydrated. It removes my makeup quite well, it doesn't irritate my eye area at all, it really is as gentle as water. It doesn't leave a cast behind like some other products of this cleansing type do. I am sooooo THANKFUL of having been sent this full size sample and the two travel size ones that came with it in the mail (one is a cleanser, the other a moisturizer, which also work amazingly). I didn't think Simple products were a match for my oily skin. but i can truthfully say that they have made my skin look and feel clean, hydrated, and moisturized.
Keep up the good work Simple. GREAT PRODUCT!

I received a free sample in exchange for my review. I love the Micellar Cleansing water! Now, I still prefer to wash my face with facial soap, but on those nights that it's late and I'm tired, but do not want to sleep in my makeup, I use this. It wipes everything away. I feel clean and not overly dried. It is scentless and is just like water! I would definitely recommend this.

        It was not what I was Expecting!
I received this in the mail from Simple skincare to try this new Micellar Water cleanser. I was honestly not expecting much from what I thought was just glorified water. I was severely wrong! My skin has cleared up so much from using not only this product, but Simple skincare in general. I really like the Micellar cleaning water because unlike many other cleansers, my face no longer feels tight or dry. My red, irritated, and sensitive skin has never felt better after using this product! I can't wait to try out other Simple skin care products!

First of all, I love the way it feels on my skin since it makes me feel so refreshed. The bad thing is that it doesn't remove all makeup, specially waterproof. The best way to use this in my opinion would be before applying makeup or to remove it when wearing a minimal look.

The power of water for truly beautiful skin


   

 




































































The power of water
The power of water
For truly beautiful, hydrated skin
We all know how important water is for our wellbeing. Water is the ultimate source of life, a vital factor in hydrating our skin. But every day we lose it drop by drop. Things like air conditioning, dry weather and sun exposure can leave skin feeling dehydrated and sensitive.


Causes of dehydration


Humidity
Humidity levels vary regionally and seasonally. When there is low humidity, air lacks moisture which impacts on skin hydration levels.1,2






Hard water
You often see the signs of hard water in the form of lime scale, but cleansing with hard water also leaves traces of these elements on your skin, which can cause it to become dehydrated.3






Sun
The effect of the sun and its powerful UV rays can weaken the skin barrier and contribute to skin dehydration.4






Temperature
As the temperature drops, so do skin hydration levels, with cold winds and increased use of heating guilty of drying out skin.5







Help protect your skin by following these Simple® tips 


In colder months heating can strip the air of moisture, whilst in the warmer months, air

conditioning can do the same. Keep skin hydrated over night by filling a bowl with water and put it in

your bedroom overnight, so that the air conditioning and heating will dry up the water from the bowl rather than your skin.


Exercise is great for boosting blood circulation and providing skin with a glowing appearance. However, sweating can cause more water loss, ultimately making skin feel dry. Feel the full benefits of a work out by briefly rinsing your face with luke-warm water and immediately moisturizing after exercise.



For moisturizers to work their best, apply them within 3 minutes of stepping out of the bath or shower to lock in the benefits of water.



When travelling by air, don't be tempted to rinse your face with water - it will only evaporate in the dry environment of the plane, leading to further dehydration. Instead, where possible, cleanse before boarding and always follow with a moisturizer.

            Transforming medical devices for improved patient outcomes        










As interventional techniques have evolved, so has the need for advancing medical devices—devices with greater efficacy and enhanced safety profiles that provide better clinical outcomes. Since 2006, Micell has teamed with world renowned medical and scientific innovators to realize our singular vision: to lead in the development of advanced vascular medical devices with innovative drug delivery systems. As a result, we are perfecting our technology to deliver a best-in-class coronary stent system, MiStent SES. Our patented drug application methodology is the force behind the success of this system.
Smooth, Uniform Coating
Micell employs a supercritical fluid technology developed in conjunction with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, a U.S. Department of Energy laboratory managed by Battelle Memorial Institute. This solvent-free technology, used in applying the polymer component to the stent platform, preserves the crystalline integrity of the drug during the coating process. Fusing the polymer, applied using supercritical fluid technology, and the dry crystalline form of the drug, creates a smooth, uniform, well-adhered coating on the stent.

Unique Advantages
Micell’s coating technology provides unique advantages for the modification and coating of biomedical surfaces with advanced polymers and drugs. Compared to current solvent-based coating processes, Micell’s technology is:

Solvent Free: Polymers, drugs and medical devices are not exposed to conventional liquid solvents that could alter the chemistry of the drug or trigger an inflammatory response in the body;
Preserving: Moderate temperatures are used to maintain the structure and morphology of therapeutic agents, which allows for the use of therapeutic agents that may be sensitive to elevated temperatures or traditional solvent processes;
Adaptable: By combining electrostatic attraction with supercritical fluids, surface modifications for a broad range of medical devices using a variety of polymers and drugs can be achieved.

Multiple Applications
Micell’s supercritical fluid technology platform has the potential to provide control over drug morphology and the ability to apply multiple therapeutic agents in single or multiple layers to achieve tailored therapeutics allowing the potential for a variety of innovative product applications within the interventional healthcare space.

Health Economics
Lower TLR rates can have a significant impact on reducing cost to the healthcare system.  A 50 percent reduction in TLR would translate into meaningful savings for hospitals, insurers and patients.
Cost Impact of TLR Reduction

Average Medicare, in-patient hospital reimbursement for percutaneous vascularization with a DES*
$11,800 without complications (Diagnosis Related Group (DRG) 246)
$18,500 with complications (DRG 247)

There were a total of 132,890* in-patient Medicare vascularization procedures in 2012 for a cost impact of about $1.8B.
This does not include out-patient Medicare, Medicaid or private insurers

The TLR rate for DES at five years is generally at least two times the one-year TLR rate.
Even relatively small reductions in late TLR will have significant cost impact.

Product Pipeline
Micell’s proprietary supercritical fluid process has potential applications in areas beyond coronary stents. While the primary therapeutic agent for these products is crystalline sirolimus, additional therapeutic agents are also being evaluated for use with Micell’s unique drug delivery systems in future generation products.



Bioresorbable Scaffold (BRS) – A fully resorbable scaffold with the capability to over-expand/post-dilate while providing excellent drug delivery (akin to MiStent SES).



Drug-Coated Balloon (DCB) – A sirolimus-based, novel-composition, consistently-coated drug balloon designed to achieve rapid transfer of antiproliferative drugs to the arterial wall without the requirement of an implanted drug delivery system.



Peripheral Drug-Eluting Stent – Uniquely designed, sirolimus-based, self-expanding stent to treat lower extremity disease.



Advanced Membrane – Potential therapeutic benefit to membrane-based devices (e.g., vascular grafts, closure devices, stent-grafts).

MiStent SES®
Micell’s flagship product is the MiStent® Sirolimus Eluting Absorbable Polymer Coronary Stent System (MiStent SES). Taking full advantage of 25 years of stent design learnings, MiStent SES is designed to limit the duration of polymer exposure, optimize healing, more precisely and consistently control drug elution, and ultimately improves safety and clinical outcomes.
MiStent SES has a CE mark and is available for sale in many countries around the world. MiStent SES is not approved for sale/use within the United States, at this time. (For more information on international distribution partners, please contact us.)

Watch the TCTMD panel discussion of MiStent SES, with expert commentary from Martin Leon, M.D., Elazer Edelman, M.D., Ph.D., Alexandra Lansky, M.D., and Robbert de Winter, M.Sc., M.D., Ph.D.

Ultra-Thin Design Promotes Healing
 MiStent SES leverages the strengths of a cobalt chromium coronary stent system, a state-of-the-art, ultra-thin strut platform that provides excellent deliverability, conformability and flexibility. The MiStent is 64 microns in thickness yet does not compromise performance when it comes to longitudinal compression or elongation. The thinness of the stent struts helps to minimize vessel damage to the surrounding tissue, limits flow disruption decreasing the risk of early stent thrombosis, and allows for more rapid re-endothelialization, while still providing needed support to the artery.
MiStent SES is unique based on its bioabsorbable polymer coating and its use of a crystalline form of sirolimus. The polymer is designed to flow away from the stent struts, which minimizes tissue reactivity and thus allows for accelerated tissue healing. The polymer is eliminated from the stent structure in 45 to 60 days, and is absorbed from the surrounding tissue within three months.
The application of crystalline sirolimus to the stent through a proprietary supercritical fluid technology allows for a near linear release of the drug rather than an uncontrolled burst and immediate taper, as is often found with other drug-eluting stents. This sustained release provides therapeutic drug levels well beyond the time it takes for the polymer to be absorbed, thereby significantly reducing potential inflammatory response to the polymer itself. Additionally, the sustained controlled drug release provides an anti-restenotic effect in the treated area beyond most traditional DES products.
Improved Clinical Outcomes
Based on clinical evidence, the unique design of MiStent SES has shown improved clinical outcomes, including:

Minimal progression of late lumen loss or neoatheroma formation
Low Target Lesion Revascularization (TLR) over long-term follow-up
Short duration of polymer presence and even distribution of drug to minimize risk of early and late stent thrombosis

Drug Delivery vs. Polymer Dissolution
MiStent SES is the only bioabsorbable polymer coated drug-eluting stent with active drug present after the polymer is fully absorbed.

No Late Catch-up of In-Stent Late Lumen Loss (LLL) observed with MiStent vs. other DES
Progression of LLL is seen by many as a surrogate marker for TLR. The lower the progression, the lower the rate of restenosis over time. The unique clinical findings of no LLL progression or neoatheroma formation are likely contributors to MiStent’s low TLR progression rate.

BBB Accreditation





                This Business Is Not BBB Accredited
            

                
                Businesses are under no obligation to seek BBB accreditation, and some businesses are not accredited because they have not sought BBB accreditation.
            

                To be accredited by BBB, a business must apply for accreditation and BBB must determine that the business meets
                BBB accreditation standards, which include a commitment to make a good faith effort to resolve any consumer complaints. BBB Accredited Businesses must pay a fee for accreditation review/monitoring and for support of BBB services to the public.

                   1. Fulfill contracts signed and agreements reached.
                

                   3.

4. Be free of an unsatisfactory rating and maintain at least a B rating at the accrediting BBB and the BBB where it is headquartered, if different.

BBB Accreditation Reviews

BBB routinely monitors its files on all Accredited Businesses to affirm that they continue to meet all BBB Accreditation Standards











BBB Accreditation Process


        Not every business is eligible for BBB Accreditation. Businesses must meet, commit to and maintain the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards) 
        in order to be eligible for and maintain BBB Accreditation. The BBB Code of Business Practices represents sound advertising, selling and customer
        service practices that enhance customer trust and confidence in business. The Code is built on the BBB Standards for Trust, eight principles that
        summarize important elements of creating and maintaining trust in business.
    

        In order to be eligible for Accreditation a business must complete an Accreditation application.        
    

        Upon receipt of a fully completed BBB Application for Accreditation, BBB staff:        
        
Reviews the application
Researches the business
Verifies the information presented in the application 
May request additional information
May request proof of specific information on the application

        After the review and verification process, BBB will then evaluate if the business meets the
        BBB Code of Business Practices (Accreditation Standards)..
    
    
        Once BBB has finished its evaluation, the application for BBB Accreditation is either approved or denied. If the applicant is found in compliance with the BBB Code of Business Practices it will be presented to the BBB Board of Directors, or a committee of that board, for final approval. If the application is denied, BBB will contact the applicant, indicating the BBB Standard(s) that were not met and any recourse available to the applicant.

Business Identifier: NO Business Identifier is currently available for this company. 
Public Profile: Micell Technologies, Inc., is a privately-held, early-stage biomedical company dedicated to advancing combination product therapies in the cardiovascular, orthopedic, and drug-delivery areas. The firm's Supercritical Fluid Technology consists of patented processes and methods for surface modifications of medical devices with specific focus on improvements to current polymer based drug-eluting technologies. Included in the firms technology platform are exclusively licensed patents from Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, a U.S. Department of Energy laboratory, managed by Battelle. Since 2006, Micell has teamed with renowned medical and scientific innovators to realize the singular vision: to lead in the development of advanced vascular medical devices with innovative drug delivery systems. The technology is being perfected to deliver a best-in-class coronary stent system, MiStent SES. the firm's patented drug application methodology is the major factor in the success of this system. Micell employs a supercritical fluid technology developed in conjunction with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, a U.S. Department of Energy laboratory managed by Battelle Memorial Institute. This solvent-free technology, used in applying the polymer component to the stent platform, preserves the crystalline integrity of the drug during the coating process. Fusing the polymer, applied using supercritical fluid technology, and the dry crystalline form of the drug, creates a smooth, uniform, well-adhered coating on the stent.

        Awesome Cleanser!
This is a great product! I always use Simple products and had never heard of this until the company sent me free sample in the mail and i was very excited to try it out, it leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean. I even used it after using makeup remover wipes to remove my makeup and thought i got all the makeup off but this cleanser took off more that i had no idea was left behind. I really love this product and will be purchasing it and would highly recommend it!

        FANTASTIC NEW PRODUCT!
I was very pleasantly surprised to find a package from Simple in my mailbox on the last day of 2014. Inside I found a FULL sized bottle of their new Micellar Cleansing water, cotton rounds, and very generous samples of their Moisturizing Facial Wash, and Replenishing Rich Moisturizer.
I was VERY skeptical as I read the information and directions for the Cleansing Water. I've tried cleansing wipes in the past and always found that they irritated my skin and left behind a film that needed to be rinsed off which defeated the purpose of a quick easy wipe.I thought what the heck, I've been battling dry skin and a cold and barely made it through my New Year's Eve festivities so the idea of being able to wash my face in one step without even having to leave my bed was very appealing.I wet the cotton round and wiped it all over my face and eyes. It felt cool and refreshing. I was very surprised to look in the mirror and find that all my makeup had been removed,my skin looked clean ,felt soft & there was no residue! I have since been alternating using the Cleansing Water, Facial Wash and Moisturizer every night and in less than a week I have soft, glowing skin!
I am really interested to see how the water will work this summer when I tend to get super sensitive, weirdly dry yet oily skin due to the humidity and heat. I will also be interested to try their lighter moisturizers as well.
Thanks so much Simple for sending me this package and giving me the gift of gorgeous skin!

        Great product!
I received this product in order to try it and write a review. I've been using it for the past week (probably for longer than a week, since I can't recall the day it surprised me in the mail.) I should mention that I have combination to oily skin, with a very sensitive eye area,, and I get the usual monthly mini breakout (and I live in the Caribbean). This product performs as advertised: leaves skin feeling clean and hydrated. It removes my makeup quite well, it doesn't irritate my eye area at all, it really is as gentle as water. It doesn't leave a cast behind like some other products of this cleansing type do. I am sooooo THANKFUL of having been sent this full size sample and the two travel size ones that came with it in the mail (one is a cleanser, the other a moisturizer, which also work amazingly). I didn't think Simple products were a match for my oily skin. but i can truthfully say that they have made my skin look and feel clean, hydrated, and moisturized.
Keep up the good work Simple. GREAT PRODUCT!

I received a free sample in exchange for my review. I love the Micellar Cleansing water! Now, I still prefer to wash my face with facial soap, but on those nights that it's late and I'm tired, but do not want to sleep in my makeup, I use this. It wipes everything away. I feel clean and not overly dried. It is scentless and is just like water! I would definitely recommend this.

        It was not what I was Expecting!
I received this in the mail from Simple skincare to try this new Micellar Water cleanser. I was honestly not expecting much from what I thought was just glorified water. I was severely wrong! My skin has cleared up so much from using not only this product, but Simple skincare in general. I really like the Micellar cleaning water because unlike many other cleansers, my face no longer feels tight or dry. My red, irritated, and sensitive skin has never felt better after using this product! I can't wait to try out other Simple skin care products!

        Love/Hate.
First of all, I love the way it feels on my skin since it makes me feel so refreshed. The bad thing is that it doesn't remove all makeup, specially waterproof. The best way to use this in my opinion would be before applying makeup or to remove it when wearing a minimal look.

The power of water for truly beautiful skin


   

 




































































The power of water
The power of water
For truly beautiful, hydrated skin
We all know how important water is for our wellbeing. Water is the ultimate source of life, a vital factor in hydrating our skin. But every day we lose it drop by drop. Things like air conditioning, dry weather and sun exposure can leave skin feeling dehydrated and sensitive.


Causes of dehydration


Humidity
Humidity levels vary regionally and seasonally. When there is low humidity, air lacks moisture which impacts on skin hydration levels.1,2






Hard water
You often see the signs of hard water in the form of lime scale, but cleansing with hard water also leaves traces of these elements on your skin, which can cause it to become dehydrated.3






Sun
The effect of the sun and its powerful UV rays can weaken the skin barrier and contribute to skin dehydration.4






Temperature
As the temperature drops, so do skin hydration levels, with cold winds and increased use of heating guilty of drying out skin.5







Help protect your skin by following these Simple® tips 


In colder months heating can strip the air of moisture, whilst in the warmer months, air

conditioning can do the same. Keep skin hydrated over night by filling a bowl with water and put it in

your bedroom overnight, so that the air conditioning and heating will dry up the water from the bowl rather than your skin.


Exercise is great for boosting blood circulation and providing skin with a glowing appearance. However, sweating can cause more water loss, ultimately making skin feel dry. Feel the full benefits of a work out by briefly rinsing your face with luke-warm water and immediately moisturizing after exercise.



For moisturizers to work their best, apply them within 3 minutes of stepping out of the bath or shower to lock in the benefits of water.



When travelling by air, don't be tempted to rinse your face with water - it will only evaporate in the dry environment of the plane, leading to further dehydration. Instead, where possible, cleanse before boarding and always follow with a moisturizer.
