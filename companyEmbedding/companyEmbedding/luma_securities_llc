Our Display LUMAscape is one of the most viewed, used, referenced and copied slides in the industry. And now we’ve expanded the collection to include “LUMAscapes” for all the digital media sectors — DISPLAY, VIDEO, MOBILE, MARKETING TECHNOLOGY, CONTENT / NATIVE, SEARCH, SOCIAL, COMMERCE, and GAMING. We have also mapped the leading suppliers of capital – the DIGITAL CAPITAL LUMAscape, and the strategic acquirors – the STRATEGIC BUYER LUMAscape.
We have produced a variety of content that reflects our focus on and understanding of the digital media and marketing ecosystem — how it works and where its going.
And based on the extent to which it gets shared around the web, the messages have struck a chord – over 6,000,000 views and downloads.
So go ahead and check out the content. Download the latest LUMAscape or view a presentation for some compelling and prescient insights. Or, if you’re looking for a little lighter fare, take in a comedy video. As you can see, we work hard but also like to have fun.

About LUMA
LUMA Partners provides strategic advice to companies at the intersection of media, marketing and technology. We are passionate about entrepreneurs, excited about the innovation taking place and thrive on disruption.
LUMA Partners takes a refreshing approach to investment banking. The typical broad auction sell-side process simply doesn’t work for leading companies in the dynamic digital media industry. “Selling” a company results in adverse selection that can taint or sub-optimize the result for entrepreneurs and their investors.
Our approach is different.  We work “up-funnel” with decision-makers at the strategic companies to provide objective advice regarding strategy and target selection – which we are able to do because of our deep market expertise and since we are not burdened with “inventory.” In other words, we help companies get bought. This approach results in more logical strategic matches that are a better outcome for all parties.
At the end of the day, we believe good companies are bought, not sold. Most investment bankers say this – but we put our business model where our mouth is. Since the digital industry we cover is all about disruption and efficiency, we felt the investment banking model could use a little disruption. Don’t you?


So what’s a LUMA?



 



The people at LUMA are incredibly strategic. They get how the industry works and, more importantly, have a great sense for where it is headed.

DMS 15
June 11th, 2015

LUMA Partners hosted its 7th annual Digital Media Summit on May 20, 2015 in New York City. We brought together more than 500 industry leaders, including 300 CEOs under one roof to create the premier conference experience for digital media decision makers.

This year our fantastic lineup of speakers on the main stage featured some of the biggest names in Digital Media:

Wrapped in a James Bond theme (it was our 007th DMS), the summit focused on pressing topics around content, commerce, data, email, mobile, native advertising, TV and video. And, of course, there was the non-stop networking with near everyone in the industry.
At DMS, we presented our annual State of the State, which looks at markets and trends in digital media. You can view or download the presentation here.

   LUMAscapes
LUMA Partners painstakingly compiles sector landscapes (“LUMAscapes”) to organize what can be a very confusing ecosystem. We have mapped each of the increasingly overlapping key sectors of digital media: DISPLAY, VIDEO, MOBILE, MARKETING TECHNOLOGY, SALES TECH, CONTENT / NATIVE, SEARCH, SOCIAL, COMMERCE, VR and GAMING. We have also mapped the leading suppliers of capital – the DIGITAL CAPITAL LUMAscape, the strategic acquirers – the STRATEGIC BUYER LUMAscape and the knowledge sources – the KNOWLEDGE LUMAscape.
We understand these LUMAscapes are not perfect. Many companies  operate across multiple sectors and there are significant product and  business differences within categories. This is our categorization with  the help of a lot of feedback from the community. Tell us what you think as we are always tinkering with the changing landscapes and appreciate  the expert crowd sourcing. LUMAscapes@lumapartners.com

  Overview SO WHAT’S A LUMA?

About LUMA
LUMA Partners provides strategic advice to companies at the intersection of media, marketing and technology. We are passionate about entrepreneurs, excited about the innovation taking place and thrive on disruption.
LUMA Partners takes a refreshing approach to investment banking. The typical broad auction sell-side process simply doesn’t work for leading companies in the dynamic digital media industry. “Selling” a company results in adverse selection that can taint or sub-optimize the result for entrepreneurs and their investors.
Our approach is different.  We work “up-funnel” with decision-makers at the strategic companies to provide objective advice regarding strategy and target selection – which we are able to do because of our deep market expertise and since we are not burdened with “inventory.” In other words, we help companies get bought. This approach results in more logical strategic matches that are a better outcome for all parties.
At the end of the day, we believe good companies are bought, not sold. Most investment bankers say this – but we put our business model where our mouth is. Since the digital industry we cover is all about disruption and efficiency, we felt the investment banking model could use a little disruption. Don’t you?


So what’s a LUMA?



 



The people at LUMA are incredibly strategic. They get how the industry works and, more importantly, have a great sense for where it is headed.
