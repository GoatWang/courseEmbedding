Products           
OCI Nitrogen has three product groups: fertilizers, melamine, and industrial products. We offer a variety of products in each group. FertilizersFertilizers play an important role in solving the world’s food problems. Our fertilizers can be applied for virtually all crops. They can be spread effectively, work fast and are predictable, and therefore preferred by many European farmers. The main component is nitrogen. The product portfolio includes such products as Nutramon CAN, Granular 3, Granular 2, ammonium sulphate, urea, and urean. 
MelamineMelamine is used mainly in wood-based panels and laminates. The melamine product group produces and sells various products depending on the desired application. It also sells urea for technical applications, for example in adhesives.  
Industrial ProductsThe industrial products product group is responsible for the production, distribution, and sales of mainly ammonia. Ammonia is the basic raw material for fertilizers and melamine. Production of ammonia generates other products such as ammonia water, argon, nitric acid, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen. These products are utilized for countless applications in the pharmaceutical, chemicals, and food industries.

Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades.

 The Demerger
On 16 February 2015, OCI N.V. announced that it formally commenced proceedings to effect a demerger of the company’s engineering and construction business from its fertilizer and chemicals business (the Demerger), which was previously announced by the Board of Directors on 6 November 2014. The Demerged entity holding the engineering and construction activities is called Orascom Construction Limited (Orascom Construction). 
The Demerger was effected through a USD 1.4 billion reduction in OCI N.V.’s share capital whereby OCI N.V. shareholders received one Orascom Construction share for every two OCI N.V. shares they owned as at close of trading on 6 March 2015.
The Demerger resulted in OCI N.V. continuing to be listed on the Euronext Amsterdam as a global producer of nitrogen fertilizers, methanol and other natural gas based chemical products.
Orascom Construction is dually listed on NASDAQ Dubai and the EGX as a global engineering and construction company. 
For information and publications related to the Demerger, please visit the Demerger Documents page. For more information about Orascom Construction, please visit www.orascom.com
