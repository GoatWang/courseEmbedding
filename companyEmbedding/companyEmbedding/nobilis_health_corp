HOUSTON, June 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Nobilis Health Corp. (NYSE MKT: HLTH) ("Nobilis" or the "Company") announced today the appointment of Phil Ayres as Vice President of Marketing. Mr. Ayres' primary responsibility will be managing and further developing the Company's direct-to-consumer (DTC) platform used to market the Company's nine nationally branded surgical procedures.








Mr. Ayres most recently served as the Director of Marketing for Travelocity, where he successfully developed a digital-based marketing strategy focused on maximizing performance through audience retargeting and digital platform customization. During his tenure, Mr. Ayres led Travelocity's search engine optimization (SEO) channel through a period of exponential growth while completely redesigning the company's display, retargeting and social direct response efforts, with a rigorous focus on vendor expansion and channel conversion optimization. These efforts resulted in improved performance across the Marketing Division, while saving the company tens of millions annually in reduced marketing spend. 
Prior to his role at Travelocity, Mr. Ayres was the Director of Online Marketing at Hotels.com where he oversaw digital marketing operations in North America and led his team to numerous awards and nominations, including Advertiser of the Year, Innovator of the Year and Hotels.com's Gold Star Award, which the company reserves for the top 1% of its performers.
"As our marketing platform becomes more technology driven, Phil's addition to our team allows us to capitalize on his experience and improve our marketing platform. We believe the experience Phil possesses in designing and implementing digital-based marketing campaigns on a global level makes him tailor-made for this very important role," said Kenneth Efird, President of Nobilis. "Throughout the course of his career, Mr. Ayres has shown the ability to improve marketing operational efficiency through dedicated application of specific SEO tactics and network analytics. As Nobilis continues to scale its marketing programs, Mr. Ayres' leadership and proven ability to reduce customer acquisition cost through technology will impact the Company's performance."

Nobilis Health Corp. Appoints New Vice President of Marketing
BY PR Newswire— 7:34 PM ET 06/08/2017



HOUSTON, June 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Nobilis Health Corp. ("Nobilis" or the "Company") announced today the appointment of Phil Ayres as Vice President of Marketing. Mr. Ayres' primary responsibility will be managing and further developing the Company's direct-to-consumer (DTC) platform used to market the Company's nine nationally branded surgical procedures.



Mr. Ayres most recently served as the Director of Marketing for Travelocity, where he successfully developed a digital-based marketing strategy focused on maximizing performance through audience retargeting and digital platform customization. During his tenure, Mr. Ayres led Travelocity's search engine optimization (SEO) channel through a period of exponential growth while completely redesigning the company's display, retargeting and social direct response efforts, with a rigorous focus on vendor expansion and channel conversion optimization. These efforts resulted in improved performance across the Marketing Division, while saving the company tens of millions annually in reduced marketing spend. 
Prior to his role at Travelocity, Mr. Ayres was the Director of Online Marketing at Hotels.com where he oversaw digital marketing operations in North America and led his team to numerous awards and nominations, including Advertiser of the Year, Innovator of the Year and Hotels.com's Gold Star Award, which the company reserves for the top 1% of its performers.
"As our marketing platform becomes more technology driven, Phil's addition to our team allows us to capitalize on his experience and improve our marketing platform. We believe the experience Phil possesses in designing and implementing digital-based marketing campaigns on a global level makes him tailor-made for this very important role," said Kenneth Efird, President of Nobilis. "Throughout the course of his career, Mr. Ayres has shown the ability to improve marketing operational efficiency through dedicated application of specific SEO tactics and network analytics. As Nobilis continues to scale its marketing programs, Mr. Ayres' leadership and proven ability to reduce customer acquisition cost through technology will impact the Company's performance."

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/27/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

As with all your investments through Fidelity, you must make your own determination whether an investment is appropriate for you.  Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

First Week of February 2017 Options Trading For Nobilis Health (HLTH)
Investors in Nobilis Health Corp saw new options begin trading this week, for the February 2017 expiration. One of the key data points that goes into the price an option buyer is willing to pay, is the time value, so with 240 days until expiration the newly trading contracts represent a possible opportunity for sellers of puts or calls to achieve a higher premium than would be available for the contracts with a closer expiration.

NOBILIS
Words define us, label us and give us meaning. Nobili’s founder, Adolphe Halard choose the word – Nobilis – from the Latin word Nobile – which means distinguished or in good taste.  For nearly a century, Nobilis has lived up to that name.  Steeped in French culture, Nobilis has come to represent sophisticated elegance with a global style. Noted for both, luxury  and accessibility, Nobilis is trusted  for use in residential, high-end hotels, restaurants, yachts and businesses.
FABRIC COLLECTION
The Nobilis collection is an eclectic, colorful panache of styles, patterns, hues and textiles.  Their line literally runs from A – Agate – to – Z – Zen with a host of choices in between. Whether for blinds, upholstery, or curtains you will find fabric for outdoor, indoor, with prints, and patterns on satins, silks, cottons, sheers and wool, and that is just the start.
HISTORY
Adolphe Halard began Noblis in 1928.  Working out of a small boutique in Paris, he created wallpapers and fabrics that reflected the art scene of the day. His shop was located between the church of Saint-German-des-Paris and the fine arts school – so it was impossible not be inspired to greatness.  Since then Noblis has grown to become a worldwide textile leader with 200 associates across Europe, the United States, and the Middle East.
