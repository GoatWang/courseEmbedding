Jue Zhou & Jing Jin and Pei Zhang
























    
 


Nu Skin’s products were the driving force behind Pei Zhang’s decision to become a Nu Skin distributor after she, her husband, Wen Long Gan, and their son immigrated to Canada. She tried the products after attending a presentation and she and her friends quickly noticed her results. She then learned the compensation plan, heard leaders’ success stories and decided to take action to begin her and Wen Long’s Nu Skin journey.
 
Pei believes that diligent use of the products is key to building a successful business. Her own strong belief in the products’ benefits has catapulted her and Wen Long to a rewarding lifestyle, and given them the ability to help others transform their lives—from how they look and feel to enjoying life with their own thriving businesses. She encourages distributors to remain positive, attend meetings and events, enjoy the journey, and act as a force for good.
 
Jing Jin and Jue Zhou were looking for an opportunity that would change their future, and they found it with Nu Skin. They soon learned that Nu Skin is a business of duplicating your actions, and that it is important for you to first demonstrate to your team actions to take to achieve the results you—and they—want. Jing and Jue say they have learned the power of love through their business—loving their family, their organization of customers and distributors and people in their community whom they help.
 
Creating a dream board to keep them focused on their goals was a vital part of Jing and Jue’s success, they say, along with continuing to learn, present and help their partners as they grew their organization. Today they give back by sponsoring Tibetan students to help them attend school and improve their futures, by helping with relief efforts during natural disasters in China and through finding new ways to help others.
