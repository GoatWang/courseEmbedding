 Educational Background



Undergraduate Degree 


The Johns Hopkins University

                  The Johns Hopkins University opened in 1876, with the inauguration of its first president, Daniel Coit Gilman. "What are we aiming at?" Gilman asked in his installation address. "The encouragement of research ... and the advancement of individual scholars, who by their excellence will advance the sciences they pursue, and the society where they dwell."

The mission laid out by Gilman remains the university's mission today, summed up in a simple but powerful restatement of Gilman's own words: "Knowledge for the world."

What Gilman created was a research university, dedicated to advancing both students' knowledge and the state of human knowledge through research and scholarship. Gilman believed that teaching and research are interdependent, that success in one depends on success in the other. A modern university, he believed, must do both well. The realization of Gilman's philosophy at Johns Hopkins, and at other institutions that later attracted Johns Hopkins-trained scholars, revolutionized higher education in America, leading to the research university system as it exists today.

After more than 130 years, Johns Hopkins remains a world leader in both teaching and research. Eminent professors mentor top students in the arts and music, the humanities, the social and natural sciences, engineering, international studies, education, business and the health professions. Those same faculty members, and their research colleagues at the university's Applied Physics Laboratory, have each year since 1979 won Johns Hopkins more federal research and development funding than any other university.

The university has nine academic divisions and campuses throughout the Baltimore-Washington area. The Krieger School of Arts and Sciences, the Whiting School of Engineering, the School of Education and the Carey Business School are based at the Homewood campus in northern Baltimore. The schools of Medicine, Public Health, and Nursing share a campus in east Baltimore with The Johns Hopkins Hospital. The Peabody Institute, a leading professional school of music, is located on Mount Vernon Place in downtown Baltimore. The Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies is located in Washington's Dupont Circle area.

The Applied Physics Laboratory is a division of the university co-equal to the nine schools, but with a non-academic, research-based mission. APL, located between Baltimore and Washington, supports national security and also pursues space science, exploration of the Solar System and other civilian research and development.

Johns Hopkins also has a campus near Rockville in Montgomery County, Md., and has academic facilities in Nanjing, China, and in Bologna, Italy. It maintains a network of continuing education facilities throughout the Baltimore-Washington region, including centers in downtown Baltimore, in downtown Washington and in Columbia.

When considered in partnership with its sister institution, the Johns Hopkins Hospital and Health System, the university is Maryland's largest employer and contributes more than $10 billion a year to the state's economy

In addition to offering degrees in medicine, Weill Cornell also has PhD programs in biomedical research and education at the Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences, and with neighboring Sloan-Kettering Institute and The Rockefeller University, has established a joint MD-PhD program for students to intensify their pursuit of Weill Cornell's triple mission of education, research, and patient care.  eill Cornell Medical College is divided into 24 basic science and patient care departments that focus on the sciences underlying clinical medicine and/or encompass the study, treatment, and prevention of human diseases. In addition to its affiliation with NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, Weill Cornell Medical College and the Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences maintain major affiliations with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, The Rockefeller University, the Hospital for Special Surgery, as well as with the metropolitan-area institutions that constitute NewYork-Presbyterian Healthcare Network.

Humana Chief Medical Officer Roy Beveridge, M.D., welcomes you





We’re excited to have you come and learn more about the work we’re doing to improve people’s health by making the health care system less fragmented and more integrated. Humana is a rapidly changing company that is a leader in both population health and in the conversion from a “traditional” insurer to a true “integrated health delivery company.” 
We’re hoping you’ll join us as a member of our innovative program designed to bring physician leaders to Humana. Our rotational program will utilize the leadership skills you’ve already developed, immersing you in key areas within our company with intense executive mentorship and structured learning. Our goal is to foster the development of the next generation of physician leaders within Humana.
Learn more about our CMO

Dr. Beveridge Bio


















About the office of the CMO


One of the main focus areas of the office of the chief medical officer is to help physicians improve the health of their patients. Working alongside clinicians, we look for new ways to elevate the quality of care and health outcomes of each individual patient. Learn more about how the office of the CMO is helping to improve population health. 









Browse our publications


The office of the chief medical officer continually advocates for improvements to the health system. One way we do that is by partnering with academic centers and professional organizations to conduct research that is peer-reviewed, reliable and relevant.
Our research publications can be found at humana.com/research 
The following two studies are examples of these valuable partnerships:
Synchronization of Medication Refill Dates and Adherence
In this prospective-controlled study, synchronizing prescription refill dates of multiple medications increased adherence by up to 4 percentage points relative to control.  
Leveraging Health-related Quality of Life in Population Health Management: The Case for Healthy Days
In this article, the authors describe the CDC’s quality of life tool, Healthy Days, and why quality of life is so important in improving health.









We work hard to create awareness


In addition to ongoing research, the office of the chief medical officer also maintains a presence in popular medical publications through guest columns or informative articles. 

















Simplicity in health care


Together with Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services (CMS) and other commercial payers, we’re working toward consistency in reporting for physicians.

I found Dr. Dufresne’s office environment to be warm and inviting, and the office staff kind and accommodating. After discussing with him my facial skin issues (I have very elastic skin that continues to stretch over time creating small rolls of skin on my face and neck), we agreed to a conservative game plan that not only gave me strong confidence in his ability to perform the surgery, but also a sense of comfort with the surgical approach and follow-on support. Dr. Dufresne respected my thinking about the surgical procedure prior to surgery and cared about meeting my needs both surgically and post-operational support. His surgical nurses are friendly and professionally top-notch. The surgical results were incredible and provided me renewed confidence with a new lease on life. He is honest and was able to accomplish what other surgeons believed was difficult to achieve. It is easy to see why Dr. Dufresne is viewed by his peers as an extraordinary plastic surgeon. Should there ever be a Hall of Fame for Plastic Surgeons, I strongly believe that through Dr. Dufresne’s demonstrated extraordinary results in my surgery, as well as his renowned achievements in reconstructive surgeries illustrated in text books and documentaries, he would be a first-ballet inductee! I am so happy that I found the right doctor. Liu Wei PLLC DRkennygee ratedI am a patient with disabilities, and was refused service because of my predisposition. I'm sorry but i can't help my disability, and according to the Hippocratic Oath, doctors are to do no harm and help the patient to the best of their abilities. I feel very wronged here, and i hope patients have a good idea of who she is after reading this. Although Dr. Liu has good ratings, she discriminates on her patients and doesn't allow the patient to voice their concerns. She is very short tempered, authoritative, and unforgiving.I wish the best of luck to her, because this type of patient service is damaging to individuals and exemplifies the heartless ignorance some doctors harbor.Med-First Urgent CareFairfax city R. ratedThe best certified physicians located in city Fairfax Main St. providing urgent medical care when appointments aren't available. I had a fever of over 100 degrees a while back and they were very competent and caring even in the middle of the night. The staff has vast knowledge and experience. And even charging fair price in case your insurance plans are not covered by them. The only thing that really bothered me was their extra paper work. It seemed a lot. I hope they reduce it soon.Shah, Soloman, MDPrefer A. ratedExcellent physician in every way!  He is extremely knowledgeable, spends time talking to his patients, and is an excellent practitioner regarding his ability to scope. I know this because I have worked with him and he is my personal GI doctor. I would (and often do) highly recommend him!Visual HealthFairfax city R. ratedThe doctor here is very informative, kind and caring. Staff is great for repairing broken glasses. The shop is easier to reach from my house as well being located on Fairfax Blvd. Got an eye exam for $59 and the best part is I got a free pair of lens on my Gucci frame.Otolaryngology AssociatesFairfax city R. ratedI found a great place for treatment of my throat and tonsils infection. Staff was very patient & empathetic to me. Rooms smells nice all the time and cleanliness is up to the mark. Good professionals and I also liked their positive attitude.Gurpreet, S Bajwa, MDjtremper ratedDefinitly a GREAT Dr.!!!I have been seeing Dr. Bajwa for 3 years now, & definitly plan on continuing to see him until he retires or i move out of state!! :)Did You Know?Physicians and surgeons help to keep people - from infants to the elderly - as healthy as possible. These individuals provide diagnoses and treatments for a wide variety of ailments, and preventative care and early detection for more serious illnesses. Whether you love or hate going to the doctor, the fact is your physician is there to listen to your health concerns, take preventative measures against diseases and advise you on your options for staying in tip-top shape.In 2013, there were more than 1 million doctors of medicine in the U.S., over 854,000 of which were active. Additionally, in 2012, there were about 18,000 active general surgeons in the country. It's important to know which type of physician or surgeon you need, how to choose the best one, and account for other considerations in order to stay healthy.Different Types of PhysiciansPatients can choose from a wide variety of physicians depending on doctor specialty and what problems they are experiencing. Here are a few of the most common types of physicians that you may see in your lifetime:General Practitioner
Your GP is the doctor that you go to for regular checkups, vaccines and to identify health issues. GPs can treat many different illnesses and injuries, from the common cold to a broken arm. If your health requires a second opinion or expert care, the GP will refer you to a specialist who has the skills to focus in on the issue.Cardiologist
Heart attacks and heart disease are some of the most common afflictions seen across the country, making cardiologists important to your long-term health. These physicians specialize in studying and treating the heart and related diseases.Dentist
Other than a GP, the dentist is likely the most common physician you'll ever see. These professionals work with the human mouth, ensuring that your teeth and gum health are up to par. Patients typically go to the dentist twice a year.Dermatologist
Dermatologists are focused on skin-related issues and diseases, from skin cancers, to acute acne, eczema, psoriasis, and general cosmetic concerns like aging and scars. Most will also perform annual or semi-annual mole checks to screen for any signs of melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer.ENT
If you have a number of sinus infections or have had your tonsils taken out, you've likely seen an ENT specialist. ENTs handle ailments related to the ear, nose and throat, often related to taking out tonsils and treating hearing issues.OB/GYN
For many women, their gynecologist and obstetrician are the same person. These professionals work with the female reproductive system to focus on reproductive health, fertility issues, prenatal care, options for new and expectant mothers, neonatal care and childbirth. OB/GYNs can also help in the early detection of breast or cervical cancer.Choosing a PhysicianThere are obviously a number of physicians that you can choose from, but how do you know if they're the best choice for you? Here are a few considerations to help you pick a physician:Look at Your Insurance
Before you get down to the details, you need to verify which doctors are covered by your insurance and whether they are in or out of your carrier's network. Rates may be cheaper if the doc is in network – a doctor can be covered by your insurance but not necessarily in network. Out of network is typically more expensive. Doctors often add and drop plans, so it's important to ensure that your options are compatible with your insurance plan. Doing your homework will help you avoid unexpected expenses. Check for Board Certification
Your physician should be certified through the American Board of Medical Specialties. Doctors must earn a medical degree from a qualified school, complete three to seven years of residency training, be licensed by a state medical board and pass one or more ABMS exams to be certified.Examine the Reviews
Reviews of a doctor can reveal a lot about what your experience may be like. People may grade on staff friendliness, availability and effectiveness of treatment. Looking at these evaluations and getting recommendations from family and friends can direct you toward a physician for your needs.Choosing a SurgeonSurgeons can literally hold your life in their hands, and it's important to find the best one that can put you at ease and treat you effectivelyCompatibility Factor
You need to feel comfortable with your surgeon. It's important to communicate your concerns and that your surgeon can respond adequately. Surgeons should be willing to go over the details of your procedure and answer any questions that you may have. They must take the time to discuss and address your worries.Expertise Level
If you're going in for surgery, you want someone that knows what they're doing and has a high success rate. Ask how often the surgeon performs this surgery and try to find one that regularly does it. This will give you peace of mind that you're in capable hands.Understanding Your InsuranceYour decision on a physician or surgeon can be majorly affected by the insurance plan you have. You may have insurance through employment, your spouse, your parents if you're under 26, or the marketplace if the previous options don't apply to you. It's important to understand how your insurance works to have the full picture of what you'll need to pay for.Your insurance will have a deductible, which is the amount that you're responsible to pay for covered medical expenses. Some plans have coinsurances, where you must pay a certain percentage of the bill, and insurance will cover the rest. Co-pays state a flat rate for certain services, like paying $20 when you visit your GP or a $100 co-pay for an emergency room visit. Once you reach your out-of-pocket maximum, which will differ if you're an individual or within a family plan, your insurance may pay for 100 percent of covered medical expenses for the rest of the plan year.If you plan to go to the doctor, need medication or have been recommended for surgery, call your insurance provider or go online to see what your plan covers. You can choose the best doctor for your needs, understand your options and prevent yourself from being blindsided by medical expenses.Setting Your AppointmentMost doctors require a phone call for an appointment, although some may provide online scheduling as well. Be sure to have your insurance card with you when you set an appointment, and to bring it with you to the actual appointment. They need the ID numbers to verify your coverage, and will usually make a copy of the card for their files so you don't have to show it again unless your insurance changes.When you call, let them know if you're a new patient, as this will require you to complete some paperwork for your first visit. Tell them the reason for your visit, such as your symptoms if you're feeling sick. It's also important to inform them if you have Medicaid and to find out if you need to bring anything to the visit, like current medications or medical records.From here, the receptionist will likely ask what dates and times work best for you. During your call, it's important to be honest about your symptoms and the reason for your visit. This information will help the doctor treat you and give him or her an idea of what to expect. Your appointment may progress faster as a result, and the doctor can come prepared with a list of options to better care for you.RisksDoctors see a number of patients in a day, sometimes in 15-minute increments in areas where the physicians are in high demand. This can leave little time for doctors to perform thorough examinations, and they can end up missing certain problem indicators. While some problems, like a cold or flu, can be diagnosed in this time, more complex ailments require attention, which takes up time. Reviews can illuminate which doctors actively spend the necessary time with their patients and which ones are pressed against the clock to meet demand.Surgery has some more dire risks attached to it, so be sure to talk to your surgeon about the potential issues that can come up as a result of your procedure. If a patient has a reaction to anesthesia, it can cause very serious complications, but this is an uncommon occurrence. Blood clots can be a significant problem after surgery, often caused by inactivity during recovery. Infections, numbness, scarring, swelling and death are all possible, but the likelihood of these issues will vary depending on the type of surgery you're undergoing. Talk to your doctor about your concerns and your risk potential.AftercareSurgery affects people in different ways, but as you begin to emerge from anesthesia, you'll want to alert your nurse to any issues you may have. The nurse will tell you how the procedure went, what effect it will have on your condition, what to expect when you get home and how long it will take to get back to normal. If you start feeling pain, the nurse may give you medication to stop it from getting worse. When possible, it's also advised to move around to avoid blood clots from developing in your legs. This can be as simple as occasionally flexing your knee or rotating your foot. Some surgeries are outpatient procedures, where people are released the same day. For major surgeries, patients may stay at the hospital for a few days to be monitored and address any concerns before being sent home. Discuss with your surgeon the projected length of the hospital stay and what you need to bring.Recovery and Follow-upYour recovery time and follow-up expectations will vary depending on your procedure. For example, you can be expected to be on your feet within a few days of having your wisdom teeth taken out, but it may be weeks before you have fully recovered from a broken foot or heart-valve surgery. Your surgeon will give you a list of things that you'll need to do during this time, including what medications to take and when you'll be able to get back to work and other activities.Every surgery will have a follow-up call or appointment to discuss your recovery and allow you to ask any questions about unusual symptoms or changes in your overall health. If you have a major operation, like heart surgery, it's important to make regular checkups with your doctor or a specialist to ensure that everything is normal. Visiting a doctor will help deter infection and verify that everything is healing as expected. These appointments will give you peace of mind about your state of health and ensure that any issues are caught early on.
