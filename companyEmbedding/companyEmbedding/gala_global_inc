Gala Global, Inc. Plans for New Products and Service From Hemp and CannabisNovember 06, 2014 |  About: 
GLAG  +0%
GRNH  +0%



Cannabis Ventures, Inc. Plans for Operational Expansion in Canada for MMPR

LOS ANGELES, CA--(Marketwired - Nov 6, 2014) -  Gala Global, Inc. (OTCQB: GLAG) today announced expansion plans for business opportunities related to Hemp and Cannabis. The Hemp and Cannabis plant provide applications for new products and service offering from Gala Global. The new focus and direction for GALA is to stay in line with natural and eco-friendly products but allow such products to be used for multiple applications.
Cannabis Ventures, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Gala Global based in Canada currently has an application in review with Health Canada for the Marijuana for Medical Purposes Regulations (MMPR) license. Cannabis Ventures, Inc. plans to operate a cultivation facility servicing Health Canada patients upon receiving approval. The cultivation facility would use the Greengro Technologies Inc (PINKSHEETS: GRNH) all new modular grow rooms. http://greengrotech.com/gro-rooms/ 
Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with GLAG. Click here to check it out. 
GLAG 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of GLAGPeter Lynch Chart of GLAGGala Global will immediately introduce Hemp based textile to its existing product line. The added Hemp based clothing product in its current distribution of all-natural everyday custom tailored women's clothing products from England has multiple benefits. Hemp textile can repels up to 95% of UV rays. Hemp is more water absorbent which can be applied for active wear. This is a natural transition to bring focus to our core interest in working with Hemp and Cannabis plant.
Gala Global Inc. is also working on developing its own line of natural lotions and oils based on Cannabidiol (CBD) derived from the Hemp and Cannabis plant. CBD lotions and oil is a natural based healthy alternative for an overall daily application. The initial CBD derived products planned will be extracted from industrial hemp with no traces of THC. Gala is currently in discussions to add additional services and product offerings. The expansion plans will focus on the development, research, and commercialization of products derived initially from the Hemp plant.
"We are enthusiastic on the new direct and value add to our shareholders on the vast opportunity in the Hemp and Cannabis sector. Gala management is confident that we can create new collaborations and business opportunities and we believe that Gala can contribute greatly to the expansion and development of future products," said George Lefevre, CEO of Gala Global. 
Mr. Lefevre further added, "It's very important for us to reach a common goal to provide and create top quality products related to Hemp and Cannabis. Hemp and Cannabis also allows us to explore other opportunities outside the current product offering. The additional Hemp and Cannabis products Gala plans to offer are related to Hemp and Cannabis CBD oils (cannabidiol). We are currently seeking acquisition candidates in this area of interest in the nutraceutical and pharmaceutical industries. We plan to launch a powerful solution for our shareholders interest."

Business Expansion (Subsequent event):
On May 8, 2017, Gala Global Inc. ("GLAG") and Controlled Environment Genomics,
Inc. ("CEG") entered into a definitive agreement whereby GLAG is acquiring 80%
of CEG. The transaction will be closing shortly.
Controlled Environment Genomics, Inc. (CEG), Akron, Ohio, is a genomics company
with expertise in digital plant gene sequencing, editing and cloning
technologies. Genomics is an interdisciplinary field of science and branch of
molecular biology focused on the structure, function, evolution and mapping of
genomes, complete sets of DNA within single cells of an organism. CEG's
state-of-the-art genomics technology enables computerized genome sequencing and
plant cloning using a fully automated turnkey solution for digitally sequencing
the genomes of the world's most desirable plant varieties based on flavor and
nutrition.
CEG improves the most valuable crop varieties currently available on the market
by utilizing proprietary Cloud computing-based digital cloning technologies to
crossbreed crops that have advantageous traits with established varieties
featuring the best genetic profiles for commercial production. The very best
plant traits can be used to improve the most sought-after commercial varieties
by adding characteristics like maximized yields and quality conducive to
increased consumer demand and optimized production profitability.
CEG's patent-pending digital cloning technology makes it possible for plant
breeders to edit the original genetic profile of any crop by modifying it with
specific genes that control traits like active compound production and/or
nutritional/medicinal value, thus increasing business efficiencies while
boosting commercial viability.
CEG Inc. designed its digital plant cloning incubation and growth chambers with
plant breeders in mind. CEG incubation technology enables breeders to control
temperature, light, humidity and more for agricultural biotechnology,
phytopathology, entomology and other plant science research. Using CEG
technology, plant breeders can quickly clone hybridized plants containing
specific desirable genes and traits "on demand" in any geographical location.

About us




A Pioneer in South Asian Entertainment


Over the course of 35 years, the team behind Gala Global Inc. has brought more than 1,000 quality feature films and television programs to audiences worldwide.


 


Beginning in 1968 with the release of An Evening in Paris, the Gala team was among the first distributors to import Indian films in the United States, Canada, Latin America, and the UK.  Over the years, we cultivated these new markets through the first release of hit films including Aradhana, Ram aur Shyam, Roti Kapada Aur Makaan, Dulhan Wohi Jo Piya Man Bhaye, Mother India, Main Tulsi Tere Aangan Ki, Waqt, Tere Mere Sapne, Guddi, Abhimaan,  Gopi, Mausam, Mere Mehboob, and Dharam Veer.   


 


In the mid 1970’s, Manu Savani (President, Gala Global Inc) launched “Cinema Cinema,” the first Indian television program in North America. The program, which was seen by a large number of viewers from South Asia, started a trend in Indian television broadcasting in North America.


 


Global Growth


In the late 1970s, we expanded our footprint by introducing independent Hollywood films to emerging markets in East Africa, West Africa, Pacific Islands, and West Indies.  Over the years, Gala brought titles such as Bedroom Eyes, Missing in Action II, Invasion USA, Breakin’ 2: Electric Boogaloo, Titanic, and Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace to a growing audience of international filmgoers.


 


In the mid 1980s, upon India’s liberalization of the importation of Hollywood films, the Gala team was a pioneer in exporting American motion pictures to India.  


 


By the 1990s, Manu Savani began working closely with the American Film Marketing Association (AFMA) as a consultant on India. Gala also became an exclusive agent for Twentieth Century Fox products for East Africa.


 


In the mid-1990s, we also brought When Love Calls, the English-dubbed version of the Bollywood hit film Maine Pyar Kiya, to audiences in the United States, Canada, and East Africa. 


 


In 1997, our team ventured into the Indian film exhibition business by opening Fox Theatre in Covina, California.  Fox was the first multiplex theatre catering solely to a South Asian audience in the United States, and has paved the way for multiplex South Asian cinemas in major markets throughout the United States.


 


Today


Today, Gala is a leading buyer, seller, and distributor of American and Indian films for theatrical, television, airline, and DVD markets in Asia, Africa, Middle East, Latin America, Caribbean, and Pacific Islands. 


 


Gala is also the exclusive copyright holder of a library of hundreds of classic Indian films from the 1950’s through today. 


 


In addition, Gala has diversified into a significant player in the media technology space, specializing in offering theatrical equipment and digital film colorization services.

The Market
The rapidly evolving market of plant genetics and plant genomics is a key part of the growing scientific and economic ecosystem spurred by the advent of high-throughput genome sequencing.
The small flowering mustard plant Arabidopsis thaliana, easy to grow in the laboratory and featuring a relatively small genome (just five chromosomes), was the gold standard for plant research in the 1980s.  As a result, in 2000 Arabidopsis was the first plant to be completely sequenced.
Flash forward and in 2016 the global genome editing market reached US$2.84 billion in value and is expected to reach US$5.54 billion by 2021, growing at a CAGR of 14.3%, according to a 2016 report from Markets and Markets titled “Genome Editing/Genome Engineering Market.”
According to the report, the global genome editing market is segmented on the basis of technology, application, end user and region.
Understanding Genetics and Genomics
Genetics  — the study of heredity and the variation of inherited characteristic
Genomics — an interdisciplinary field of science and branch of molecular biology focusing on the structure, function, evolution and mapping of genomes – complete sets of DNA within single cells of an organism.
Genomic — related to the complete set of genes or genetic material present in a cell or organism.
Genome — the complete set of genes or genetic material present in a cell or organism.
Genotype — an organism’s complete heritable genetic identity
Phenotype — the set of observable characteristics of an individual resulting from the interaction of its genotype with the environment.

Gala Global, Inc. Plans for New Products and Service From Hemp and Cannabis

Cannabis Ventures, Inc. Plans for Operational Expansion in Canada for MMPR

LOS ANGELES, CA--(Marketwired - Nov 6, 2014) -  Gala Global, Inc. (OTCQB: GLAG) today announced expansion plans for business opportunities related to Hemp and Cannabis. The Hemp and Cannabis plant provide applications for new products and service offering from Gala Global. The new focus and direction for GALA is to stay in line with natural and eco-friendly products but allow such products to be used for multiple applications.
Cannabis Ventures, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Gala Global based in Canada currently has an application in review with Health Canada for the Marijuana for Medical Purposes Regulations (MMPR) license. Cannabis Ventures, Inc. plans to operate a cultivation facility servicing Health Canada patients upon receiving approval. The cultivation facility would use the Greengro Technologies Inc (PINKSHEETS: GRNH) all new modular grow rooms. http://greengrotech.com/gro-rooms/ 
Gala Global will immediately introduce Hemp based textile to its existing product line. The added Hemp based clothing product in its current distribution of all-natural everyday custom tailored women's clothing products from England has multiple benefits. Hemp textile can repels up to 95% of UV rays. Hemp is more water absorbent which can be applied for active wear. This is a natural transition to bring focus to our core interest in working with Hemp and Cannabis plant.
Gala Global Inc. is also working on developing its own line of natural lotions and oils based on Cannabidiol (CBD) derived from the Hemp and Cannabis plant. CBD lotions and oil is a natural based healthy alternative for an overall daily application. The initial CBD derived products planned will be extracted from industrial hemp with no traces of THC. Gala is currently in discussions to add additional services and product offerings. The expansion plans will focus on the development, research, and commercialization of products derived initially from the Hemp plant.
"We are enthusiastic on the new direct and value add to our shareholders on the vast opportunity in the Hemp and Cannabis sector. Gala management is confident that we can create new collaborations and business opportunities and we believe that Gala can contribute greatly to the expansion and development of future products," said George Lefevre, CEO of Gala Global. 
Mr. Lefevre further added, "It's very important for us to reach a common goal to provide and create top quality products related to Hemp and Cannabis. Hemp and Cannabis also allows us to explore other opportunities outside the current product offering. The additional Hemp and Cannabis products Gala plans to offer are related to Hemp and Cannabis CBD oils (cannabidiol). We are currently seeking acquisition candidates in this area of interest in the nutraceutical and pharmaceutical industries. We plan to launch a powerful solution for our shareholders interest."

Steiner published his work in 1924 to combat the rapid worldwide decline in crop nutritional value and fertility occurring in the 20th century as a result of monoculture practices and the overuse of pesticides. The science of indoor agriculture is founded on the need for crop production as a closed loop agricultural system, self-contained and self-sustaining, creating and maintaining life, free of external contaminants and the production of pollution. Tim has helped make Dr. Steiner’s vision a reality in his own work through entrepreneurship and the invention and development of proprietary controlled environment technologies operated by artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and powered by integrated renewable energy systems.Contact:
