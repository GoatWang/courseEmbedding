As a subject matter expert in data science, including machine learning and cognitive computing, Mitchell was someone I could count on to make himself available to answer questions, create content, and even be a panelist on a webinar, all while managing his client engagements effectively. Notably, he had an uncommon ability to communicate complex technical concepts in simple terms that non-specialized audiences could understand.
