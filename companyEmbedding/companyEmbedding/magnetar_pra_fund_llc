History[edit]
Magnetar Capital was founded in 2005 by Alec Litowitz (formerly of Citadel LLC) and Ross Laser (formerly of Glennwood Capital Partners). It is based in Evanston, Illinois.[1]
In 2006, Magnetar Capital began to buy large amounts of equity tranches in CDO deals. Partner David Snyderman (also formerly of Citadel LLC) told Derivatives Week at the time that Magnetar Capital was "excited about the opportunities in the mortgage derivatives market".[1] From 2006-2007 Magnetar Capital sponsored (bought the equity tranche of) about $30 billion worth of CDOs.[2] Many of the CDOs were named after stars or constellations.
Around 2006, Magnetar Capital received marketing from Goldman Sachs regarding "short bets" against the housing market via an Asset-backed securities index (ABX).[3] That year, Andrew Sterge (formerly of Cooper Neff Group, BNP Paribas) brought his team from AJ Sterge Investments to work for Magnetar Capital.[4] Magnetar Capital also hired Michael Gross of Apollo Management[5] and started a reinsurance company called Pulsar Re.[4] Also in the same year, a team at Calyon bank participated in multiple deals involving Magnetar Capital CDOs. The team, led by Alexander Rekeda, left Calyon for the Mizuho bank in late 2006. In 2007, Mizuho did more CDO deals with Magnetar Capital.[6][7][8][9]
In 2007, Magnetar Capital participated in a series of CDO deals with GSC Partners and JP Morgan Chase. They would later become the center of an Securities and Exchange Commission case against JP Morgan.[10][11] In October of that year, Magnetar Capital set up a Credit Derivatives Product Company (CDPC) named Quadrant Structured Credit Products, with Lehman Brothers. Employees included Gene Park (formerly of AIG), Martin Nance, and others. Fitch Ratings rated it AAA in October 2007 and withdrew its rating in October 2008. In December 2008, Quadrant bought competitor Cournot. Moody's withdrew its rating in February 2009.[12][13][14][15][16][17]
As of 2010, 23 of the CDOs sponsored by Magnetar Capital had become "nearly worthless".[18][19]
The 2010 Ig Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to executives and directors of Magnetar Capital, among others, "for creating and promoting new ways to invest money—ways that maximize financial gain and minimize financial risk for the world economy, or for a portion thereof."
In 2012 Intesa Sanpaolo sued Magnetar Capital (and others) for alleged fraud related to Pyxis ABS CDO 2006-1.[20]
The US Federal Securities and Exchange Commission had been investigating deals involving Magnetar Capital for years, for example the JP Morgan settlement regarding Squared CDO 2007-1. ProPublica published a summary of these activities in 2012. The Wall Street Journal reported that same year that the SEC was directly investigating Magnetar Capital itself.[21]
In 2015 Institutional Investor/Alpha magazine gave Magnetar an A grade and the #4 ranking among hedge funds worldwide.[22]

In the press[edit]
Several journalists and writers have reported on the Magnetar Capital CDO program. Janet Tavakoli says that she covered the strategy itself in her book of 2003, before Magnetar Capital was founded.[26] In 2006 Derivatives Week did a story on the strategy. In 2008 the Wall Street Journal published "A Fund Behind Astronomical Losses" by Serena Ng and Carrick Mollenkamp.[2] In mid‑2010 two more indepth analyses appeared, one a joint effort between NPR and ProPublica, and another in the 2010 book ECONned by Yves Smith, in connection with her website nakedcapitalism.com
Tavakoli[edit]
Janet Tavakoli, a financial industry expert and consultant with many years experience, had been writing about structured finance in a series of books starting in 1998. In her 2008 book, "Structured Finance and Collateralized Debt Obligations" (2nd ed.), she specifically mentioned Magnetar Capital's "Constellation CDOs" in the chapter on "The Credit Crunch and CDOs". She described the deals as "classic long equity, short mezzanine", a type of deal whose moral hazards she explored elsewhere in the book.[27] In addition, she wrote

"Constellation CDOs seemed designed to fail and were largely synthetic"[28]

In her diagram of the capital structure, she noted that the Monoline insurers were major investors. Elsewhere in the book she predicted the Monolines would have huge losses related to CDOs and time proved her correct [29] She also noted that "Excess interest is sometimes paid to the equity investor, creating a conflict of interest", a theme that would be central to subsequent media stories.[28]
ProPublica / NPR / This American Life report[edit]
In 2010 This American Life, of Chicago Public Radio, broadcast a radio show on Magnetar Capital's CDO strategy. The report was by Alex Blumberg, of the NPR Planet Money project. The report consisted largely of Blumberg's interviews with Jesse Eisinger and Jake Bernstein, of ProPublica, whom Blumberg had commissioned to research possible financial misdeeds related to the subprime housing bubble. Eisinger and Bernstein interviewed dozens of people who had worked in the industry and many who were directly involved in Magnetar Capital deals.[30] Eisinger and Bernstein won the Pulitzer Prize of 2011 for their series on the CDO industry. It was the first Pulitzer for work published only on the web.
ProPublica's written story came out on their website in April 2010, coinciding with the radio show. It alleged that the company's trades in the CDO market helped worsen the financial crisis of 2007–2010 by helping to structure CDOs it was planning to short (bet against).[30]
The story essentially claimed that Magnetar Capital "sponsored" mortgage-backed collateralized debt obligations by agreeing to buy the worst tranche (portion) of the CDO, the "equity tranche". Since very few wanted to invest in the risky Equity Tranche, those few that did were called "sponsors"; without them the CDO would never get created. The ProPublica stories claimed that Magnetar Capital then shorted (bet against) the better tranches of those (and similar) CDOs by buying credit default swaps that insured them. When the middle tranches of the CDOs failed, Magnetar Capital made back many times its initial investment in the equity tranche by receiving the insurance payoff.[18][31]
The report also claimed that Magnetar Capital tried to influence the managers of the CDOs it was instrumental in creating, to buy certain risky bonds that would increase the risk of those CDOs failing. It also claims that Magnetar Capital CDOs "defaulted" at a significantly higher rate than similar CDOs. (This may reflect Magnetar Capital's superior performance in identifying which of the "high-quality" tranches were most overpriced.) They also claim that the CDO market would have "cooled off" in late 2005 if Magnetar Capital had not entered the market, and that this would have resulted in the financial crisis being less severe.[18][32][33]
Magnetar Capital's response[edit]
Magnetar Capital disputed the story. Many of its responses were explained in ProPublica's story and in a detailed letter Magnetar Capital sent to ProPublica, posted on ProPublica's website. Magnetar Capital said, among other things, that it was not betting, it was hedging, that most of its hedges were against non-Magnetar-Capital CDOs, and that it was not making CDOs that were "built to fail" on purpose. It also claimed that its strategy was not based on a downturn in the housing market (that is, it did not bet that mortgage-backed CDOs would default). It detailed many of its objections in a letter and list of responses to ProPublica, which are linked to on ProPublica's website.[34][35]
Magnetar Capital stated to investors that it never sought to bet on the decline of the subprime-mortgage market.[36] Rather, the firm states, it had no embedded view regarding the direction of housing prices, the rate of mortgage defaults, or the subprime mortgage market generally. Instead, Magnetar Capital claimed it sought to profit from arbitrage: its perception that the riskiest, high-yield tranches of CDOs were underpriced relative to the less-risky low-yield tranches. The firm expected to make a profit when either the overpriced securities declined or when the underpriced securities appreciated. With the collapse of the subprime market, Magnetar Capital lost money on the risky tranches but made a net profit because the overpriced tranches declined even further. Magnetar Capital rejected the idea that it had picked securities purposely so that they would fail.[2][18][31][34][35][37]
The theory[citation needed] is that Magnetar Capital was essentially betting that the likelihood of multiple defaults on the underlying loans was more likely than was reflected in the price of the higher tranches. The high prices of the "high-quality" tranches reflected the assumption that any defaults would be localized and unrelated, so that it was unlikely that much of the portfolio would default at once. Magnetar Capital was betting that, in all likelihood, if the equity tranch lost its value, the rest of the CDO would lose value as well, because many defaults were likely to happen together. This is what, in fact, happened.[citation needed]
Magnetar Capital also disparaged the reporters, stating that "the questions we received from you [the ProPublica reporters] last week, and the assertions reflected in those questions, reflect significant inaccuracies or misunderstandings regarding aspects of Magnetar Capital’s investment strategy".[35]
Later, Magnetar Capital wrote a letter to its investors, rebutting many of the claims in the ProPublica story. IE:

"we wanted to address the recent publicity regarding our Mortgage CDO investment strategy. At the center of these stories is a blatantly false and misleading story written by ProPublica, an online news outlet, regarding our Mortgage CDO investment strategy that was active from 2006 through 2007. Despite our best efforts to educate ProPublica’s reporters about the specifics of Magnetar Capital’s Mortgage CDO investment strategy as well as the general process and market circumstances regarding the structuring and issuance of CDOs, ProPublica simply got the story wrong."
[38]
Despite the claims that these trades lead to price distortions, it is generally acknowledged that arbitrage leads to price stability and convergence.
Counter Response[edit]
ProPublica's editor-in-chief, Paul Steiger, responded to Magnetar Capital's letter and wrote:

"Magnetar [Capital]’s letter doesn’t deny that it purchased collateralized debt obligation (CDO) equity, that it bet against many of those CDOs, or that it exercised influence over the construction of the portfolios. In particular, it doesn't deny and in one case admits that it pushed for higher returns and hence greater risk in the portfolios...In short, we see nothing in our story to correct."

ProPublica continued to publish articles on Magnetar Capital throughout 2010 and 2011.
Naked Capitalism / EConned[edit]
Yves Smith of the nakedcapitalism.com, along with other bloggers at that site, also worked on describing and analyzing Magnetar Capital's CDO program.
Smith also wrote a book, ECONned: How Unenlightened Self Interest Undermined Democracy and Corrupted Capitalism, in 2010 which contains a detailed description of Magnetar Capital's activities. It cites anonymous sources affiliated with institutions that did business with Magnetar Capital. Her research was gathered in October 2009 and the book came out in March 2010.[39][40] The book goes into detail surrounding the motives of the various parties and the numbers involved that made the deal profitable. It also describes the large size of Magnetar Capital's play in proportion to the subprime market as a whole. The book gives a larger context for the Magnetar Capital arbitrage, fitting into Smith's thesis of the modern science of economics being largely a failure.[41]
Smith and the nakedcapitalism.com bloggers continued to post articles regarding Magnetar Capital throughout 2010. They also produced a spreadsheet analyzing the Magnetar Capital CDOs, similar to the one found at ProPublica.[42][43]
Moe Tkacik, formerly of the Wall Street Journal, worked with individuals from nakedcapitalism.com on an article about the relationship (and large number of campaign donations) between Barack Obama's chief of staff Rahm Emanuel and Magnetar Capital CEO Alec Litowitz. Moe's article was "de-published" from DailyFinance, but Yves Smith published another version of the story on Huffington Post.[44]
Senate Report of 2011[edit]




Lippman describes Magnetar Capital's arbitrage as "buying equity and shorting the single names…a bit devious"






Lippman offers to explain how Magnetar Capital distorted the market


In April, 2011, the United States Senate released the Levin-Coburn report on "Wall Street and the Financial Crisis". Their report went in depth into the activities of Greg Lippman, the head global CDO trader of Deutsche Bank. He was a CDO expert and worked at the heart of the Synthetic CDO market during the credit bubble. He also is featured in the book The Big Short by Michael Lewis; it describes his attempts to sell "short positions" on the mortgage security market to hedge funds.
In the report transcript, Lippman describes Magnetar Capital's strategy of shorting one part of the CDO while buying the other; he also writes about what he thinks their view of the housing market is. When asked if they are "bearish on housing", he says that "yes…as they are buying equity and shorting the single names…a bit devious".
In another email, someone asks him how Magnetar Capital has distorted the market. In the report transcript, no explanation is provided; Lippman indicates only that he has an "easy, but lengthy answer".
Huber Heights, Ohio[edit]
In January 2013, the firm became the largest homeowner in Huber Heights, Ohio by buying almost 2,000 homes from the family of the town's original developer. It rents these homes as part of its investment strategy.[45]

History[edit]
Magnetar Capital was founded in 2005 by Alec Litowitz (formerly of Citadel LLC) and Ross Laser (formerly of Glennwood Capital Partners). It is based in Evanston, Illinois.[1]
In 2006, Magnetar Capital began to buy large amounts of equity tranches in CDO deals. Partner David Snyderman (also formerly of Citadel LLC) told Derivatives Week at the time that Magnetar Capital was "excited about the opportunities in the mortgage derivatives market".[1] From 2006-2007 Magnetar Capital sponsored (bought the equity tranche of) about $30 billion worth of CDOs.[2] Many of the CDOs were named after stars or constellations.
Around 2006, Magnetar Capital received marketing from Goldman Sachs regarding "short bets" against the housing market via an Asset-backed securities index (ABX).[3] That year, Andrew Sterge (formerly of Cooper Neff Group, BNP Paribas) brought his team from AJ Sterge Investments to work for Magnetar Capital.[4] Magnetar Capital also hired Michael Gross of Apollo Management[5] and started a reinsurance company called Pulsar Re.[4] Also in the same year, a team at Calyon bank participated in multiple deals involving Magnetar Capital CDOs. The team, led by Alexander Rekeda, left Calyon for the Mizuho bank in late 2006. In 2007, Mizuho did more CDO deals with Magnetar Capital.[6][7][8][9]
In 2007, Magnetar Capital participated in a series of CDO deals with GSC Partners and JP Morgan Chase. They would later become the center of an Securities and Exchange Commission case against JP Morgan.[10][11] In October of that year, Magnetar Capital set up a Credit Derivatives Product Company (CDPC) named Quadrant Structured Credit Products, with Lehman Brothers. Employees included Gene Park (formerly of AIG), Martin Nance, and others. Fitch Ratings rated it AAA in October 2007 and withdrew its rating in October 2008. In December 2008, Quadrant bought competitor Cournot. Moody's withdrew its rating in February 2009.[12][13][14][15][16][17]
As of 2010, 23 of the CDOs sponsored by Magnetar Capital had become "nearly worthless".[18][19]
The 2010 Ig Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to executives and directors of Magnetar Capital, among others, "for creating and promoting new ways to invest money—ways that maximize financial gain and minimize financial risk for the world economy, or for a portion thereof."
In 2012 Intesa Sanpaolo sued Magnetar Capital (and others) for alleged fraud related to Pyxis ABS CDO 2006-1.[20]
The US Federal Securities and Exchange Commission had been investigating deals involving Magnetar Capital for years, for example the JP Morgan settlement regarding Squared CDO 2007-1. ProPublica published a summary of these activities in 2012. The Wall Street Journal reported that same year that the SEC was directly investigating Magnetar Capital itself.[21]
In 2015 Institutional Investor/Alpha magazine gave Magnetar an A grade and the #4 ranking among hedge funds worldwide.[22]

In the press[edit]
Several journalists and writers have reported on the Magnetar Capital CDO program. Janet Tavakoli says that she covered the strategy itself in her book of 2003, before Magnetar Capital was founded.[26] In 2006 Derivatives Week did a story on the strategy. In 2008 the Wall Street Journal published "A Fund Behind Astronomical Losses" by Serena Ng and Carrick Mollenkamp.[2] In mid‑2010 two more indepth analyses appeared, one a joint effort between NPR and ProPublica, and another in the 2010 book ECONned by Yves Smith, in connection with her website nakedcapitalism.com
Tavakoli[edit]
Janet Tavakoli, a financial industry expert and consultant with many years experience, had been writing about structured finance in a series of books starting in 1998. In her 2008 book, "Structured Finance and Collateralized Debt Obligations" (2nd ed.), she specifically mentioned Magnetar Capital's "Constellation CDOs" in the chapter on "The Credit Crunch and CDOs". She described the deals as "classic long equity, short mezzanine", a type of deal whose moral hazards she explored elsewhere in the book.[27] In addition, she wrote

"Constellation CDOs seemed designed to fail and were largely synthetic"[28]

In her diagram of the capital structure, she noted that the Monoline insurers were major investors. Elsewhere in the book she predicted the Monolines would have huge losses related to CDOs and time proved her correct [29] She also noted that "Excess interest is sometimes paid to the equity investor, creating a conflict of interest", a theme that would be central to subsequent media stories.[28]
ProPublica / NPR / This American Life report[edit]
In 2010 This American Life, of Chicago Public Radio, broadcast a radio show on Magnetar Capital's CDO strategy. The report was by Alex Blumberg, of the NPR Planet Money project. The report consisted largely of Blumberg's interviews with Jesse Eisinger and Jake Bernstein, of ProPublica, whom Blumberg had commissioned to research possible financial misdeeds related to the subprime housing bubble. Eisinger and Bernstein interviewed dozens of people who had worked in the industry and many who were directly involved in Magnetar Capital deals.[30] Eisinger and Bernstein won the Pulitzer Prize of 2011 for their series on the CDO industry. It was the first Pulitzer for work published only on the web.
ProPublica's written story came out on their website in April 2010, coinciding with the radio show. It alleged that the company's trades in the CDO market helped worsen the financial crisis of 2007–2010 by helping to structure CDOs it was planning to short (bet against).[30]
The story essentially claimed that Magnetar Capital "sponsored" mortgage-backed collateralized debt obligations by agreeing to buy the worst tranche (portion) of the CDO, the "equity tranche". Since very few wanted to invest in the risky Equity Tranche, those few that did were called "sponsors"; without them the CDO would never get created. The ProPublica stories claimed that Magnetar Capital then shorted (bet against) the better tranches of those (and similar) CDOs by buying credit default swaps that insured them. When the middle tranches of the CDOs failed, Magnetar Capital made back many times its initial investment in the equity tranche by receiving the insurance payoff.[18][31]
The report also claimed that Magnetar Capital tried to influence the managers of the CDOs it was instrumental in creating, to buy certain risky bonds that would increase the risk of those CDOs failing. It also claims that Magnetar Capital CDOs "defaulted" at a significantly higher rate than similar CDOs. (This may reflect Magnetar Capital's superior performance in identifying which of the "high-quality" tranches were most overpriced.) They also claim that the CDO market would have "cooled off" in late 2005 if Magnetar Capital had not entered the market, and that this would have resulted in the financial crisis being less severe.[18][32][33]
Magnetar Capital's response[edit]
Magnetar Capital disputed the story. Many of its responses were explained in ProPublica's story and in a detailed letter Magnetar Capital sent to ProPublica, posted on ProPublica's website. Magnetar Capital said, among other things, that it was not betting, it was hedging, that most of its hedges were against non-Magnetar-Capital CDOs, and that it was not making CDOs that were "built to fail" on purpose. It also claimed that its strategy was not based on a downturn in the housing market (that is, it did not bet that mortgage-backed CDOs would default). It detailed many of its objections in a letter and list of responses to ProPublica, which are linked to on ProPublica's website.[34][35]
Magnetar Capital stated to investors that it never sought to bet on the decline of the subprime-mortgage market.[36] Rather, the firm states, it had no embedded view regarding the direction of housing prices, the rate of mortgage defaults, or the subprime mortgage market generally. Instead, Magnetar Capital claimed it sought to profit from arbitrage: its perception that the riskiest, high-yield tranches of CDOs were underpriced relative to the less-risky low-yield tranches. The firm expected to make a profit when either the overpriced securities declined or when the underpriced securities appreciated. With the collapse of the subprime market, Magnetar Capital lost money on the risky tranches but made a net profit because the overpriced tranches declined even further. Magnetar Capital rejected the idea that it had picked securities purposely so that they would fail.[2][18][31][34][35][37]
The theory[citation needed] is that Magnetar Capital was essentially betting that the likelihood of multiple defaults on the underlying loans was more likely than was reflected in the price of the higher tranches. The high prices of the "high-quality" tranches reflected the assumption that any defaults would be localized and unrelated, so that it was unlikely that much of the portfolio would default at once. Magnetar Capital was betting that, in all likelihood, if the equity tranch lost its value, the rest of the CDO would lose value as well, because many defaults were likely to happen together. This is what, in fact, happened.[citation needed]
Magnetar Capital also disparaged the reporters, stating that "the questions we received from you [the ProPublica reporters] last week, and the assertions reflected in those questions, reflect significant inaccuracies or misunderstandings regarding aspects of Magnetar Capital’s investment strategy".[35]
Later, Magnetar Capital wrote a letter to its investors, rebutting many of the claims in the ProPublica story. IE:

"we wanted to address the recent publicity regarding our Mortgage CDO investment strategy. At the center of these stories is a blatantly false and misleading story written by ProPublica, an online news outlet, regarding our Mortgage CDO investment strategy that was active from 2006 through 2007. Despite our best efforts to educate ProPublica’s reporters about the specifics of Magnetar Capital’s Mortgage CDO investment strategy as well as the general process and market circumstances regarding the structuring and issuance of CDOs, ProPublica simply got the story wrong."
[38]
Despite the claims that these trades lead to price distortions, it is generally acknowledged that arbitrage leads to price stability and convergence.
Counter Response[edit]
ProPublica's editor-in-chief, Paul Steiger, responded to Magnetar Capital's letter and wrote:

"Magnetar [Capital]’s letter doesn’t deny that it purchased collateralized debt obligation (CDO) equity, that it bet against many of those CDOs, or that it exercised influence over the construction of the portfolios. In particular, it doesn't deny and in one case admits that it pushed for higher returns and hence greater risk in the portfolios...In short, we see nothing in our story to correct."

ProPublica continued to publish articles on Magnetar Capital throughout 2010 and 2011.
Naked Capitalism / EConned[edit]
Yves Smith of the nakedcapitalism.com, along with other bloggers at that site, also worked on describing and analyzing Magnetar Capital's CDO program.
Smith also wrote a book, ECONned: How Unenlightened Self Interest Undermined Democracy and Corrupted Capitalism, in 2010 which contains a detailed description of Magnetar Capital's activities. It cites anonymous sources affiliated with institutions that did business with Magnetar Capital. Her research was gathered in October 2009 and the book came out in March 2010.[39][40] The book goes into detail surrounding the motives of the various parties and the numbers involved that made the deal profitable. It also describes the large size of Magnetar Capital's play in proportion to the subprime market as a whole. The book gives a larger context for the Magnetar Capital arbitrage, fitting into Smith's thesis of the modern science of economics being largely a failure.[41]
Smith and the nakedcapitalism.com bloggers continued to post articles regarding Magnetar Capital throughout 2010. They also produced a spreadsheet analyzing the Magnetar Capital CDOs, similar to the one found at ProPublica.[42][43]
Moe Tkacik, formerly of the Wall Street Journal, worked with individuals from nakedcapitalism.com on an article about the relationship (and large number of campaign donations) between Barack Obama's chief of staff Rahm Emanuel and Magnetar Capital CEO Alec Litowitz. Moe's article was "de-published" from DailyFinance, but Yves Smith published another version of the story on Huffington Post.[44]
Senate Report of 2011[edit]




Lippman describes Magnetar Capital's arbitrage as "buying equity and shorting the single names…a bit devious"






Lippman offers to explain how Magnetar Capital distorted the market


In April, 2011, the United States Senate released the Levin-Coburn report on "Wall Street and the Financial Crisis". Their report went in depth into the activities of Greg Lippman, the head global CDO trader of Deutsche Bank. He was a CDO expert and worked at the heart of the Synthetic CDO market during the credit bubble. He also is featured in the book The Big Short by Michael Lewis; it describes his attempts to sell "short positions" on the mortgage security market to hedge funds.
In the report transcript, Lippman describes Magnetar Capital's strategy of shorting one part of the CDO while buying the other; he also writes about what he thinks their view of the housing market is. When asked if they are "bearish on housing", he says that "yes…as they are buying equity and shorting the single names…a bit devious".
In another email, someone asks him how Magnetar Capital has distorted the market. In the report transcript, no explanation is provided; Lippman indicates only that he has an "easy, but lengthy answer".
Huber Heights, Ohio[edit]
In January 2013, the firm became the largest homeowner in Huber Heights, Ohio by buying almost 2,000 homes from the family of the town's original developer. It rents these homes as part of its investment strategy.[45]

The ProPublica stories claimed that Magnetar Capital then shorted (bet against) the better tranches of those (and similar) CDOs by buying credit default swaps that insured them. When the middle tranches of the CDOs failed, Magnetar Capital made back many times its initial investment in the equity tranche by receiving the insurance payoff.[18][31]
The report also claimed that Magnetar Capital tried to influence the managers of the CDOs it was instrumental in creating, to buy certain risky bonds that would increase the risk of those CDOs failing. It also claims that Magnetar Capital CDOs "defaulted" at a significantly higher rate than similar CDOs. (This may reflect Magnetar Capital's superior performance in identifying which of the "high-quality" tranches were most overpriced.) They also claim that the CDO market would have "cooled off" in late 2005 if Magnetar Capital had not entered the market, and that this would have resulted in the financial crisis being less severe.[18][32][33]
Magnetar Capital's response[edit]
Magnetar Capital disputed the story. Many of its responses were explained in ProPublica's story and in a detailed letter Magnetar Capital sent to ProPublica, posted on ProPublica's website. Magnetar Capital said, among other things, that it was not betting, it was hedging, that most of its hedges were against non-Magnetar-Capital CDOs, and that it was not making CDOs that were "built to fail" on purpose. It also claimed that its strategy was not based on a downturn in the housing market (that is, it did not bet that mortgage-backed CDOs would default). It detailed many of its objections in a letter and list of responses to ProPublica, which are linked to on ProPublica's website.[34][35]
Magnetar Capital stated to investors that it never sought to bet on the decline of the subprime-mortgage market.[36] Rather, the firm states, it had no embedded view regarding the direction of housing prices, the rate of mortgage defaults, or the subprime mortgage market generally. Instead, Magnetar Capital claimed it sought to profit from arbitrage: its perception that the riskiest, high-yield tranches of CDOs were underpriced relative to the less-risky low-yield tranches. The firm expected to make a profit when either the overpriced securities declined or when the underpriced securities appreciated. With the collapse of the subprime market, Magnetar Capital lost money on the risky tranches but made a net profit because the overpriced tranches declined even further. Magnetar Capital rejected the idea that it had picked securities purposely so that they would fail.[2][18][31][34][35][37]
The theory[citation needed] is that Magnetar Capital was essentially betting that the likelihood of multiple defaults on the underlying loans was more likely than was reflected in the price of the higher tranches. The high prices of the "high-quality" tranches reflected the assumption that any defaults would be localized and unrelated, so that it was unlikely that much of the portfolio would default at once. Magnetar Capital was betting that, in all likelihood, if the equity tranch lost its value, the rest of the CDO would lose value as well, because many defaults were likely to happen together. This is what, in fact, happened.[citation needed]
Magnetar Capital also disparaged the reporters, stating that "the questions we received from you [the ProPublica reporters] last week, and the assertions reflected in those questions, reflect significant inaccuracies or misunderstandings regarding aspects of Magnetar Capital’s investment strategy".[35]
Later, Magnetar Capital wrote a letter to its investors, rebutting many of the claims in the ProPublica story. IE:

"we wanted to address the recent publicity regarding our Mortgage CDO investment strategy. At the center of these stories is a blatantly false and misleading story written by ProPublica, an online news outlet, regarding our Mortgage CDO investment strategy that was active from 2006 through 2007. Despite our best efforts to educate ProPublica’s reporters about the specifics of Magnetar Capital’s Mortgage CDO investment strategy as well as the general process and market circumstances regarding the structuring and issuance of CDOs, ProPublica simply got the story wrong."
[38]
Despite the claims that these trades lead to price distortions, it is generally acknowledged that arbitrage leads to price stability and convergence.
Counter Response[edit]
ProPublica's editor-in-chief, Paul Steiger, responded to Magnetar Capital's letter and wrote:

"Magnetar [Capital]’s letter doesn’t deny that it purchased collateralized debt obligation (CDO) equity, that it bet against many of those CDOs, or that it exercised influence over the construction of the portfolios. In particular, it doesn't deny and in one case admits that it pushed for higher returns and hence greater risk in the portfolios...In short, we see nothing in our story to correct."

ProPublica continued to publish articles on Magnetar Capital throughout 2010 and 2011.
Naked Capitalism / EConned[edit]
Yves Smith of the nakedcapitalism.com, along with other bloggers at that site, also worked on describing and analyzing Magnetar Capital's CDO program.
Smith also wrote a book, ECONned: How Unenlightened Self Interest Undermined Democracy and Corrupted Capitalism, in 2010 which contains a detailed description of Magnetar Capital's activities. It cites anonymous sources affiliated with institutions that did business with Magnetar Capital. Her research was gathered in October 2009 and the book came out in March 2010.[39][40] The book goes into detail surrounding the motives of the various parties and the numbers involved that made the deal profitable. It also describes the large size of Magnetar Capital's play in proportion to the subprime market as a whole. The book gives a larger context for the Magnetar Capital arbitrage, fitting into Smith's thesis of the modern science of economics being largely a failure.[41]
Smith and the nakedcapitalism.com bloggers continued to post articles regarding Magnetar Capital throughout 2010. They also produced a spreadsheet analyzing the Magnetar Capital CDOs, similar to the one found at ProPublica.[42][43]
Moe Tkacik, formerly of the Wall Street Journal, worked with individuals from nakedcapitalism.com on an article about the relationship (and large number of campaign donations) between Barack Obama's chief of staff Rahm Emanuel and Magnetar Capital CEO Alec Litowitz. Moe's article was "de-published" from DailyFinance, but Yves Smith published another version of the story on Huffington Post.[44]
Senate Report of 2011[edit]




Lippman describes Magnetar Capital's arbitrage as "buying equity and shorting the single names…a bit devious"






Lippman offers to explain how Magnetar Capital distorted the market


In April, 2011, the United States Senate released the Levin-Coburn report on "Wall Street and the Financial Crisis". Their report went in depth into the activities of Greg Lippman, the head global CDO trader of Deutsche Bank. He was a CDO expert and worked at the heart of the Synthetic CDO market during the credit bubble. He also is featured in the book The Big Short by Michael Lewis; it describes his attempts to sell "short positions" on the mortgage security market to hedge funds.
In the report transcript, Lippman describes Magnetar Capital's strategy of shorting one part of the CDO while buying the other; he also writes about what he thinks their view of the housing market is. When asked if they are "bearish on housing", he says that "yes…as they are buying equity and shorting the single names…a bit devious".
In another email, someone asks him how Magnetar Capital has distorted the market. In the report transcript, no explanation is provided; Lippman indicates only that he has an "easy, but lengthy answer".
Huber Heights, Ohio[edit]
In January 2013, the firm became the largest homeowner in Huber Heights, Ohio by buying almost 2,000 homes from the family of the town's original developer. It rents these homes as part of its investment strategy.[45]

History[edit]
Magnetar Capital was founded in 2005 by Alec Litowitz (formerly of Citadel LLC) and Ross Laser (formerly of Glennwood Capital Partners). It is based in Evanston, Illinois.[1]
In 2006, Magnetar Capital began to buy large amounts of equity tranches in CDO deals. Partner David Snyderman (also formerly of Citadel LLC) told Derivatives Week at the time that Magnetar Capital was "excited about the opportunities in the mortgage derivatives market".[1] From 2006-2007 Magnetar Capital sponsored (bought the equity tranche of) about $30 billion worth of CDOs.[2] Many of the CDOs were named after stars or constellations.
Around 2006, Magnetar Capital received marketing from Goldman Sachs regarding "short bets" against the housing market via an Asset-backed securities index (ABX).[3] That year, Andrew Sterge (formerly of Cooper Neff Group, BNP Paribas) brought his team from AJ Sterge Investments to work for Magnetar Capital.[4] Magnetar Capital also hired Michael Gross of Apollo Management[5] and started a reinsurance company called Pulsar Re.[4] Also in the same year, a team at Calyon bank participated in multiple deals involving Magnetar Capital CDOs. The team, led by Alexander Rekeda, left Calyon for the Mizuho bank in late 2006. In 2007, Mizuho did more CDO deals with Magnetar Capital.[6][7][8][9]
In 2007, Magnetar Capital participated in a series of CDO deals with GSC Partners and JP Morgan Chase. They would later become the center of an Securities and Exchange Commission case against JP Morgan.[10][11] In October of that year, Magnetar Capital set up a Credit Derivatives Product Company (CDPC) named Quadrant Structured Credit Products, with Lehman Brothers. Employees included Gene Park (formerly of AIG), Martin Nance, and others. Fitch Ratings rated it AAA in October 2007 and withdrew its rating in October 2008. In December 2008, Quadrant bought competitor Cournot. Moody's withdrew its rating in February 2009.[12][13][14][15][16][17]
As of 2010, 23 of the CDOs sponsored by Magnetar Capital had become "nearly worthless".[18][19]
The 2010 Ig Nobel Prize in Economics was awarded to executives and directors of Magnetar Capital, among others, "for creating and promoting new ways to invest money—ways that maximize financial gain and minimize financial risk for the world economy, or for a portion thereof."
In 2012 Intesa Sanpaolo sued Magnetar Capital (and others) for alleged fraud related to Pyxis ABS CDO 2006-1.[20]
The US Federal Securities and Exchange Commission had been investigating deals involving Magnetar Capital for years, for example the JP Morgan settlement regarding Squared CDO 2007-1. ProPublica published a summary of these activities in 2012. The Wall Street Journal reported that same year that the SEC was directly investigating Magnetar Capital itself.[21]
In 2015 Institutional Investor/Alpha magazine gave Magnetar an A grade and the #4 ranking among hedge funds worldwide.[22]
List of Magnetar Capital CDOs[edit]

In the press[edit]
Several journalists and writers have reported on the Magnetar Capital CDO program. Janet Tavakoli says that she covered the strategy itself in her book of 2003, before Magnetar Capital was founded.[26] In 2006 Derivatives Week did a story on the strategy. In 2008 the Wall Street Journal published "A Fund Behind Astronomical Losses" by Serena Ng and Carrick Mollenkamp.[2] In mid‑2010 two more indepth analyses appeared, one a joint effort between NPR and ProPublica, and another in the 2010 book ECONned by Yves Smith, in connection with her website nakedcapitalism.com
Tavakoli[edit]
Janet Tavakoli, a financial industry expert and consultant with many years experience, had been writing about structured finance in a series of books starting in 1998. In her 2008 book, "Structured Finance and Collateralized Debt Obligations" (2nd ed.), she specifically mentioned Magnetar Capital's "Constellation CDOs" in the chapter on "The Credit Crunch and CDOs". She described the deals as "classic long equity, short mezzanine", a type of deal whose moral hazards she explored elsewhere in the book.[27] In addition, she wrote

"Constellation CDOs seemed designed to fail and were largely synthetic"[28]

In her diagram of the capital structure, she noted that the Monoline insurers were major investors. Elsewhere in the book she predicted the Monolines would have huge losses related to CDOs and time proved her correct [29] She also noted that "Excess interest is sometimes paid to the equity investor, creating a conflict of interest", a theme that would be central to subsequent media stories.[28]
ProPublica / NPR / This American Life report[edit]
In 2010 This American Life, of Chicago Public Radio, broadcast a radio show on Magnetar Capital's CDO strategy. The report was by Alex Blumberg, of the NPR Planet Money project. The report consisted largely of Blumberg's interviews with Jesse Eisinger and Jake Bernstein, of ProPublica, whom Blumberg had commissioned to research possible financial misdeeds related to the subprime housing bubble. Eisinger and Bernstein interviewed dozens of people who had worked in the industry and many who were directly involved in Magnetar Capital deals.[30] Eisinger and Bernstein won the Pulitzer Prize of 2011 for their series on the CDO industry. It was the first Pulitzer for work published only on the web.
ProPublica's written story came out on their website in April 2010, coinciding with the radio show. It alleged that the company's trades in the CDO market helped worsen the financial crisis of 2007–2010 by helping to structure CDOs it was planning to short (bet against).[30]
The story essentially claimed that Magnetar Capital "sponsored" mortgage-backed collateralized debt obligations by agreeing to buy the worst tranche (portion) of the CDO, the "equity tranche". Since very few wanted to invest in the risky Equity Tranche, those few that did were called "sponsors"; without them the CDO would never get created. The ProPublica stories claimed that Magnetar Capital then shorted (bet against) the better tranches of those (and similar) CDOs by buying credit default swaps that insured them. When the middle tranches of the CDOs failed, Magnetar Capital made back many times its initial investment in the equity tranche by receiving the insurance payoff.[18][31]
The report also claimed that Magnetar Capital tried to influence the managers of the CDOs it was instrumental in creating, to buy certain risky bonds that would increase the risk of those CDOs failing. It also claims that Magnetar Capital CDOs "defaulted" at a significantly higher rate than similar CDOs. (This may reflect Magnetar Capital's superior performance in identifying which of the "high-quality" tranches were most overpriced.) They also claim that the CDO market would have "cooled off" in late 2005 if Magnetar Capital had not entered the market, and that this would have resulted in the financial crisis being less severe.[18][32][33]
Magnetar Capital's response[edit]
Magnetar Capital disputed the story. Many of its responses were explained in ProPublica's story and in a detailed letter Magnetar Capital sent to ProPublica, posted on ProPublica's website. Magnetar Capital said, among other things, that it was not betting, it was hedging, that most of its hedges were against non-Magnetar-Capital CDOs, and that it was not making CDOs that were "built to fail" on purpose. It also claimed that its strategy was not based on a downturn in the housing market (that is, it did not bet that mortgage-backed CDOs would default). It detailed many of its objections in a letter and list of responses to ProPublica, which are linked to on ProPublica's website.[34][35]

The Magnetar Trade: How One Hedge Fund Helped Keep the Bubble Going
The hedge fund Magnetar helped create mortgage-based securities, pushed for risky things to go inside them and then bet against the investments, resulting in billions in losses for investors and ultimately making the financial crisis worse. It’s a story of the perverse incentives and reckless behavior that characterized the last days of the boom.

Update June 21, 2011: JP Morgan Chase has agreed to pay a $154 million penalty to settle SEC charges that the bank misled investors about a complex mortgage-securities deal during the waning days of the housing boom. The SEC charged that JP Morgan neglected to tell investors that the hedge fund Magnetar helped create the deal and was betting against it. This story was the first to detail Magnetar's role.
Update Oct. 29, 2010: This story has been corrected in response to a recent letter from Magnetar. Read their letter, along with our response.

	 
In late 2005, the booming U.S. housing market seemed to be slowing. The Federal Reserve had begun raising interest rates. Subprime mortgage company shares were falling. Investors began to balk at buying complex mortgage securities. The housing bubble, which had propelled a historic growth in home prices, seemed poised to deflate. And if it had, the great financial crisis of 2008, which produced the Great Recession of 2008-09, might have come sooner and been less severe.
At just that moment, a few savvy financial engineers at a suburban Chicago hedge fund helped revive the Wall Street money machine, spawning billions of dollars of securities ultimately backed by home mortgages.

Get ProPublica's Top Stories and Major Investigations Delivered to Your Inbox
When the crash came, nearly all of these securities became worthless, a loss of an estimated $40 billion paid by investors, the investment banks who helped bring them into the world, and, eventually, American taxpayers.
Yet the hedge fund, named Magnetar for the super-magnetic field created by the last moments of a dying star, earned outsized returns in the year the financial crisis began.
How Magnetar pulled this off is one of the untold stories of the meltdown. Only a small group of Wall Street insiders was privy to what became known as the Magnetar Trade. Nearly all of those approached by ProPublica declined to talk on the record, fearing their careers would be hurt if they spoke publicly. But interviews with participants, e-mails, thousands of pages of documents and details about the securities that until now have not been publicly disclosed shed light on an arcane, secretive corner of Wall Street.
According to bankers and others involved, the Magnetar Trade worked this way: The hedge fund bought the riskiest portion of a kind of securities known as collateralized debt obligations -- CDOs. If housing prices kept rising, this would provide a solid return for many years. But that's not what hedge funds are after. They want outsized gains, the sooner the better, and Magnetar set itself up for a huge win: It placed bets that portions of its own deals would fail.
Along the way, it did something to enhance the chances of that happening, according to several people with direct knowledge of the deals. They say Magnetar pressed to include riskier assets in their CDOs that would make the investments more vulnerable to failure. The hedge fund acknowledges it bet against its own deals but says the majority of its short positions, as they are known on Wall Street, involved similar CDOs that it did not own. Magnetar says it never selected the assets that went into its CDOs.
Magnetar says it was "market neutral," meaning it would make money whether housing rose or fell. (Read their full statement.) Dozens of Wall Street professionals, including many who had direct dealings with Magnetar, are skeptical of that assertion. They understood the Magnetar Trade as a bet against the subprime mortgage securities market. Why else, they ask, would a hedge fund sponsor tens of billions of dollars of new CDOs at a time of rising uncertainty about housing?
Key details of the Magnetar Trade remain shrouded in secrecy and the fund declined to respond to most of our questions. Magnetar invested in 30 CDOs from the spring of 2006 to the summer of 2007, though it declined to name them. ProPublica has identified 26.
An independent analysis commissioned by ProPublica shows that these deals defaulted faster and at a higher rate compared to other similar CDOs. According to the analysis, 96 percent of the Magnetar deals were in default by the end of 2008, compared with 68 percent for comparable CDOs. The study was conducted by PF2 Securities Evaluations, a CDO valuation firm. (Magnetar says defaults don't necessarily indicate the quality of the underlying CDO assets.)
From what we've learned, there was nothing illegal in what Magnetar did; it was playing by the rules in place at the time. And the hedge fund didn't cause the housing bubble or the financial crisis. But the Magnetar Trade does illustrate the perverse incentives and reckless behavior that characterized the last days of the boom.
At least nine banks helped Magnetar hatch deals. Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and UBS all did multiple deals with Magnetar. JPMorgan Chase, often lauded for having avoided the worst of the CDO craze, actually ended up doing one of the riskiest deals with Magnetar, in May 2007, nearly a year after housing prices started to decline. According to marketing material and prospectuses, the banks didn't disclose to CDO investors the role Magnetar played.
Many of the bankers who worked on these deals personally benefited, earning millions in annual bonuses. The banks booked profits at the outset. But those gains were fleeting. As it turned out, the banks that assembled and marketed the Magnetar CDOs had trouble selling them. And when the crash came, they were among the biggest losers.
Some bankers involved in the Magnetar Trade now regret what they did. We showed one of the many people fired as a result of the CDO collapse a list of unusually risky mortgage bonds included in a Magnetar deal he had worked on. The deal was a disaster. He shook his head at being reminded of the details and said: "After looking at this, I deserved to lose my job."
Magnetar wasn't the only market player to come up with clever ways to bet against housing. Many articles and books, including a bestseller by Michael Lewis, have recounted how a few investors saw trouble coming and bet big. Such short bets can be helpful; they can serve as a counterweight to manias and keep bubbles from expanding.
Magnetar's approach had the opposite effect -- by helping create investments it also bet against, the hedge fund was actually fueling the market. Magnetar wasn't alone in that: A few other hedge funds also created CDOs they bet against. And, as the New York Times has reported, Goldman Sachs did too. But Magnetar industrialized the process, creating more and bigger CDOs.
Several journalists have alluded to the Magnetar Trade in recent years, but until now none has assembled a full narrative. Yves Smith, a prominent financial blogger who has reported on aspects of the Magnetar Trade, writes in her new book, "Econned," that "Magnetar went into the business of creating subprime CDOs on an unheard of scale. If the world had been spared their cunning, the insanity of 2006-2007 would have been less extreme and the unwinding milder."

My 2003 book, “Collateralized Debt Obligations & Structured Finance,” includes the “Magnetar” structure as applied to corporate CDOs.  I don’t know the first person to use that structure, but contrary to many finance articles and recent books, the “Magnetar” structure itself wasn’t new when it was applied to mortgage loans and other asset backed securities.  For example, it wasn’t developed by any of the people in Greg Zuckerman’s book, The Greatest Trade Ever.  Furthermore, there are a large variety of structured products and a huge network of players.  Magnetar was a cog in the wheel, but the story is much bigger then just this one hedge fund.
One of the key people at Magnetar, David Snyderman, was in the structured products group at Citadel in August 2004.  At that time, the group asked me to meet with them and asked if I would help them with this structure for the ABS market after reading about it in my CDO book (Wiley, 2003, Chapter 6 (especially Pp. 184-194, and this information is also in the 2008 updated edition).  They said my book gave them the idea to apply the structure to the other loan markets.  As I recall, Snyderman did not attend his group’s meeting on that day.  
My CDO book was written as a caution to investors not a handbook for guys like this.  I declined to get involved.  In my opinion, the investment banks that got involved in these structures should have declined to do so, too.  To the best of my knowledge, Citadel got rid of the entire group and they scattered to various shops.

The SEC should have shut down this kind of activity, but the SEC dropped seminal investigations into CDOs and failed to act on information in the public domain.  
The Magnetar strategy story was already told by the Wall Street Journal, before Bear Stearns imploded (March 2008), and before Fannie, Freddie, Lehman, AIG, and TARP.  This was before the meltdown, when it mattered most, but regulators and most of main stream media ignored the significance of these issues.
The following is a link to a December 2007 Wall Street Journal story explaining the creation and implosion of a CDO called “Norma” with which Magnetar was involved.  It was written by Serena Ng and Carrick Mollenkamp.  http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119871820846351717.html 
The following is an excerpt of story the same reporters did for WSJ on Magnetar’s strategy on January 14, 2008 (link at bottom).  (I am also quoted in this article.)  The WSJ has to work within space limitations, but it got the word out on many of the key issues, and it did a good job. 
There is obviously a lot more to this. I wrote about many of the structures and players in STRUCTURED FINANCE (Wiley, 2008) and in my book on the financial crisis and how to fix it, DEAR MR. BUFFETT (Wiley, 2009). 
A Fund Behind Astronomical Losses
By SERENA NG and CARRICK MOLLENKAMP
January 14, 2008
The trading strategy of a little-known hedge fund run by an astronomy buff contributed to billions in losses on Wall Street, even as the fund itself profited from the subprime-mortgage crisis.
 Its trading highlights the important role some hedge funds played in the great debt unwind that is now plaguing financial markets. Many hedge funds realized early on “that the loans and securities that went into CDOs were extremely toxic, and they designed structures to exploit that,” says Janet Tavakoli, a structured-finance consultant.

I wrote a further comment on the Huffington Post On Paril 29, 2010 (link below).
ProPublica’s “Untold” Magnetar Story Creates Excuses for Wall Street and Washington
ProPublica, Planet Money, and radio show This American Life recently carried stories about Magnetar, a hedge fund that profited from the housing crisis.  Unfortunately, many thought it was a fresh revelation.  Magnetar wasn’t a previously unknown hedge fund.  Magnetar did not create the synthetic CDO structure, and the magnitude of Magnetar’s role in the subprime crisis has been overblown.

The Story So Far

As the housing market started to fade, bankers and hedge funds scrambled for ways to maintain the lavish bonuses and profits they had become so accustomed to, repackaging mortgages in complex securities called collateralized debt obligations. The booming CDO market masked how weak the housing market was, and exacerbated its collapse.

This Old School Hedge Fund Is Going Quant Rob Copeland


Rob CopelandEVANSTON, ILL.—Alec Litowitz, founder of one of the country’s largest hedge funds, raised a simple question at the firm’s investment committee meeting: How often do mergers fall apart?
No one had the answer, so the Magnetar Capital LLC founder assigned a team of analysts to pore through three decades of data to find out. They calculated that while 7% of announced transactions eventually collapse, the market behaves as if nearly twice as many do.
Mr. Litowitz reasoned a computer program could make money exploiting that discovery and thousands of others. So he posed a second question: “What if we could take what was in our head and our database and make rules out of it?”
So began six years ago a billion-dollar quantitative effort at Magnetar designed to help the $13.5 billion firm buck a hedge-fund massacre waylaying its peers and set to rest memories of controversial trading by the firm on subprime housing during the financial crisis.
Like high-end restaurants, hedge funds often roll out new menus to entice investors to keep coming back, and quantitative trading is the latest special du jour. In the wake of years of disappointing investment performance and client defections, hedge funds are emphasizing a systematized, algorithmic approach to investing. That is a change from the hand-over-your-money-and-just-trust-us pitches of an earlier era.
Magnetar’s quantitative push is different from many of its high-speed quant competitors, who parse reams of data in the hunt for an edge—even one they can’t explain. Magnetar is taking a more manual approach. Discoveries such as the types of corporate acquirers are more likely to see through to the end of a tough deal, are translated into computer algorithms

algorithm
Set of rules that can parse data and automatically decide what to buy and sell.
that trade automatically.“We start with intuitions and then go see if the data backs it up,” says Mr. Litowitz. “Most people reverse it. They go looking for data and then go find a signal that explains it.”
The shift is particularly remarkable because Magnetar and Mr. Litowitz for years represented the prototypical headstrong hedge fund, investors and industry executives say. An adrenaline junkie who competes in triathlons and off-road mountain bike races, 50-year-old Mr. Litowitz was one of Kenneth Griffin’s first hires at hedge-fund giant Citadel LLC. He racked up such profits that Mr. Griffin awarded him part-ownership of the firm.
Mr. Litowitz left to start Magnetar in 2005. The firm launched with $1.8 billion in capital, marking one of the largest hedge-fund launches of the time. The firm commanded high fees even by the standards of the era, passing on many of its costs directly to investors.

Magnetar Capital, BlackRock Bet on the Quants



Since inception, Magnetar’s flagship fund has reported only two down years, with an average annualized return of roughly 5%, after fees.
Similar to many hedge funds, however, investors have pulled more from Magnetar than they have put in of late. The firm still manages nearly as much assets as it ever has thanks to positive investment performance including 8% gains in each of the past two years for its newest quantitative vehicle, investor documents show.
The firm was investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission after the crisis for its role in creating mortgage securities that suffered billions of dollars in losses in the housing swoon. The firm consistently denied wrongdoing, and the probe was closed with no charges brought.

Mr. Litowitz, whose parents were psychoanalysts, now describes the public flogging the firm received as “not my favorite period, but probably partly our responsibility a little bit, having not done the greatest job of articulating what we did.”
Independent of the investigation, Magnetar executives had concluded some of their old trades, such as spotting discrepancies in complicated financial instruments like convertible bonds, had grown tired. Thus began a shift into new areas such as quantitative trading and investments in big money transactions like Hollywood movies and commercial jets.
“What worked in the past will not necessarily work in the future,” Mr. Litowitz says. “The traditional hedge-fund world has to come to grips” with a new reality, he said.
Magnetar is pouring tens of millions of dollars annually into researching new techniques for investing. One-fifth of the firm’s 260-person staff now works in technology. A stand-alone Minneapolis office houses quantitative researchers who produce sometimes counterintuitive advice. In one example, they advised the firm’s investment staff to largely ignore traditional metrics in stock picking like executives’ ownership of their own company’s stock because such statistics are weak predictors of company short-term performance.

“Everybody in this industry is suddenly saying: ‘Couldn’t a robot do that?’” said Sean McGould, president of Lighthouse Investment Partners, which puts client money with Magnetar.
In fixed income, which includes half the firm’s assets, Magnetar executives say only 15% of the firm’s investments now constitute old school hedge-fund bets like deciding one-by-one when to zip in and out of securities. The firm cast a wide net for the next big wins, in one instance scoring handsomely on Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba before its public debut, and in another investing in thousands of commercial trucks and single-family homes.
“We would have never thought we’d ever be in these businesses before,” says Dave Snyderman, Magnetar’s global head of fixed income.

Magnetar also began telling investors it would waive some fees tied to performance unless it could beat a market benchmark. Such an attitude was long anathema in the hedge-fund world, where a flat charge of 2% of assets under management and 20% cut of all profits has been the industry standard.
“It’s rare, because most people are creatures of habit,” says J. Tomilson Hill, vice chairman of the Blackstone Group LP, which bought a minority stake in Magnetar in 2015, confident it could outlast a global hedge-fund malaise. “If you’re not constantly innovating…you run the risk of going obsolete.”
In one previously unreported move, Magnetar recently parted ways with its head trader—a top role at most hedge funds—to instead move to a committee-based approach where no single individual holds the power, people close to the firm say
