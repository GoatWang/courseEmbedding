SOUTHERN PINES and GREENSBORO, N.C., June 22, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- First Bancorp (Nasdaq:    FBNC) the parent company of First Bank, announced today the signing of a definitive merger agreement under which First Bancorp will acquire Carolina Bank Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq:    CLBH) the parent company of Carolina Bank, in a cash and stock transaction with a total current value of approximately $97.3 million, or $19.26 per share.   


The merger agreement has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of each company. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016 or first quarter of 2017 and is subject to customary conditions, including regulatory approval and approval by Carolina Bank Holdings shareholders. Subject to the terms of the merger agreement, Carolina Bank Holdings shareholders will receive either 1.002 shares of First Bancorp's common stock or $20.00 in cash for each share of Carolina Bank Holdings common stock, subject to the total consideration being 75% stock / 25% cash, which equates to a deal value of $19.26 per share based on First Bancorp's closing stock price on June 21, 2016 of $18.98. 
Carolina Bank currently operates eight banking locations in the Greensboro-High Point, Burlington and Winston-Salem, NC MSAs, along with three mortgage loan offices. Carolina Bank Holdings reported assets of $706 million, gross loans of $491 million and deposits of $601 million as of March 31, 2016.  The acquisition complements First Bancorp's recent branch exchange announcement and the hiring of a team of bankers in the Piedmont Triad area.
"Carolina Bank is an outstanding addition to our company as we continue our expansion into higher growth markets," said Richard Moore, Chief Executive Officer of First Bancorp, "We are excited to welcome Carolina Bank's customers, employees, and communities into the First Bancorp family, and look forward to continuing to develop upon the strong foundation Carolina Bank has built in the Piedmont Triad."
Upon completion of the acquisition, the combined company will have approximately $4.1 billion in assets, $3.0 billion in loans and $3.4 billion in deposits. This transaction represents a strategic and financially attractive combination for both companies' shareholders and will solidify First Bancorp's position as one of the top community banks in North Carolina.  
"We are pleased to have this opportunity to join with First Bancorp. The combination provides strong value for our shareholders, including the opportunity to benefit as First Bancorp shareholders going forward," said Robert Braswell, President & CEO of Carolina Bank Holdings. "The combination also provides valuable additional products and services for our customers, an expanded branch network, and new opportunities for our employees."
Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. served as financial advisor to First Bancorp and Nelson Mullins Riley & Scarborough provided legal counsel. Sandler O'Neill + Partners served as financial advisor to Carolina Bank, and Wyrick Robbins Yates & Ponton LLP served as legal counsel. 
INVESTOR PRESENTATION

On March 3, 2016, First Bank entered into an agreement with First Community Bank, Bluefield, Virginia, pursuant to which First Bank will exchange its seven branches in Virginia for six of First Community Bank's branches in North Carolina. Four of the branches to be acquired by First Bank are located in Winston-Salem, one in Mooresville and one in Huntersville.

        First Bancorp completes Carolina Bank purchase

First Bancorp has completed a two-prong expansion into the Triad by completing its $93 million deal for Carolina Bank Holdings Inc. on Friday.First Bancorp, based in Southern Pines, has increased its Winston-Salem and Triad presence significantly in the past year.It is likely to enter the Top 10 for North Carolina deposits with the acquisition of the Greensboro bank.First Bancorp has 19 branches in the Triad and 94 in North Carolina. It increases its total assets to $4.3 billion and deposits to $3.6 billion.“We’re an 80-year-old bank that’s the fifth largest based in North Carolina,” Richard Moore, First Bancorp’s chief executive and former state treasurer, said in July.“We’ve had a small presence in the southern Triad but knew our future would be tied to having a bigger presence in the parts of the state growing the fastest.“Our goal the past three years is to make that happen, and Winston-Salem will play a key role as part of the most natural expansion we can make right now, “ Moore said.Following the closing date, Carolina shareholders will be mailed an election form with instructions and a deadline for electing how they wish to be compensated in terms of cash and stock. The accepted offer was worth $19.26 a share, based on 75 percent stock and 25 percent cash.The bank said it expects to convert the Carolina branches in August.Carolina Bank, the bank subsidiary of Carolina Bank Holdings, will continue to operate as Carolina Bank until it is merged into First Bank.First Bancorp entered the Winston-Salem market in July when it completed the acquisition of four branches of First Community Bancshares Inc.,Upon completion of the purchase, Forsyth County would be First Bancorp’s largest branch market at eight when using that measuring stick.However, it is likely to close one branch between a former First Community branch and a Carolina Bank branch that are less than a mile apart off Stratford Road and Knollwood Street.Chris Marinac, managing principal with FIG Partners of Atlanta, said he viewed First Bancorp’s growth initiative and its Small Business Administration activities as positive for generating additional fee income, positive operating leverage and earnings per share.
“First Bancorp is executing on its new goal of entering higher growth markets and enhance longer-term return on assets,” Marinac said.Moore said First Bancorp has two main advantages over those super-community bank competitors, two of which — BNC Bancorp and Yadkin Financial Corp. — are in the process of being bought by regional banks.The first, Moore said, is its focus on traditional community bank lending to individuals, and small- to medium-sized businesses in the $1 million to $25 million sweet spot.The second is that unlike BNC, Capital and Yadkin, First Bancorp has no private-equity groups with a large ownership stake. The other banks sold such stakes as part of surviving the financial crisis of 2008-11 and rashes of defaulting residential mortgages and commercial real-estate loans.“We understand the Triad economy, the changes it’s going through,” Moore said.“We are absolutely confident there is a place for a bank like ours with the economies of scale we have because, traditionally, there always has been.”

Tellers normally start at just $10 per hour. Many Branch Managers make in the $35,000-40,000 range. Market Presidents only make in the $80,000 range so honestly there isn't a lot of money to be had. In addition, the bonuses inside the branch aren't even worth discussing. You are looking at $50-100 per month as potential earnings and the goals aren't realistic at all to achieve.- The company states You First - however, there isn't hardly any sign of actually putting the customer first. For example, the customer service hours are regular business hours. Many customers let us have it in the branch on Monday mornings due to an issue they had with our bank (we had a lot of problems with our online banking since it wasn't very good) on Monday mornings. They really don't live out the You First slogan well.- Many upper management are very poor leaders and short sighted. The new retail banking director was full of himself and too pompous to provide any coaching to (not a 360 degree person at all). His lack of leadership led to the retail banking leaders following his lead which led to a lot of problems to the branch teams below. Also, God forbid you make a mistake. The upper management will pile on you with full force as if they never made a mistake before. It's ridiculous, talk about walking on egg shells.- The bank was infested with gossip and back stabbing. A lot of it arose from the retail banking director and retail banking leaders. My team and I were actually lied to on two occasions and we verified from within. It was something that the upper management thought we actually didn't talk amongst one another inside the branches. The morale was low as a result and was and made it easy for me to look out and find another job to get out of this sinking ship.Advice to Management- Have you management teams treat others as they would want to be treated! Show respect, act humbly, have the heart of a servant and be kind! There was so much backstabbing, deceit and gossip around the bank at the time I left. I was so thankful to be able to leave the bank when another opportunity arrived.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (2) First South Bancorp (NC) Response seconds agoEdit • Delete First South Bancorp (NC) 2016-06-08 15:55 PDT Apr 17, 2015 Helpful (1)"Commercial loan officer"StarStarStarStarStarWork/Life BalanceCulture & ValuesCareer OpportunitiesComp & BenefitsSenior ManagementCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeCurrent Employee - Anonymous EmployeeDoesn't RecommendNegative OutlookNo opinion of CEOI have been working at First South Bancorp (NC) full-timeProsNot many.

Tellers normally start at just $10 per hour. Many Branch Managers make in the $35,000-40,000 range. Market Presidents only make in the $80,000 range so honestly there isn't a lot of money to be had. In addition, the bonuses inside the branch aren't even worth discussing. You are looking at $50-100 per month as potential earnings and the goals aren't realistic at all to achieve.- The company states You First - however, there isn't hardly any sign of actually putting the customer first. For example, the customer service hours are regular business hours. Many customers let us have it in the branch on Monday mornings due to an issue they had with our bank (we had a lot of problems with our online banking since it wasn't very good) on Monday mornings. They really don't live out the You First slogan well.- Many upper management are very poor leaders and short sighted. The new retail banking director was full of himself and too pompous to provide any coaching to (not a 360 degree person at all). His lack of leadership led to the retail banking leaders following his lead which led to a lot of problems to the branch teams below. Also, God forbid you make a mistake. The upper management will pile on you with full force as if they never made a mistake before. It's ridiculous, talk about walking on egg shells.- The bank was infested with gossip and back stabbing. A lot of it arose from the retail banking director and retail banking leaders. My team and I were actually lied to on two occasions and we verified from within. It was something that the upper management thought we actually didn't talk amongst one another inside the branches. The morale was low as a result and was and made it easy for me to look out and find another job to get out of this sinking ship.Advice to Management- Have you management teams treat others as they would want to be treated! Show respect, act humbly, have the heart of a servant and be kind! There was so much backstabbing, deceit and gossip around the bank at the time I left. I was so thankful to be able to leave the bank when another opportunity arrived.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (2) First South Bancorp (NC) Response seconds agoEdit • Delete First South Bancorp (NC) 2016-06-08 15:55 PDTReviews > First South Bancorp (NC) There are newer employer reviews for First South Bancorp (NC)See Most Recent There are newer employer reviews for First South Bancorp (NC)See Most RecentWork at First South Bancorp (NC)?

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, the lender will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow the lender to identify you. The lender may also ask to see your driver's license and other identifying documents.
*Disclaimer:24/7 Lending Group is not a lender and does not represent lenders as a loan broker or in any other capacity other than as a loan matching referral service, offering free rate quotes with no impact to your credit. 24/7 Lending Group does not run your credit and is not acting as a credit services agent for you. Lenders may perform a soft pull of your credit during the free rate quote process. Soft credit pulls have no impact to your credit scores or rating. You must select a rate quote and then finalize your loan directly with the lender with which you have selected. Any credit product for which you apply is solely the product of the lender. Most lenders will perform a hard credit check under the Fair Credit Reporting Act in order to evaluate your request promptly and adequately. Your permission will be asked for prior to any hard credit inquiry being performed. Final rates, terms and fees will be based on your individual credit history and underwritten by the lender NOT 24/7 Lending Group. 24/7 Lending Group cannot guarantee final terms, rates or repayments as they vary by lender. Providing your information on this Website does not guarantee approval for a product offering.  There is no charge to use 24/7 Lending Group service. 24/7 Lending Group may receive compensation from a lender in certain circumstances.
  Rate quotes provided to customers will be no greater than 35.99% APR (APRs include 0-5% origination fees), with terms from 12 to 72 months and available borrowing amounts of $1,000 to $35,000. Representative Personal Loan Example: For a $5,000 36-month loan at an interest rate of 6.03% with a 1.11% origination fee of $55.50, you will receive a loan amount of $4,944.50 and will make 36 monthly payments of about $152.18 at a 6.78% APR. Total loan cost would be $5,478.48.

				1. Please see your applicable Wells Fargo account agreement and card terms and conditions for information on liability for unauthorized transactions. 2. 10 or more purchases/payments with your Wells Fargo Debit Card each fee period required to avoid the $10 Everyday Checking account monthly service fee. - Included: Debit card purchases include PIN, signature, online and phone purchases that post during the fee period. Debit card payments include one-time and recurring payments of bills made with your debit card that post during the fee period. - Not Included: Any transaction at an ATM (Wells Fargo or non-Wells Fargo) and ACH (Automated Clearing House) transactions. Debit card purchases and debit card payments must post during the fee period to be counted toward the total of 10 or more. The dates of your fee period are located in the “Monthly service fee summary” section of your statement. Transactions received after the applicable cut-off time or on a non-business day (Saturday, Sunday and federal holidays) are posted on the next business day. 3. A qualifying direct deposit is a direct deposit of your salary, pension, Social Security, or other regular monthly income electronically deposited to this checking account by your employer or an outside agency. Transfers from one account to another, or deposits made at a banking location or ATM, do not qualify as a direct deposit. 4. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the bonus interest rate on all eligible savings accounts, and discounts or fee waivers on other products and services will discontinue and revert to the Bank's then- current applicable rate or fee.  For bonus interest rates on time accounts, this change will occur upon renewal. If the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program is terminated, the remaining unlinked Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking or Wells Fargo Prime Checking account will be converted to another checking product or closed. 5.  Subject to credit qualification. To qualify for a customer relationship discount, you may be required to maintain a qualifying Wells Fargo consumer checking account and make automatic payments from a Wells Fargo deposit account—if automatic payments are required but not selected, or are canceled for any reason at any time after account opening, the interest rate and the corresponding monthly payment may increase. To learn which accounts qualify for the discount, please consult a Wells Fargo banker. 6. The Portfolio by Wells Fargo program has a $30 monthly service fee, which can be avoided when you have one of the following Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances: $25,000 or more in qualifying linked bank deposits (checking, savings, time accounts (CDs), FDIC insured IRAs), OR $50,000 or more in qualifying linked bank, brokerage (available through our brokerage affiliate Wells Fargo Advisors®) and credit balances (including 10% of mortgage balances, certain mortgages not eligible). 7. Subject to applicable transfer or advance fees. 8. Benefits apply only to the primary Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking account within the Portfolio by Wells Fargo. 9. Surcharge fees imposed by non-Wells Fargo ATM owners or operators may apply. For the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program, Wells Fargo will waive its own ATM access fee (U.S. and international) when you withdraw cash from a non-Wells Fargo ATM from your primary checking account within the Portfolio by Wells Fargo program. Where Portfolio by Wells Fargo qualifying balances are $250,000 or more, you will be reimbursed for all surcharge fees on non-Wells Fargo ATM withdrawals located in the U.S., and receive reimbursement for up to 5 surcharge fees imposed by non-Wells Fargo ATM owners or operators per monthly fee period if you use a non-Wells Fargo ATM to make a cash withdrawal at an ATM located outside of the U.S. 10. No fee for Wells Fargo personal checks — except desk checks or home office style (3-on-a-page). Check discounts apply only to the primary Wells Fargo Portfolio Checking account.

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, the lender will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow the lender to identify you. The lender may also ask to see your driver's license and other identifying documents.
*Disclaimer:24/7 Lending Group is not a lender and does not represent lenders as a loan broker or in any other capacity other than as a loan matching referral service, offering free rate quotes with no impact to your credit. 24/7 Lending Group does not run your credit and is not acting as a credit services agent for you. Lenders may perform a soft pull of your credit during the free rate quote process. Soft credit pulls have no impact to your credit scores or rating. You must select a rate quote and then finalize your loan directly with the lender with which you have selected. Any credit product for which you apply is solely the product of the lender. Most lenders will perform a hard credit check under the Fair Credit Reporting Act in order to evaluate your request promptly and adequately. Your permission will be asked for prior to any hard credit inquiry being performed. Final rates, terms and fees will be based on your individual credit history and underwritten by the lender NOT 24/7 Lending Group. 24/7 Lending Group cannot guarantee final terms, rates or repayments as they vary by lender. Providing your information on this Website does not guarantee approval for a product offering.  There is no charge to use 24/7 Lending Group service. 24/7 Lending Group may receive compensation from a lender in certain circumstances.
  Rate quotes provided to customers will be no greater than 35.99% APR (APRs include 0-5% origination fees), with terms from 12 to 72 months and available borrowing amounts of $1,000 to $35,000. Representative Personal Loan Example: For a $5,000 36-month loan at an interest rate of 6.03% with a 1.11% origination fee of $55.50, you will receive a loan amount of $4,944.50 and will make 36 monthly payments of about $152.18 at a 6.78% APR. Total loan cost would be $5,478.48.

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT: To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person who opens an account. What this means for you: When you open an account, the lender will ask for your name, address, date of birth, and other information that will allow the lender to identify you. The lender may also ask to see your driver's license and other identifying documents.
*Disclaimer:24/7 Lending Group is not a lender and does not represent lenders as a loan broker or in any other capacity other than as a loan matching referral service, offering free rate quotes with no impact to your credit. 24/7 Lending Group does not run your credit and is not acting as a credit services agent for you. Lenders may perform a soft pull of your credit during the free rate quote process. Soft credit pulls have no impact to your credit scores or rating. You must select a rate quote and then finalize your loan directly with the lender with which you have selected. Any credit product for which you apply is solely the product of the lender. Most lenders will perform a hard credit check under the Fair Credit Reporting Act in order to evaluate your request promptly and adequately. Your permission will be asked for prior to any hard credit inquiry being performed. Final rates, terms and fees will be based on your individual credit history and underwritten by the lender NOT 24/7 Lending Group. 24/7 Lending Group cannot guarantee final terms, rates or repayments as they vary by lender. Providing your information on this Website does not guarantee approval for a product offering.  There is no charge to use 24/7 Lending Group service. 24/7 Lending Group may receive compensation from a lender in certain circumstances.
  Rate quotes provided to customers will be no greater than 35.99% APR (APRs include 0-5% origination fees), with terms from 12 to 72 months and available borrowing amounts of $1,000 to $35,000. Representative Personal Loan Example: For a $5,000 36-month loan at an interest rate of 6.03% with a 1.11% origination fee of $55.50, you will receive a loan amount of $4,944.50 and will make 36 monthly payments of about $152.18 at a 6.78% APR. Total loan cost would be $5,478.48.
