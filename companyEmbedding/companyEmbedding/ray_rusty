Rust Preventative Coating
Rust Preventative Coating, commonly known as Bel-Ray RP-30, is a rust preventive compound that offers unsurpassed protection against rust and corrosion. It is estimated that 2% of all the steel produced annually is lost due to rust.  The best method to guard against this costly and unwanted loss is the use of protective coatings. No better protective coating can be found than Rust Preventative Coating. This product will protect material from all kinds of contaminants and corrosion, fingerprints, heat, sunlight, bacteria, electricity, and, most importantly, water.
