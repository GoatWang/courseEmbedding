office at 4721 Ironton Street, Denver, Colorado 80239.

final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws
or finding any violation with respect to such laws. 
 


Item 3.
Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.

 
Pursuant to a convertible secured
promissory note dated November 8, 2016 (the “Second Convertible Note”), issued by the Issuer to the Reporting
Person, as the “Holder”, the Reporting Person acquired a convertible note in the original principal amount of
$11,000,000, initially convertible into approximately 6,010,929 shares of the Issuer’s Common Stock at a price per
share equal to $1.83. Under the terms of the Second Convertible Note, the Issuer promised to pay the Reporting Person the

therewith received shares of restricted stock of the Issuer. In December 2015, the Reporting Person entered into the First Convertible
Note (as defined below) to assist the Issuer with working capital needs. The Reporting Person subsequently was appointed Interim
President, Interim CEO and Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Issuer and, in connection with such service, acquired options of the Issuer as equity awards.  The Reporting Person acquired the Second Convertible
Note and shares of Common Stock reported as beneficially owned to assist the Issuer in paying amounts owed by the Issuer pursuant
to a Settlement Agreement entered into on November 7, 2016 in connection with a dispute arising out of a manufacturing agreement. 
The Reporting Person holds all shares reported as beneficially owned for investment purposes.
 
The Reporting Person is Interim President, Interim
CEO and Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Issuer.  In these capacities the Reporting Person takes, and will
continue to take, an active role in the Issuer’s management and strategic direction.  In addition, in connection with
his employment with the Issuer, the Reporting Person may be entitled to cash and other non-equity compensation in connection with
a sale of the Issuer or other transaction of the nature described below.
