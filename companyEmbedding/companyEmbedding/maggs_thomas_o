Capital One® Secured Mastercard®


                                            I never had played in credit before, and someone suggested this card to me to build credit for the first time.

                                            My husband called a customer service dealing with our balance. We've had this card for over 4 years and have only missed one payment.

AAA Insurance


                                            I submitted a claim for a burglary in April. The beginning of this joke is that the girl that answered the 800 number didn't know where claims were sent. She had me send my claim to the Walnut Creek, California office. When I contacted the adjuster IN OKLAHOMA CITY, he said...show more

                                            While the card offers nice perks, just like every other crappy card, there are hidden fees.

Wells Fargo


                                            I find it quite disturbing to see 24 one star, the lowest, ratings on the first page of Wallet Hub's most recent reviews of Wells Fargo. Somehow, in its overall summary, Wallet Hub still gives the impression Wells Fargo is a good banking option. What's going on here?
