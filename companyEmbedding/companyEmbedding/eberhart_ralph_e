General Ralph Edward "Ed" Eberhart (born December 6, 1946)[1] was commander, North American Aerospace Defense Command and United States Northern Command, Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado. He was in charge of NORAD on 9/11.

General Eberhart has commanded a flight, squadron, wing, numbered air force and two major commands, as well as one sub-unified command, two unified commands and one bi-national command. While commander of the 363rd Tactical Fighter Wing during Operation Desert Shield, the unit established the theater's initial air-to-ground combat capability from a forward operating location. General Eberhart's international awards include the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Sacred Treasure, presented while serving as the Commander of U.S. Forces, Japan, by the Emperor of Japan, as well as the French Legion of Honor. A command pilot, General Eberhart has logged more than 5,000 hours, primarily in fighter and trainer aircraft, including 300 combat missions as a forward air controller in Vietnam.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).

The Case Against Ralph Eberhart, NORAD’s 9/11 Commander

Posted on January 12, 2013 by Kevin Ryan  

In a 2004 U.S. Senate hearing, Senator Mark Dayton remarked that “this country and its citizens were completely undefended” for “109 minutes” on 9/11.[1]  Dayton went on to clarify that officials within the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) had covered up the facts about the lack of air defenses by lying to the 9/11 Commission, to Congress and to the American people. And they were not held accountable.
One man was most responsible for both the air defense failures and the lying that covered it up.  U.S. Air Force General Ralph Edward Eberhart had taken over command of NORAD from General Richard Myers in February 2000.  The position included leadership of all air defense operations in North America and, also, the U.S. Space Command.  Therefore, on 9/11, Eberhart was the man most responsible for failure to intercept the four hijacked aircraft over a period of nearly two hours.
NORAD is the joint U.S.-Canadian military organization responsible for monitoring and defending the airspace over North America.  Long-standing operating procedures at NORAD, for dealing with airliners that have gone off-course or been hijacked, were not followed on 9/11.  Each of the four flights involved in the 9/11 attacks should have been intercepted when they lost radio contact, deviated from their course, or turned off their transponders.[2]
The procedures for interception were automatic and required no special orders to implement. Through these procedures, interceptor jets had been scrambled 129 times in the year 2000 and 67 times in the year prior to June 2001.  A 1994 government report stated — “Overall, during the past four years, NORAD’s alert fighters took off to intercept aircraft (referred to as scrambled) 1,518 times, or an average of 15 times per site per year. Of these incidents, the number of suspected drug smuggling aircraft averaged … less than 7 percent of all of the alert sites’ total activity. The remaining activity generally involved visually inspecting unidentified aircraft and assisting aircraft in distress.”[3]
On 9/11, the NORAD interception system failed completely and we have been given multiple, conflicting explanations for why that happened.  Considering that there is strong evidence for an alternative hypothesis of insider involvement in 9/11, it is reasonable to assume that an intentional compromising of the U.S. air defenses might have occurred that day.  Adding to this suspicion is the fact that guilt tends to be reflected in false testimony.  And as Senator Dayton said, NORAD officials “lied to the American people, they lied to Congress and they lied to your 9/11 Commission.”[4]

Exactly which NORAD statements were lies and which were not is a matter that is still not clear to this day.  This is partly because the explanations and testimony that are now said to have been false were far more damning to NORAD than the final account, which exonerates NORAD entirely.  Why would NORAD leaders want to lie so as to make their performance look worse?
In order to better determine the facts, investigators should begin with at least three areas of inquiry: 1) the times at which NORAD was notified (or made aware) of the hijackings, 2) the times at which NORAD responded in the form of scrambling jets to intercept, and 3) the instructions given to the interceptor pilots in terms of speed and direction.
NORAD’s ever-changing story
The military’s explanations began with a short description of the response to the hijackings.  Two days after the attacks, General Richard Myers gave this account to the Senate Armed Services Committee, in an official hearing for his confirmation as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (CJCS).  He said that no fighter jets were scrambled to intercept any of the hijacked 9/11 flights until after the Pentagon was hit.[5]
Although Myers was not in command of NORAD on 9/11, he should have known two days later if normal procedures had been followed.  As Acting CJCS on 9/11, and as Vice Chairman otherwise, his role was to ensure the president and secretary of defense were informed of critical military matters.
A second story was given a week after the attacks, when NORAD provided a partial timeline of the notifications it had received from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the responses that followed.  General Eberhart reiterated this timeline in testimony to the U.S. Senate a few weeks later and for over two years it stood as the official account.[6]  This timeline said that NORAD had received notification about three of the hijacked planes with plenty of time left to ensure interception and had scrambled jets from multiple bases as the attacks proceeded.
The new timeline showed that NORAD was notified about the hijacking of Flight 175 at 8:43 am, a full twenty minutes before it impacted the south tower of the World Trade Center (WTC).  Moreover, F-15 interceptor jets from Otis Air Force Base (AFB) were said to be airborne by 8:52, having been scrambled in response to the first hijacking.  This allowed twice the time needed for the jets to reach New York City before Flight 175 crashed.
Eberhart added that NORAD was notified about the hijacked Flight 77 coming into Washington at 9:24 am, fourteen minutes before it impacted the Pentagon.  He told the Senate Armed Services Committee (repeatedly) that this was a “documented notification.”[7]  If true, interceptor jets from Andrews AFB, only ten miles from the Pentagon, could have easily reached the errant airliner given this lead time.
Although the military might now use the excuse that Andrews was not technically under the command of NORAD, the 9/11 Commissions says Eberhart’s statement was simply not true.  In fact, both Commission counsel Dan Marcus and Team leader John Farmer were later very blunt about this being a false statement.[8]  Therefore, it is clear that Eberhart should be brought up on a charge of contempt of Congress.  It is illegal to make any materially false statement or representation in testimony to the Unites States Congress.[9]  And that was not the only false statement that Eberhart apparently made to the senators.
In May 2003, Eberhart’s subordinates General Arnold and Colonel William Alan Scott presented a slightly revised version of NORAD’s timeline.  They contradicted the timeline for Flight 175, saying that NORAD was not notified of the hijacking until 9:05, three minutes after the aircraft crashed into the south tower.  This was despite the fact that when asked by a U.S. Senator about “the second hijacked plane somewhere up there” (Flight 175), Eberhart had previously said “Yes, sir. During that time, we were notified.”[10]
Arnold and Scott also revealed for the first time that NORAD was notified about the hijacking of Flight 93 at 9:16 am.  This was 47 minutes before that flight allegedly crashed in Pennsylvania, at 10:03 am.  Obviously, interceptor jets could have easily reached and escorted Flight 93 given this revised timeline.
The fourth and final story from NORAD was the official account given by the 9/11 Commission Report, now supported by NORAD.  In this explanation NORAD received “no advance notice” on any of the last three hijacked airliners.[11]  Instead of 20 minutes of notice on Flight 175, and 14 minutes notice on Flight 77, and 47 minutes notice on Flight 93, we were told that NORAD was not notified about any of them until it was too late.  The military was off the hook entirely.
All the evidence for notifications and response, which had constituted the official account for nearly three years, had been thrown out the window.  In place of these documents and testimonies, new explanations were given for why the scrambled aircraft never reached the hijacked airliners. These included unbelievable claims of communication failures and misdirection of the scrambled jets, as well as the introduction of a never-before mentioned “Phantom 11” scenario.[12]

The 9/11 Commission Report account was supported two years later by an article in Vanity Fair. [13]  Allegedly, the author of the article was given privileged access to audio tapes that were not available to the public.  Although the newly revealed “NORAD tapes” ostensibly bolstered the Commission’s new timeline, credible explanations were never given for throwing out the years of testimony and evidence that supported entirely different timelines.
The changing stories given by NORAD led to placing more blame for the failed air defenses on the FAA.  After NORAD’s 2003 timeline was issued, however, the FAA publicly stated that NORAD had in fact been informed throughout all the developments that morning.  FAA official Laura Brown wrote a memo to the 9/11 Commission in which she stated that FAA shared “real-time information” with NORAD about “loss of communication with aircraft, loss of transponder signals, unauthorized changes in course, and other actions being taken by all the flights of interest, including Flight 77.”[14]
FAA leadership certainly did fail that morning and there are shocking questions to be answered in that regard.[15]  Not the least of these questions is why evidence that might have helped was destroyed by an FAA official after the attacks.[16]  But the multiple stories given by the military indicate that NORAD was at least as culpable as the FAA in the inexplicable lack of air defense. And the facts indicate that NORAD was in the loop earlier than its 2003 timeline suggested, meaning that there is no reasonable explanation for why NORAD-controlled jets did not intercept most, if not all, of the planes hijacked on 9/11.
When questioned by the 9/11 Commission, Eberhart confirmed that if NORAD had been in the loop as the FAA said it was, his people would have been able “to shoot down all three aircraft — all four aircraft.”[17]
Reasons to suspect Eberhart
Investigation of NORAD and its commander Eberhart is warranted, apart from the evidence for lying to Congress.  Additional reasons to focus on Eberhart include the following nine facts.

As Commander in Chief of the U.S. Space Command (CINCSPACE), Eberhart was responsible for setting Infocon levels.[18]  Infocon is an alert system that defends against attacks on communications networks within the Department of Defense (DOD).  Just 12 hours before the 9/11 attacks, an order was given to lower Infocon to its least protective level.[19]  Setting Infocon at a lower level made it easier for people to hack or compromise the DOD computer networks, including the air defense system.[20]

As both CINCSPACE and Commander in Chief of NORAD (CINCNORAD), Eberhart was in charge of many of the highly coincidental military exercises (i.e. war games) that were going on that morning.
Eberhart did nothing effective in response to the 9/11 hijackings, despite being present in the military’s teleconference as those hijackings were in progress. He did not order the scrambling of jets, he did not order an escort for Air Force One, and he did not provide leadership.
Eberhart also failed to implement military control over U.S. airspace until well after the attacks were over.  Although it was his prerogative to do so, Eberhart did not implement SCATANA, the process of assuming military control over the U.S. airspace, until two hours after the second plane hit the WTC and one hour after the last plane had been destroyed.  Eberhart later said that he had waited until it finally became “obvious” to him that a coordinated terrorist attack was underway.[21]  He told the 9/11 Commission that, although people were telling him to take control of the airspace earlier, he didn’t feel that the military could “provide traffic deconfliction like the FAA has.”[22]

In the middle of the 9/11 attacks, Eberhart decided to drive between Peterson Air Force Base and NORAD’s Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center (CMOC).  Normally this 12-mile drive takes 30 minutes but it took Eberhart between 45 minutes and an hour to make the drive that morning.  No reason was ever given (or requested) for why Eberhart did not fly directly to CMOC from Peterson, making use of the Cheyenne Mountain helicopter port.  Eberhart made conflicting statements about his reasons for making this trip, saying that he stayed for a while at Peterson because he “did not want to lose communication.”[23]  Nevertheless, Eberhart lost communication at the most important time by leaving at approximately 9:30 am (EST), when two of the hijacked planes were still flying wildly off-course.  His reason for doing this was that things had “quieted down.”[24]
While on his way to the CMOC he was in the U.S. military’s air threat call via cell phone.  In this call, at 9:49 am, Eberhart “directed all air sovereignty aircraft to battle stations, fully armed.”[25]  Although this might sound like decisive action, the command apparently grounded all interceptor jets that had not yet taken off due to the fact that “battle stations” is a grounded status.  Other military leaders later gave orders to actually scramble the jets.  And despite his involvement, Eberhart portrayed himself as being out of the loop entirely.  For example, he told the 9/11 Commission that he had “no knowledge of the circumstances that initiated the scramble” of fighter jets from Langley AFB and that he had just “recently” been made aware that it happened (in March 2004).[26]

Eberhart failed to explain the multiple changes in the account of 9/11 that were given by NORAD.  In fact, he seemed to tell his staff to change the NORAD timeline as much as was needed in order to prevent further questioning about the military’s performance.[27]

For whatever reasons, Eberhart also gave out false information about the NORAD response to others.  General Richard Myers, acting CJCS that morning, said that Eberhart told him there were “several hijack codes in the system.”  Yet none of the four planes had squawked the hijack code on 9/11 and therefore it is not clear how such codes could have been in the system.[28]

NORAD failed to cooperate with the 9/11 Commission.  Even as late as March 2004, the Commission was struggling to get basic documents about 9/11 performance from Eberhart’s organization.[29]  In some cases, such as with the after-action reports that follow all military actions, the Commission never received the NORAD documents.

Of all these concerns, it is the military exercises that NORAD was conducting on 9/11 that have drawn the most attention from concerned citizens.  When questioned about them, Eberhart claimed that the impact of the 9/11 exercises on NORAD’s response was that they “at most cost us 30 seconds.”[30]  That was clearly not the case.
NORAD’s coincidental exercises
After several government officials had made incorrect statements about the military’s preparation for hijackings and the use of planes as weapons, General Myers responded to a pointed question on the subject.  He reported that NORAD had practiced “five exercise hijack events,” between November 1999 and October 2000, all of which “included a suicide crash into a high value target.”[31]  Records since released show that NORAD practiced approximately 28 hijack exercise events in the 20 months leading up to 9/11.  At least six of these were focused on hijackings located entirely within the Unites States, which puts to rest the excuse that NORAD was only looking for threats coming from outside of U.S. borders.[32]

One of these exercises, Vigilant Guardian in October 2000, practiced interception of an airliner hijacked for a suicide attack against the 39-story United Nations building in New York City, just a few blocks from the WTC.[33]  Another air defense exercise, called Amalgam Virgo and practiced just three months before 9/11, was accompanied by a planning document that had a picture of Osama bin Laden on the cover.[34]
Many of the military exercises or war games that were occurring on the day of 9/11 were run under the control of CINCNORAD Eberhart.  In fact, Eberhart was in command of the war games that had the greatest impact on the nation’s air defenses.  Of course, he had help.
NORAD is divided into several large areas that cover the U.S. and Canada, one of which is the region of the continental U.S. called CONR, headed on 9/11 by General Larry Arnold.  Within CONR there are three sectors. The 9/11 attacks took place in the airspace monitored by CONR’s Northeast Air Defense Sector (NEADS). Personnel at NEADS were therefore primarily responsible for trying to coordinate the NORAD response to the hijackings.  CMOC was also an important facility in the response that should have been effective but was not.
At NEADS, Colonel Robert Marr was in charge.  Marr had been in the U.S. Air Force for over 20 years until 1994, at which time he spent a few months in Saudi Arabia as “director of combat operations.”[35]  He then left the military to work two years for a private company called Phoenix Air.  Coincidentally, Phoenix Air provided aircraft for the Amalgam Virgo exercises.[36]  There is also reason to believe that Phoenix Air is associated with Huffman Aviation where the alleged 9/11 hijackers had trained.[37]  After his stint at Phoenix Air, Marr returned to the military as the exercise coordinator at NEADS and, by 9/11, had risen to the position of commander of the facility.
There were several NORAD exercises planned for 9/11:  Vigilant Guardian and Vigilant Overview, both command post exercises (CPX), and Amalgam Virgo and Amalgam Warrior, which were field training (or FTX) exercises.  All four of these exercises were CJCS approved and sponsored by CINCNORAD Eberhart.[38]  Apollo Guardian was also running on 9/11.  This was an exercise conducted by the U.S. Space Command, meaning Eberhart was in control of that too.
FTX exercises are sometimes what are referred to as SPADEs, meaning “a track is taken out of radar coverage and then re-introduced as an unknown track.”[39]  This exercise feature is interesting given that Flight 77 was lost on radar for a period of time on 9/11 and then reappeared in a way that has not yet been explained.[40]
Amalgam Virgo 02 was a modification of Twin Star, a live-fly joint FAA/NORAD exercise conducted in 1995.  This was described by NORAD exercise design manager Ken Merchant and Major Paul Goddard, the Canadian who was NORAD exercise chief.[41]  According to Goddard, the Twin Star plan was to have interceptor jets scramble and escort a hijacked airliner.  During that exercise, “the fighters never got off on the appropriate heading, and it took them forever to catch up.”[42]
It is interesting to consider that Amalgam Virgo 02, which was said to be only in the planning stages, might actually have been in play on 9/11.  One reason to consider this is that, on 9/11, the fighters “never got off on the appropriate heading, and it took them forever to catch up.”  Another reason is that 9/11 Commissioner Richard Ben-Veniste showed considerable interest in Amalgam Virgo 02, as did the 9/11 Commission staff in its request for documents.[43]  According to Ben-Veniste, this was a case in which “NORAD had already in the works plans to simulate in an exercise a simultaneous hijacking of two planes in the United States.”[44]  The plan for Amalgam Virgo 02 was therefore similar to the 9/11 attacks, with multiple, simultaneous hijackings.
Another large-scale exercise being conducted on 9/11 was Global Guardian, a joint nuclear war simulation run by the U.S. Strategic Command (Stratcom) in conjunction with NORAD.  This was essentially a practice for Armageddon that involved live nuclear bombs and at least three airborne command and control airliners called E-4Bs.[45]  The E-4B that was seen circling the White House during the 9/11 attacks might have been part of this exercise.[46]
The 9/11 Commission did not mention most of these exercises in its report.  To the contrary, the report mentioned only Vigilant Guardian and then only one time in a deceptively stated footnote that said “On 9/11, NORAD was scheduled to conduct a military exercise, Vigilant Guardian, which postulated a bomber attack from the Soviet Union.”[47]  This statement is false in several ways, not the least of which is that NORAD was scheduled to conduct at least five exercises on 9/11.  And Vigilant Guardian was not simply an exercise involving one bomber from the former Soviet Union.
Vigilant Guardian (VG) had been in play for several days as of 9/11.  On September 9, it included a scenario in which terrorists hijacked an airliner and planned to attack New York City.  The exercise presented a number of other scenarios based around airliner hijackings and in one of these, the fictitious terrorists threatened to “Rain Terror from the Skies.”[48]

According to the VG planning documents, the 9/11 exercise was to be conducted “sim over live,” meaning the simulated hijackings were to be inserted into the live air control system.  This was repeated in the instructions – “Ensure all tracks of interest (sim or live) are input on the live chart.”[49]  Furthermore, the VG plan was that “All expansions will be Real World.”  Although frequently misunderstood, the term “Real World” does not refer to an actual hijacking, it refers to the use of real aircraft in live-fly exercises.[50]

Due to these confusing circumstances, NEADS staff confused the actual hijackings on 9/11 with the exercises.   As researcher Matthew Everett explained — “What is remarkable… is that at a time when it should have been obvious to them that the U.S. was in the middle of a major terrorist attack, these key personnel [at NEADS] were uncertain whether what was happening was real or simulated.”[51]  The confusion caused much more than a “30 second” problem as Eberhart suggested, because NEADS personnel thought the exercises were continuing well after the attacks.
On 9/11, VG was scheduled to include a simulated hijacking at 9:40 am, within an hour of when Flight 11 struck the WTC.  When they first learned that Flight 11 was hijacked, NEADS staff noted that the “exercise” appeared to be starting an hour early that morning.  The evidence indicates that everyone at NEADS, including Colonel Marr, thought the actual hijackings were exercises.  They even joked about it.[52]  That might have been due to the VG plan stating that the NEADS building where Colonel Marr and company were located was a planned “exercise play area” and everyone there, knowingly or not, was “subject to exercise play.”[53]

NEADS radar scopes were displaying simulated information at least until the time of the Pentagon attack.  The same problem was going on at CMOC, another exercise play area, with radar screens showing false tracks as late as 10:12 am.  In fact, personnel at CMOC called NEADs in an attempt to stop the exercise inputs.[54]  Because those inputs did not stop, it appeared that someone wanted the NEADS and CMOC radar scopes to continue showing false information until after the four planes had been destroyed.
Ken Merchant added that the National Military Command Center (NMCC), located at the Pentagon, regularly participated in NORAD exercises by interjecting emergency action messages (EAMs).[55]  On 9/11 the performance of the NMCC, which plays a critical role in establishing the military chain of command and communicating orders, was remarkably poor.  Officers there lacked any sense of urgency and were completely ineffective with regard to communications.[56]

The disruptive effect of the ongoing NORAD exercises that morning continued until after all the hijacked planes had crashed.  One military newspaper said VG continued until 30 minutes after attacks.[57]  Global Guardian was “formally terminated” at 10:44 am but certain actions taken after that time, including that CMOC blast doors were closed (a needless action in terms of hijacked airliners), suggested that the exercise continued.[58]

Investigating Eberhart
Investigation of Ralph Eberhart and his subordinates would almost certainly reveal more of what the public needs to know. Whether Eberhart or others were part of a conspiracy to attack the United States is not the only reason.  The main purpose would be to understand how such an inexplicable failure to follow the long-standing and most critical procedures of the U.S. defense system could be followed by a string of lies about that inexplicable failure.
Eberhart was among the liars and he was in charge of NORAD at the time.  Was he lying to make himself and his organization look bad, as the 9/11 Commission suggests?  Or is he lying now, along with the 9/11 Commission, in order to remove NORAD’s responsibility and eliminate questioning about 9/11?
A year after 9/11, Eberhart was rewarded for his performance by being placed in charge of the new NORTHCOM organization. He has more recently been praised and honored for his great work on 9/11.  Called a “9/11 hero” despite having been a disastrous failure on that day, he was honored by having the new NORTHCOM headquarters at Peterson AFB named after him.[59]

There is an intangible benefit to consider as well.  Like a number of people who should be investigated for 9/11, Eberhart was a veteran of the only war in which the United States was defeated.  He began his military career as a forward air controller stationed out of Pleiku Air Base in South Vietnam.
Coincidentally, Benedict Sliney, who was in charge of FAA operations on 9/11, was an air traffic controller stationed in Pleiku at about the same time.  Fighting in related operations was Michael Canavan, the FAA’s missing hijack coordinator on 9/11, who was in the 5th Special Forces Group (SFG).  Also in the 5th SFG were Brian Michael Jenkins, who as Deputy Chairman of Kroll designed the WTC security systems, and CJCS Hugh Shelton, who was yet another high-level leader missing on 9/11.  Shelton’s temporary replacement that morning, Richard Myers, was a combat pilot in Vietnam.
Along with Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney, who were high-level leaders in the Nixon administration at the time, all these men were undoubtedly devastated by the defeat in Vietnam.  Cheney and Rumsfeld experienced the only other significant defeat of their careers when President Ford lost the 1976 election a few years later.  Other people who played critical roles on 9/11 and also worked under the Ford Administration included L. Paul Bremer, Frank Carlucci, Rudy Giuliani, and DOD employees Richard Clarke, Paul Wolfowitz, and Richard Armitage.
The defeats in Vietnam and the 1976 presidential election made their mark on these men.  Years later, the attacks of 9/11 brought all of them a late chance for redemption and victory.  And it made them all heroes.
Eberhart benefited from the 9/11 attacks in more tangible ways as well.  He continued on as head of NORAD and NORTHCOM through 2004.  After that he went on to become the chairman for more than half a dozen stock or bond equity funds, and a board director for a similar number of companies profiting from increased military expenditures, oil and gas services, and “Homeland Security.”[60]
The bottom line is that NORAD officials working for Ralph Eberhart covered up the facts about the lack of air defense on 9/11 by lying to the American people and by failure to cooperate with the 9/11 investigations.  For those reasons alone, Eberhart’s performance that day and the related statements should be thoroughly investigated.  Considering the nine facts presented above about Eberhart’s activities on 9/11, and that Eberhart appears to have violated U.S. law by lying to Congress, that investigation should be performed with the utmost assertiveness including formal charges and the use of subpoenas.

Excellent compilation of facts and clarification.  In the military I served in you were accountable for performance. Failure to perform adequately meant no promotions, even demotions.  Eberhart clearly performed poorly on 9/11 so far as the American people were concerned.  Why then was he promoted and rewarded for his failures.  Or were they failures?

Exactly! He didn’t fail in his mission on September 11th, 2001. It was resounding success for him and his band of fucking traitors. We know most of the key players who attacked our country on 911 yet none of them have been brought to justice or have even been publically accused of taking part in the largest attack on American soil since Pearl Harbor.
Guess what? None of these men will ever be brought to justice. We’re witnessing the purposeful destruction of our country. The only hope we have is enough Americans wake up and force the criminals out of power. I’m not sure how many Americans it would take but I do recall reading that only 3% of the population took part in the revolutionary war. That makes me think it wouldn’t take more then five or ten percent of the American public to get the job done.

I already submitted this comment or reply but while others I subsequently submitted were posted, this one wasn’t. So, I modified it a little, thinking that maybe some URLs had a little too much specified in them.
Posted what’s below using my GMail address and WordPress.com login password on 27 April 2013, at 22:30, but am not sure if it was properly submitted for my GMail address might not be the one I have associated with my WP account.
Quote: “I consider Kevin Ryan to be the most important American journalist around.”
He isn’t a journalist and is also much more than that.  A place to start to get some background information about him is the About page of this website. I’ll also recommend doing web searches like the following one and the exact syntax will work whether you use Google, ixquick, startpage (by ixquick), or duckduckgo.
“kevin ryan” site:globalresearch.ca
ixquick and the others will change “site:” to “host:”, but this is done automatically, so a user can just write “site:” regardless of which of the search engines mentioned just above is used. And I recommend using more than one of them for I’ve sometimes found some returning little while others return useful links, and some can simply return more  relevant links.
In addition to GlobalResearch being a good website to search to find articles by and others referring to Kevin Ryan, tv.globalresearch.ca (GR’s video section), ae911truth.org, corbettreport.com (seems to be plenty of interviews), prisonplanet.com and infowars.com are very worth checking.  He also has an important and always relevant, voir important, 4-part article that has an introduction by Don Paul at 911review.com, which is one of Jim Hoffman’s three 9/11 analysis, … websites.
I’ll provide the link for Don Paul’s introduction page, for it’s worth reading and it has a complete index for the 4 parts by Kevin Ryan.
“Demolition Access To The WTC Towers”, 2010
911review.com/articles/ryan/demolition_access_DonPaul.html
A complmentary video for the 4-part article by Kevin and which I also find to be quite interesting is the following 15-minute one.  Actually, 15min is only for “part 1 of ?” and I’m not sure how many parts there are in all, but part 2 is linked in the following page.
“9/11 Explosive Connections (Part 1 of ?)”, uploaded by WarCrime911 in Sept. 2010

The following video is 15min and provides some update, fixing for the above multi-part video, all uploaded and by WarCrime911(aka AlienScientist), but I’m not sure what the updates or fixes exactly are since the above multi-part one is 30 minutes or longer while, again, the following is only 15min.

warisacrime.org/content/colorado-pbs-runs-911-film-sponsored-911-families-experts-reject-official-story-present-evid
It’s the first time that I’ve heard or read of what Kevin’s comments are about and you’ll be able to see that he’s more than a journalist.  A very important advantage that he has over them is that he’s of scientific background/expertise and it’s very useful regarding the attacks of 9/11.
There have been and are, today, some very good journalists; Gary Webb, Robert Parry, editor of ConsortiumNews.com, the editors of NarocNews.com, and others, f.e.  But while we can all, as individuals, realize in different respects that the official story about 9/11 from Washington is like a story of a paper bag supposedly being able to hold water for longer than a second or two, if that long, it’s very important to have the experts speak out and Kevin is one of them.

This website or blog is working in an awkward manner. My two posts, above, shouldn’t have appeared all-of-a-sudden.  The second one was only because the prior one wasn’t appearing. I finally became fed up with the automatic WordPress login not working for my reply to xxxanonxxx, so went to WP to do the login there and now my re-attempts at trying to get the reply posted finally worked, only it also shows two of the multiple attempts, rather than only showing one.
Peculiar is that I replied to other comments afterwards and those replies were immediately posted.  It’s only the reply to xxxanonxxx that was always being un-posted. Perhaps it has something to do with the inclusion of YouTube links, for that’s about the only difference that I think to see; or maybe that and/or the links having initially begun with the http and https prefixes, in the reply to xxxanonxxx.  It seems to be for either or both of these reasons that there was a posting problem. Submission seemed to work, for there were no error messages or warnings of any sort. Only, the reply wasn’t effectively posted.
If WP is the problem, then it should produce a message saying what the problem is, and WP seems to be what this blog depends on.
Peculiar, also, is that I’m presently logged in at WP and when I click the “Posting Comment…” button beneath this comment box and the fields for specifying email address and username, I nevertheless get another WP login prompt.

Excellent/fantastique article, and I’ll inform people about it when appropriate, topic-wise. I spend enough time on the topic of 9/11, so there’ll be occasions to inform people about this article often enough.  It’d be great to have this in video format and uploaded at YouTube. But we can always refer people to articles when posting comments there, so I’ll be doing this.
It’s very clear that Eberhart is guilty of very high crimes and very possibly treason; him and plenty of others.
And I guess that we can say that this article is very complementary with or for your 4-part article, “Demolition Access: …”, for which there’s a copy at 911review.com, which includes a decent or good introduction by Don Paul.  I’ve been recommending that article ever since reading it a few years ago, so now there’ll be this additional piece about Eberhart.
Just learned about your website this morning from the following index.

I think that one of the important things to think about here is the possibility that United Flight 93 was shot down by the Air Force and then subsequently covered up.  No, I’m not saying it was a conspiracy by Bush or an inside job.  
What I am saying is that to shoot down a commercial airliner, on its way to Washington DC would be very hard to explain to the American public.  A true first.  It’s important to look at the actions and timelines of General Montague Winfield, Donald Rumsfeld, General Richard Myers and General Eberhart – especially between the time of 9:30 and 10 AM.  
Also look at the NEADS timeline and taped conversations.  There are many areas where the conversations are not recorded or noted in the official transcript, especially between 9:40 and 10 AM.  
I’m sure that General Eberhart made plenty of mistakes for which he is covering up.  However, I also believe that there’s a plausible reason for why the NORAD timeline for United 93 was not initially released to the public, as it did with the other planes.
Just my thoughts.

Regarding the shoot-down of UA93, which actually happened, and this is why the plane crashed into a Pennsylvania rural field, I recommend searching 911review.com, 911research.wtc7.net and wtc7.net.  They’re all originally from or edited by Jim Hoffman, who I believe to continue to edit them, while it also seems that other people contribute, today. From what I’ve gathered over the past few months, 911review.com seems to be the one least updated, but I always refer to it anyway; along with the other two.
These are good websites and they might need a little updating here and there, but given all of the content provided, we can understand that it isn’t easy to perform all revisions in fast-as-lightning speed.  I’m not sure which has the most recent updates and additions, but it seems to be either WTC7.net or 911research.wtc7.net.
Search the three about UA 93 and you’ll learn that a sufficient number of local people witnessed the shoot-down plane, plus the fact that there were parts of the plane spread over an unusually large area, and a little more.

A little correction for my first comment:
About Eberhart, forget the “very possibly” part. He isn’t very possibly treasonous. He simply is. We clearly don’t need to have any doubt about this. It’s how I felt, what I thougt when adding “very possibly”, but that’s just “politically correct” nonsense and I should’t have added those words. The man clearly is treachorous.
If I’m now mistaken, then I’m open to “enlightenment”, but it’ll surely be very difficult for anyone to be able to convince me that he isn’t a traitor.  Regardless of his intentions, if he didn,t mean to be traitor, that is, for he was either way. There’s nothing new about this, but it’s not a fact that we should become comfortble with, either.

I just received a notice about Steve’s post seconds ago even if I posted since his comment; having posted on March 29th, while he posted on March 28th. Anyway. I find some of what he says a little comical.
Quote:  “I think that one of the important things to think about here is the possibility that United Flight 93 was shot down by the Air Force and then subsequently covered up. No, I’m not saying it was a conspiracy by Bush or an inside job”.
Of course not. A cover-up by Washington wouldn’t be an inside job. Israel made the US do this after having drugged Washington to the point that it had no clue of what was going on.
While I perceive the Israeli government as a real enemy of the USA, I nevertheless don’t believe the above-stated explanation. Of course the cover-up was an inside job, and of course UA 93 was shot down by the US military. How more inside do we want to get? And, no, keep Washington out of my bed, svp!
Steve added, quote:  “What I am saying is that to shoot down a commercial airliner, on its way to Washington DC would be very hard to explain to the American public”.
Ha ha ha ha. Steve is trying to be funny, but assuming he’s not, then all I can say is, No kidding.  But the least that could be done is to break the news only after people have had their meals, like a couple of hours after, to make sure that there’s time for full digestion of the food. Otherwise, Barf or “Vomiture” will become the new name of the USA.
I’ll recommend 911review.com, 911research.wtc7.net, historycommons.org, f.e. Visibility911.com apparently is a good resource, but I haven’t personally used it, only having paid a few very short visits over many years; but I learned about it from the recommended links at 911review or 911research.
Yet, I never came across information like Kevin Ryan provided with this article about treachorous General Eberhart. I’ve believed in “inside job” for many years, but this piece about Eberhart certainly rocked me.

I’m wondering which post you’re referring to.  If you mean Kevin Ryan’s article, then I’d say “article”, rather than post; for, while the article was posted, the same is also true of reader comments.  So, you could be referring to either and only you know for sure or with certainty.
It’s always better to be clear about what we mean when posting online, or in any communication, for that matter.
If you’re meaning Kevin’s article, then your comment would be fine as it is for a PM, but try to not forget that it’s a different matter when posting in comments sections that any visitor can read and others have already commented.  If yours was the first comment, then it would be okay, but there’re plenty of comments before yours.
I’m not a moderator of this website’s comments section, or any other part of the website, but given that it’s Kevin Ryan’s website and the important contribution that he’s been providing to 9/11 Truth, I think all users should contribute to making this website highly qualitative with the comments that’re added.  Part of being qualitative is being clear.  It helps to preclude questions that ideally would be unnecessary, for the information or answers are already in place or provided.
“Art of communication”:  An important part is being clear rather than ambiguous.
No offence intended.  Your comment just leaves me confused about what you’re referring to.

Former Intelligence officials have hypothesize’d that if 9/11 was a cover up, you would needs wtc security clearencr and norad officials “on the inside”. This for the controlled demo explosives to be put into towers as well as building 7 ,(which honestly fell in same way as twin towers) i.e at extremely close to free fall speed (into its own footprint) as well as to confuse and stall fighter jets from being in position. Its sobering to learn who had been given wtc security “big wig” status and to see and hear accounts of blasts going on inside towers and then buildings falling like a control’d demo. The cia by the way has stop’d several terrorist threats, but did u know they trained and financed alot of these radical islamists to the point of then setting them up and taking the credit for “stopping them”. You should also reasonably conclude that if 9/11 was lead by rogue forces within certain intelligence and military circles w a cpl careful placed govt officials (likely w some amount of compartmentalize) knowledge that the truth can NOT be known to the public bc the threat of upheaval and. Societal breakdown and riots would be destabalizing beyond current abilities to confidently contain.

WTC 7 wasn’t destroyed in the same way. Look carefully at videos of the destruction of towers 1 and 2, and then 7.  There’re serious differences. All 3 were evidently demolition jobs that certainly no outside organization could’ve carried out or been responsible for, but the destruction differed with no. 7.  7 fell right into its own footprint whereas the tops of 1 and 2, or certainly one of those two anyway, exploded outward with great force and there were less but nonetheless other outward explosions.  The first few seconds with 7 also was at very near perfect free-fall speed, but this wasn’t the case with 1 and 2. All 3 were demolition jobs, but there were marked differences that’re very observable when carefully watching the videos.  
Plenty that’ve been uploaded by ae911truth and David Chandler channels at YouTube. He did this as a member or certainly associate of AE911Truth and his channel used to be DavidChandler911 or something like that.
WTC security:
For “wtc security clearencr” you evidently mean WTC security management.  My guess is that some of them had to be somewhat included in the “inside loop” of information, but not everyone in these circles is told everything.  It’s on a “need to know” basis, only, and very strictly.
Some people refer to it, usually in other contexts, as compartementalization. A “hit man”, fe, doesn’t need to know more than he or she needs to know to carry out a hit. A security manager would just need to be told by superior authorities that he/she has to allow bla bla, whatever, to happen and that there’s nothing to worry about, higher-ups supposedly having good conscience and knowing what they’re doing. That’s if the security manager is someone who’s of good conscience. If they’re not, then they can be told a little more, though not everything.  Not everyone in a criminal organization, if any organization at all, is equally informed/knowledgeable.  Each participant learns what he/she has to know in order to be able to carry out the work that he/she is paid for; but, they don’t need to have greater knowledge in order for the leadership to be able to carry out all of its planning, etc.
Regarding WTC security, 911review.com or 911research.wtc7.net and I think it’s a piece by Jim Hoffman, presents an argument that I find interesting.  This is in a critique of Scott Forbes’ account, a guy who apparently is like almost entirely unknown, though not entirely. And his story apparently hasn’t been corroborated.  The following are some example articles.
“UNLIKELY: ‘The South Tower Was Powered Down Before the Attack'”, last modified on 28 Jan 2006
http://911review.com/errors/wtc/forbes.html
Excerpts:
* It makes no sense that the perpetrators would do something so obvious as powering down half of a tower so shortly before the attack. …
…
* Powering down for cabling upgrades is laughable as a cover story …. Cabling upgrades for data bandwidth do not require interrupting AC power at all. …
* Contrary to the e-mail’s assertion, security cameras are designed to use independent uninterruptible power supplies. …
End of excerpts
I still haven’t heard anyone speak about this supposed Forbes account in a way that can cause me to doubt that the above 911review.com page is wrong.  Everything isn’t “hunky-dory ok” about security at the WTC on and over the days, weeks, months preceding 9/11, but what Scott Forbes purportedly said is very questionable and I don’t know of anyone who’s actually spoken with him.  Something was wrongly done with security at the WTC, but what Forbes supposedly said and which apparently was communicated through others is very questionable.  As far as I know, he’s like a ghost and even less verifiable than that.
http://911research.wtc7.net/talks/911mysteries/powerdown.html
Sibel Edmonds said earlier this year that she only listens to two people about the 9/11 attacks, Scott Forbes and I believe the other is Jon Gold. While I think Gold has said some acceptable things, without agreeing with him 100%, though nevertheless enough; the Forbes account is very or else totally uncorroborated and would definitely need to be corroborated.  What Gold has said, from what little I read and heard anyway, raised some questions for me, but he wasn’t speaking as a witness.  Forbes’s account is treated like a witness or eye-witness one and this requires corroboration. There’re no others when there should normally be many people who witnessed the same thing. 
We only have people who support and refer to what he purportedly said, nothing more. Supposedly isn’t good enough. Real corroboration is essential if what he purportedly said is to be seriously believed.  But, I guess that Sibel Edmonds can be forgiven about this flaw in her choices.  After all, she certainly isn’t a technologist.
Some elementary questions :
*) How could Forbes, who was  supposedly working on the IT system for his employer on floor no. x in one of the two WTC towers hit by a plane, have known that power was totally cut off from the 50th floor to the top?  Did he leave his job or assignment to go inspect what the power situation was on upper and lower floors?  He was purportedly there to do emergency work for his employer, not the rest of the tower, which had somewhere around or a little over 100 floors.
*) How would he know that all doors normally locked by security were unlocked? How many did he check?  He was there for the weekend for emergency IT work for his employer, so why did he go around checking doors for all or many of the other floors when his employer occupied only 1 or 2 floors, or parts of them?
*) Who told him that power was disabled from floor 50 upward and that all normally secured doors were unlocked due to power-down?
*) Why has this supposed Scott Forbes not been proven to be a real person? As far as I know, this still hasn’t been done after nearly a decade.  Why hasn’t he come forward?
*) If he has come forward and proven his identity, that he worked at the WTC the weekend preceding 9/11, etc., then why is the “9/11 community” like totally silent about this?
Kevin Ryan wrote a 4-part article and 911review.com provides an apparently full copy, including an introduction by Don Paul, who I’ll let others look up.  All 5 parts are worth reading and it’s important information.  There’s also a video that presents some overview of what’s said in the 4-part piece.  I already included this in a prior comment, here, for this page, but will repeat it.
“Demolition Access To The WTC Towers”, by Kevin Ryan, 2010
911review.com/articles/ryan/demolition_access_DonPaul.html
A complmentary video for the 4-part article and which I also find to be quite interesting is the following 15-minute one. 
“9/11 Suspects – Explosive Connections (Updated Fixed and Revised)”, uploaded by WarCrime911 on 15 Oct 2011
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffs7PkOREEY
He has an older 2010 video on the same topic and that’s titled while saying, “Part 1 of ?”.  I found a second part, but no more.  The two parts provide about 30min for runtime and perhaps they’re important to listen to when listening the above one of only 15min.  The following link is for part 1.
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grybkFkmfYM
The same user has the following related video.
“Marvin Bush, Stratesec, and 9/11: The Straight Facts”, uploaded on 14 Dec 2012.  (11min)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPD9kAJT98o
These 3 videos are based on Kevin Ryan’s writings and they definitely inform readers and listeners to the fact that there were serious problems with security; but, none say what Forbes purportedly claimed.

For other readers, skip this comment unless having problems with subscribing to the RSS feed, for that’s all this post is about.
This ideally would be a Q&A placed in a different comments section, perhaps in the About page for this blog or website, but I have no way to move this there while leaving your post here and the first part of your comment is specifically about the …, like you said, “awesome article” of this page.
What problem is it you’re having with RSS, here?  I was able to easily subscribe using the “Entries RSS” link in the section of Meta links located on the right-hand-side of a Web page here.  If I click on it now, which I did after reading your question, and then also tried the “Comments RSS” link, then this immediately causes pop-up prompts for adding these as “Live Bookmark”. I didn’t know what LB was but said ok maybe a month ago and it worked.  Now I get the prompt, but I cancel them due to already being subscribed.
I’m using Firefox, which is always kept to the most recent official release.  If you’re also using Ffx and the current or a recent release, rather than one many years old (as some people seem to do), f.e., then you should be getting the pop-up prompt.
If clicking on the two RSS subscription links from this page, then I respectively get the two following URLs.
https://digwithin.net/feed
https://digwithin.net/comments/feed
Clicking on the same (what seem to be the same, anyway) links from the home page of this website, the url doesn’t change.  It remains http://digwithin.net for both RSS links.
I just performed these tests and if I check Properties for the feed or LB added around a month ago, then it’s https://digwithin.net/feed.  It’s correctly working.
If clicking on the RSS links don’t work for you, for getting the pop-up prompt to add a LB, then try again by copying, pasting and loading the feed URLs specified above in a separate tab, say.
If that also doesn’t work, then there perhaps is a problem that’s due to your Web browser.  In that case, try inquiring with user support for the browser.  Firefox or Mozilla browser users should check both mozilla.org as well as mozillazine.org.  MISIE users can simply do a Web search of microsoft.com, for this will include Technet and social sections.  Mozilla and MozillaZine need to be separately searched.  The ‘Zine one isn’t by Mozilla.  It’s by Mozilla product users and provides a forum as well as a knowledge base.

The idea that NORAD could have affected the events of 9/11 is largely spurious. There was nothing that could have ,or should have, been done to stop AA11 , and no plausible way the crash of UA175 could have  been stopped either. With AA77, given better co-ordination that might have been intercepted at least but even then positively identifying it and getting an order to do something about it would have been difficult. With UA 93 it would in all likelihood have been intercepted if it hadn’t been crashed. Since it is unlikely NORAD could have done little to prevent what happened, there would be no requirement to hamper them in preventing it.  Those trying to help did their best in the circumstances.

A.Wright evidently is very wrong and a clear example of this is wherein he/she wrote, quote:  “With UA 93 it would in all likelihood have been intercepted if it hadn’t been crashed”.
UA 93 was intercepted.  It was shot down.  See Jim Hoffman’s websites, 911research.wtc7.net and 911review.com.  All a person needs to do is to either work their way through the websites’ menus, or use, f.e., Google with the search terms of “flight 93” and “UA 93”; for separate searches.  “UA 93” returns only 1 link and it may or possibly may not be included in the links returned for “flight 93”, so I’d recommend both searches.  The main page is entitled “Flight 93” and I’ll briefly cite from it.
Quote:
Shoot-Down
According to the official story, Flight 93 crashed by flying into the ground near Somerset, Pennsylvania as a result of a struggle between passengers and the hijackers. However, eyewitness reports and widely scattered debris belie this account. …
End quote
Emphasis is to be placed on, “eyewitness reports and widely scattered debris belie” the official “story”.
A person who doesn’t speak other than the official “story” about UA 93 is surely not someone to consider believing about the other 9/11 attack flights, either; NOT today, not after all of these many years.

We can use the name to do some Web searches, but you should provide links to the sources you used.  Not necessarily everyone who’s published about Col. Marr with respect to 9/11 will say the same things.  Some may say the same thing but all while some of theyse may say little and others say more.
Good writers or speakers provide reference notes for the sources used.
Take the following article, f.e.
http://911review.com/articles/gaffney/MysteryPlane2.html
Quote:
The 9/11 Mystery Plane (Part II)
Mark H. Gaffney
Part 2 in a series, See Part I
May 7, 2007
…
Yet, incredibly, the 9/11 Commission Report barely mentions the issue.  It appears that instead of doing its job, i.e., digging for the truth, the commission meekly accepted the military’s various explanations, without a word of protest.  General McKinley, for example, ….  There was also the lame excuse about antiquated radar equipment.  …  According to Scoggins NEADS could see everything the FAA saw, and more. NEADS’ failure to locate Flight 11 on radar had the serious consequence of slowing down the military’s response, because Col. Robert Marr, NEADS commander, was reluctant to scramble his Otis fighters without a target. Was this the intended outcome?
…
End quote
Doing a Web search of 911research.wtc7.net turns up links, but it appears to be a copies of some 9/11 report.  Doing a Web search of 911blogger.com, however, turns up plenty more.
Nonetheless, you should provide source references.  Who wants to spend a day or two trying to find the material that you should be able to include specific references for?
Not me.

What a strange armed services committee and 911 commission ; none of them seem to be aware that the NORAD Tapes , show General NASYPANY in charge of planes chasing unseen targets .  NARA  HAS NO specific documents about Nasypany ( Nasty ) . Scoggins was the only one in contact with NEADS , especially the misinformation about Flight 11.
There is / are NO contacts between the FAA ( except for Flight 11 ) on the other 4 planes . NO one can see or hear any contacts between either agency . Cleveland Center focused on 93 , and 1989  all passengers disembarked and never seen again ?  
Is anyone familiar with a Del Favaro ? from Nashville ,? flying over the WTC on 911 ; saw the flames from the Tower . At the Airport where they landed ? they were not allowed to go into Manhattan . Never questioned : The same thing with Ryan Crocker , he landed coming from Jersey . When he landed  he and his assistant ? watched the towers come down . Crocker immediately said “, Implosion” Newsweek , 2009 . Nov. or Oct. interview .  Nary a word after that .
Del Favero ? s story was printed in a Nashville paper on 9-12- 2001 . 
The Government is burying Nasypany some where . After they made him a General . Leidig was made an Admiral ; Deborah Loewer , was with Bush at the “Little Goat “reading . She was in charge of Situation Room .She was made Admiral .

John Farmer was the only dissenting vote ( John Azzarello ) . They were told by Marcus and Zelikow , they could not go back and interview NEADS in NY .( Rome ) .

While commander of the 363rd Tactical Fighter Wing during Operation Desert Shield, the unit established the theater's initial air-to-ground combat capability from a forward operating location. General Eberhart's international awards include the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Sacred Treasure, presented while serving as the Commander of U.S. Forces, Japan, by the Emperor of Japan, as well as the French Legion of Honor. A command pilot, General Eberhart has logged more than 5,000 hours, primarily in fighter and trainer aircraft, including 300 combat missions as a forward air controller in Vietnam.

While commander of the 363rd Tactical Fighter Wing during Operation Desert Shield, the unit established the theater's initial air-to-ground combat capability from a forward operating location. General Eberhart's international awards include the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Sacred Treasure, presented while serving as the Commander of U.S. Forces, Japan, by the Emperor of Japan, as well as the French Legion of Honor. A command pilot, General Eberhart has logged more than 5,000 hours, primarily in fighter and trainer aircraft, including 300 combat missions as a forward air controller in Vietnam.

Accountability, Evidence and Research
Air Defense Failures


Originally published at Consensus 9/11 on 9/10/14
Introduction

NORAD is the US-Canadian military agency responsible for defending North American airspace. Its traditional operating procedures – according to which planes are to be intercepted when they deviate from their courses, turn off their transponders, or permanently lose radio contact – were not followed on 9/11.
As the commander-in-chief of NORAD on 9/11, General Ralph E. “Ed” Eberhart was ultimately responsible for all of NORAD’s failures on 9/11 – most importantly, the failure to intercept hijacked airliners before they could strike the Twin Towers and the Pentagon. The fourth airliner, UA 93, which was reportedly headed towards the nation’s capital, may have been shot down by NORAD, but NORAD has denied this. Accordingly, the official story about 9/11 is that NORAD was four-for-four in failing to intercept hijacked airliners that day.
Nevertheless, in spite of NORAD’s disastrous failures under General Eberhart’s leadership, he was never held accountable or even criticized. Indeed, he was promoted shortly after 9/11 and later called a “9/11 hero.”[1]

Unlike others, such as Gen. Richard Myers and Gen. Henry Shelton, Eberhart has not written an account of his actions on 9/11. Likewise, he was seldom discussed by the 9/11 Commission. Accordingly, we do not know much about his actions that day. But enough has been said and reported by officials and the media to add up to an official story about his actions.

The Official Account

“On the morning of 9/11 General Eberhart was in his office at headquarters—roughly 30 minutes away from Cheyenne Mountain, where the operations center is located.”[2]
“Eberhart received a call at 6:45 AM MDT (Mountain Daylight Time, or 8:45 AM EST [sic EDT] from CMOC’s [Cheyenne Mountain Operation Center’s] Command Director (CD) that informed him of the ongoing circumstance of a suspected hijacking on the East Coast. He was told that this was a non-exercise. He went to his office, and saw the CNN broadcast of the World Trade Center explosion.”[3]
It seemed to Eberhart that there was “great confusion in the system” at this time. (This was also stated by Canadian Lt. Gen. Rick Findley, the Battle Staff Director at Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center, who later told the 9/11 Commission that, following the second attack on the Twin Towers, there was “confusion as to how many, and which aircraft, were hijacked.”[4]) When Eberhart learned about the second WTC attack, it became obvious to him that “an ongoing and coordinated terrorist attack” was underway.[5]
Eberhart tried to contact Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Henry Shelton, but could not, because Shelton was on a plane to Europe to attend a NATO meeting.[6]
Eberhart then contacted the acting chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Richard Myers, who was on Capitol Hill meeting with Senator Max Cleland. Eberhart called Myers sometime between 9:03 and 9:30 AM, hence before the report of the Pentagon attack, which took place at approximately 9:37 AM.[7]
Eberhart updated Myers about the crisis, telling him that the Twin Towers had been hit, that NORAD would be launching fighter jets in response, and that he was working with the FAA to get all non-military planes in the United States grounded.[8]
According to Myers, Eberhart told him that there were “several hijack codes in the system,”[9] which meant, said Myers, “that the transponders in the aircraft [were] talking to the ground, and they’re saying . . . we’re being hijacked.”[10]
Eberhart next said that he was going to remain at Building 1 of Peterson Air Force Base – the headquarters of the US Air Force Space Command (of which Eberhartwas also the commander) – because “he did not want to lose communication.” However, he then decided to drive to NORAD’s Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center, leaving at “approximately 9:30” EDT (or 7:30 MDT), which would have been shortly after his conversation with Myers. As to why Eberhart took this trip during the crisis, he explained that things had “quieted down” and the Operations Center “had communications capabilities not available at Peterson.”[11]
Although, according to the 9/11 Commission, making the 12-mile drive normally takes “roughly 30 minutes,” it took Eberhart 45 minutes. As a Washington Post story reported later, the trip “can be time-consuming if traffic is bad.”[12] During this period, it was later reported, Eberhart “couldn’t receive telephone calls as senior officials weighed how to respond,”[13] or at least could not hold them: He “lost a cell phone call with Vice President Dick Cheney.”[14]
At 9:49 AM, Eberhart, during the Pentagon’s air threat conference call, ordered “all air sovereignty aircraft to battle stations, fully armed.”[15]
The 9/11 Commission asked Eberhart why he, after realizing that there was an organized attack against the country, did not implement the plan called SCATANA (Security Control of Air Traffic and Air Navigation), which would clear the sky of all non-military planes, so that the military would have complete control of the U.S. airspace. Eberhart explained that, with the radars it had, NORAD would not have been able to “control the airspace that day,” so if SCATANA had been implemented suddenly, even more problems would have developed. In response to those within NORAD who had advised him to implement it immediately, Eberhart said: “I will execute SCATANA once you have a modified SCATANA that . . . doesn’t cause a bad situation to become worse.” Two hours after the second plane hit the WTC, Eberhart was able to execute the modified SCATANA.[16]


The Best Evidence
An examination of the evidence shows that Eberhart, rather than being considered a “9/11 hero,” may well be the opposite. This evidence can be divided into two categories:
1. Eberhart made several contradictory and implausible statements
2. Eberhart also caused delays by virtue of his actions and omissions
1. Eberhart made several contradictory and implausible statements:
The official story about Eberhart contains the following elements, discussed in the order they appeared in the summary above:

Eberhart said that he first tried to contact Gen. Shelton, finding that he was on the way to Europe. However, given that Shelton’s trip had been planned for some time, the claim that Eberhart did not know when his immediate superior (the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff) would be absentis not credible.
Eberhart said that he called General Myers while the latter was on Capitol Hill – which, as shown in the 9/11 Consensus Point about Myers,[17] was false.
Although Eberhart reported that the hijacked airliners, having used the hijack code, were talking to the ground, the failure of all eight pilots to squawk the hijack code is one of the main problems with the official account.[18]
Although Eberhart justified driving to the Operations Center by saying that things had “quieted down,” two hijacked airliners were still in the air (which his statements about several hijack codes implies that he believed).
If he had a good reason to get to the Operations Center, he could have taken the quick helicopter trip (rather than wasting 45 minutes or longer driving the distance).[19]
Although Eberhart claimed that he was unable to communicate by cell phone during the trip, he at 9:49 AM (7:49 Mountain) reportedly ordered – during an air threat conference call – interceptor pilots to get to their battle stations.[20]
Although “battle stations” sounds like an effective action, it actually means that pilots wait in their jets with the engines off, so they were not ready to scramble immediately.[21]
Eberhart’s claim that he could not implement SCATANA immediately, without making a bad situation worse, is not credible, given that SCATANA was a procedure set up for emergencies, and the modified SCATANA would have surely been already worked out, especially given the fact that NORAD was doing exercises at the time, including a plane crashing into a Manhattan skyscraper. Also the NORAD officers who were urging Eberhart to order SCATANA evidently saw no problem with doing so.

Accordingly, the official account about Eberhart contains inaccuracies, extraordinary claims, and actions and omissions through which the interception of the hijacked airliners would have been delayed.
2. Eberhart caused delays through further actions and omissions
There were additional irregularities regarding Eberhart’s actions, omissions, and statements:

It is standard operating procedure for NORAD to intercept a flight if it has lost radio contact, turned off its transponder, and gone off course. This was true of all four 9/11 flights and yet NORAD, under Eberhart, did not intercept any of them.[22]
As to why NORAD failed to intercept, it gave out a timeline in 2001, claiming NORAD knew about the hijackings and tried to intercept the airliners but could never get there in time.[23] NORAD told this story from 2001 until 2004. But then, in The 9/11 Commission Report, it gave a completely different account, according to which (1) the FAA failed to alert NORAD about American 11 until it was too late for jets to reach it and (2) the FAA failed to tell NORAD about all three of the other flights until after they had crashed.[24]
Regarding American 77 (which reportedly hit the Pentagon), Eberhart and the 9/11 Commission said that “NEADS never received notice that American 77 was hijacked.”[25] But if that were true, why did Eberhart, about six weeks after the attacks, tell the U.S. Senate that NORAD had scrambled jets at 9:24 AM after being notified that hijacked American 77 was coming towards Washington, adding that this was a “documented notification”?[26] Did the 2004 timeline mean that Eberhart’s 2001 statement to the Senate was a lie? Or did it mean that the FAA was lying when it emphatically said that it had shared “real-time information” with NORAD and the Pentagon about “all the flights of interest, including Flight 77.”[27]
As to why the new story may have emerged: The 9/11 research community had shown that NORAD’s first timeline did not excuse NORAD, because there would have been time to intercept the airliners before the Twin Towers and the Pentagon were hit. In June 2004, while the 9/11 Commission Report was being prepared, Eberhart said that this view was correct – that if NEADS had been told about the flights when the FAA claimed, his people would have been able to shoot down “shoot down all three of them — all four aircraft.”[28]
When Eberhart was interviewed by the 9/11 Commission in March 2004, he said he had “no knowledge of the circumstance[sic] that initiated the scramble”[29] of fighter jets at 9:24 AM from Langley. Having learned that NEADS had scrambled those fighters in response to a false report – that American 11, which had hit WTC 1, was still airborne and heading toward Washington DC – Eberhart said that he had learned about this false report only “recently.”[30] It seems incredible that the head of NORAD would have been ignorant about which fighters had been scrambled until two and a half years following the attacks.
Eberhart had the responsibility of setting the alert levels of the Infocon, which defends against attacks on the Pentagon’s communications networks. Just 12 hours before the attacks, Infocon was reduced to its least protective level and then not raised until after the second WTC attack.[31]
Eberhart was also in charge of many of NORAD’s military exercises (“war games”) that occurred on 9/11, such as Vigilant Guardian, which had a scenario in which terrorists hijacked an airliner with the aim of attacking New York City. The exercise was conducted “sim over live,” meaning the simulated hijackings were to be inserted into the live air traffic control system. As a result, NEADS personnel for some time were uncertain whether the radar tracks were real or simulated.According to Eberhart’s own testimony, he realized after the second WTC attack, hence shortly after 9:00 AM, that a “coordinated terrorist attack” was underway. Eberhart was the person with the primary responsibility to protect Canada and the US from attack, and yet he allowed the war games to continue until after 10:00 AM.Moreover, radar personnel at Cheyenne asked NEADS to “get rid of this goddamn sim.” According to a 9/11 Commission interview with Canadian Lt. Gen. Rick Findley, who was NORAD’s Battle Staff Director at Cheyenne Mountain Operations Center on the morning of September 11, there was, following the second attack, “confusion as to how many, and which aircraft, were hijacked.”[32] Nevertheless, the sim remained until after the time of the Pentagon attack (at 9:37 AM). When asked about the impact of the military exercises by the 9/11 Commission, Eberhart falsely claimed that they had “at most cost us 30 seconds.”[33]
Researcher and reporter Michael Kane of Global Free Press, who was on the scene at a 9/11 Commission Hearing, reported: “After General Eberhart’s sworn testimony, I asked him who was in charge of coordinating the multiple war games running on 9/11. He replied: ‘No Comment.’”[34] However, Lt. Col. Dawne Deskins from the North East Air Defense Sector (NEADS) told the Commission, “Exercises that are designed on the NORAD level are created at planning conferences. NORAD planning exercises are mostly held at Peterson,” which is where General Eberhart was in charge.[35]


Conclusion
Eberhart made several statements that were clearly false and others that were at least highly implausible, including:

that he decided it would be all right to drive to the Operations Center because things had “quieted down”;
that the airliner pilots had squawked the hijack code;
that he could not use his cell phone during his drive to the Operations Center;
that the military exercises would have delayed NEADS no more than 30 seconds;
that he had only recently learned that the 9:24 AM scramble was based on a false report about American 11;
that he called General Myers while the latter was on Capitol Hill;

Eberhart also caused delays through his actions and omissions:

by turning Infocon down to the least protective level;
by taking 45 minutes or longer to drive to the Operations Center with a cell phone that reportedly did not work (which meant that Eberhart – like Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, Myers, Shelton, and Winfield – was reportedly incommunicado during the attacks);
by ordering interceptor pilots to “battle stations,” which meant that the pilots wait in their jets with the engines off, so they were not ready to scramble immediately;
by delaying to implement SCATANA until after the attacks were over;
by arranging multiple military exercises for 9/11, with at least one of them being “sim over live,” then not ordering removal of these confusing “sims” until after the Pentagon attack;
Finally, in agreeing with The 9/11 Commission’s statement that NORAD’s 2001 timeline was false, Eberhart implied that the military (under his control) had given a false account.

In short, Eberhart did nothing effective in response to the 9/11 hijackings – despite being present in the military’s teleconference as those hijackings were in progress – except to delay responses.
Considerable evidence points to Eberhart as having been derelict in his duty.[36]
A formal investigation should be launched to see if there is any other conclusion that could be reached.

[36] Dereliction of duty is a specific offense under United States Code Title 10,892, Article 92, and applies to all branches of the US military. A service member who is derelict has willfully refused to perform his duties or has incapacitated himself in such a way that he cannot perform his duties (as when Eberhart took his long drive). Article 92 applies to service members whose acts or omissions rise to the level of criminally negligent behavior (“Dereliction of Duty,” Wikipedia, accessed August 2014).

9/11 Suspects: Ralph Eberhart

TRANSCRIPT
According to the official story of September 11, 2001, four hijacked airliners flew wildly off course over the most sensitive airspace in the United States for 109 minutes without being intercepted by a single fighter jet. As Commander-in-Chief of the North American Aerospace Defense Command on 9/11, General Ralph Eberhart was in charge of the largest failure to defend North American airspace in history.
Rather than accepting blame for his command’s complete lack of response that morning, however, or even expressing regret about what had occurred, General Eberhart instead spent the rest of his career attempting to pin the blame for this failure squarely on the FAA.
GEN. EBERHART: You’ve read a lot over the last two and a half years about what NORAD did and did not do that morning and should have done in the years and months leading up to that attack. Ground truth is that NORAD was charged to support the FAA in the event of a hijacking. Our role was to respond to the request from FAA to get airborne, fly, shadow the hijacked airplane, say whether the hijacked airplane was following the instructions of the air traffic controller, of FAA. And in a terrible situation that that plane crashed, or that airplane exploded in mid-air, document that tragedy.
(Source: Homeland Defense in the Global War on Terrorism)
Although Eberhart’s version of events was cemented into place as the official story of 9/11 propounded by the 9/11 commission, they are in fact self-serving lies.
In Eberhart’s version of events, NORAD is completely subordinate to the FAA. In reality, however, NORAD is specifically tasked with dealing with such events itself, not waiting passively for FAA orders. NORAD’s own regulations for dealing with hijacked jets specifically state that “FAA Authorization for Interceptor Operations is not used for intercept and airborne surveillance of hijacked aircraft within the [continental United States].”
These standard operating procedures were not merely theoretical, or some obscure regulation that would have been unfamiliar to the four-star general in charge of defending American airspace. In the year 2000 alone, NORAD scrambled fighters in response to “unknowns”–pilots who didn’t file or diverted from flight plans or used the wrong frequency–129 times.
Perhaps even more remarkable, however, is that Eberhart and NORAD offered not one, not two, not three, but four separate timelines of their complete lack of response that morning. The first, offered by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Richard Myers just two days after the attacks during his confirmation hearings in the Senate, claimed that not a single fighter was scrambled to intercept any of the airliners until after the incident at the Pentagon. One week later, NORAD released a partial timeline that indicated they had in fact received advance notification about three of the planes with as much as 20 minutes warning, more than enough time for the planes to have been intercepted. A third story emerged in May 2003; this time, NORAD was only contacted about Flight 175 at 9:05, 3 minutes after it crashed into the south tower. The official story, found in the 9/11 Commission’s final report, was that NORAD received no advance notice of any of the flights. Eberhart and the military were completely exonerated.
However, Eberhart had testified in October 2001 that NORAD had been notified about Flight 77 at 9:24 AM. The 9/11 Commission determined that this was a lie. Regardless of the truth or untruth of any of these accounts, the simple fact is that, according to the 9/11 Commission itself, Eberhart had lied to Congress, which is in fact a crime. By the 9/11 Commission’s own account, Eberhart should have been tried.
But Eberhart’s lies do not end there.
GEN. EBERHART: Many people will talk about that they knew that there was going to be an attack. They knew that people were going to take over an aircraft and fly it into a building. I can tell you that there was no credible intelligence at that time to go build a defense against that type of attack. Tragically, we were wrong. We were wrong.
(Source: Homeland Defense in the Global War on Terrorism)
Once again, Eberhart’s depiction of events is a self-serving and easily demonstrable lie.
Not only had NORAD envisioned such a scenario, they had been training for it extensively in the years leading up to 9/11. Between October 1998 and September 2001, NORAD had conducted 28 exercise events involving hijackings. At least five of those hijack scenarios involved “a suicide crash into a high-value target.” Furthermore, at least six of the exercises took place completely within American airspace, putting to rest the oft-heard excuse that NORAD wasn’t prepared for threats from within the US.
Another note that would be of interest to prosecutors looking at potential foreknowledge of the 9/11 attacks pertains to Eberhart’s dual role as Commander-in-Chief of US Space Command, where he was responsible for setting something called the “Infocon threat level.” Established in March 1999, the Infocon threat level was designed as a measure of the threat to Defense Department computer systems and networks and different levels required different protocols for securing communications and information systems. At 9:09 PM on September 10, 2001, less than 12 hours before the attacks began, Eberhart reduced Infocon to Level 5 , the lowest threat level, making it easier for hackers to compromise Defense Department systems and controls. Eberhart has never been asked about this change in the public record.
There are a laundry list of other questionable actions that Eberhart took on 9/11. His failure to implement military control over US airspace. His decision to drive from Peterson Air Force Base to NORAD’s Cheyenne Mountain Control Center at 9:30 AM, right in the middle of the attack, despite knowing this would involve loss of communication for part of the drive, and the fact that it took him 45 minutes to complete the 30 minute trip. His decision to ground all fighter jets by ordering them to battle stations instead of ordering them to scramble at 9:49 AM. And even NORAD’s inability to turn over basic documentation to government investigators.
The official story of 9/11 is a lie. But Eberhart’s story is a lie within that lie, designed to absolve himself and other members of the US military charged with defending American airspace that morning from the most catastrophic failure in that mission in their history. And not only did Eberhart survive with his career intact, he was praised as a “9/11 hero” and moved into the private sector after leaving NORAD in 2004, as chairman and board member of a number of companies that directly benefited from the post-9/11 police state and the post-9/11 war on terror.
Ralph E. Eberhart remains at large.

So Sayeth YouTube:
“Content that is considered “not advertiser-friendly” includes but is not limited to:
 – Controversial or sensitive subjects and events, including subjects related to war, political conflicts, natural disasters and tragedies, even if graphic imagery is not shown.”
James, it would appear that your subject matter is not deemed sufficiently controversial nor sensitive by YouTube to warrant censorship.  I am puzzled by this.  How are you managing to stay while others are complaining they have been invited to leave?

This whole recent story about YouTube censorship is wrong on every level. There has been no change in YouTube policy. The crackdown began a year and a half ago (which I reported on at the time: https://www.corbettreport.com/?p=13994). And it is not about “censorship” in the “delete your video” sense but monetization of videos, which doesn’t affect me since I do not monetize my videos anyway.
So, in short, don’t believe everything you read on the internet.

“Don’t believe everything you read on the internet”…. says the gentleman on the internet.
Forgive me.  That you are distributing your carefully and ingeniously crafted information AND reaching hundreds of thousands of people occasionally strikes me as too good to be true.
There is no Santa Claus.  There is no Easter Bunny.  There is no God.  There is no democracy.  The leaders of the Western world are NOT the good guys.  There are no “Peace Keepers”.  There is no moral coalition of benevolent souls uniting to fight Climate Crisis; there is no climate crisis.  There is no justice.  There is no truth in mainstream media.  There was no Osama Bin Laden striking fear into a free America because he “hates our freedom”.  There was no airplane at the Pentagon.  There were no weapons of mass destruction.  There was no lone deranged gunman in 1963….ad nauseum….
My parents misled me.  The church lied to me.  The media lied to me.  The politicians lied to me.  My school lied to me.  Noam Chomsky let me down……
The pattern has repeated since the day I was born.  James Corbett hasn’t yet disappointed me….and, believe me, I’m looking carefully with the cross armed posture of a skeptic.  If you are (as I suspect you are) the real deal, I worry about your safety if you manage to add a couple of zero’s to your subscribership.
I haven’t been able to poke any holes in your arguments yet but…I owe it to myself and you NOT to accept every word you post as gospel.
Thanks for the reminder @ 11:58.  Especially, I want to thank you for this recent 911 video effort.  Again, it’s all too good to be true.
Sincerely,
Ryan

I won’t hazard a guess on how many times, in my relatively recent exposure to TCR, James has stressed the importance of not merely verification of what’s presented, but invitation to actively contribute open-source documentation of facts. 
That’s how this place works. All-in responsibility for material, analysis and opinion. 
Maybe, just, rather, ‘good to be true’, eh?  
Cheers.

Well… Hats of to you Mr. Corbett…  That was excellent work, and worth every second spent watching it.
Congratulations….
On another note.. 
What does Corbett Nation think of Anonymous??  I stumbled on the video below posted 4 days ago, and watched over 600,000 times so far..  The scary part is, everything in this video is very accurate.. They seem to be people in the know, and not just some hackers… 
Anonymous – Message to the Citizens of the World V
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ChEI5VslDM
James, did you do an article on Anonymous???  What do you think of them??

I apologize, you didn’t ask me, but….I strongly suspect Anonymous are Gate Keepers:

Likewise for Bill Maher
Likewise for Noam Chomsky

I’m with you m.clare on leaning toward Anonymous being gatekeepers/a deep state operation as well… 
But unlike Assange, Snowden and the others you mentioned, Anonymous pointing toward 9/11 being a false flag is a significant thing. Does anyone know if this is the first time they’ve mentioned that in their official videos?
In any case, I’m interested in Corbett’s thoughts on this as well! : )
If not before, here’s a good QFC:
James, what’s your overall take on “official” Anonymous at this point? And what’s your take on them pointing to 9/11 being a false flag operation in this video that VOA posted above?
A great community of researchers and activists here, most of whom strive to be reflective and mature in their engagement of one another and the very important, sensitive subject matter. James, his guests and this community continue to give me hope and passion about our future as humanity. Thank you all!

Hi m.clare,
Thanks for answering my question, and i am glad you did.  It makes it more interesting when it is a collaborative effort.
I agree with you 100% on The Young Turks, Bill Maher, Noam Chomsky, and I will even throw in InfoWars, because i have seen enough of their material to make a judgment.
But this is the first time i have seen Anonymous.  I have watch 5 videos all titled Message to the Citizens of the World, and i must admit, it appears to be well informed, and not keeping anything away. (i did not care much for the graphics and just listened to audio)  but I could be mistaken..
Why do you suspect that they maybe gatekeepers??

VoiceOfArabi,
I was enthusiastic about their work at first but became disillusioned.  I regret that I can’t recall what initially led me to suspect “Anonymous”, however, the link I provide above regarding their position on Climate Crisis is a quick example and is enough for me.  Corbett, Pilato, Edmonds (and others) have the balls to put their name behind their work…..
I spoke to an individual who doubts the 911 Legend (which got us talking) but swallows Climate Crisis, Chemtrails and thinks there is compelling evidence the world is flat and the moon landings were faked.  I know another guy who “knows” Climate Crisis is BS but refuses to discuss 911.
We are thus divided and conquered.
You can fool all of us some time, some of us all the time but you can’t fool all of us all the time.  Some of us will stumble upon inconsistencies that get us asking questions.  I believe there is a gatekeeper to lead these folks safely down the garden path.  David Icke is another example.  Donald Trump is another.
I believe the role of Donald Trump is to lump those asking questions together on the same leaky boat; we will all go down with the ship when he loses the election.  Anybody who challenges 911 is a gullible, racist loony.  Tin foil hats all around.
I suspect Anonymous are performing a similar service.

m.clare, there is the possibility that Chomsky is not a gate keeper, at least in the way some mean, in that he’s agreed to be on the payroll. Could be that he was threatened into boundaries, which to me is a totally different situation than, say, the Young Turks and Maher, who are disgusting, steaming piles.
Does anyone have thoughts on this distinction or Chomsky in particular?

Intimidation?  Why have Corbett, Pilato, Edmunds, and Richard Gage NOT been threatened?  I think the LAST thing the bastards need at the moment is a martyr…. martyrdom lends legitimacy.  Tin foil hats, peer pressure, gaming, distraction and systematic brainwashing are cleaner and much more effective.  Violence is a last resort.  They have learned much and refined their methods since the days of the Great Wars.
Chomsky is brilliant.  I have a hard time believing he swallows the 911 Fairy Tale.  He could very well have been threatened.  I don’t care if he has.
The two obvious motivations for the types of sociopathic behaviour Corbett is shining a spotlight on at present are Greed and Fear.  Is it possible that a more Altruistic motivation is also making a significant contribution to the justification of these atrocities?

I’ve been told that the key is credibility. For a renowned prof at MIT to come out and say 9/11 was an inside job is completely different from an unknown, know-nothing, Canadian blogger in Japan. No offense, James, just framing the debate. The people with credibility need to be kept in line or gotten rid of, is my impression. Look at the eye witnesses who dropped dead. The marines who go public. Michael Hastings.
Credibility is the key. 
And the threats are more likely against his family than him. It doesn’t matter if you care or not, the fact is that few people would sacrifice their children in that way, and expecting them to is just not realistic.

ccuthbert2001 it seems illogical that if credibility is the key you would go about keeping that by holding non credible views on particular topics (9/11 and JFK for Chomsky in particular). I assume you have seen the Corbett vid on Chomsky gatekeeper? In any event, i think even if your suggested reasons for CHomskys compliance are correct, MClare’s point is also correct. If your credibility is not beyond reproach (for whatever reason) then you are a shill because how can anyone possibly differentiate what you lie /remain willfully ignorant about vs what you are being honest about. You are basically in the same pot as all the rest. It is the essence of counter intelligence. Stirring in 5% crap with 95% truth so people being given the message chuck the baby out with the bathwater. Even the craziest of the crazies David Icke speaks truth on 70-80 percent of what he talks about. If CHomsky is on the payroll (be it for cash or the safety of his family), which im sorry, he just has to be for such an intellect to unequivocally state there is nothing even suspicious that has any credibility re 911 inside job, then how can he be trusted any more than a David Icke type?

Sorry, I guess I wasn’t clear about what I meant by credibility. 
The credibility that I’m referring to is that which the general public assigns to someone. The general public would certainly think that an MIT prof is highly credible just by his position. I’m not referring to Chomsky being credible due to his opinion on 9/11 or anything else. In this context, credibility is all about appearances.
That’s why I said that James isn’t “credible” while Chomsky is. Therefore, I think James has little to fear from tptb wanting to bump him off. They would more likely marginalize him.

“In this context, credibility is all about appearances.”
This says more about superficiality and popular distortion of definition than anything. C’mon.
9/11 realities are no mere matter of opinion. One demonstrable reality is the overt and pronounced ambivalence to open and unfettered independent investigation of facts proffered by Chomsky himself. 
MIT is the inner academic sanctum of the Pentagon. To make any comparison between Corbett v Chomsky is pure straw-man stuffing. ( Btw, I’m being polite 😉
One is about facts, the other: pretentious and pernicious propaganda.

It seems you are again completely missing my point. sigh. 
The question was will tptb bump off James. I suggest no because in the estimation of the majority (51%) or even plurality of Americans, James is not credible because he’s an unknown, unconnected, no-nothing, Canadian blogger somewhere in Japan v. a member of the intelligentsia. 
I am not commenting on James’ or Chomsky’s work, on the quality of the information or anything else.
In general, I doubt that tptb are interested in assassinating Joe Blow on the internet. They would be and we have evidenced that they are very interested in famous experts, eye witnesses, movie stars and journalists who stray off the reservation.
I hope this is clear now bc I’m getting tired of talking at cross purposes.

RE: Credibility,
A colleague @ the office ended a Climate Crisis debate by bringing up the NASA web page.  He asked me how many missions to the moon I had under my belt; the answer is, of course, none.  Who am I to contradict the official NASA gospel on the matter?  Case dismissed.
NIST
Popular Mechanics
NASA
MIT Professors
Ok…ccuthbert2001…your question,
As I am of the “working class” I spend 50 hrs / week working or commuting, 15 hrs / week running a household, 30 hrs / week parenting…….but I have spent some time imagining what it might be like to be one of the super elite.  They don’t need to waste their waking hours with such trivial matters.  What would they think about with all of their free time?
EMPATHY WITH A SOCIOPATH
Given that 1) Oil is a finite resource and 2) Human population continues to rise, it is logical to conclude that Peak Oil is an inevitability.
The consequences of Peak Oil would be extreme hardship, hunger, cold, and War
I considered the following moral dilemma years ago when people were starving in Africa:  Which scenario represents the moral high ground 1) allow 10 million to starve to death today or 2) feed them so that 25 million starve to death 30 years later?  If I was an accountant, I would say feeding them would be three times as cruel as letting them starve to death.  (again, I’m empathizing with a sociopath)
Gulf of Tonkin: 50,000 American soldiers die.
911: 3,000 citizens and 5,000 troops = 8,000 dead
911 was Five times more humane than Vietnam (wearing the sociopathic bean counter hat)
Military industrial complex employs MANY.  Ending it results in millions of engineers, factory workers, secretaries, etc. etc. NOT bringing bacon home to their families.  Military industrial complex is in the business of war.  There will be blood.  There has been a 500% reduction in American blood and…well….the same amount of brown skinned blood gets spilled.  Can’t be helped.
Now,
Same logic applies to Peak Oil.  The elite are having the slaves build the Green infrastructure.    Georgia Guide Stone commandment #1 says Half a Billion representatives of the human race can sustain themselves on the remaining half of the world’s oil inheritance.
Q. What is more humane: allowing our population to swell to 15 billion and having to wipe out 14.5 billion of us OR wiping out 6.5 Billion of us today?  The sociopathic bean counter will say the ALTRUISTIC option is to eliminate half as many people.  The sooner the better.
Is it possible we’re in the final push to commission the great Green Infrastructure for the benefit of the offspring of the chosen ones before the virus is released?
Years from now the offspring of the elite will look at our empty cities and the Green Infrastructure with the same wonder we express today for the Great Pyramids.

You could add to your argument the vaccination effort and slathering people with pesticides, both of which reduce fertility. 
Not sure how to respond to your idea, other than to propose that psychopaths don’t have the empathy you’re suggesting.
Quien sabe?

When Chomsky said that it didn’t really matter who did 9/11, that was when he outed himself as being one of them.

Letter to Paul Craig Roberts posted on his webpage today at http://www.paulcraigroberts.org/2016/09/09/from-a-reader-2/
I’m a retired career firefighter, having served over 20 years on a FD in a medium size Midwest city. During those years, I was on many a fire scene, and yes, even a few high-rise fires. Also saw some ‘pancake’ collapse structure fires and NONE of those looked like the WTC collapses. A pancake collapse has the floors falling down on top of each other, looking like a pile of pancakes on a plate, hence the term. A pancake collapse building will fall down in a random, haphazard manner, not free-fall and doesn’t emit a large cloud of pulverized contents hundreds of feet high and blocks long, making it look like a volcano exploded. Neither does a pancake collapse generate enough energy to eject a 20 ton steel beam nearly 400 feet and still have enough energy left over to impale the beam into another building. Nor does a pancake collapse turn humans into tiny bits of nothing, leaving only bone fragments no bigger than a fingernail. Nor does a pancake collapse evaporate thousands of tons of steel and concrete. I’ve read some of the NYFD radio transcripts from that day, from a crew working the fires in one of the towers. They radioed Command that the main body of fire was out, leaving only ‘mop-up’ duty. Mop-up is putting our small fires that aren’t really dangerous, but could reignite the structure, so best extinguish them. They also said they were going to start providing medical care to the victims, which means they inspected the fire floor and determined it was safe enough to provide medical care in place, if the floor had been deemed unsafe, they would of begun moving the victims to a lower level. Then, their world blew up, killing 343 NYFD firefighters. Slowly, the real news behind whathappened on 9/11 is coming out, I just pray that the truth is exposed soon, before all these ME wars that are based on the 9/11 lies, turn into WW III. Thank you for your brave reporting on this literally, life or death situation.

I wrote that letter to Mr. Roberts and I’ll add my name to the same, Greg Bacon of Boonville, MO.
I didn’t belong to this site before today, so couldn’t leave a comment, but will definitely do so now.
9/11 is the Biggest LIE and CON JOB of the century, maybe of all time and it behooves us to keep plugging away at this monstrosity until it is exposed.
We can’t afford to wait for the truth to dribble out over decades, the way matters are proceeding, we don’t have the time.
ON 9/11, I watched 343 of my fellow brother and sister firefighters die a horrible death, murdered by their own government and swore that day to never stop asking questions until the real perps are outed.
Thanks to Mr. Corbett, that is becoming less of a chore.

The founder of Apollo Global Management is Leon Black. He has a PERSONAL art collection approaching a billion dollars.
Apollo
 Apollo has had money invested in all types of companies (such as Twinkies, AMC Entertainment, Telemundo, GNC, Coldwell Banker, Century 21, McGraw-Hill Education publishers, Chuck E. Cheeze’s, cloud servers and web hosting, mega real estate holdings and mortgages, etc.)
 Apollo has a variety of masked sister investment arms, some affiliated with Arabian oil money, some affiliated in partnership with the infamous Carlyle Group (see 9/11 research and Soros research) along with its holdings of Carnegie Learning, the University of Phoenix, etc.

 (It should be noted that Wikipedia has expunged/censored some previously written Wikipedia financial escapades of Apollo.)
– SPROUTS FARMERS MARKET –
Sprouts is like a small Whole Foods offering vitamins, healthy and organic foods.
In the Spring of 2011, Apollo bought a controlling interest ownership of privately owned Sprout Farmers Market for 214 million.
 IPO stands for an “Initial Public Offering” which means that the company’s stock will be traded on Wall Street. Often investors rush to buy shares on the day an IPO occurs.
 On August 1st, 2013 Apollo took “Sprouts Farmers Market” public to the stock market with an IPO.
 Some reporters estimate that Apollo PROFITED overnight to the tune of way more than billion dollars with the Sprouts IPO. https://www.pehub.com/2013/07/apollo-make-5-3x-its-money-sprouts-farmers-markets/ 
— Sprouts Farmers Market, Apollo, NBC, GE, “Autism Speaks” —
Sprouts Farmers Market has a deception on its support for AUTISM.
 Sprouts will collect donations for Autism at the cash register, but “Autism Speaks” is the organization which receives the funds. https://www.autismspeaks.org/
“Autism Speaks” is a fraud.
“Autism Speaks” adamantly refuses to mention vaccines as a possible link to Autism.
“Autism Speaks” was founded by Bob Wright.
 Bob Wright was the CEO and top executive of NBC for many years and also top honcho for General Electric (which owned NBC, The Weather Channel, Universal Studios, etc.) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bob_Wright
…
And I should mention that a Plano, TX Sprouts store once had hundreds and hundreds of rats.  The Regional Manager had moved his office out of the store because the rat urine was so rank.  When a guy in a hazmat suit tore out his office wall, there were more than 50 baby rats in the Regional Manager’s office wall.  So many rats, sometimes one would fall on an employee.

ccuthbert2001 sorry for the misunderstanding, but guess my wider point is a gatekeeper is more about the effect than the motivation. If Chomsky gatekeeps for ‘moral’ reasons, the gate is kept all the same. I understand though that if your hypothesis on his motivations were correct then it gets trickier, gets back to a more philosophical question we see in MMP type political systems like here in NZ where smaller parties have to work with bigger parties who go against their general principles to achieve anything ie better inside the tent the out, but again thats where the rubber hits the road, if you sell your principles for any price, be it noble or not, then you cant be trusted cause you have declared your principles have a price, and its just a case of meeting that price.

Agreed. 
Please don’t apologize. This is a good discussion, if difficult due to the nature of a written forum. 😉

Well maybe the reason there was no air force response because there were no planes to respond to.
This was covered in many alternative investigations after 9/11. There are many inconsistencies surrounding the planes.
1. The amount of wreckage recovered. 2. Amount of damaged caused (pentagon) 3. One or two of the planes was recorded as being grounded that day. Or one bearing the same identity number shows up landing at another airport some time after 9/11.  Ect.
A former CIA employee and pilot by the name of John Lear of Lear Jet fame has information suggesting  that the air force prior to 9/11 has military grade holographic hardware that can be mounted on a plane, that can produce and project an image that looks like and sounds like a real plane

Russell.m,
Unfortunately, the “no planes” concept is an infiltrated idea.  There are other infiltrated ideas.  Historically, I watched many infiltrated concepts develop through people such as CIA asset Morgan Reynolds and deep state sponsored loonies such as Judy Woods.
Infiltration is really about a meme, a cultural aspect unwittingly swallowed.  A concept which kind of manifests itself by behavior which benefits “The Powers That Shouldn’t Be”.
We now have a regression in some of the alternative “truther” media such as Alex Jones who promotes Trump as the white Obama, and promotes discord, rage, even prejudice against Muslims.
A valid alternative media will “care” and strive towards unifying people offering solutions and promoting activism in the real world.  A valid alternative media cites references. A valid alternative media targets the reality of the type of audience it is presenting itself to.  (e.g. a message to a new person should be different (simpler) than a message to an old hat who has kept abreast.)
Many “awoken” people have been compromised by an infiltrated meme.  They spend their days ONLY chatting back-n-forth to the choir, but never taking effective action or solutions to the real world.  “The Powers That Be” must be laughing… …lots of forums and chats alone in itself will never change real world scenarios, because it takes real world interaction.

Home, This “were there or weren’t there planes” is a real dilemma. From the very first time I saw the first “plane crashing into the building” I thought the video was fake. It looks like the plane effortlessly flew into steel and concrete and left a hole like Wiley Coyote on the canyon floor–including the wing tips. This is simply ridiculous and could not happen.
What it means, however, is still a mystery. Were the crashes faked and bombs set off? Did planes really hit, but fake vids were released to confuse us? I don’t know, but I do know that if planes hit, they wouldn’t have effortlessly entered the buildings leaving a perfect silhouette. There are likewise excellent questions about the amazing pix Judy Woods shows in her book, whatever her conclusions are. Were these pix photoshopped and if so, why? So that Woods could come along and “reveal” amazing, magical weapons that tptb have to really scare the hoi polloi into line? 
Be that as it may, you are correct that divide and conquer is continuing to be successful. James certainly helps the situation with this series, avoiding the possible red herrings and going for mainstream video to out the criminals. Follow the money was great in this regard, too.

ccuthbert,
Jeremy Rys is good to go to about Judy Woods.
http://911blogger.com/news/2016-09-02/what-real-911-investigation-would-reveal
Steven Jones thoroughly nailed her.  I remember when she came on the scene with Fetzer…what a mess.  Jones has a good scientific paper on her stuff, but the time line history of Judy Woods and Fetzer would make a person puke at how they tried to hijack the movement and how they caused a big mess.
The hologram concept is out there to discredit the truth movement.  That is what it accomplishes. 
Some people in our truth group hold to the above ideas. That is fine if one wants to hold these ideas.  It is still America.  Anyone can have an opinion.  But those ideas are harmful when approaching a new public with them…it hurts the movement.  Our group focuses primarily on sharing Ae911truth with new public. (and we do non 9/11 issues like VAXXED and Fluoride and health, etc)

On September 11th at our Dallas Sign Wave, we had some folks come by after hearing about it at CorbettReport.
Thank you!  And thank you for the donations towards more Free DVDs.
We even had a 90 year old engineer, Ae911truth petition signer, come join holding signs.
Visibility.
Being visible in the Real World (not just cyber) lets other who are aware know that they are not alone.  And it lets the unaware know that the issue of the 9/11 Cover-up it Real World, not a cyber-blurb.
…and talk about courage.
One fellow arrived late when we were all packed up with our group Sign Wave ready to head home.
He said, “Well, I need to do my part.”  And so he grabbed two signs and went at it alone on the busy intersection.
Visibility in the Real World is key.
In our personal daily aspects, we all can do our part in being visible with this information.

@ccuthbert2001, Russell.m
Judy Woods might sound ok if you are not familiar with physics, constructions, materials… She is building her story on a premise that plane made of aluminum is soft and fragile, but building made of steel and concrete is hard and tough. 
In case of plane crashing into a building the most important thing is Kinetic Energy.
Plane had almost 100 tons and it was flying at 400-500 knots. Tremendous energy.
You cannot apply knowledge of everyday physics in this case. Situation is in fact similar to Kinetic energy weapons, like armor piercing ammunition. The most important characteristic of material used in this ammunition is its density (DU, tungsten), to get big mass, since kinetic energy is a product of mass and velocity squared.
Projectile simply gets through, passes through obstacle, because of kinetic energy.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
