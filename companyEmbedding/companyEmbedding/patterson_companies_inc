Patterson Companies Inc is a medical supplies conglomerate primarily in the business of veterinary and dental products (ranging from xray equipment to consumable products, dental consumables make up the biggest part of the dental industry).[4] Since 2003 it also distributes general medical rehabilitative devices like braces and wheel chairs. Traditionally a dental company it diversified its business at the turn of the millennium when it acquired 55-year-old company JA Webster Inc, a distributor of veterinary products. That business segment (now known as Patterson Veterinary) currently distributes equipment (diagnostic and surgical) and medicine (anaesthetics, vaccines). The company operates directly in only the US and Canada (in Canada through subsidiaries Sammons Preston Canada and Patterson Dental Canada).
In 2008 it was noted as having one of the lowest debt ratios among companies in the health care sector.[5] Patterson was also a member of the Nasdaq-100 until December 10, 2010 when it and six other companies were replaced. The Nasdaq-100 is composed of the 100 largest non financial stocks traded on the Nasdaq.[6]
Patterson is the distribution company for Sirona Dental Systems, one of the world's biggest dental equipment manufacturers.[7] More recently the company has been active in making acquisitions abroad; On June 17, 2010 Patterson Medical purchased the rehabilitation part of Ireland-based DCC Healthcare (Days Healthcare, Physiomed and Ausmedic) in a move that increased Patterson Medical's revenue by 16.43% (US$70 million, fiscal year ended April 24, 2010). The new companies were added to its Homecraft Rolyan unit in the UK.[8]

History[edit]
The company traces its roots through division Patterson Dental Supply back to one established in 1878 named Patterson Dental Company. It remained focused solely on the dental products market until the 21st century when it branched out into the veterinary supplies market through 2 large acquisitions, JA Webster in 2001 (92.5 million dollars)[9] and ProVet in 2004. For about 130 years it dealt only in dental supplies.[10][11] It began selling rehabilitation supplies in 2004 after acquiring Ability One Products Corporation followed by Medco the same year.[12]
It went public on the Nasdaq in 1992 with an IPO of around 480 million dollars.[13]
Key dates and events

1987 - Acquired D.L. Saslow Co another major distributor
1993 - Started doing business outside of the US by purchasing Healthco Canada.
1997 - purchased software developer Eaglesoft Inc a company founded by Scott R. Kabbes who 6 years later was made president of Patterson Dental Company. It later became Patterson Technology Center [14]
2004 - CAESY Patient Education Systems was acquired. It is used by the company to provide information relating to treatment procedures for patients. As a subsidiary the company retained its name.
July 2004 - was renamed Patterson Companies Inc because by then it was not only in the business of dental equipment distribution, it also made software, served the veterinary market and supplied products for general medical use. Until that time it was named Patterson Dental Company.

Business segments[edit]
Patterson Dental Supply, Inc, Patterson Veterinary Supply, Inc. (formerly Webster Veterinary Supply), and Patterson Medical Supply, Inc. comprise the three core segments of the company. Those core businesses branch out into many regional subsidiaries, most of which are based in the United States (except for a few Canadian ones like Sammons Preston Canada and Patterson Dental Canada (has 550 employees). The majority of business in Canada comes from Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan. Software and hardware businesses are part of Patterson Dental.
Patterson Medical provides over 20,000 rehabilitation supplies, equipment and assistive living products.
Patterson Medical’s international operations consist of Homecraft in the United Kingdom and Kinetec in France. Homecraft is a supplier of aids to daily living and rehabilitation products in the United Kingdom. In France, Kinetec consists of two operations: the manufacturing and distribution of Continuous Passive Motions machines and distribution of Sammons Preston and Homecraft products.
More recent acquisitions[edit]
For 2010 the last 3 rehabilitation companies (Days Healthcare, Physiomed and Ausmedic) were formerly part of DCC Plc a company that serves the UK market.

Patterson Companies Inc is a medical supplies conglomerate primarily in the business of veterinary and dental products (ranging from xray equipment to consumable products, dental consumables make up the biggest part of the dental industry).[4] Since 2003 it also distributes general medical rehabilitative devices like braces and wheel chairs. Traditionally a dental company it diversified its business at the turn of the millennium when it acquired 55-year-old company JA Webster Inc, a distributor of veterinary products. That business segment (now known as Patterson Veterinary) currently distributes equipment (diagnostic and surgical) and medicine (anaesthetics, vaccines). The company operates directly in only the US and Canada (in Canada through subsidiaries Sammons Preston Canada and Patterson Dental Canada).
In 2008 it was noted as having one of the lowest debt ratios among companies in the health care sector.[5] Patterson was also a member of the Nasdaq-100 until December 10, 2010 when it and six other companies were replaced. The Nasdaq-100 is composed of the 100 largest non financial stocks traded on the Nasdaq.[6]
Patterson is the distribution company for Sirona Dental Systems, one of the world's biggest dental equipment manufacturers.[7] More recently the company has been active in making acquisitions abroad; On June 17, 2010 Patterson Medical purchased the rehabilitation part of Ireland-based DCC Healthcare (Days Healthcare, Physiomed and Ausmedic) in a move that increased Patterson Medical's revenue by 16.43% (US$70 million, fiscal year ended April 24, 2010). The new companies were added to its Homecraft Rolyan unit in the UK.[8]

History[edit]
The company traces its roots through division Patterson Dental Supply back to one established in 1878 named Patterson Dental Company. It remained focused solely on the dental products market until the 21st century when it branched out into the veterinary supplies market through 2 large acquisitions, JA Webster in 2001 (92.5 million dollars)[9] and ProVet in 2004. For about 130 years it dealt only in dental supplies.[10][11] It began selling rehabilitation supplies in 2004 after acquiring Ability One Products Corporation followed by Medco the same year.[12]
It went public on the Nasdaq in 1992 with an IPO of around 480 million dollars.[13]

Patterson Companies Inc is a medical supplies conglomerate primarily in the business of veterinary and dental products (ranging from xray equipment to consumable products, dental consumables make up the biggest part of the dental industry).[4] Since 2003 it also distributes general medical rehabilitative devices like braces and wheel chairs. Traditionally a dental company it diversified its business at the turn of the millennium when it acquired 55-year-old company JA Webster Inc, a distributor of veterinary products. That business segment (now known as Patterson Veterinary) currently distributes equipment (diagnostic and surgical) and medicine (anaesthetics, vaccines). The company operates directly in only the US and Canada (in Canada through subsidiaries Sammons Preston Canada and Patterson Dental Canada).
In 2008 it was noted as having one of the lowest debt ratios among companies in the health care sector.[5] Patterson was also a member of the Nasdaq-100 until December 10, 2010 when it and six other companies were replaced. The Nasdaq-100 is composed of the 100 largest non financial stocks traded on the Nasdaq.[6]
Patterson is the distribution company for Sirona Dental Systems, one of the world's biggest dental equipment manufacturers.[7] More recently the company has been active in making acquisitions abroad; On June 17, 2010 Patterson Medical purchased the rehabilitation part of Ireland-based DCC Healthcare (Days Healthcare, Physiomed and Ausmedic) in a move that increased Patterson Medical's revenue by 16.43% (US$70 million, fiscal year ended April 24, 2010). The new companies were added to its Homecraft Rolyan unit in the UK.[8]

History[edit]
The company traces its roots through division Patterson Dental Supply back to one established in 1878 named Patterson Dental Company. It remained focused solely on the dental products market until the 21st century when it branched out into the veterinary supplies market through 2 large acquisitions, JA Webster in 2001 (92.5 million dollars)[9] and ProVet in 2004. For about 130 years it dealt only in dental supplies.[10][11] It began selling rehabilitation supplies in 2004 after acquiring Ability One Products Corporation followed by Medco the same year.[12]
It went public on the Nasdaq in 1992 with an IPO of around 480 million dollars.[13]
Key dates and events

1987 - Acquired D.L. Saslow Co another major distributor
1993 - Started doing business outside of the US by purchasing Healthco Canada.
1997 - purchased software developer Eaglesoft Inc a company founded by Scott R. Kabbes who 6 years later was made president of Patterson Dental Company. It later became Patterson Technology Center [14]
2004 - CAESY Patient Education Systems was acquired. It is used by the company to provide information relating to treatment procedures for patients. As a subsidiary the company retained its name.
July 2004 - was renamed Patterson Companies Inc because by then it was not only in the business of dental equipment distribution, it also made software, served the veterinary market and supplied products for general medical use. Until that time it was named Patterson Dental Company.

Business segments[edit]
Patterson Dental Supply, Inc, Patterson Veterinary Supply, Inc. (formerly Webster Veterinary Supply), and Patterson Medical Supply, Inc. comprise the three core segments of the company. Those core businesses branch out into many regional subsidiaries, most of which are based in the United States (except for a few Canadian ones like Sammons Preston Canada and Patterson Dental Canada (has 550 employees). The majority of business in Canada comes from Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan. Software and hardware businesses are part of Patterson Dental.
Patterson Medical provides over 20,000 rehabilitation supplies, equipment and assistive living products.
Patterson Medical’s international operations consist of Homecraft in the United Kingdom and Kinetec in France. Homecraft is a supplier of aids to daily living and rehabilitation products in the United Kingdom. In France, Kinetec consists of two operations: the manufacturing and distribution of Continuous Passive Motions machines and distribution of Sammons Preston and Homecraft products.
More recent acquisitions[edit]
For 2010 the last 3 rehabilitation companies (Days Healthcare, Physiomed and Ausmedic) were formerly part of DCC Plc a company that serves the UK market.

Patterson Companies Inc is a medical supplies conglomerate primarily in the business of veterinary and dental products (ranging from xray equipment to consumable products, dental consumables make up the biggest part of the dental industry).[4] Since 2003 it also distributes general medical rehabilitative devices like braces and wheel chairs. Traditionally a dental company it diversified its business at the turn of the millennium when it acquired 55-year-old company JA Webster Inc, a distributor of veterinary products. That business segment (now known as Patterson Veterinary) currently distributes equipment (diagnostic and surgical) and medicine (anaesthetics, vaccines). The company operates directly in only the US and Canada (in Canada through subsidiaries Sammons Preston Canada and Patterson Dental Canada).
In 2008 it was noted as having one of the lowest debt ratios among companies in the health care sector.[5] Patterson was also a member of the Nasdaq-100 until December 10, 2010 when it and six other companies were replaced. The Nasdaq-100 is composed of the 100 largest non financial stocks traded on the Nasdaq.[6]
Patterson is the distribution company for Sirona Dental Systems, one of the world's biggest dental equipment manufacturers.[7] More recently the company has been active in making acquisitions abroad; On June 17, 2010 Patterson Medical purchased the rehabilitation part of Ireland-based DCC Healthcare (Days Healthcare, Physiomed and Ausmedic) in a move that increased Patterson Medical's revenue by 16.43% (US$70 million, fiscal year ended April 24, 2010). The new companies were added to its Homecraft Rolyan unit in the UK.[8]

History[edit]
The company traces its roots through division Patterson Dental Supply back to one established in 1878 named Patterson Dental Company. It remained focused solely on the dental products market until the 21st century when it branched out into the veterinary supplies market through 2 large acquisitions, JA Webster in 2001 (92.5 million dollars)[9] and ProVet in 2004. For about 130 years it dealt only in dental supplies.[10][11] It began selling rehabilitation supplies in 2004 after acquiring Ability One Products Corporation followed by Medco the same year.[12]
It went public on the Nasdaq in 1992 with an IPO of around 480 million dollars.[13]
Key dates and events

1987 - Acquired D.L. Saslow Co another major distributor
1993 - Started doing business outside of the US by purchasing Healthco Canada.
1997 - purchased software developer Eaglesoft Inc a company founded by Scott R. Kabbes who 6 years later was made president of Patterson Dental Company. It later became Patterson Technology Center [14]
2004 - CAESY Patient Education Systems was acquired. It is used by the company to provide information relating to treatment procedures for patients. As a subsidiary the company retained its name.
July 2004 - was renamed Patterson Companies Inc because by then it was not only in the business of dental equipment distribution, it also made software, served the veterinary market and supplied products for general medical use. Until that time it was named Patterson Dental Company.

Business segments[edit]
Patterson Dental Supply, Inc, Patterson Veterinary Supply, Inc. (formerly Webster Veterinary Supply), and Patterson Medical Supply, Inc. comprise the three core segments of the company. Those core businesses branch out into many regional subsidiaries, most of which are based in the United States (except for a few Canadian ones like Sammons Preston Canada and Patterson Dental Canada (has 550 employees). The majority of business in Canada comes from Quebec, Ontario, British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan. Software and hardware businesses are part of Patterson Dental.
Patterson Medical provides over 20,000 rehabilitation supplies, equipment and assistive living products.
Patterson Medical’s international operations consist of Homecraft in the United Kingdom and Kinetec in France. Homecraft is a supplier of aids to daily living and rehabilitation products in the United Kingdom. In France, Kinetec consists of two operations: the manufacturing and distribution of Continuous Passive Motions machines and distribution of Sammons Preston and Homecraft products.
More recent acquisitions[edit]
For 2010 the last 3 rehabilitation companies (Days Healthcare, Physiomed and Ausmedic) were formerly part of DCC Plc a company that serves the UK market.

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Data Format: N-Triples RDF

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
