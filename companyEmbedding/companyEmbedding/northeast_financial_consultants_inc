There's an advantage in working with a financial advisor who knows you – and your financial goals. That's what makes Edward Jones different from other investment firms. Supporting the relationship between you and your financial advisor shapes nearly every aspect of our business.
You may have seen one of our 12,000 offices in your community. That's because we believe you deserve more than a 1-800 number when it comes to your financial future.
What you may not know is that we're a Fortune 500 company with thousands of associates and sophisticated technology supporting your local financial advisor.
The Edward Jones approach in determining your goals, and developing tailored financial strategies, has been helping nearly 7 million clients for more than 90 years.
In fact, we like to think we became one of the largest financial services firms in the country by not acting that way. If you're ready to work with a different kind of investment firm—one that cares as much about why you're investing as what you invest in— you're ready to work with Edward Jones.

Knows My Investment Style
I want someone who makes recommendations in my best interest and explains how they can help me make progress towards my goals.

Focus On You

Focus On You




Every investment firm has principles. And they usually sound exactly the same. We believe Edward Jones is different in almost every way. Our principles were deliberately created with you in mind. We don't just talk about personal service. We're built to deliver it.
Your dedicated financial advisor – It's your financial future, so an 800-number or Internet search for financial advice doesn't cut it. You have a relationship with an Edward Jones financial advisor, who spends time to learn why you're investing and then develops a personalized strategy. No cookie-cutter plans here.
In your neighborhood – With more than 15,000 financial advisors, you shouldn't have to go far to find an Edward Jones office in your community. That means you can actually meet with a financial advisor to discuss what's important to you.
Tailored for individual investors - All of our resources – including investment research, online account access, easy-to-understand statements, sophisticated software and detailed reports – are developed with you in mind.
Experienced support team - Backing up this personal service is a Fortune 500 company with thousands of people and advanced technology. Your financial advisor uses these resources to develop the best strategy for you.
We spend the time and have the knowledge to help you sort through complicated financial questions. Most financial services firms claim to focus on you and your needs, but can they really do it? We believe Edward Jones is uniquely positioned from the ground up to provide the attention, respect and service you deserve.

Prepare for Your First Appointment 
Learn more



Prepare for Your First Appointment 




We're honored that you're considering working with us to help achieve your financial goals. Here are three ways you can prepare our first meeting.


Think about why you're investing
Understanding the "why" will help you be better prepared to discuss your goals and strategies to help reach them. What's important to you and your family? What do you want to achieve?


Gather your statements
If you've worked with a financial advisor before, it's helpful to know about your current investments and your experience to date. If you're new to the investing world, we promise to talk with you, not at you. Our goal is to empower you with the knowledge you'll need to pursue your goals.


Bring your questions
We want to make sure to answer any investment questions you may have, as well as how we can best work together. What do you expect? How often do you want to touch base?

Invested in the Community






We are invested in our community
We value the communities where we work, so we're committed to giving back. You'll find our associates serving clients in our offices, but you'll also find us investing our time and talents to support local organizations and great causes. Many Financial Advisors are on Chambers of Commerce and serve as board members and event coordinators for local organizations, and our associates volunteer, donate and support a variety of charitable organizations.







Tour De Ted
Each year, branch and Home Office associates take to the road to raise funds for cancer research for the firm's annual Tour de Ted. In memory of Ted Jones, former managing partner who died from cancer, the first Tour de Ted showcased the firm's community-oriented culture while paying tribute to the history of Edward Jones. Volunteers rode the path of the original "wire" that connected Pueblo, Colo., to St. Louis, Mo., which created our branch network.







Emergency Assistance
Sixteen Financial Advisors in Texas decided to set aside one day out of their busy schedules to give back to their community. They volunteered at the Montgomery County Emergency Assistance facility by painting offices and hallways, and sorting and tagging clothes.







School Supply Drive
Eight local Edward Jones Financial Advisors teamed up on behalf of school children, clearly demonstrating their commitment to family values. Their school supply drive brought in hundreds of classroom necessities, from notebooks and markers to tissues and cleaning wipes.







Habitat for Humanity
When investors wanted to save for a new home, Edward Jones was there to help. Associates from Ontario, Canada, helped a local family reach its goal of home ownership in another way when they came together for the Habitat for Humanity build in Amherstburg, Ont., the first such home built in this community.







Pedal the Cause
We're proud of our associates who joined the fight against cancer as Edward Jones Pedal the Cause riders. More than 200 bike riders from across the U.S. took to the streets (and the Katy Trail) to help fundraise for cancer research.







Walk to End Alzheimer's®
At Edward Jones, we live and work in the communities we serve. We want to make a difference in people’s lives, both in and out of the office. Alzheimer’s disease has a significant impact on individuals, family, friends and community. That’s why we’ve chosen to partner with the Alzheimer’s Association as the National Presenting Sponsor of the Walk to End Alzheimer’s®. We invite you to join us in the fight to end this terrible disease.

Financial Life Planning 




















 
Fee-Only Planner



Northeastern Financial Consultants Inc.is a fee-only financial planning firm committed to assisting client to reach their financial goals. Fee-only planners, like us, are compensated solely by fees paid by their clients and do not accept commissions or compensation from any other source. As fee-only planners, we believe there is a significant conflict of interest if an advisor stands to gain financially from the purchase of any investment or insurance product he or she recommends to the client. 

What is it?

Fee-only investment management is the newest and most attractive way to pay for professional money management and is the type of arrangement recommended by many leading financial writers and experts. 

 Rather than paying sales commissions for brokers to sell you products you pay instead a reasonable annual fee, based on your account value. The fee-only advisor does not charge commissions. He/she is interested in growing your account and providing long-term service. 
Why is it better?

Northeastern Financial Consultants Inc.charges a reasonable, quarterly management fee based on the value of your account. 
The main difference between a Stockbroker and us is that they make a living by charging their clients commissions. Therefore the more the charge the more money they make. 
Stockbrokers often charge 1% - 2% per trade on stocks, and as much as 6% on mutual funds. Stockbrokers may also have hidden charges such as 12b-1 fees or surrender fees on mutual funds, surrender fees and bloated internal expenses on annuities, and heavy markups on products like unit trusts or bonds. 
On the other hand, as a fee-only advisor, our compensation is a flat percentage of your account value. We do not earn any money from commissions, trailers, or markups. We earn money only if your account grows or if we gain new clients. 
Fee-only vs. Fee-based

Do not be confused or misled! - Fee-only is definitely not the same as fee-based. Fee-based is a confusing term for a compensation structure that used to be called, "fee-plus commission." 
Fee-based usually means that you pay for a plan or other advice and then pay to buy investments with commissions or markups that go to the advisor. This can be worse than the straight commission arrangement because you may pay twice without realizing it. 
Fee-only is what leading financial writers often recommend. It is safer, more objective, and without the drag of commissions it has every reason to have performance as good or better than the fee-based or commission approaches. 
Standard Payments for Services

There are three basic ways you can pay for investment help: by the hour, by a set fee or by commissions. 
Specific advisory services such as evaluating your overall financial needs, developing a comprehensive financial plan or developing an asset allocation plan are billed on a flat fee basis. Fee-only advisors charge a set fee for services rendered and a fee, usually 1% or less, based on a percentage of the assets under management. A commissioned advisor gets paid on a per transaction basis by the companies whose products he or she sells. 
For ongoing management, the type of payment arrangement you have is important because of the issue of sales pressure. If an investment advisor is compensated solely by commissions or is affiliated with a firm that offers only it’s own proprietary investments, you’ll want to know the implications of this arrangement and get assurances that this will not influence decisions made for your account.

Financial Life Planning


FinancialLife Planning

 The Financial Life Planning Institute is dedicated to educating, training, and developing tools for financial advisors using this unique discovery process.
Financial Life Planning means not just asking the right questions but being able to engage clients in meaningful conversations about their important life events, situations, and goals. These introspective conversations, known as financial life dialogues, are central to the development of the Institute’s planning tools and training programs. Financial advisors who move from being transaction-based financial planners to Financial Life Planners develop clients for life, by helping those clients achieve the freedom to pursue their own goals, at their own pace, on their own terms. 
Financial life dialogues are centered around important life events, transitions, principles, and goals that have an impact on a client’s financial situation. These dialogues result in a strong foundation and long-lasting relationship between client and advisor. The Financial Life Planning Institute provides advisors with all the tools they need to develop stronger client relationships through:


Unique Tools: The Institute’s tools include: FLPOnline, an interactive tool that helps advisors engage clients in financial life planning with the most highly developed life planning tools available in the industry; The Practice Check-Up, a tool that helps advisors understand where their practice is and where they want it to be in order to achieve life/practice balance; and NewRetirementality.com, a free tool that helps clients get a bird’s-eye view of where they are, and where they want to be in their lives regarding retirement.




Knowledge: The Institute’s extensive resource library includes resources related to financial life planning, worksheets, life planning images advisors can integrate into their practices, workshops, advanced client dialogues, on-line courses, audio training, video training, and much more.




Coaching: The Institute is committed to helping advisors implement and integrate life planning into their practice through customized, one-on-one coaching.


By focusing clients on the four key components of their lives—history, transitions, principles, goals—advisors are able to move successfully from financial planning to financial life planning, and create clients for life.

Lynn S. Evans




Lynn S. Evans, CFP®
President and Chief Executive Officer
 
Long-time clients of Lynn S. Evans, CFP®, say it’s her unique combination of sincerity, honesty, breath of financial knowledge and expertise that enable her to guide them through the rewarding process of financial life planning. Lynn founded her company Northeastern Financial Consultants, Inc. more than twenty-five years ago so she could do business her way. That is, she takes the time not only to understand the hopes and dreams of her clients, but also to ensure they understand the financial strategies she implements on their behalf.  
 
Recently, Lynn’s focus has been on what she views as the metamorphosis of retirement where traditional stereotypes are being reexamined and exciting new opportunities await on the horizon. Viewing retirement not as a time of winding down, but gearing up for new challenges and rewards, Lynn helps her clients prepare financially — and emotionally — for this significant transition.
 
As it has from the start, Lynn’s fee-only business model ensures that there are no conflicts of interest. Quite simply, her clients’ needs come first. In fact, clients view Lynn not simply as a financial advisor, but as their partner in life’s financial journey. 
 
Passionate about educating her community on financial matters, Lynn has authored a monthly personal finance column for the Northeast PA Business Journal since 2001. What’s more, she’s a sought after public speaker on topics ranging from financial life planning, and the new retirement to estate planning. A valued source to the local and national media, she has been quoted in a variety of publications. 
 
Lynn earned her BA from Cedar Crest College in Allentown, Pennsylvania. She’s held the CFP® mark of distinction for more than 25 years. Active in her community, Lynn holds membership positions in a variety of civic organizations including the Women’s Resource Center of Scranton, which she co-founded, Cedar Crest College’s Alumnae Association, and a founder of the local chapter of the National Association of Women Business Owners (NAWBO).  She has also been granted membership in the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (NAPFA), a national group of fee-only (TM) advisors.
 
Lynn and her husband, Patrick A. di Napoli, enjoy spending family time with their son, Tyler, and boating on Lake Wallenpaupack in PA’s Pocono Mountains.

Kristofer T. Harrison, JD, CFP®
Senior Financial Advisor


With an exceptional background in law and business, Kristofer transitioned to a career in financial planning four years ago. His legal work advising start-ups, monitoring corporate issues from cash flow to compliance, and handling tax matters form a sound foundation for his current financial planning work.
 
Kristofer understands that the key to successful financial life planning for business owners is to integrate business and personal planning. His comprehensive approach takes into account everything from life, health and disability insurance programs to personal and business tax planning, as well as business transition and estate planning. Clients say the knowledge that their "big financial picture" is being managed well allows them to devote their energy to their family and business rather than worry about financial details.
 
Earlier in his career, Kristofer worked as a law clerk and associate attorney at a Center City Philadelphia law firm specializing in commercial real estate. While there, he was a key participant in effectuating an $80 million secondary public offering for a real estate investment trust (REIT) and played pivotal roles in several multi-million dollar commercial property acquisitions. Today, he works in the same detailed-oriented manner to discuss financial issues with the firm's clients and to evaluate and implement solid solutions. Bottom line, clients view Kristofer as a valued team member who helps them to simplify their finances and ensure they reach their goals.

What are analysts saying about NCI stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about NCI stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "NCI, Inc. is a leading provider of information technology services and solutions to U.S. federal government agencies. NCI's award-winning expertise encompasses areas critical to its customers' mission objectives including enterprise systems management, information assurance, network engineering, and systems development and integration.   " (5/13/2017)
2. Cowen and Company analysts commented, "NCIT offers an attractive risk/reward profile as its peer-low valuation (5.9x EV/EBITDA)." (4/10/2017)
3. FBR & Co analysts commented, "We take a neutral perspective on NCI shares for the time being, although we are encouraged by the efforts that the company is taking to position itself for success in an evolving government IT landscape. CEO Paul Dillahay was appointed in October 2016, and we believe he is taking steps to increase NCI’s ability to capture new business. Given that we estimate that this company has a very strong recompete win rate, the base upon which the team can build appears fairly stable. That being said, we think that the company has outsized dependence on a few larger contracts —like the PEO Soldier contract that we estimate accounted for 16% of revenue in 2016—and there may be a near-term sentiment overhang on the stock related to the recently disclosed alleged embezzlement by the former controller. The company does have significant capabilities in agile software development, and we believe management’s approach is inspired; there could be an opportunity to become more constructive in the future, but for the time being, we think that remaining on the sidelines would be advisable."

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for NCI (NASDAQ:NCIT) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Hold Ratings, 1 Buy RatingConsensus Rating:Hold (Score: 2.25)Consensus Price Target: $18.33 (7.99% downside)

Lynn S. Evans




Lynn S. Evans, CFP®
President and Chief Executive Officer
 
Long-time clients of Lynn S. Evans, CFP®, say it’s her unique combination of sincerity, honesty, breath of financial knowledge and expertise that enable her to guide them through the rewarding process of financial life planning. Lynn founded her company Northeastern Financial Consultants, Inc. more than twenty-five years ago so she could do business her way. That is, she takes the time not only to understand the hopes and dreams of her clients, but also to ensure they understand the financial strategies she implements on their behalf.  
 
Recently, Lynn’s focus has been on what she views as the metamorphosis of retirement where traditional stereotypes are being reexamined and exciting new opportunities await on the horizon. Viewing retirement not as a time of winding down, but gearing up for new challenges and rewards, Lynn helps her clients prepare financially — and emotionally — for this significant transition.
 
As it has from the start, Lynn’s fee-only business model ensures that there are no conflicts of interest. Quite simply, her clients’ needs come first. In fact, clients view Lynn not simply as a financial advisor, but as their partner in life’s financial journey. 
 
Passionate about educating her community on financial matters, Lynn has authored a monthly personal finance column for the Northeast PA Business Journal since 2001. What’s more, she’s a sought after public speaker on topics ranging from financial life planning, and the new retirement to estate planning. A valued source to the local and national media, she has been quoted in a variety of publications. 
 
Lynn earned her BA from Cedar Crest College in Allentown, Pennsylvania. She’s held the CFP® mark of distinction for more than 25 years. Active in her community, Lynn holds membership positions in a variety of civic organizations including the Women’s Resource Center of Scranton, which she co-founded, Cedar Crest College’s Alumnae Association, and a founder of the local chapter of the National Association of Women Business Owners (NAWBO).  She has also been granted membership in the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors (NAPFA), a national group of fee-only (TM) advisors.
 
Lynn and her husband, Patrick A. di Napoli, enjoy spending family time with their son, Tyler, and boating on Lake Wallenpaupack in PA’s Pocono Mountains.

Kristofer T. Harrison


Kristofer T. Harrison, JD, CFP®
Senior Financial Advisor


With an exceptional background in law and business, Kristofer transitioned to a career in financial planning four years ago. His legal work advising start-ups, monitoring corporate issues from cash flow to compliance, and handling tax matters form a sound foundation for his current financial planning work.
 
Kristofer understands that the key to successful financial life planning for business owners is to integrate business and personal planning. His comprehensive approach takes into account everything from life, health and disability insurance programs to personal and business tax planning, as well as business transition and estate planning. Clients say the knowledge that their "big financial picture" is being managed well allows them to devote their energy to their family and business rather than worry about financial details.
 
Earlier in his career, Kristofer worked as a law clerk and associate attorney at a Center City Philadelphia law firm specializing in commercial real estate. While there, he was a key participant in effectuating an $80 million secondary public offering for a real estate investment trust (REIT) and played pivotal roles in several multi-million dollar commercial property acquisitions. Today, he works in the same detailed-oriented manner to discuss financial issues with the firm's clients and to evaluate and implement solid solutions. Bottom line, clients view Kristofer as a valued team member who helps them to simplify their finances and ensure they reach their goals.
 
Kristofer has an MBA from the Fox School of Business at Temple University and a JD from the James E. Beasley School of Law at Temple University. He earned his undergraduate degree in sociology from Villanova University.
 
An Eagle Scout who most enjoys spending time with his family, Kristofer resides in the Back Mountain with his wife Marina and three children, Markayla, Delaney and Gavan. Interests include travel, fine dining, golf and managing his Fantasy Football team.

There's an advantage in working with a financial advisor who knows you – and your financial goals. That's what makes Edward Jones different from other investment firms. Supporting the relationship between you and your financial advisor shapes nearly every aspect of our business.
You may have seen one of our 12,000 offices in your community. That's because we believe you deserve more than a 1-800 number when it comes to your financial future.
What you may not know is that we're a Fortune 500 company with thousands of associates and sophisticated technology supporting your local financial advisor.
The Edward Jones approach in determining your goals, and developing tailored financial strategies, has been helping nearly 7 million clients for more than 90 years.
In fact, we like to think we became one of the largest financial services firms in the country by not acting that way. If you're ready to work with a different kind of investment firm—one that cares as much about why you're investing as what you invest in— you're ready to work with Edward Jones.

Focus On You

Focus On You




Every investment firm has principles. And they usually sound exactly the same. We believe Edward Jones is different in almost every way. Our principles were deliberately created with you in mind. We don't just talk about personal service. We're built to deliver it.
Your dedicated financial advisor – It's your financial future, so an 800-number or Internet search for financial advice doesn't cut it. You have a relationship with an Edward Jones financial advisor, who spends time to learn why you're investing and then develops a personalized strategy. No cookie-cutter plans here.
In your neighborhood – With more than 15,000 financial advisors, you shouldn't have to go far to find an Edward Jones office in your community. That means you can actually meet with a financial advisor to discuss what's important to you.
Tailored for individual investors - All of our resources – including investment research, online account access, easy-to-understand statements, sophisticated software and detailed reports – are developed with you in mind.
Experienced support team - Backing up this personal service is a Fortune 500 company with thousands of people and advanced technology. Your financial advisor uses these resources to develop the best strategy for you.
We spend the time and have the knowledge to help you sort through complicated financial questions. Most financial services firms claim to focus on you and your needs, but can they really do it? We believe Edward Jones is uniquely positioned from the ground up to provide the attention, respect and service you deserve.

Prepare for Your First Appointment 
Learn more



Prepare for Your First Appointment 




We're honored that you're considering working with us to help achieve your financial goals. Here are three ways you can prepare our first meeting.


Think about why you're investing
Understanding the "why" will help you be better prepared to discuss your goals and strategies to help reach them. What's important to you and your family? What do you want to achieve?


Gather your statements
If you've worked with a financial advisor before, it's helpful to know about your current investments and your experience to date. If you're new to the investing world, we promise to talk with you, not at you. Our goal is to empower you with the knowledge you'll need to pursue your goals.


Bring your questions
We want to make sure to answer any investment questions you may have, as well as how we can best work together. What do you expect? How often do you want to touch base?

Invested in the Community






We are invested in our community
We value the communities where we work, so we're committed to giving back. You'll find our associates serving clients in our offices, but you'll also find us investing our time and talents to support local organizations and great causes. Many Financial Advisors are on Chambers of Commerce and serve as board members and event coordinators for local organizations, and our associates volunteer, donate and support a variety of charitable organizations.







Tour De Ted
Each year, branch and Home Office associates take to the road to raise funds for cancer research for the firm's annual Tour de Ted. In memory of Ted Jones, former managing partner who died from cancer, the first Tour de Ted showcased the firm's community-oriented culture while paying tribute to the history of Edward Jones. Volunteers rode the path of the original "wire" that connected Pueblo, Colo., to St. Louis, Mo., which created our branch network.







Emergency Assistance
Sixteen Financial Advisors in Texas decided to set aside one day out of their busy schedules to give back to their community. They volunteered at the Montgomery County Emergency Assistance facility by painting offices and hallways, and sorting and tagging clothes.







School Supply Drive
Eight local Edward Jones Financial Advisors teamed up on behalf of school children, clearly demonstrating their commitment to family values. Their school supply drive brought in hundreds of classroom necessities, from notebooks and markers to tissues and cleaning wipes.







Habitat for Humanity
When investors wanted to save for a new home, Edward Jones was there to help. Associates from Ontario, Canada, helped a local family reach its goal of home ownership in another way when they came together for the Habitat for Humanity build in Amherstburg, Ont., the first such home built in this community.







Pedal the Cause
We're proud of our associates who joined the fight against cancer as Edward Jones Pedal the Cause riders. More than 200 bike riders from across the U.S. took to the streets (and the Katy Trail) to help fundraise for cancer research.







Walk to End Alzheimer's®
At Edward Jones, we live and work in the communities we serve. We want to make a difference in people’s lives, both in and out of the office. Alzheimer’s disease has a significant impact on individuals, family, friends and community. That’s why we’ve chosen to partner with the Alzheimer’s Association as the National Presenting Sponsor of the Walk to End Alzheimer’s®. We invite you to join us in the fight to end this terrible disease.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
