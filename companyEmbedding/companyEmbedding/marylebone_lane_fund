A single portfolio, with three main components.
 






We approach the markets from the perspective of investors, not mere allocators. At a time when it is fashionable to offer a variety of products, we manage money according to a single philosophy. This means we are more likely to do it well.
Above all, we believe in the power of combining both internal and external elements to create a portfolio more attractive than its constituent parts.
In our flagship vehicle, The Marylebone Lane Fund, we manage a single portfolio with three main components. It is the way in which they interact that differentiates our approach from others.
By combining external managers with direct (internally managed) investments across these strategies, we can produce an outcome that is greater than its constituent parts.

External MANAGER SKILL, in a variety of formats, all fundamental in nature
THEMES that capture attractive risk premia over the medium term, in a pure and cost-effective way
DIRECT EQUITIES, sourced through our personal networks
Periodically, we may employ liquid OVERLAYS, both to reduce risk and enhance returns
