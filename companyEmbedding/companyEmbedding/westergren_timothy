Born
Timothy Brooks Westergren
(1965-12-21) December 21, 1965 (age 51)
Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S.


Occupation
Co-founder of Pandora Radio


Timothy Brooks "Tim" Westergren (born December 21, 1965 in Minneapolis), is a co-founder of Pandora Radio.[1]
Biography[edit]
Westergren was born in 1965 in Minneapolis. He attended boarding school, Cranbrook Kingswood, during his high school years. He graduated from Stanford University with a B.A. in political science.[2] Following his graduation, Westergren spent twenty years working as a record producer and composer (working as a nanny in between jobs), devoting the majority of his time to emerging artists and independent labels.
In 1999 he started Pandora Media along with two co-founders: Will Glaser and Jon Kraft. The Oakland, Calif., company went public in 2011,[3] reporting $138 million in revenue that fiscal year.
As an early project, Westergren and Glaser created the Music Genome Project, a mathematical algorithm to organize music.[1] As the company's chief strategy officer, Westergren spends the majority of his time traveling the nation and gathering feedback from Pandora Radio users. In 2010 he was listed by Time magazine as one among the 100 most influential people in the world.[4]
In April 2016, Pandora Media announced that Tim Westergren would replace Brian McAndrews as CEO. He had previously served as CEO and president from May 2002 to July 2004.[5]
In June 2017, he announced that he is going to step down as CEO.[6]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

The future of live music has arrived Pandora News Ticketfly Tim Westergren 

 by Tim Westergren on October 7, 2015			




Years ago, my band played a show in Los Angeles. It was a prestigious club and it was big deal for us. As is often the case with these shows, we had to guarantee a certain number of people. We knew it would be tight because we hadn’t played L.A. enough to build a local audience, and our local mailing list (as in “postal” mailing list) was pretty small, but we put the word out to everyone we knew and crossed our fingers.
When the time came for us to go on, the sound man stopped us on our way to the stage. He told us we were just short of the audience guarantee (I think it was 150 people) and the manager was pulling us. It was a humiliating moment. We had driven 400 miles, brought a bunch of fans, and now we were being told we couldn’t play.
That moment captured for me the awful challenge that working musicians face. You lug a truck full of equipment thousands of miles a week, sleep on floors, spend hours rehearsing and setting up, and then you sweat attendance every night. The difference between 100 and 300 people at a show is the difference between a slow death and sustainability.
Today marks the day when that starts to change. That era is over.
Today, we shared the news that we are buying Ticketfly – the country’s largest, most-beloved and fastest-growing independent ticketing and digital marketing platform for live events. Last year they sold over 16 million tickets to more than 90,000 events. We’re combining forces to create the world’s most efficient platform for connecting listeners with live shows from their favorite bands. …Read More 




Pandora – 10 years and beyond 10 Year Milestones Tim Westergren 

 by Tim Westergren on September 5, 2015			



We’ve crossed the ten-year mark at Pandora. It has been a long and winding road, but never have I been more excited about the future. We’re on the cusp of a massive transformation in the way music is discovered and distributed and everything we’ve done has put us in a position to be the force behind that change.
When we analysed “Dancing Queen” by Abba (the very first song in the Music Genome Project) we had no idea what lay ahead. We were too naïve to realise just how absurd our idea was. It took about 30 minutes to analyse that single track. We listened multiple times to capture every detail of the recording. Close to 200 attributes were notated using pen and paper, then double-checked by a second music analyst before being transcribed into an Excel spreadsheet. Who knew that this intensive, detailed, manual process would become the foundation for personalised radio. …Read More

50 Billion Thumbs! Milestones Tim Westergren 

 by Nicole McInnes on January 29, 2015			



Just a few years ago, Jason Derulo stopped by our offices to celebrate receiving the 10 billionth thumb on Pandora. Today, I am proud to share that we have passed 50 billion thumbs. 50 billion. That’s roughly seven thumbs for every person on Earth.
As milestones go, this one is particularly meaningful. Our entire mission is to give listeners the ability to personalize their experience. Thumbs give each listener the power to make Pandora personal to them. Every thumb up and thumb down has not only made your stations better, but helped us make better song choices for every listener. This is a serious group effort – so, thanks!
As you can imagine, it took a lot of songs to hit 50 billion thumbs. While we can’t share every single one, we did want to highlight some of the more momentous thumb recipients along the way.

Before Pandora hit it big, the music streaming company went through some tough times. 
Tim Westergren, the Pandora co-founder, survived on maxed-out credit cards and sheer willpower. 
Westergren recounted tales of those early, “not glamorous” days during a talk at today’s Hustle Con event in San Francisco.
The cash crunch: 
In the run up to its 2004 Series B funding Pandora was running on financial fumes. Pandora wasn’t able to pay its employees for an astounding two years between 2002 to 2004 while it worked on producing a viable commercial product. Not paying full-time employees is very, very illegal in California, where Pandora is based.
“We had no idea we were breaking the law," Westergren said.
Over that period, Pandora accumulated $2 million in back wages owed. Westergren himself ran up a $500,000 debt on "maxed-out cards" while he paid bills and as many salaries as he could afford. 
He paid a little at a time in the order they were due, an experience he describes as like "playing Tetris" with his finances, which he "[doesn't] recommend." 
Two employees sued for back wages. And Pandora's original model of licensing out its Internet music recommendation engine to retailers and labels wasn't working out. 
But Westergren, a musician by training who had little to fall back on if he defaulted on the debts, managed to keep most of the team together. To keep employees motivated, he gave speeches upon speeches, encouraging them that the potential market was huge, and so was Pandora's potential impact on music and culture. 
Somehow — Westergren says he's not sure how — the company was able to close a $9 million round of funding in 2004, when money was much harder to come by than it is today. 
Westergren called an all-hands meeting for everybody in Pandora that same day. Everybody was expecting another stirring speech, he says. Instead, he pulled a stack of envelopes from his back pocket and paid out the $2 million among the 50 employees right then and there. 
"Everybody thought it was a bad joke, like it would bounce or something," Westergren says.
The Beatles - Bee Gees connection: 
There was another scary moment earlier in Pandora’s life, shortly before the dot-com bubble burst in 2000, Westergren said. 
Pandora founders Will Glaser, Jon Kraft, and Westergren had spent the last year and a lot of money on their so-called Music Genome Project, an algorithm that would predict what music listeners would want based on suggestions you put in.
Now it was ready for its first test. 
The founders put in a song by the Beatles.
"Four or five minutes later," he says, it returned with a song by the Bee Gees — a pop group that couldn't be further from the Fab Four. 
"We were like, 'oh f***," Westergren said. 
But on further investigation, it turned out it was an early song by the Bee Gees, from when they were a "clone" of the Beatles, Westergren said. It worked, just in mysterious ways.
"We went from despair to elation in a very short period of time," Westergren said.
Nowadays, Pandora is a publically-traded company since 2011, and Westergren himself is building a massive vacation home.

The Music Genome Project was first conceived by Will Glaser and Tim Westergren in late 1999. In January 2000, they joined forces with Jon Kraft to found Savage Beast Technologies to bring their idea to market.[1] The Music Genome Project is an effort to "capture the essence of music at the most fundamental level" using over 450 attributes to describe songs and a complex mathematical algorithm to organize them. The Music Genome Project is currently made up of 5 sub-genomes: Pop/Rock, Hip-Hop/Electronica, Jazz, World Music, and Classical. Under the direction of Nolan Gasser and a team of musicological experts, the initial attributes were later refined and extended.
A given song is represented by a vector containing values for approximately 450 "genes" (analogous to trait-determining genes for organisms in the field of genetics). Each gene corresponds to a characteristic of the music, for example, gender of lead vocalist, prevalent use of groove, level of distortion on the electric guitar, type of background vocals, etc. Rock and pop songs have 150 genes, rap songs have 350, and jazz songs have approximately 400. Other genres of music, such as world and classical music, have 300–450[2] genes. The system depends on a sufficient number of genes to render useful results. Each gene is assigned a number between 0 and 5, in half-integer increments.[3] The Music Genome Project's database is built using a methodology that includes the use of precisely defined terminology, a consistent frame of reference, redundant analysis, and ongoing quality control to ensure that data integrity remains reliably high.[2]
Given the vector of one or more songs, a list of other similar songs is constructed using what the company calls its "matching algorithm". Each song is analyzed by a musician in a process that takes 20 to 30 minutes per song.[4] Ten percent of songs are analyzed by more than one musician to ensure conformity with the in-house standards and statistical reliability.
The Music Genome Project was developed in its entirety by Pandora Media and remains the core technology used to program its online radio stations in response to its users' desires. Although there was a time when the company licensed this technology for use by others, today they limit its use for just their own users.
Because of licensing restrictions, Pandora is available only to users whose location is reported to be in the USA, Australia or New Zealand[5] by Pandora's geolocation software.[6]

Timothy Westergren
Thanks, Palmera. So, that song was, Come A Little Closer by Cage The Elephant, which was the first song ever replayed on Pandora, it seems appropriate for today. That band has two and a half million unique listeners, so that added their station to Pandora, and in just last weekend we've got 5,000 new listeners at a station, which is more than the Instagram followers, Facebook likers, Twitter followers and YouTube subscribers combined. So, in just one week they've added a large audience on Pandora. That was the pretty impressive information.
So, I'll reiterate that Palmera's thanks for probably out time and this is earnings week, we knew it's a busy week for everyone and we're asking a lot as you come and take time with us. But even so we thought it was really important for us to set us by the time, as we, as the company goes through a pretty profound transformation, both in product and in our business to really kind of open the kimono for you all, talk about the opportunity, how we're going to tackle it and really dive in deep on the business model. So we hope that this will be an informative day for you and have plenty of time for questions at the end. So, thanks again for taking the time today, we really appreciate it.
So, just like a quick recap of Pandora, 17 years ago we created something brand new never been done before, the first taxonomical approach of music recommendation, the music genome prospect, which was our hand built database manually detailing musical and logical information about songs that really was the most precise and continues to be the most precise and continues to be the most precise way to connect music. It requires an immense investment, we spent about five years investing in that product, refining algorithms, perfecting the music analysis, and really developing a very robust methodology for recommending songs.

Most notably, Genome is the only form of music recommendation that is blind, it's a popularity. So, you recommend songs based on how they sound, that mix Pandora uniquely positioned for music discovery, which I think you'll see today, and ongoing the big part of sort of theme that Pandora that I think makes it very attractive and enduring service for listeners.
We spent five years building that technology, and then finally launched our consumer-facing products in the fall 2005, Pandora.com. It was claim to say Pandora.com now. But it just took off like a rocket shift from the day we launched it, a thousands of people from day one, within a weeks, tens of thousands, and without barely a diamond marketing, we reached a couple of hundred million registered listeners in the U.S., alone, really all by word of mouth.
And I think the reason that Pandora grew so fast as pretty simple, although it's a very complex problem solved. We offer for the first time a service that was deeply and precisely personalized, it was also easy to use. That combination of easy to use and personalized is phenomenally hard. Easy had existed before, broadcast radio, hit a button, music comes out. Personalized has existed before, I think for CD collection, MP3 collection, growing subscription services that give you kind of ubiquitous access to massive catalogue, you can write manually create your experience, you could think about is very, very, totally personalized, but very time consuming, difficult to use, and we really think not, but consumer ultimately want.
Pandora puts us together, one song, one artist, and we delivered immediately a listening experience that combine music that you knew and loved and also played songs you never heard before, and it worked and they grew entirely by word of mouth. We were accelerated of course by the smartphone revolution that struck in the summer of 2007, we rode that ways from phones into connected devices until the service grew to be a gigantic service of today.
During that time, we brought equal focus to monetization and that become world class, I think, best in the world and making money off of audio streams, again a fantastically difficult task. We've invested in enormous technology stack to do that. And in recruiting, training and deploying hundreds of sellers, both digital sellers and broadcast alumnis that have come over from MSN side to help us tackle in the local market. So, we have really perfected and invested in that, the product and the monetization piece of the company over the last 11 years since we launched Pandora.
So, where does that put us today? Pandora is a gigantic service, just shy of 80 million listeners come to Pandora every month. They listen on average of 22 hours per month. That per month number is growing year-on-year, continues to grow relentlessly as we keep refining the product, investing in new distribution platforms. We're now available on over 1,800 devices of course that began with the smartphones, but we're talking about connected Blu-Ray Players, TVs, connected set-top devices and wearables.
Refrigerators now come with Pandora as apparently a hot tub that has Pandora embedded on. So, if you're in the market for a hot tub, look for the Pandora piece, and new devices coming out every day, the Amazon Echo, great platform for us, we're seeing very heavy usage on that, the Google Home device and we're constantly looking for these additional distribution platforms.
Under 90 car models, which means pretty much every major car manufacturer coming off the line, has an embedded Pandora functionality, it's a very fast growing category for us. And last but not least, we are now one among a very small number of online media companies that crossed very small number of online media companies that cross the $1 billion annual average advertising revenue threshold and that core business is profitable. For the ad-supported radio products that have been Pandora's main stay until today is a profitable ad-supported business. So I think it's a really tremendous accomplishment.

To put some context around that, we now represent just shy of 10% of all radio listening in United States, that makes us the largest radio station in every major market. In some cases a substantially larger in the local broadcast station that gives us a great opportunity to leverage local advertising dollars and I think you know, fastest growing part of our revenue is that in the local ad sales domain. And as we look at this pie chart on the left, that big light blue three quarters of the pie broadcast radio, we see that is eminently reachable. We're going after those hours and as we penetrate cars and the home, we think that broadcast is deeply vulnerable to what we think is a far superior product, personalized radio service. So we see in that a huge unexplored opportunity that we are really attacking. And in online streaming, Pandora is category king. 55% of all streaming online is on Pandora.
The story on mobile is no less impressive. We are by far the leading mobile engagement, far even with – in Facebook, and I think perhaps sort of most impressively at any given moment in time, there are more people streaming on Pandora than every other streaming service combined. So this an enormous platform of having engaged listeners that we built in the last 11 years.
So what's next for us. So couple of years ago, we began to seeing signals from our listeners that they wanted something more from Pandora. So they were enjoying the regular product, creating stations, personalizing it in a more lean back mode, engaging when they want to sort of protect the station, but we saw them kind of bumping into things they want that we can offer. For example, we're playing a song and we saw that how they use the product and their behavior on the product, we also heard from them very directly. We typically get between 80,000 and 100,000 emails a month from Pandora listeners, many of them with feature requests.
People are bumping into skip limits, they're losing connectivity and going offline that with the frustration for folks, and we began to sort of feel something of a ground saw from listeners about additional functionality like for Pandora to deliver.
So, we sat down and really went through a pretty comprehensive strategic review process at Pandora to figure out, should we adopt, is there a way for us to in an economically positive way to address this need. And after a lot of research and really kind of studying this, we came to the conclusion, there was a resounding aspect. There was an opportunity for us to really go after this and make Pandora the one service, the only music service you would ever need, whether you're a lean back listeners or somebody wants it much more interactive, that we could be that solution for you, so you wouldn't have to go someplace else.
One of the things that we've seen over the years of increasing permanent security among listeners, that are using more than one service and we have very compelling data about listeners on Pandora that are also using other services, including on-demand products.
So, the kind of the signs however there for us and a question was, can we make a great business out of it. And can we address that well from a product standpoint. So, there are really two main pillars to attacking the strategies at the product side and there is a licensing, but as key parts of delivering on that idea.
Renew the licensing, but has to really wait until the end of 2015, which is when the Copyright Royalty Board will set its decision on the non-interactive radio streaming rate, that would form the benchmark for any kind of direct deal licensing that we would undergo following that. So, in waiting for that, we've attacked the product, we made a handful of very key acquisitions, we purchased among them audio, what we view is the leading from a product standpoint, the leading subscription product out there, Crawford Jack team of engineers, we bought them for a very reasonable price for just less than 100 engineers in the Pandora that team formed a nucleus of the product team at Pandora that has been gone after billion subscription products that are beginning to see surface now. It's a tremendous team, virtually every engineer has stage, that we started create a lot of instant momentum and allowed us to build these products very, very quickly.

We purchased Next Big Sound, leading music data company that we've woven now to the fabric of Pandora to use across the company, and we bought Ticketfly, a mid-market ticket SaaS company, they're the leader in delivering ticketing solutions for middle-tier clubs and that business has seen it's been that explodes since becoming part of Pandora.
We put the pieces in place from a product standpoint, and then began seriously developing that product. Coming to end of the year, we engaged directly with the labels on the right side, second big pillar. And as you all know, recently we're very pleased to announce that we've reached a direct deal agreements with every major label pretty much all of the independent and close to 4,000 publishers, giving us the right to really build the product that we have imagined. When Chris and his team put pen to paper to figure out what's the product we want to offer, there was essentially kind of a menu of features they wanted to offer and we probably get those rights, and we got them all. And we got them, I want to note in a very, very short period of time.
For anybody here that's been involved in music licensing, you all know that six months or seven months is possibly quick to do a deal at this complexity, this is not a cookie cutter deal, we did want product come before us, we don't think that's the right solution, and it happens fast and the reason it happen quickly I think it's very clear, I think the music and if you sound Pandora, a potential ala, like really a partner that can grow the industry, not another substitutional product trying to take share, but actually a company that could open up new revenue streams for them.
I think then in particular, the first company that might unlock subscriptions for the mass consumer, which I think has been an uncapped or unopened opportunity for many, many years. And yes, the deals were – negotiations were tough at times, they were fundamentally collaborative. And I would say that if you ask anything on that side of table how they feel now, I think they'd all say, their echo what we say, which is the truly a win-win agreement.
We have exited these negotiations as partners, and it's already showing up and how are working together as this product launch. So, very quick negotiation and the really two things they accomplished in this deal, and they're both very important to understand. The first is we got the ability to offer additional tiers of products with greater interactivity, substantially greater interactivity, really new products of Pandora can – in a way that not been done before, but equally importantly, we're able to enhance the core product. So, we have a massive ad-supported business, and there are handful of features that we know listeners really wanted us to add to that product. We are able to get those as well.
So, we enhanced our core ad-supported business and opened up new opportunities for the product with the Plus – and full on-demand here, we feel very good about this. So, what is it look like from a product portfolio, what's the lineup at Pandora. There are three thesis to this, with that said, the ad-supported product will continue on strong with two added capabilities, the ability to replay and add more skips by watching a video add.
So, this was two things I want it solved the two biggest consumer issues of Pandora, I believe that the most frequent complaints of Pandora, but things that are sending people off of Pandora and elsewhere and it brings with that incremental revenue opportunity. So these are high value, high viewable video ads on Pandora, that becomes harder for our existing ad sales team to sell. And as Mike will walk you later on, very, very modest videos sell through, one ad every 10 hours covers the much small incremental licensing fees that we have to pay for this incremental functionality.

So, we think we brought great new expanding capability at a reasonable cost and opened up a very accretive revenue stream. So that's kind of a one leg of a stool. Then Pandora Plus is a second piece. Again our fundamentally radio-based product and experience built around radio but now at just $5 a month and its unlimited skips, unlimited replays and offline listening on Pandora and no advertising. And we think in the offline space, we have again invented a very, a really genius way of allowing someone to keep listening to Pandora when they go offline is completely effortless. It just happens on Pandora.
The majority of the interactions are already going offline are happening with us. Any listener interactions just happens like magic on Pandora. I think a really brilliant engineering solution and we're going to bring many more of those to the product. Again the $5 price points is very – I think a very strong value proposition. That now was made put in the hands seamlessly to the existing subscribers of Pandora launch. So, just one day recently their product has got a lot better at the same price, Pandora Plus.
And announcing for the first time today the third leg of stool Pandora Premium, we're going to unveil that on December 6, at an event in New York City. We hope to see a lot of you guys there. Half of you won't have to travel the next time. Pandora Premium is essentially the full interactive on demand service. Again it will be – radio will be at its core, the notion of listening, continuous listening will be at the center of this product. It will have all the features of Plus, so the rewinding, skipping, offline et cetera, but it will now include the ability to search and play, the ability to build and share playlists, taking everything offline and many, many more Pandora features that we can't reveal now for competitive purposes, but I think we'll bring a unique flavor to how this product services for the consumer. We're going to reinvent the interactive experience just the same way we invented online personalized radio.
So, it's a three legged tool for Pandora. And I think you'll see these products are all nicely are very well related. They create a great upsell path for us and for our existing user base. That was built intentionally to be a [ph] stereo set for listeners, I want to talk about that pathway today in great detail.
So, I think we have the right product that will address the full demand curve. But on top of that, we think that Pandora brings three distinctive massive strategic advantages to win in a go-to-market with these products. And again, part of the rationale for us, a big part of the rationale for entering this space in the first place is we felt that we were not going to come into this through the same door that other companies are coming through. Not a me too product and definitely not a me too go-to-market strategy. Pandora has a different way to enter this market, I think is very compelling.
The first of those advantages of course is our existing audience. So, we have again close to a 100 million listeners on Pandora every three months. 22 hours a month of listening, highly, highly engaged listeners. We can talk to our listeners for free on our platform in the very personalized targeted way in different kinds of modes and in context of their Pandora listening. So, a fertile ground for upselling.
The second is the level of data we know about listeners. There is no one who has this level of precise preference information about music consumers of Pandora. I starts with the music side, so we understand what people like, at a musical logical levels starting with the Music Genome Project, but supplemented by this treasure trove of some data, something up and some down that we've been accumulating over the years over $75 billion signals from our listeners which is very, very strong preference and indication as well as station creation, they help us form a very strong musical logical profile for its listener.

On top of that and I think equally importantly in this rule of up selling we have very strong behavioral information. So we know how people listen to Pandora where, what are their pain points, do they hit the skip limit a lot but they go offline a lot, they seem to have an appetite for on demand based on how they search and use Pandora, one of the frustrations that we sort to see emerging implicitly from their behavior. We know that for every listener, again very strong signals for us to think about who we think is a candidate for up selling into these new tiers and then demographic data of course. Our Pandora is in a largest logged end user basis on the planet, but not just ridged data, but a far more detail profile listeners that we do through the connection with broad data basis which again as in the foundation for our ad business. So we develop its expertise at profiling, understanding listeners, and we bring that into this new business. And then finally less but not least in the technical side in terms of technology they're two areas that had become we've become world class, I would say best in the world. The first again its personalization, like how to help someone, how to pick that what song to play next and it meant not of intellectual property and data Pandora has accumulated to make us the best at this. And equally in the course of the last 11 years we've developed the ability to really know how and what non-music content to put and when in front of listeners.
So, how to interrupt this listening experience with other content. That maximizes the value of that content with minimal impact on the listener. So, maximizing retention, maximizing special links, but also maximizing the value of that insertion, interruptive articles, and then we built a whole infrastructure inside Pandora that we call Chronos, which is a whole software layer, call that's a great brain inside Pandora that chooses those adds in a targeted way.
And incrementally over time, that system has enabled to increase add load and increase listening. So, increased RPMs and increased listening became more and more efficient out way to place adds. That capability maps beautifully onto a world, we're looking to be up-selling people into new capabilities. So, we're once – we were that Chronos, the system was just picking between one audio add in another. Now, it's going to be tweaking between that or up-sell to Pandora Plus, or the Pandora Premium, or an artist audio message, or targeted recommendation for a local concert.
And as a broader portfolio of things that picks from, but it brings that same fundamental discipline of being really good at picking up those in there to minimally affect our listening experience. So, again, interrupt of the advertisings Pandora expertise.
You put this all together with these products, and there are two things that Pandora can do, excuse me. It's sets us up capture, we think a substantial share of just fast growing, market for on demand. We are really well-positioned to do this. We bring great advantage to this space. Those advantages are differentiated product, massive user scale. This level of rich data, and that drives a compelling business model for Pandora.
We're going to talk through in detail about unit economics, how we control, how we retain price discipline, our customer acquisition cost, Pandora is just perfectly positioned to do this.
So, we're going to walk through the product today, both what we've been building and Pandora Plus, and some hints that was for the future, and then that'll be followed by a detailed look into the business model. So, Chris Phillips our new Head of Products was couple of years in. A fantastic new leader for us who came over from Amazon, he has brought a real sort of fire in the belly, and we've doubled our engineering team in just under his tenure, and I think we're seeing the fruits of that with the rapid growth of innovation velocity at Pandora. So, let's welcome to Chris Phillips.

[Video presentation]
Christopher W. Phillips
All right. I don't know what, my blood boiling more from coming on to boiling buying by logic for that new brand video. What do you guys think about the new brand assets. You've clearly seen them coming into building, we had it everywhere and it's really a testament of signal of what's changing at Pandora. And I'm really proud that our in house design team led by [indiscernible] who worked really hard to bring that together and bring it to life. It's bold, it's vibrant, it puts the music in front and this is that key give the window directly into the music. So really excited about that.
So I appreciate the opportunity to speak with all of you. My section today I'm really going to focus on three things. What I'd like first off to cover is Evidence. Share with you, what we've been building, how it's doing, how it's impacting our listeners in growth. So this is all about highlighting that innovation.
The second thing I want to talk about is, a month ago we talked to you about releasing Pandora Plus and Tim talked about its features and new additions to our ad supported Pandora. I'm going to share with you how that's going. Some early look at the data that shows progress.
And then the third thing I'm going to talk about is give you a sneak peek at what how we're thinking about our Premium offering and as we've prepare for the unveil coming in December.
So before I go into that though, I do want to give a shout out to our new CMO, Nick Bartle is right over here, the new Chief Margin Officer. Very excited to welcome Nick. I am absolutely thrilled that we have a great partnership now with our CTO, Chris Martin, and myself and Nick in how we define, build, and bring all these products to market to drive huge adoption and growth. So we have a great team, a great executive team led by Tim and everyone else so, really pumped.
Okay. Let's jump in. I want to first start by talking about the relevance of Pandora. And our listener base as you know by the numbers is huge. But what's important to understand is that 53% of our listeners, our active listeners are under 34 years old, 23% are under 24 years old. So we have a vibrant audience of younger demo and while we're building products that are resonated and landing with all of our listeners and we would hope to serve hundreds of millions of listeners, we are really proud that the new things that I'm going to be sharing with you are landing, working and being adopted and used and over-indexing for our younger demographic. And what's really exciting also is that, this October, October 2016 will be our biggest, largest month ever. When we think about active in hours, we're pacing for our biggest October and that's fueled by the growth that we're seeing from September and October, so much so that even in our largest growth periods in 2012, our 2012 compared to our 2012 and October – or 2016 now will be bigger. So that's a huge signal that things are changing and we're driving growth back into the business. Let's give you some examples about additional data points.
And this one, I'm particularly proud of. When you work in product and technology, the most important thing is that when you bring a new product to market, a new innovation, that it gets used, that people care, that they adopt it. And 43% of our listeners, 35 million people are engaging in the new products that I'm going to showcase here for you. That's an amazing stat, especially considering these new products have just been coming out over the last nine months to 12 months. That's a big deal. And not only are they trying these new products, but they're actually spending more time on Pandora, it's driving deeper engagement. And that's really valuable because we want to be stickier and sticker.

We collect 1 billion data points a day, actually more than 1 billion data points a day on our listeners. And so this engagement gives us all kinds of advantages, not just to monetize and create a business, but also continue the depth in what we can offer our listeners. And we're monetizing. We've seen a 5% increase in our ad capacity due to this hour's growth, due to the growth we're seeing in our listener base and that's exciting.
Just in August, year-over-year, we saw a 10% increase and now a lot of that was driven for our audio ads. So it's very exciting time, not just in delivering new products but also in our ability to monetize that going forward.
So let's go through some examples. How many of you have used Thumbprint Radio? All right. I see some hands are not up, I'm glad to see a lot of you have. Clearly, many people are adopting, using it with 22 million people using this new station. It's an amazing personal journey through your listening. I was listening to my Thumbprint Radio the other day, and it took me from Foo Fighters, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden and then rolled me into Hippie Sabatoge, ODESZA, Marian Hill and then back into Drake & Future and GEZ, what other station does that so elegantly? Not just putting a list of songs in front of you for you to cherry pick, but actually weaving you through a seamless experience with music you love and winding in new discoveries.
This station is driving incremental hours of listening, has improved days active on our platform, it's a huge win for us and it's driven by our deep knowledge of personalization and discovery about for each individual person.
So we're really proud of this offering and over $5 million of these $22 million, that have come back to Pandora, after they had slowed down or stopped using Pandora. So we're recapturing audience with innovations like this. That's a very important note when you think about, how we pull our 100 million listeners into monthly and how we capture the hearts and minds of brand new listeners or people that are coming on.
This station also over indexes for under 24 listeners. Another example is podcast. How many of you guys have heard of Serial, This American Life, been around for a while. And who knew if a podcast would work on Pandora. We had never done it before. This was a new thing for our listener base and for our platform. And we said, well, if we're going to give it a shot, let's go after one of the most popular podcasts on the planet and with Serial, which was by the number of the most popular by downloads podcast.
And This American Life has been around for 20 years; and digitally, I think for over 10 years, hugely successful podcast. So we worked with the team and we stood these up on Pandora, and we've been thrilled by the success, 11 million and growing listeners are engaging with podcast on Pandora. And again, a million of them had actually slowed or stopped using Pandora and this brought them back in.
So a new content form that's helping invigorate growth, more deeper growth with our existing base and bringing people back in. And our fantastic advertising sales team had been working to bring new forms of sponsorship and monetization to this new content form, so it's very exciting and I think you should be looking for more of this as we go forward.
The next one I'll highlight is our ongoing continued growth in automotive in the connected device space. We continue to grow the investment we made in Ubiquity is working and it continues to work. I saw a Honda ad, I think, literally a couple days ago, featuring Pandora. So we're so proud of what we've been able to do in the cars, but we are far from done. There is still so much growth to drive out of it, but with 62% increase year-over-year in listening hours or hours in active and 24% growth in CE – in connected devices, we see a lot of opportunity to keep going further.

We've even found that some of the devices that are offered by companies that have competing services are some of our fastest growing areas of listeners. And we're finding that we're growing new listeners on those platforms. So again, it goes back to the fact that Pandora works. It works beautifully on these products and the ease, the personalization is a key factor in that. So keep an eye out for more.
There's a whole slew of things that I could take all day talking about all the new innovation happening and we are more rapidly growing and building new offerings than ever before. And some more that I want to highlight for you are around programming. So the computational programming that you'll see here is our scientists and our product folks worked very hard to continually refine the algorithm, the personalization, the insight to keep optimizing the music on Pandora. This touches 100% of our listeners. So the service is constantly getting better and it's driven real growth that we measure by having small hold out to compare. We measure that hold out for up to a year in order to prove that we really are driving real growth.
We introduced a new music station and we hadn't had a dedicated place for new artists only or new music only on Pandora. And what we did is we have kind of a different twist on this. This invention came out of our Curation team, where we have really skilled, fantastically smart, curators who actually are leading each of these stations. So if you want to go to a new pop or a new hip hop or new alternative, our curators are actually each week and they do a mini hosted version where they'll introduce new artists, new songs, you can check out and you can listen to new music only.
So if you want to be cool with your friend, you want to be hit, check these out and you can see the latest that's happening and these are personalized, every other service will just give you a bucket of new music. We actually know that there is that one popstar that makes you nuts and we can drop that out, no one else is doing that. Questlove Supreme, very excited about what we've done with introducing this brand new program, again new content program different format. So Questlove, Ahmir Thompson is a – just a phenomenal musician, artist, thought leader in the space of music, fell in love absolutely with Pandora after spending time with Tim, and seen how we analyze the guts of every song, identify that we're doing this – Pandora's doing this differently and wanted to partner with us.
And we're so thrilled by this new program. Again, we didn't know how it performed, but after literally the first month, we have over 3 million people who have added the station and the engagement that continues to grow. The program is a three-hour live show where he brings on stars and other musicians and they talk about music, they go deep, hit their spin tracks and then the program will roll over for a few days and then it goes into a mix state that Questlove curates every single week of songs. You haven't checked it out, you really need to.
It's a great exploration through music and it's just a new format for us on Pandora and we're really excited about that and our ability to monetize that and bring in new sponsor that want to be connected to that audience. And again, bringing people into Pandora that otherwise might not have been on the platform.
Live streaming. We continue to bring the live concert into your ears while at home. So if you weren't able to make it in show that was happen in Minneapolis in August, I happen to be directly field watching Pro Jam live at that same time. So you could actually listen on your phone and stream it live. So we expand the audience for artist to actually get more people to their show than otherwise could be there.

And then with that show particular, we are able to play the show for multiple days afterwards. And so, even though I missed it that night when it was happening, I was able to check it out the next day. So, it's very exciting what's happening there and we're growing listeners.
And even more music experiences and more partnerships. Anybody used Pandora in an Uber ride, lately, all right, so we have really – this new partnership is pretty exciting and we did it differently and by the way, it's working, it's has become the fifth largest auto platform for us. Now, it's a different kind of auto platform, because it's not your car, but it's listening in the car.
And what we did, because we weren't the first to market on it, but we did it differently. We did in a way that works, in a way that's being used. We started with the drivers. We got the drivers engaged. Their connection in the car and the music playing through their driver app was going through the speakers. Seems like an obvious thing. We focused on that first. That got the attraction and then started to open it up for listeners. So, in the rider app, if you pull up and your driver is listening to Pandora, you'll see not just the kind of power in the face, but what they're listening to on Pandora and you can continue jamming or flip it over to your station, or you can just start listening to Pandora on the stations you love, while you are on your ride.
And we are very excited the rapid growth we're seeing, again building it and launching it in a way that gets adoption and traction and it's an ad-supported solution. We didn't lock this up behind a pay wall.
Ticket discovery. Tim mentioned earlier our acquisition of Ticketfly. We spent time studying our ability to sell tickets. Are people paying attention on Pandora? Can I really offer them a ticket and they'll buy? The answer is yes. So, what we are doing is we crossed our first phase of the integration with Ticketfly and successfully taken their ticket inventory and actually are surfacing it to our listeners, based on their listening preferences and their [indiscernible] songs and their location. So we've introduced [indiscernible] into our mobile app, which also has advertising benefits, but we know where you are. So when I dropped into New York, even though I live in Berkeley, I can actually get notifications of who's playing that I like, while I'm in town or coming soon.
So, that's a really special experience and we're proud that tens of millions of listeners are starting to get that discovery point and it's growing. So, we'll have more to share on that later. Again, lot of very exciting innovation happening. Tim mentioned intelligent interruptions and he used our co-term kronas which I am like, don't say internal tech term, but sure you guys can handle it.
And so, kronas which is our code name but it's way to do intelligent interruption is a pretty special piece of code, it's really a tool for us, it's a tool for us to optimize the right time to talk to a listener about all these great new things that we're doing.
One of the main things about Pandora is, we're not just putting ticket over into tab on the app or putting in podcast over randomly into one little room of the house so to speak. While you can get to those things, when you want, we're trying to bring everything directly to the listener. So, you can effortlessly discover. But we have to do really smart about, when is the right time to serve an ad versus, when is the right time to serve a ticket or an up-sell kind of day, what device you're on.
We even know that we like some of our younger listeners, when they first come into the product, that's what they do. They change stations, they skip a bunch, you think that's a good time to serve them an ad or a time to buy a ticket, it's a terrible time. Because, they're trying to peddle in their music. But once they find the music they like, we know at that moment at the individual personal level, this is the best time to serve them an ad or a ticket or an up-sell. And that's an engine, that we're constantly working on refining and we have science behind that, that helps us to do that really effectively.

We really think that's a unique way to reach listeners, right in the sweet spot of what we do, so that's a pretty special innovation that we've had life for a while now during this year and we're watching great results, where we did increase video capacity, while not hurting listeners, and that's key, we want to put that listener experience and protect our listener base.
We're also innovating around our advertizing, you know clearly monetizing around ads is super, super, super important. And Mike is going to take you through later, why all of these innovations driving listeners and engagement, and new tools to help us drive up that RPM is so critical. And so, he'll share more about that, but we're putting products behind that are working. And trust me, our roadmap next year, has got a huge amount of emphasis and focus around ad-tech.
Some of the things I'd like to highlight around sponsored listening. We actually released the sponsored listening products last year. So this is where, you get prompted. If you're actually willing to watch a 15 second video ad, you can actually get an hour of uninterrupted listening brought to you by that sponsor.
And we have really great results with that, without going to the metrics, I think the one metric that I was most excited to share with you is 62% of the folks who are buying this new ad, which is a premium ad unit, are actually repeat buyers.
And in the digital space, you have to build a measure, you have to show ROI, you have show real engagement, you have to show brand lift. So that's really critical, and I think it says a lot and we're starting to sell this into top and different categories across Pandora, and that's a very exciting movement for us. We've also introduced visual ad experience, and this is in the process of rolling out, as we've had a number of clients in beta and so we've been watching and measuring the benefits of this new product where historically on the now playing view, an ad would – a display I would pop on top of the album art and if you ever get frustrated with that, we have to just kind of want it get it out of the way. So, we think – we can do better, and we have. This new ad unit and takes the album art and moves it down on the page, and allows the – the display ad to come over in, so nothing is locking to metadata of the music your you're listening to. And we remove that tax, so you can swipe it away or tap it away or you can engage in the ad. And we're really excited about this, and some of the beta clients have gone early with us using this one-by-one and where we take over this whole area has seen an 19% increase in conversion that means not just tapping through to the ads, but then linking through to actually make a purchase or may take an action.
And so, again we want to assemble more and more of those examples of ROI and return on this, but we're really excited about that early evidence we're getting that this is a win for the listener because you're not [indiscernible] artist and to the advertiser, because the ad is not in the way it's complementary. We care about the details, we care about how we can make advertising look as beautiful as the music on our product, and keep it simple and then targeting. The targeting story for Pandora, we've been doing for a while, but our targeting segments are at 1,993 target segments I think as of yesterday. Lissie and John and the team are feeding me the data and 416 of those target segments are proprietary to Pandora. We either have them from first party derived.
So, we know that your Spanish speaking with small children driving this kind of car in this area, we know all kinds of things about you that we can use unleashed really smart premium Premium targeting to advertisers. And this is also listing what we can charge. And so, again Mike will talk about how, why we really believe we can bring this back to business results. But using those risk data points to help our advertisers reach the listeners on our platform is super, super important, and it makes the advertising more relevant and those higher efficacy. So, it's really valuable, and here's the key thing, we're selling it. In January 2015, with fewer segment only 10% of our ad buyers were taken advantage of these Premium segments. Now it's 36%. So again advertisers put their money where they get return and they find this is the benefit and they are using these segments more and more and we believe there is a lot of upside there. All right, so that was the part of the course of the agenda where I really wanted you to understand what's new, what we are innovating, what we've been building, the evidence behind it getting traction in you, so that was kind of the goal in that section. Now let's talk about how things are going in Pandora Plus and the new features we've just been turning on over the recent weeks to our ad-supported listeners. Now before I going to the results though, I wanted to go back and talk about the opportunity. What is the opportunity for Pandora to sell a $4.99 subscription to our user base. Now we think the opportunity is large, that's the headline. We think that we'll get there over time, but I wanted to talk about how we came up with that.

I've been asked a lot, how did you come up with the features of what's in Plus, because before it was Pandora without ads, how did you come up with these extra features, what we didn't get. We started it very carefully. We use actual real behavior, real data. On our platform, we analyze it, we have crossed the consumer research, we listen to what our listeners are asking for it, Tim mentioned that earlier, you put that together as a very clear, it was a very clear not even a bet as to what people would care about, if we can get right and actually add these in. And these new rights are going to give us all kinds of opportunities to make money with on the subscription. So ad-supported, ad can be frustrating for listeners, some listeners are okay with it, but we look at ad sensitivity. We measure those who at different ad levels, are dropping off, or slowdown their engagement and so we know there is still frustration with ads. Now we already have 4 million, $4.99 subscribers and that only value prop above Pandora, a great Pandora with without ads. So, we think there's still upside there, with 38% of our monthly listeners.
Skips. People like to skip. Our program is fantastic, but especially even in our younger demographic, we see these like people who love skip or skip a lot. So, this is the pretty easy one for us to measure as well. We look at how many people are hitting the skip limit, how many people are hitting the skip limit multiple times in a month, and we can understand and look at 38% of our monthly listeners might appreciate the ability to not be blocked and get more skips.
Replay. We didn't have replay, but it was pretty clear for us in listening to our customers and our listeners, looking at why people are leaving our product to go to other services to just replay that song. Gosh, Pandora can you just replay it. So we looked at thumbing activity. We looked at those that are actively thumbing, those that are actively thumbing up and we just take a fraction of that and say, what if we lit up a replay button on the songs you keep thumbing up, and so that gives us a huge opportunity, a 31% of our monthly listeners might care about that value prop.
And then, Offline. This is the one, I think we could be massively understating, but the reality is that, we have clear signals that 31% of our monthly listeners would appreciate the fact that Pandora doesn't go dark, when you lose connectivity, whether you're going through the subway, whether you're just over here in children park and in Berkeley, going to the trails and making the music, helping the music continue to play is really the key and so, we estimate there's a huge opportunity there. Again, all of this does that one or multiple of these pain points if we solve them can be enough to tip you over to pay $499. That's the very simple math. We think that adds up to 67% of our monthly listeners are relevant to go after and we think that could be growing.
All right. So, how are we doing so far. Well, literally we've only had the features fully dialed up for a couple of weeks. We actually were at few days ahead, when we said our full dial up would happen when we met back in September. And we're already seeing 5% of our monthly active start to actively use replays and more skips. And again, each time they are doing that, they're engaging with a video ad to unlock a handful of replays, unlocking handful of more skips.
So, we're pretty excited about that and really the marketing of that is just now starting. So, a lot of that was people organically finding in these great features. I wanted to have a tweet board to show you all the really wonderful tweets that we're getting from listeners, they're just slipping about such a simple addition, that's really made the service so much better, it's the details.

Under 34, no surprise heavily over indexing on their use of these features or under 24 listeners are heavily using these features. So, we're really excited about these are amplifying the use of Pandora. We're excited to see how this impacts retention on the platform, because we're not frustrating people by not offering these. And very important, linking this fact to our business opportunity, we're seeing an increase in video capacity, because of these features being unlocked.
So, that's a great opportunity, where again we have this exchange. We're able to open up this great capability and we're able to monetize that and make more money. So, that's a huge portion of what we are trying to do in our ad-supported base that Mike will talk about further.
How is going with Plus. So, our $499 offering, actually the numbers are somewhat staggering. The 68% of our Plus listeners, since we've been dialed up in this window of time has usually the replays, more skips or offline. Offline is the dominant used case that we're seeing the most people using.
Now, part of that is because how we do it automatically, but folks are using these new features and recall back to my earlier presentation. The mass consumption of these features in the usage is what makes the product sticky that improves your churn that also keeps people on platform above and beyond just attracting people back to Pandora, so we're excited about that.
Again, indexing heavily in our under 24 listeners' user base, that's important. And we're finding that already, I mean, we're early days on this, early days, this is like a product person's dream that people would actually be using all these features so early, 10% are using offline daily. And Tim mentioned that magical experience, when you know we were talking about Jim as used case, where you're riding your bike from the marine headwinds and you lose connectivity for a period of time, no problem, leave your phone in the pocket, Pandora will automatically transition your offline station, and then when you regain connectivity, we'll bring you right back.
Every other service, you need to stop on the side of the road, get the phone on your pocket, go find your offline music, probably play with the same songs that were downloaded last time you showed up, and then you can get back on your bike and start riding, and hopefully you're safe to that whole experience. We'll keep going – go on the road, okay that's what we're doing differently. But this is being used 57% of the engagements of offline or when we do it for you. Again, it's not just checking a box of offline, it's doing it in a different way and in effortless way. And our engineering team have done a great job and our designers and making that come to life in such a seamless simple way.
How about trials, I knew you guys would want some information about how this will impact the money, right, just to us as group, you got to care about that?
A Rhetorical question, , of course, you do. So, we're pretty excited. This picture right here is just showing you one of the new mechanisms that we're using to convert people on platform. We've talked about this very smart, intelligent interactions. These are prompts that come up for a replay, when you take a certain action in the products like thumbing up music and we let you know that hey, are you replay the song that you actually could subscribe and get replays all the time with no ads. Well, if you hit the skip sign up, we give you a prompt, we call them smart conversions. So, based on your behavior at just the perfect time, we let you know about when it makes sense to subscribe.
So, we're not going to hammer you over the head with sign up, sign up, we can do it in a more elegant way. And what we're finding, Plus subscriptions are more than doubled. A 113% in conversions, just in the last – less than two weeks, since we've been fully dialed up, compared the four when we had Pandora One or $499 offering, which was just Pandora without ads.

So, we feel really good that actually people, the new offering is resonating. Our marketing engines are just now kicking in, we've only been doing marketing really for the last week. So, in two weeks, less than two weeks really, we've seen this kind of growth. One of the surprised metrics for us has been this recapture rate.
So, listeners who had previously subscribed or tried it out before, subscribe and let their subscriptions stop. We measure how many of them on a monthly basis comeback and resign up. We're seeing a 46% increase in that. In this short window of time, that was really a surprise metric for us.
What that means is they've heard, oh! they choose it, they now have offline, they now have replays, I'm going to resubscribe. So, folks that had tried us stopped coming back. Again, this is a huge story around reengagement and also the appeal of this offering is landing and we're just getting started.
Now, Mike and Tim are going to kill me, maybe not, maybe not kill, but they're going to be, I want to go after off the ranch a little bit here. Just in less than two weeks, we've had 250,000 conversions, which is pretty amazing.
[Video presentation]
All right, sorry how to square that in there with the – we're really excited, I mean common it's a great new start when you launch a product like this you put it out there even with the marketing just getting going we're born or on our way to born. Okay. Let's talk about Pandora Premium. So, Pandora Premium as Tim mentioned is going to be the unique Pandora cake on demand and way more.
We think this is a huge opportunity for someone to start with some of the opportunity, they're going to give you a taste of how we're thinking about it, just so everybody can take a deep breath, and I don't want to be too disappointed, but I'm not going to show screenshots. I'm not going to take you through features, I'm not going to demo anything today. You're going to have to come in December when we do the formal unveiling where we'll show you the features, we'll walk you through the product, we'll explain it and show it. We have a lot of competitors who are joining today to participate in our show, and so we're trying to keep some that close to the best while we get ready for the lunch, but I do want to give you some insight on why we've confidence. And as we unveil in December, our plan is to then start to turn it on for listeners in early Q1. So, that's kind of our plan for that.
All right, what's the opportunity for Pandora to sell a 999 on demand offering that is differentiated? Well we think we have a lot of data that gives us confidence that this is a great place for us to enter, this is a great thing for us to do, and entirely relevant. Tim mentioned that 78 million of our monthly listeners are spending 22 hours. We've 10 million monthly listeners who spend more than 50 hours with us, 75 billion songs that's a lot of data to help us know what you like, what you care about, your reactions, your very individual personal care, not with this row I will like, and not with this row of folks all like but what you like and how we can actually show up in a way, that's right for you.
We've also looked at outside research, our own research and we see that 58 million listeners are actually who use Pandora today are also using some form of free on-demand and some paid on-demand. So, we know that's a desire they need for some of the features that are classically available in an on-demand product, makes sense.
We're also looking at the 45 million of our monthly listeners who haven't just, don't just hang out on a couple of stations, but have really deep, a selected multiple stations of at least 25, many of them way more stations on Pandora. They give us all those great tastes. And again that's where Thumbprint really shines, because we know your patterns across different music.

We can deliver a music discovery in a personalized way, at scale like no one else. And $20 million, based on some research that we've done and we've seen other outside research that points to even a bigger number or a growing but the number we thought confident looking at and thinking about is, 20 million of our monthly actives are paying for some form of on-demand, already. But still coming back and using Pandora 15 hours to 20 hours a month, why is that. It's because, we nail it when it comes to discovery. We know them, the ease of use and many people are discovering on Pandora, hearing that great news songs, jumping over and selecting it and doing point used cases in other services and continue to come back into Pandora.
So we really believe, these types of points of data, give us confidence that in introducing a $9.99 on-demand, we can win. Now you might ask, what is that up to. We think this means about 30% and you could argue this is growing of our active monthly listeners a $9.99 offering would be relevant.
And yes, I know, you're all very smart with math, but those might be interested in Plus and those that might be interested in our on-demand and overlap, and that's okay. So, it's not just one the other, we think that there could can be overlap there.
So, how do we believe, we can win in on-demand. And again, the product, we'll be showing you later, and I think really, when you first put it in your hands, and that it goes your ears, you're going to have special moment, where you kind of get it, it's the ah, ha, but I'll do my best to represent that on these – with these five points at this time.
It starts with what we've been saying around personalization and in effortless. The other services on the market are just to conversome to use. You're having to do a lot of work to go find music, pull it off of a list, put it into a play list. If you're really intend to you build multiple lists or you to gathered on the one, you come to a page in the app, and it's a bunch of things being promoted, half of which might not be relevant for you. So, we really think the product, we have confidence that we can just have this show and it can be right for your individual taste.
And you are individual person, you hear a some kind of radio, everybody in here has a different station experience. We're not just organizing you around hip-hop listener, you know classic, rock listener, who likes a little bit of old rock. We are deeper than that. We're done at the individual level at some print. And we've made it really, really easy. We're going to take key things that we know people doing on-demand, and we're going to do them on your behalf. Think about the way, we're doing offline right now and in Plus.
We can do it for you. Can you switch over to offline mode in Plus, sure you can, but isn't it nice, when it just does it for you. So, that's kind of the way, we think about the product, Plus could be very easy to learn. Our opportunity is first and foremost to actually sell and promote this amongst our user base. The monthly access, the daily access, the quarterly access that we have on Pandora, they know how to use our products. They trust us. So, this product will pop up for you and be familiar. You'll recognize it. You won't scratch your head and say, how do I use this thing? How do I navigate around? You'll walk right into a product that's familiar and knows you. We're going to take on this idea of the best of both worlds. Chris Becker, our lead on the product side who joined from RDO has kind of talked about this quite a bit, I think it's spot on. Every other service kind of makes you choose between on demand and features and radio. You are in lean, lean in mode or you're in lean back mode. We just, we just don't buy that. There are certain things you're trying to do and we think we can blend those worlds. So, we let you get to what you're trying to do and if you found a specific song, and then you just want to lean back and let it go, we'll take over. [indiscernible] , you're enjoying the radio and you start it into a collection mode, you can do that too. You don't have to kind of think about what mode you're in, we just kind of blend those worlds.

And so, we're really excited to kind of leapfrog, the leapfrog the world of on demand from a user experience perspective, because the prices are very similar, the access to music catalog is very similar, but the way we bring the music to you, the way we do it in a personal way, the ease, we think will be differentiated. The music will never stop. We are not shy about when you open up Pandora, music starts playing. Most of that, it's silent. And after you've picked what you want to play, it goes silent again. That will not happen in our product. We actually can keep the music going because we know you. We don't have to worry about messing it up, because we know what songs matter for you and we can mix your favorites and with discovery all the time. And then the final point, that we mentioned earlier but I really do think it's important, is one of the key reasons to believe that we have all these intelligent ways to smartly reach our listener base, based on their usage patterns, their behaviors. We have our science team are working on probably six models around willingness to subscribe, willingness to trial, when is the right time of the day, all the details, what's the base, what kind of music they're listening to when you might convert.
These are super smart ways for us to help reach our huge audience, and our growing audience in a way that no one else can. And these are the things that give us confidence, that our on demand $9.99 Premium offering is going to be really great.
I would ask you one thing, as I close out here, if you haven't yet checked out your Thumbprint Radio station, you need to. If you're confused around other things that are out there, the people say Deliver Discovery check out Thumbprint Radio and check our Plus and use your Thumbprint while offline that is a sick experience that's amazing, it's great.
Thank you very much.

Please welcome to the stage Pandora's present President & Chief Financial Officer, Mike Herring.
[Music]
Michael S. Herring
All right. Thank you [inaudible] right, and thank you all for coming here and joining us this afternoon. I know it's busy earnings week and not a common day to choose for an Analyst Day, but it's a critical moment in the evolution, the transformation of Pandora's. Hopefully, you've seen through Tim and D.P.'s comments. We've been working for years to get this point, me personally for three-and-a-half years, 16 years for Tim, but we think we've aligned a lot of things up to this moment to take the next step into Pandora's future.
But before we get into that, I'm going to spend some time walking through our quarterly results and then we released them earlier today, you had time to digest them. September 2016, really marked the beginning of this transition, its cost structures are changing related to the direct yield framework, but more importantly our priorities are shifting from being a primarily advertising supported service to one that has multiple products and revenue streams and that transition really started in September and affected our earnings in Q3, and it's affecting our outlook for Q4. I want to talk through the details there. And so, we all understand we start from kind of the same footing and then we'll go through specially how we expect the business to evolve next year and over the next few years towards 2020 in terms of our target metrics for that over the next four years, and then we look forward to answer your questions to you at the end of the day.
So, let's start with revenue. Total revenue for the quarter is $352 million. It was $8 million below the low-end of our guidance range. And that was really driven and it was in an advertising driven by national advertising softness that continued from second quarter. Primarily in the entertainment and telco verticals, but in general in the digital demand space, there was overall softness in digital advertising. We expect that to continue, we don't see any big changes of that in the Q4 and that's reflected in our guidance for Q4, but advertising revenue still increased 7% year-over-year at about $273.7 million in Q3 versus $254.7 in Q3 of 2015.

Local advertising at 28% of revenue in Q3, continues to be a steady engine of revenue for Pandora. Turning to subscription, subscription revenue was actually at $56.1 million, a slight decrease year-over-year of 1%. I think this is a kind of underlying a lot of the transformations we're taking here. Pandora One has leveled off at approximately 4 million subscribers. It added 77,000 subscribers in the third quarter, increased about 2%, but it's been in the 3.9 million to 4 million subscriber zone now for well over a year at about 5% of our active. And with a single value proposition, which is a sort of advertising, no advertising value proposition reason to subscribe, and consumers move back and forth in and out of that from our ad supported business. And so a lot of the things that Chris talked about tonight, it really efforts to drive higher conversion, higher penetration rates and we'll talk about that a lot more in the next section.
Ticketing revenue in the third quarter was $22.1 million and that business continues to operate at or above expectations. It had great growth transaction value in the quarter growing 35% year-over-year, $155 million for the tickets sold through the platform. That generated – that 3.9 million tickets about 1.7 million ticket buyers, that's a growth about 20% year-over-year covering across 40,000 live events through the Ticketfly network.
So, not just great business in itself, but as DP talked about really an opportunity to connect live events to the demand that Pandora can bring. But the advertising market, as we can see here is seasonal, and can fluctuate dramatically based on exogenous factors anything from changing in market, plans, shifting demand, product launches by ourselves, product launches by other players in the market, larger macroeconomic issues like the economy, or elections all can affect how much – how advertising can be built in a quarter and how that trends over time, that will continue to be an important business for us for a long time, but I think this quarter results really further support the plans that we've been putting in place for some time and that we're now executing on the building scale or subscription offerings and diversify and extend the revenue stream.
Turning to active users and listeners, active users were essentially flat year-over-year and sequentially. Seasonally Q3 tends to be down a little bit because of the summer months, but – and we see that in listener hours, down from 5.66 billion to 5.4 billion hours in the quarter. That 5.4 billion is also restricted somewhat by Pandora as we signed deals and prepared to launch, Plus we started restricted hours on the ad supported business in August through September. So, cost control a little bit also starting to create more opportunities for upsell – cross-sell opportunities as we look to launch subscription businesses.
I'll provide more detail about our expectations on that business here in a second. We continue to grow RPMs while controlling LMPs. This has been a constant vein that we reiterated now for really three plus years. It's critical to our ability to expand our overall gross margins and ad RMP continues to increase, it increased 2% year-over-year, 9% sequentially. As we get – we continue to be more efficient in selling advertising on per hour basis despite hours continuing to grow significantly.
We've added the ARPU as a metric here, largely because going forward that can be a really important measure of our progress. I'm going to finish today's conversation talking about the specific metrics we're going use internally, but also share externally. But Q3 ARPU is approximately $14.73, $15 something we're really proud from an advertising perspective. It's a multiple of any other advertising supported service out there. It's really the cornerstone of what differentiates Pandora's model, now in going forward. Total RPM is $61 increase increased from $60.50 from third quarter, last year. And the LPMs at $32.31, that's up 28% year-over-year, that's largely driven by the CRB ruling, last December, up a $1 from Q2, in part because September was now under the direct deal framework fit, slight increase in LPM and cost going into September, and we'll talk a lot about how that's going to manifest itself in the model going forward.

I will want to make a note here that going forward; we are not going to talk about LPMs in the context of the subscription businesses any longer. The new direct deal framework does not have an activity based cost to it or royalty calculation, so we will no longer need to worry about limiting hours into the subscription businesses. It's much more based on an ARPU. It's an ARPU based royalty calculation, not specifically that there is a lot of complexity around it, but generally speaking, ARPU versus LPU or licensing cost per thousand hours is going to be kind of a new metric we're going to talk about, that'll show you how you're going to expand margins over time and track our progress in that and I'll talk about that at the end of the meeting as well.
Kind of diving down a little bit further down income statement in terms of our Q3 2016 results. Gross margin year-over-year declined 14%, but was up 8% sequentially by – as we managed hours, controlled pot and grew RPMs in that timeframe.
Our total employees at the end of quarter was 2,421, up from 1,879, last year, this time. Product development and G&A in 2016, both took step up function beginning of this year as I am sure you remember as we invested to build a infrastructure and product capabilities to bring [ph] subscription products to markets that you saw in the last few weeks with Boston and coming in Premium. But as we move through the year, those possibly leveled out, and we made the big investments in order to get these products to market in a timely manner. We said the rates was between our ability to license and our ability to build product, I won the race by the way a month ahead of Chris. But to the extent that we made those investments early, so we're delivering products that we can pay licensing accurately on. And that work, when you start using them, so huge kudos to our teams, who brought the – who were able to bring these things and be able to launch them earlier in the year than we really expected to.
External marketing, sales and marketing decreased 7% sequentially. It's largely that drop is a decrease in marketing spend from Q3 – from Q2 to Q3, we spent about $15.6 million in external marketing in the third quarter. Really as products kicks in and started driving users and hours engagement, it reduced marketing spends. Q2, we spent a lot more, we spent $24.5 million that quarter reducing marketing in Q3 and sort of gearing up internally in order to bring Plus to market, and then later on to bring Premium.
Google and Apple commissions in the quarter were $9.2 million, which is represented about 16% of the subscription revenue. Those of you who follow this line closely will know that that's down from 19% of subscription revenue in the first half of this year. That decline, it's the beginning of the changing in the commission structure with Apple and Google that we're going to see kind of gradually come into play through the end of the year, as there is their commission structures from 30% to down to 15%. That's something, we've been working with Apple and Google as partners for a long time. We are not interested in going around and trying to find alternative ways to charge customers who wanted to be easy, simple to use, and we have found the platforms both with Google and Apple being credibly great for subscription conversion. We're already seeing that as a kick in. Now, as you saw Stephi talk about in the new Plus offering. And so, it's better to focus on the right commission structure with our partners. And over time, I think we feel less and less billing for through those platforms. As we develop our own direct payment relationship with our customers and upselling cross sells can be done through those direct payment relationships. Great example of that is the millions of dollars in tickets we sell every quarter direct-to-consumers all through credit cards, through a web interface. As we merge sort of the user IDs between the two platforms, I think we have a really healthy conversion upsell on pack rate there at a lower cost to consider over time.

Lastly, just from a sales perspective, we finished the quarter with 496 quarter bearing sales reps, but a 154 still of which are our local sales reps. We are very directly on kind of ensuring that getting that advertising business ready to grow again over time. When we talk about what we think is going to drive that growth, but that we – it's a $1 billion Plus ad revenue business. It's very healthy at its core. We had a great team, we build great technology around it. We think that's going to continue to be an important part of our strategy.
So at the bottom, it comes down to our EBITDA loss of $6.6 million in the quarter, slightly the lower guidance range. You're factoring the fact that we had about $4 million in additional content cost in the quarter from signing the deals which was not anticipated in our guidance for the year, and I'll talk about that at the end. We would have been within the range even with lower revenue as we managed costs both from a hours perspective and the pace of operating expenses. Normally, I don't spend a lot of time on cash flow and earnings, but this is kind of an unusual quarter from the cash flow perspective and that, I've already been getting a lot of questions as we announced the deal around cash flow and cash requirements for the business.
When we started the quarter with $311 million in cash on the balance sheet. We made $120 million worth of upfront payment related to the direct deals that we signed. The net increase to royalty prepayments on the balance sheet is $93 million; the difference reflects the amortization of some of those upfront payments activity in the quarter. So let's put that in context and when we file our Q, we'll disclose the total amount of prepayment. But and there are over several years, about $700 million worth of payments that will be made sort of over that timeframe, as guarantees against royalties.
It is a fraction of what we will actually pay; it's a fraction of what we pay today. These are not or we hope to reach certain milestones to make these payments. These are just prepayments against future royalty obligation that we plan to and could even if the business stayed flat well exceed.
So it's more of timing from a cash flow perspective, and you'll see there's $90 million in the quarter we drew down in our credit facility, that's intended to mirror that upfront payments and we established that $120 million credit facility last year at the end of 2015 for this specific purpose.
We wanted to be able to operate the business with confidence and aggressively be able to manage the timing of payments because we knew historically that's way the music industry like to do business, they like to get paid up front. And we – and if you take those off of the table, your rates go up, right. So to negotiate, we want to be able to keep those on the table, negotiate the right terms. And that – and being able to write checks for a $120 million and balance that with the right appropriate balance sheet, financing as there – with an approach we decided to take. The rest of the cash flow fluctuations in the quarter are within normal operating parameters, and we finished the quarter with $254 million in cash.
Talking about our guidance for a second before we get into the business model, our previous revenue guidance for Q4 was $390 million, it's at the midpoint. I mentioned the softness that led to Q3's results, we expect that to continue into Q4, and that's about an $18 million hit. We're also taking about $4 million worth of inventory that we normally use programmatic channels to sell, and we're going to use that internally to drive subscription as long as that make sense, that's the plan.
Initially, we'll do – it's a trade-off between those two things. Based upon earlier conversion numbers some of which [ph] DP mentioned that's certainly going to be a plan, we may even accelerate that. The midpoint of our revenue guidance then for Q4, 2016 is $368 million.

EBITDA, our cost structure was changing a lot. I mentioned regard the deals are done sooner than we expected right after Labor Day that changed our cost structure from a content cost perspective, it also changed the timing of bringing these product to launch specifically the first product, specifically reflects features. We wanted to make sure we did that with confident, gave it the right boost out the door and prepped ourselves well for the unveiling in December our Premium in the launch of that product in early 2017.
So, of all those things created, and ins and outs here that affects what our EBITDA is going to be for Q4. Previously, our guidance was an EBITDA profit of $23 million. The $22 million from the revenue adjustment comes off the top because we saw the same infrastructure, we're not slowing investment in our advertising business. $22 million in our royalty cost step-up. This is essentially we're going to talk about it here but increased slightly in LPM related to the advertising business and an increase in the royalty calculation for the subscription business that already exist.
The impact of that as a step-up function is about $22 million in Q4. And from then on it will grow at those new rates or decline depending on a lot of factors, we'll talk about that too. As we move through the year, it's not a linear thing, it's sort of an adjustment to a new level of royalty structure. And then $24 million in OpEx that we are committed to spend this quarter to make sure that we launch these new subscription products with the right effort behind them.
I would now like to turn to our growing order business model and the changes that are pretty profound as Tim put it, from the direct – moving into a direct licensing world and it's dramatically expanding on revenue and product portfolio, revenue on [indiscernible] product portfolio. So this quarter – it's really the transformation in Pandora's business. The direct deals it's not with the music labels complete an evolution that's been happening for a while and you have been watching it and asking me questions and asking Tim questions constantly about why do you do this, why do you that, it's all to get to this point.
I say a lot internally, Pandora has finally got to the starting line of the next 10 years. It's started 2.5 years ago with the strategy that we put together as a management team. It started to show its head last fall when we signed broad publishing deal with the entire industry that enabled these products to come to market, it included settlement of the 372 losses that were floating through the course of last year still are today could – would have still delayed everything and the end of the CRB process the two things that kept us from talking to the labels in a meaningful way.
Tim mentioned that, we did this quickly in six months, we built relationships over in the last few years, the last six months, we have the big obstacles and the lawyers we are letting us talk and we are able to sit down and talk about, how we build the a business together that both of us benefit significantly over time, that was a big, big step forward.
These new revenue streams are really important, so we've got – as you heard from CP, they are building on the base of strength. They're building on the competitive advantages and assets that are unique to Pandora and give us a window of time to build a big interesting profitable business. And that's what gets us all excited. Here is the starting line, we're ready to run for the next four years, we've set big targets for ourselves out there. And those assets, the big data assets that Chris talked about, the valuable advertising platform that takes our funnel for driving users and make it a profitable engine, it's not a cost center, it drives significant dollars into the business.

It's a 100 million quarterly users, right now, using the product, that are right for being exposed to these new product offerings. And the Pandora brand, we've seen this new brand, the new energy behind it, we're really excited about it internally. But broader the brand recognition and a positive affinity for it, it's really important when you're introducing subscription businesses. The trust of paying a brand that you know is going to deliver a product you care about, that matters a lot, and Pandora has a huge step-up there. I've ran multiple subscription businesses in my life, this is my fourth time around build, launching and building subscription business and that is critical, it's as critical as managing churn, it's critical as optimizing your customer acquisition channels, it's building trust with your customers, and then brand is critical to that.
And the last really important thing I want to point it that Pandora customized personalized radio product, it's the killer app. It would drive engagement, it's the way Americans like to consume music, and for those of you, who are student of subscription business and the student of advertising, engagement is the magic word for driving effectiveness in advertising and conversion and retention in subscription. And we already do that better than any other mobile app out there by a long shot. So huge assets that may give us confidence to move forward. And our 2020 targets reflect, our ability leverage those assets to address this large and growing market opportunity, and the way it's going to move, I'm going to put some numbers and third party numbers out there to kind of quantify that for you, but if you walk away from one thing, with one thing keep in mind, we have, overnight, dramatically increased our addressable market opportunity.
I mean, yes, there were lots of steps that got us here, but through the launch of these products and the signing of these direct deals, we've opened up our addressable market significantly. And we're doing it in unique way with a balanced operating model. We're not focused on how do we describe as many people to this subscription product as possible and have to comprise our way to get there. We have an advertising through the consumer ad supported business that's profitable. We have subscription up sells with a real value proposition and a huge audience to apply it to. We're going to talk about the ARPU curve, but the whole point is, we have available audience today and everything we're doing is going to increase the value of that audience over time on a per user basis and on an aggregate user basis.
So, clear path to achieving 2020 target, unique opportunity available to Pandora, comprehensive product suite satisfy, anyway people want to consume music. And at the end, I'm going to just talk about metrics, milestones that we're going to use to drive our business and you can use to hold us accountable.
I mentioned the direct deals, I do want to lay a little groundwork here on the context of the royalty structure that we're going to be operating. And because, I think, there is still some confusion about why we did these deals and what they actually mean for us. And there is a lot about – 90% of the discussion, it's been about the increasing costs. And that is real. Under the statutory licenses, we paid a $31 LTM in the ad-supported business, that's going to $33 into the direct deals.
But that's not just giving money to the labels for the pleasure of doing business. Under the statutory license, we have a very restrictive rule set about how and what music we can play, and in what manner we can provide internet activity to users, that is increased dramatically and we think that, that can turn directly into revenue. From an advertising perspective and from a conversion and subscription perspective.

On the subscription side, there is very – there is no additional functionality available under statutory. So, on the radio subscription side, the [indiscernible] products, we had 499 with just ad-free as I mentioned. And, there was no on-demand interactivity available on the statutory rate.
I'm moving to world of direct deals, significant value propositions to move people to that mid tier products and multiple features in functionality will be introducing in order to take that into that next level to the 999. So, yes, it's an increasing cost. But, it totally changes the opportunity you have just to monetize the business. So, I'm going to talk to the unit economics of each of these levels of consumer engagement and talk about the marketed opportunity for each one of those. And then, I'll finish with the metrics as I mentioned. We'll start with unit economics. So, we now – we've gone from having two sort of price points to three, lots of iterations within there. But, we're going to keep it really simple today. And, I'm not going to talk about Ticketfly, and I'm not going to talk about international. Those things are important strategic efforts for Pandora for a variety of reasons. But today and for the next 12 months, we're really going to be focused on bringing these products to market in the United States, what the opportunity is here and driving this business domestically. And so, this entire presentation for me is going to be focused on the economics around the U.S. business and our opportunity in the U.S. business. That $4 billion that we talked about is our target for 2020 for example as a U.S. domestic target. Okay, this best the way we're thinking about it. Target ARPU were at $15 now for ad supported, that's sort of $40 to $50 – sorry, $50 to $60 RPMs. We get that to $80 to $90 and we get to a ARPU of that $26. We think that's more than possible we're $80 to $100 RPM today at existing ad loads in our top 30 markets in the 25 to 54 demographic, lots of opportunity to grow ad load, lots of opportunity to expand our advertising business. Today it's $1 billion already, we think that has a lot of room to grow.
Pandora Plus is $60, $4.99 ARPU business on a per user basis. Pandora Premium is $120, the 999. So, we have a step-up each time in terms of revenue per user. But what really matters to Pandora when we think about this is not revenue per user. If you think about the old traditional software models, they used to say, well, you just sell you're shipping CDs, you sell as many CD unit, it's all about revenue optimization curve and that's how you determine how to market, drive customer acquisition. Then everyone switched to SaaS, which I was a big part of back in the mid-2000. And all of a sudden had to convince everybody, it wasn't revenue optimization anymore, it was gross margin optimization. And that same economics works here extremely well. We are about optimizing contribution margin.
So, a little bit different than gross margin, does include like servers and co-location stuff, all which are commodities now and are collapsing from a cost perspective to companies, the scale of Pandora. What really matters is our largest cost line, which is royalty cost. And we've structured our deals that did two things. One, incentivize Pandora to pay our label partners and our publishing partners more. So, we are aligned to move up the ARPU curve, they make a higher percentage over time or as you move up that curve from a royalty perspective and we make a higher – our contribution margin per user increase pretty significantly.
So, when we go from an ad supported user and we convert that person into a Plus subscriber, the optimized – this is the optimized model here. We'll talk about 2020 models in a second. We go from a $15 contribution margin for user to $25 contribution from user, 67% increase, okay. We go – get back same user to Premium, that's a 3x contribution in margin per user converting from ad supported to there and about 80% – what is that due math, 80% increase over from Plus to Premium. So the point is that we have every incentive to move individual users of this plan. One of the questions I get lot is, are we cannibalizing ad supported great business balancing by offering the subscription services, and I'll talk about lifetime in little bit, but right here is a great example of why I would say, it's not about cannibalizing, it's about optimizing the value of each user in a way that optimizes our overall customer base from a company perspective, and we get to do this, because we have all three, because we are generating $15 at the top, and $25 at the mid year, and $45 at the bottom. And we can – if we're never going to convert selling from ad-supported, we don't have to make the life miserable, we are still going to make $15 per year off that person. If all I have, is this bottom Premiums subscription, my only product is a 999 per month product, all I'm going to do is due to over the head, try and punish you down that problem, and there is a limitation to what happens.

And by the way, your short changing your long-term opportunity that way, because someone might not describe now, but next year, they might, they might be a 19-year-old today. But in four years, they might be ready to upgrade it to mid-year product, but there might be 24 today, and do midyear, and employers to be upgrading to 999 is there music preferences changes, is the way they music changes, we keep everybody in the ecosystem this way. All other product changes, the way we structured the product ladder, everything is about keeping people in the Pandora ecosystem, where they want to be, so we optimized retention and optimized long-term – life time value of that customer, we moved them up the value chain.
We had a – I'm feeling operating profit and operating margin in here because that's really important. Contribution margins are important here. Ad supported is the higher operating profit on the percentage basis that drops just from the nature of contribution margin, dropping as a margin as you move from Plus to Premium. It's critical to being able to achieve this in a mix basis therefore – our 15% target in 2020, is that you have price discipline on the left, price discipline around that $60 and $120 ARPU and your abilities to drive a successful ad ARPU.
If you are unable to do that and those start to collapse, profits get a lot harder. This is about having a discipline around your business model, diversity around your business model and you're able to treat customers the way they want to be treated and be patient as they move up to that line now. Now we'd certainly want to drive as many subscribers as we can, as fast as we can. Don't take that in the wrong way [indiscernible] we want to do that as much as possible, but the reality is we can't be patient, because we have a balanced business model.
Describing a little bit to ad supported $15 ARPU today, growing to $26 ARPU in optimized targets. This is done largely by increasing ad load, increasing the high-value inventory from an advertising perspective. This is I think immensely achievable. I want to remind everybody, we haven't increased maximum ad load in two years that means that we are 25 to 54 in the top 30 markets have been maxed out from a monetization perspective for the last year-and-a-half, two years. It's not that we couldn't sell more ads there, it's one of the reasons why we've slowed local investments down. It's because local investments largely sell to radio buyers, radio because of the nature of broadcast, where it's one to many, its focus intently on 25 to 54. So, we sell out that segment, very aggressively, we could sell more, but we'd have to increase ad load and we purposefully didn't do that for those markets over the last year-and-a-half, as we've been saying to you often, in order to preserve that user base for the opportunity that's in front of us now. We've got to the starting line, as these products become fully available, increasing ad load becomes as an important part of the answer there.
I talked about this cost structure going from $31, under the CRB to $33. $58 in ad supported RPM in Q3. So a pretty healthy margin, but not 60%. Well, how do we get to the optimized target? Well, it's by growing RPMs and a lot of it is what I talked about here already. But, that 60% operating margin is it, RPMs of $80 to $90 and that sounds like a pretty big number, I mean, going from $58 to $80, it's not insignificant. But, let me remind you that three-and-a-half years ago, when I walked in, started Pandora in February 1, 2013 that was $24.
So we've come a long way in that timeframe, and without the benefit the of unlimited ad loads. We haven't chased every dollar, we're now giving ourselves a chance to go, fuel up more of that, and we think that getting that up – another $20 to $30 is eminently achievable over the next few years.

The incremental LPM from $31 to $33, it's not insignificant, when you apply it, it's a billions of dollars, that's why there is $22 million, part of the reason why there is $22 million more step up in cost just in Q4, right. So, but it's not for nothing, the potential revenue opportunities and conversion opportunities they come from that additional features and functionalities that we're paying for with that increase in LPM, it's not insignificant, now just in the video inventory. If we sell one more video ad, for every 10 hours of listening, we will cover that entire end piece in LPM just with that one piece of increased inventory.
You heard, TV sales about 7% increase in video inventory just from the addition of these new features in the first couple of weeks like this is a – video is the current hot thing right now that it's rollout of demand is, there is programmatically they're buying it. We don't have to move the needle much in order to cover that, because we have, we kept add load so much lower.
Another way to think of it is, these features and functionality engage users, they stay longer, they use – they listen to the service more. If hours increase 3.5% at the same RPMs we cover that $2 LPM. Some combination of these are more, that cost is easily covered, we do better than that, now we start having an accretive benefit to the business from having these additional features and functionality in taking on $2 more of LPM. So, we really are excited about that opportunity.
Just covering a little bit on plus, the value proposition we've talked a lot a bit about is very dramatically better now than the former Pandora one piece. It's really important, you have a reason to convert, ad free is that 5% of the population, now in limited skips and limited replays and most importantly offline real significant reasons to convert, you heard C.P. talk about sheered incredible numbers of the people who have a reason – have a reason to recognize the value preposition of converting. But we did – we are taking the gross margin, the contribution margin of this business down relatively significantly, it's about 55% in the old Pandora One structure into the CRB. It will start out at about 35%, growing to 42% as we scale this business.
So, there is a – that's also part of the $22 million content costs increase. It's an increasing structure in order to grow this business pretty significantly. And there is a breakeven point, it depends on where we are between that 35% and 42%. But to put it into context, we get to – we reinvigorate our consumer base, lots of reasons to convert, much higher reasons to retain. Pandora One if you cancel your subscription, you have the same product you just had to listen just some ads, not a lot of ads many people would say.
Now if you cancel your Pandora Plus, you don't have offline anymore, your skips and repays are limited, significant reasons to stay – retain and that was that we've seen some already some big reductions in churn. Just in two weeks, I mean these are little tiny things, but if anybody who knows subscription business, you tweak churn like 50 basis points and it's where tens of millions of dollars of the scale we're talking about here.
So, we think we'll more than make-up in volume here and invigorating our customer base for the decline in contribution margin. Pandora Premium as a $120 ARPU, we have lots of personalized features of functionality, we think this is going to establish. This is the true next generation of what on-demand functionality can feel like in a personalized world and we're incentivized to keep moving people up this – up this curve and get to this plan, I talked a lot about contribution margin. Let's talk about lifetime value for a little bit. So, this is a really simplistic view, starting with direct margin, taking 4% to 6% churn, that's how we do vastly better than that, but we, for an argument sake, didn't want to argue about what – whether this is the good churn or bad churn, those are pretty aggressive churn numbers, lifetime value increases significantly. And this matters from a subscription business.

Lifetime value determines how aggressively you can market, what customer acquisition costs you can accept in order to drive the business. You know, keep in mind, our lifetime values – our customer acquisition costs today in the business is a single digit. So, we have a lot of room to grow. If we decide to get once, we figure out this math, once we figure out the conversion, activity, and opportunity. If you ask any subscription marketer, if you've got a $10 customer acquisition cost and a $50 lifetime value of the customer, you have a long way to grow. That math is really important.
And if that lifetime value shrinks because churn go up or pricing declines, or your direct margins declines, and all the kind of things that people worry about. That limits your ability to grow the business, limits the size of business you can be profitably. Great news is, we have a long way to go.
Let's talk about the market opportunity for a second. I want to start by putting up the target we put in front of all over the last February. We had accomplished a lot in February. We had bought Rdio. We had done all of the activities in 2015 that I mentioned earlier. We still have the direct deals with the labels in front of us. And – but we had a good story, we had a good pitch and we've felt like we needed in order to justify to ourselves, to our Board and to our investors. The investment in the direction we were taking, we needed to state what we thought we could do, if we were able to get these deals done, and get these products to market. Because, we just spent $77 million on Rdio, for technology that didn't have an application to drive revenue in 2016. And we're committed, call that specifically $120 million in OpEx investment in 2016, again for products we didn't have licenses to deliver.
We've now done that, and we can say that the deal structure that we have, and I'll walk through how we get to these numbers a little bit, enables us to bring the products to market that we think will drive the revenue streams, get into the market opportunities that deliver on these numbers that put in front of you in February.
We think we'll be able to grow our total monthly active users to north of a 100 million, talking about 110 million here, 2.4 billion in revenue in our core radio products, that's between Plus and ad supported together combined, we consider that radio. Cleaning and subscription revenue at $1.3 billion, right. the reason we call that separately is Premium subscription is on-demand and one thing we agree with the music industry very vehemently on is on-demand functionality should be behind a $10 a month scale. Anything that's through ad supported or that's a mid-year, we're focused, that's our core radio business, it's a great business. At $10 a month, we'll have full functionality, we think that's going to be great business at $1.3 billion, $300 million in Ticketfly revenue gets to the $4 billion record, that's our target for 2020.
Contribution margins that are now enabled through these deals allow us to get to a target, consolidated operating margin in 2020 at 15%. Those are the same numbers that give you February, this still stands here today.
And now important to all this happening are some things that we're going to do internally, and some things that we expect to happen in the broader market. One of those things is that this market is large and it's growing. We think it's going to continue growing. The ad-supported streaming radio market, 115 million users today [inaudible] causes 70% dominant market share, we think that continuous to grow. That's a great tailwind in our back, it's a 130 million users by 2020.
The paid radio subscription market is a little awkward because we're essentially it, external [indiscernible] third party resources is five million growing to seven million, I put it in, dash 10 Plus million, because we actually think that Plus has a much bigger market opportunity than external today, and we'll talk about why we think that in second. And then today, 20 million U.S. subscribers to on demand products, that was recently updated, increased after only a year by 20% to 51 million, I think the point there is twofold, one that's 51 million that's a $6 billion Plus market by 2020 in revenue. And those estimates just keep getting revised out as consumers habits they learned the pay for music again.

They learn to value music and said subscribe and that the activities they're doing in live events, going more than ever. That starts to translate into how they listen to music too. And we're going to be part of that revolution. Zeroing in a little bit on the core radio opportunity, that's 100 million of that 110 million. about 10% penetration that we think will convert into paying radio listeners, so that mid-tier product, our target is about 9.5 million subscribers of the Plus product, $540 million of the $2.4 billion in revenue, advertising, we expect to get to about $1.85 billion by 2020, that's had an $80 RPM across the business by that point. Given now it's $54 today, we have a work cut off for us, but we think we have a clear path to do that. ARPU will hit $21 by 2020, so it's not quite that $26 is optimized, but we'll get there. Contribution margin is 55%, operating margin in the ad business at 20%, 12% for Plus, getting to 18% as a combined. And all these slides will be available to you later, so you don't have to write down too seriously.
Really important is, our territorial area becomes less relevant. Digital radio, especially personalized radio is going to grow like crazy. $115 million today is a big number, we think that grows to $130 million, this is external third party sources. We think it grows faster than that. When you breakdown this business, it's going from 76 million listeners now to 89 million new listeners in 40 years, $1 billion in revenue to $1.85 billion in revenue. So, this is serious growth, it's a reacceleration of advertising revenue growth.
We purposefully have held back some of our abilities to drive revenue over the last year or so and I've talked about that, we think we can reaccelerate that for reasons we've shown you today. And then the deals that we've structured to preserve our ability to drive significant contribution margin on this business.
The kind of waterfall getting to that 89 million, a big piece of that is just the market growth. But we also think we still are going to have the best product out there, the best features and functionality, optimized for listener enjoyment. So, we absolutely believe that we'll continue to maintain and grow that 70% market share according the trend.
RPM, mostly driven by ad load increases. So, increasing the ad concentration across our entire base, but also pricing, this pricing is really drilling into a mix shift to local as we expand Atmos, and we can invigorate the local investments as well as the addition of high value-add inventory like the video ads that the new Flex features, the features that we've introduced in the last few weeks are going to enable.
Also the exact sponsor to Disney, can you remind, a year ago, sponsor to Disney was just getting launched. This year, that will do well into the tens of millions in revenue at a very high RPM. As we do more and more native advertising like that, it has a really nice effects in increasing pricing over time, going from $54 to $80, we think is eminently achievable.
Talk a little bit about the overall economics around Plus. Again, $5 million to $7 million from third-party sources, we think that's well in the north of $10.5 million potential, our own target being $9.5 million. So, obviously, we think that the markets bigger than what third-party sources would say today. That's an 8.6 million penetration in the 110 million users and about a 40% contribution margin. So, a healthy contribution margin, not quite optimized yet. We're growing into that the way that deals that the music industry work, but increasing steadily overtime to get to that point. Where does the user growth were starting at 4 million, a part of that is just pure market growth, part of that increasing market share within that market, but the biggest piece is penetration and what drives penetration is value proposition to the user. I had already talked about today's it's just ad, no ad. We've added three significant pieces of that. Just by adding that penetration on top of a big user base, we believe it's going to drive well in excess of – well in excess of the subs we have today and will be the biggest part of driving 9.5 million subscribers. Now keep in mind, we know this is net of the number of Plus new subscribers we think are going to migrate quickly to Premium. There is always some percentage of subscribers who buy a most expensive thing. And believe me we will aggressively make sure that every Plus new subscriber knows Premium exists and there's an easy path to getting to testing Premium and understanding the value proposition and moving to the next level from 499 to 999.

But all our product testing, all our price testing tell us that there is a huge market at the mid-tier, that's completely untapped right now. And it's important from the long term health of the business, how that means here to teach people to pay for music again, the value to begin, and to move up that value chain. It's one of the big selling points with the music industry. It's why they embraced our mid-tier product. We're about, yes, this will help Pandora, it'll help overall the view of music from a consumer perspective.
Content costs will also improve contractually with scale. So, we improve our economics through scale purely through the leverage in the overall business from operating perspective, but also with contractually with our music partner. As we move through time, you're going to see our contribution margin at each level of product improve with scale as part of a lining or interest with theirs. And it's our way of saying to the music industry, we're on the same team, it's about growing the overall market and as we grow the market we're both going to share in the revenue and benefits that come from that. Some of them are soft data, promotion, et cetera, that we talked about a lot through and some of them are real much harder. What are the royalties we are going to pay and what are the profits Pandora is going to be able to make?
One question I get a lot is, how did you make the decision to put all, spend $90 million settling law suits, to spend $77 million buying Rdio, we spend a $120 million in OpEx last year. We did a thorough examination of all of the potential of these markets that we've talked about. And then we said to ourselves, is the investment in a hassle, and the pain is worth doing it and the answer was, an unequivocal yes, from a management team, from our board.
And a big part of that is understanding what is the return on all that investment, right. So when we took that we allocated some of that to Plus and we allocated some of that to Premium, to understand what return we're getting on this investment. Now we're starting with 4 million subscribers here, so from a return perspective, we breakeven at about 6 million subscribers, right.
Because of the contribution margin declined et cetera, but the return on the investment to bring this next generation mid-tier product to market, is breakeven at 6 million, it exceeds our cost to capital which nobody in this room cares about that, but I still – I like to do the math occasionally. It takes me back to college, when we used to make decisions based on cost to capital, but we – at 6.5 million subscribers we cross over our cost to capital has calculated, but what really got us excited is, we did this all this work and said, wow, we think we still have a 6.5 million subscribers business in 2020 and that's a 47% ROI and the investment is going to take to bring that product to market.
Let's do the same analysis with Premium. 30 million users today growing to 51 million if everyone have the price discipline Pandora tends to have an Apple as Google has that's a $6 billion revenue business on markets – market size in 2020. We think, we can do 10% penetration of a 110 million users, that for 11.3 million subscribers, 35% contribution margin by 2020. We're starting from zero, and we'll start from zero at the beginning of the next year, launching this product in the early 2017. Market growth has been – is going to be a huge wind at our back, but it's all about penetration, it's about proving the value proposition to our user base and converting them. We think, we're going to be – we have a great value proposition, and we have outstanding plans to convert them in the right way. Smart conversions as CP talked about in product already and giving them a great product experience, and showing them the obvious reasons why conversion makes sense.

And through scale, we achieve healthy contribution margin, so 65% content cost, 35% operating – sorry, contribution margins by 2020. Back to ROI again. So the majority of the investment to get here. We allocated the premium, we think it's bigger revenue stream over time. It's a 100% reliant on us doing these deals and building this technology. We break even on that investment at about 2.5 million subscribers or so, across the magic, cost of capital line at a little over 3 million subscribers. It's a steep ROI curves in there. At a 11.3 million subscribers, which is not a phone number, all right, that's 20% market share from zero in four years. But a 11.3 million subscribers that's at the 61% ROI, and that's our target, that's the way, we look at it when we think about, why make all these investments, why go through the trouble, because it's a great value building investment that it's going to provide a high return to our company and to our shareholders.
So just quickly review kind of the way it looks consolidated. Our $4 billion revenue target here is a 9.5 million subscribers in Plus, it's $11.3 million subscribers in Premium, $1.85 billion revenue in advertising, $300 million in ticketing, gets us to $4 billion so that's kind of our standard that's where we can we think about the business.
The reason I have this scenarios not really to say, I think something is more likely. The reality is we have a balanced operating model. It's not one dimensional. If conversion to Premium it's higher or lower. It doesn't completely determine my fate. It's one piece of the puzzle. We have multiple things to operate against. It's the value of a diversified product portfolio.
So, as we look at kind of potential scenarios out there, our target numbers are in some pretty wide ranges, I mean a $500 million range in Premium revenue. Now, keep in mind that cost associated with that revenue is a 100% variable. So, contribution margins are 35% whether they're $1.1 billion or $1.6 billion so there is ample opportunity to drive profitability in cash flow at any level, at any point in that line.
The point is that, I think there is a lot of opportunity. We're going to learn a lot over time. We think we've set aggressive but achievable goals and that there are upside to that if we execute as well, as we think it's possible, the way I think the market could bear.
Lastly, I just want to talk about the operating margin here. When we, these aren't the optimized levels but when we get to 2020, that 15% is made up of kind of 18% from core radio, 10% from Premium, 15% from ticketing to get that 15% operating target as revenue moves around in those things, that might change a little bit. I think we have a lot of levers in order to hit that 15%, but this is where we're starting. This is our base of operations.
Lastly, I want to spend a few minutes talking about key metrics, and then we'll go to Q&A. So metrics to the ad supported business haven't changed. So hopefully, you're well indoctrinated how we talk to the business this way. How many users, driving how many hours? What's the RPM associated with that, multiply that by hours and you get our revenue from our ad supported business. We'll report on those and we'll talk about that, there're a lot of derivatives metrics that we talk about our quarterly basis, sales people, not recording by sales, et cetera. We continue to do that, but if you understand where LPM is, the relationship with RPM and LPM and how that directly drives growth profit margins – contribution margins, then you understand that business.
From a Plus and Premium perceptive, it's a new game. It's really all about ARPU and LPU, which is kind of a new metric we'll be talking about, it's about licensing costs per thousand users, and the spread between those two. So how well are we able to maintain ARPU, price discipline relative to the cost on a per user basis which is that LPU number and that spread, we believe not only from our own operating leverage, but from contractual leverage built into the deals we have with the music industry will increase over time with scale. So you've got to watch for the number of subscribers scale, ARPU price discipline and LPU. How that changes over time relative to ARPU.

If you follow those costs, you'll understand how we're doing from a progress perspective and we will disclose all of those for both Plus and Premium on a quarterly basis. C.P. gave a lot more stats out than he normally would today. We will actually continue to give a lot more. When we go – especially the first recorders when this is all new, about trail starts and conversion rates and changes the return, we're going to be a lot more transparent about how things are going at least through 2017. And so stay tuned for February's earnings call, on exactly how we're going to do that.
We think about milestones, the key milestones are all about RPM on advertising business, how do we get that to $80. Is that our pure margin in that business and subscribers. How do we – how is conversion going to drive 9.5 million Plus subscribers, how is conversion going to drive 11 million Premium subscribers by 2020. Those are critical for driving operating margins.
We need to drive subscriber numbers and if we maintain ARPU, we have the contractual ability to drive real margin average to the bottom-line and that's why operating margins. At the end of day our goal – all these goals lead down to, are we driving a profitable business over the long-term and delivering value to shareholders.
So just to close and then we'll do Q&A. These are large and growing markets and the deals we signed last month, have really opened up brand new revenue opportunities, huge markets, addressable markets for Pandora, that were previously inaccessible. These deals provided predictable cost structure with attractive unit economics that improve with scale, improve with time and they enabled the product suite that really reaches all desires, the way our listeners want to consume music, and those give us a balanced operating model and a clear path to achieving our 2020 targets.
And with that I'm going to ask Tim and C.P. to come up and we'll take any questions you may have. Thank you very much for your time.
Question-and-Answer Session
A - Unidentified Company Representative
Thank you. Before we turn things – I hope one thing I take away from what you've heard today is, this plan has been very methodical for Pandora. We have chosen the time to intersect the market, a lot of what we've built to-date is may not the sexy stuff, radio part doesn't have the bells and whistles of a lot of products that consumers have out there, but we've done the hard work, which is really understanding and building a easy to use personalized service and monetizing heck out of it, and no one comes close to that, and actually [Indiscernible] the probably opportunity [indiscernible] you understand today, massive profitable, addressable user base that's prepared to go after this and there are a lot of time where we can engage with the industry constructively two years, three years, four years ago this conversation was labeled, but has not gone away, did now and we've earned I think our place, earned these deals that we have put in front of them to set us up for this opportunity going forward. So we're proud of about it, we're eager to get to race forward, but hope that comes through today from my presentation. So looking forward to questions.
Mark Mahaney
One long-term question and one shorter-term question. In terms of promoting or getting go into market with Pandora Premium, could you – I think Mike you talked about some efforts. Could you maybe qualify that a little bit more whatever, how you're going to get the word out, how you're going to differentiate this product in the marketplace outside of the product I mean, I guess I'm more talking about the marketing side of it. And then just the near-term stuff, the weakness in the ad revenue again and it looks like it's going to continue in the December quarter, what's the confidence that doesn't continue and bleed into next year, like how do you, it seems like this keeps coming up or may comes up everyone in a while. A little bit more on how you sustain that base or would you just have to go different advertising verticals in order to really grow that business?

Unidentified Company Representative
Great. So, I'll answer the second part and then briefly we want to talk about go-to-market strategy for Premium specifically. So, advertising business is one that has a lot of exogenous characteristics to where we talk to, I mentioned a bunch of it and kind of listed a bunch earlier. It's one of the attractiveness as a subscription business as you can smooth out a lot of that over time. And so having that balance in our operating model is really attractive from that – from a predictability perspective, et cetera. That said, being able to monetize the three user base, the [Indiscernible] is a significant competitive advantage. And being able to continue to do that and to continuing to do that in an increasingly profitable manner is a major priority for Pandora.
Now that takes investment, it takes the investment in sales infrastructure, hiring sales people and take investment and technology in order to make sure you're accessing demand, where it goes. The shift to programmatic two years ago on the mobile display side was an example of that, which we have caught up with. The reality is we're – that always going to be a challenge and that there's admin close in that. But we think that focus, we cannot take our eye out of that ball, because, it's such an important competitive advantage to us. What it will become is less critical to our overall results. And certainly even at a 50-50 revenue split, which is almost you gets – it's a little bit higher than that. I think in our target you get to a 40% advertising in 2020 advertising revenues, but still very material. But the value of a subscription revenue stream, the annuity characteristics of that, I think, are going to really change the way we view kind of the business over time. So it's an important leg that the stores as Tim said so clearly early on, and one we'll continue to invest in, but it will increasingly become less noise in kind of the overall company results.
Unidentified Company Representative
Just to underline that too, [ph] Mark, I think we're just seeing a little bit of growing pains around how to address the advertising market for us. So we [ph] fish in multiple times as a company, right, and performance and digital and local and national spots upfront, and – so you have to aim your [ph] cannon at various times, and you can't always turn the cannon quickly, and so we sometimes also to be slightly out of step with our own demand this year, hours on Pandora were so much more than we had anticipated. And we had planned that here in terms of how invested both in the ad sales team and in technology were a different reality. We learned a lot from this year on that and we are in upfront season as we speak and we're taking those earnings right now into how to address 2017. So, nonetheless makes this concern in the larger level, so let's get efficient more quickly at how we staff and invest on technology, and tech and advertising is a big focus for Kristen and the team going into next year.
Unidentified Company Representative
Yeah absolutely and on the marketing side for Premium, we're very excited about the fact that Nick has joined us and will be out of share more about – more details around how we're going to go to market and reach all the large base that we think we can install to. But at a higher level it's important to understand that we have a lot of listeners on this platform today. So they're visiting our product quarterly at 100 million, monthly 78 million. We talked about the signals we're getting, so we can do really precise almost surgical marketing to reach listeners and tell them about these new offerings and whether it's Plus, it's Premium, we're going to have some very attractive trials, which we're going to, will we'll talk about later, that we think are going to be very appealing to help move listeners up that curve as well. So, great opportunity to sale to listeners who are already using Pandora and trust Pandora. We're also going to bring people back. One of the things that I'm hoping you took away from earlier was that, we've been attracting listeners back to the platform with new content, new capability, new devices and we think that helps reinvigorate our listener base and we have another opportunity to kind of sell to those folks by just talking about how great Pandora is evolving a new and then we have these opportunities to subscribe.

And the great news to you is that, those who try and subscribe, even those who decide may be not can fall right into one of the other tiers are ad supported and can be a loyal listener and we see really good data on those listeners as well. So, it's really building that listener base, selling from those who already visiting us, bringing them back with new content and marketing those things as a key value prop.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi, James [Indiscernible] Partners. As a follow-up to the previous question, can you just go over some metric in terms of how many local ad sales people we have from August, 2015 to August, 2016 and what do you think over the next year and what's the productivity trends with the local sales people?
Unidentified Company Representative
Yeah. So, I think – I finish this quarter with a 154, I think, it might be exactly the same year ago, I don't remember pretty close, I think, we started this year with the 154 leasing at least, then we added a few Q4 last year. It's been essentially flat, largely can say those local sellers are concentrated in the 30 large markets that we largely sold out in most of the inventory they sold historically.
So, we shifted some of the way we impacted in sales going into this year, because we took a $120 million that we could have invested potentially in driving ad sales and into launching Plus and bringing Premium to market early next year. So, that was a conscious decision. It's – we think, we have delayed our ability to penetrate that market by year, but we don't think that we lost any competitive ground from that perspective.
It's too early for me to say what we're going to do next year from that perspective, what I will say is, in those markets where have been essentially sold out in the primary market, we are going to be more aggressive about ad loading those as we bring subscription products to market, which will open up capacity to sale more in the local markets, which is a broadcast buyer.
We also look at new forms of demand as inventory for example on video becomes much more prevalent on Pandora. With all the video demand that's happened over the last few years, we've had very little piece of that because we just don't have – we're an audio platform and the video does, the view ability of the video is hard to justify Pandora and has been historically, that's changed a lot over the last few years with sponsored listening and with the skits and replay functionality, where you have to be engaged with that and we've really grown our access to that market significantly. I think you'll see shifts, maybe not as much in total numbers of sales people add. We're just focused is on driving demand for advertising revenue.
Unidentified Analyst
Some of the mature markets you have, how many are hitting $80 ARPU right now, or what's the max at right now?
Michael S. Herring
All 30 of our top markets, in the 25 to 54 markets are north of $80 from an RPM perspective.
Daniel Salmon
Hi, guys. Dan Salmon from BMO. I have two questions, maybe one kind of nitty-gritty one for Mike and then a bigger picture one maybe for Tim. The nitty-gritty like you talked about the App Store platforms being a great user experience for getting new customers, being much happier with the commission structure there and how it's evolving, but also the long-term opportunity of your own platform. Could you maybe just add a little bit of a color on how you envision taking users from one of those to your own platforms just add a little bit on, I think we all know how the economies would change, but just a user experience and picture that a little bit more is the Ticketfly billing platform build out in your data base of users growth. And then for – just everything here today is largely focused on the U.S. opportunity and the new product, then we didn't want to get into international whole a lot today. But as you look out at those 2020 targets, what's your updated thinking on how international thinks into – fits into that, is there a little bit into it? Is it a lot incremental to that? Just maybe where your head is on that today? Thanks.

Michael S. Herring
So just quickly on the subscription dynamics. If you go back to the first half of the year, when I said 19% essentially of a 19%, 20% of the subscription revenue was paid in commission with Avalon, We'll pretty much tells you about two-thirds of subscriptions are in that purchases. Now, that's a 4 million subscribers. We're about getting to 20 million subscribers by 2020. Obviously some portion of them will be that $20 million, some portion of them will convert through Apple and Google, but there's a whole green deal that how do we develop payment relationships with our listeners over that timeframe. And what's the best way for that listener to pay for their subscription? That's the way we want to focus. How we can – whether we're paying 3.5% to the MasterCard and Visa or paying a smaller percent in PayPal or there's a 1 million to other payment structures out there, we're paying 15% to Apple and Google. The critical piece about driving subscription has been less focused on that, and more focused on driving subscribers has been be less focused on that and more focused on driving subscribers and working with those partners over time.
On interviews look at Apple and Google over the last couple of years. They've changed the way they allow payments structures within their app. They've lowered the percentages they take. As they think about their own app environment and their place in the ecosystem over time, their own priorities are actually much more closely aligned to Pandora than you might think and we're seeing that manifest itself from the lower commissions structure. It's also in the way they allow companies like Pandora who do it right, by the way that's a really important thing, we follow the rules, we work closely with them, to interact with our own users, especially users that have been part of our ecosystem for years. So that's a long answer to say, it's unsure exactly other than most of the subscribers haven't – aren't paying us now that we think are going to drive and lots of opportunity to make sure we're doing it the right way for them in order to convert it to the highest level in the most optimal way to drive profits for Pandora. Tim, you want to answer international?
Timothy Westergren
Yeah, so on your international question, when we launched Pandora for about 18 months back in 2005, we weren't blocking listening internationally. You could log into Pandora, just pretend you're a U.S. resident by typing a fake U.S. zip code and use Pandora. And for 18 months our most popular zip code was 90210 on Pandora by a wide margin. Obviously, it didn't reflect the population in the city of Beverly Hills. There was massive demand for Pandora outside of U.S. It was growing completely word of mouth with of course zero marketing and at that time when we had English language only catalogue. So we were not really international service. So we know the appetite is out there. As a company we are all of course eager to get back to the global experience. That said, we are focused on crushing it here in the U.S. Australia and New Zealand is doing great. We have a great team down there. It's growing well. It's 40% of the market. And these deals are set up so that when we're ready, when labels are ready as addenda you add territories, add countries. But I think we look at it, if we really do own the market here, we are set up to grow as we desire outside the U.S. So we can't take a step at a time, but I think really focusing right now getting these products out, all three of them, getting really got our feet planted here, and then take the next step at the appropriate time.
Christopher Phillips
I just want to add, you mentioned addendum and that's how you grow this business. If you remember iTunes with the U.S. service, and then they are added countries from there over 15 years in order to expand into international territories, it's the natural way of licensing work in the music industry. The key is that in the U.S., we have built the infrastructure to manage the metadata, the royalty calculations, et cetera, just for the U.S. that's directly extensible, so applying it to international royalty structure as well. So we've done all the hard work, made back to like to an ROI, international markets have different challenges, but that core challenge and the ability to actually deliver the product from an infrastructure perspective, at least it's solved largely through the deals we've already got.

Nat Schindler 
Great. Hi. Nat Schindler, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Mike, first, thank you for so much more detail on your long-term plan, but wanted to just ask one question on the ad supported and one question on the Premium. On the ad supported, can you help us out with the inconsistency here looking at your target, which requires even 11 million active users and nearly doubling of ARPU, when active users have been going flat to down, fairly down, basically flat and ARPU is in single-digit growth. How do you jump start that?
And then, on the Premium side, when you look at that target of $15 million not yours, but in the U.S., one-sixth to one-seventh of the U.S. population. How does that compare [Indiscernible] to the music industry, like to talk about $60 of spend prior to on per on average – prior to – on an annual basis prior to the introduction of MP3s, how does that compare though on a median basis? So if I could borrow lingo from our friend [indiscernible] here on how many – where would that fall that $50 million fall in that range?
Unidentified Company Representative
I'll let C.P. talk about the user number in a second. From an RPM perspective, I try to describe why we're confident in increasing that, a big reason is that we think that the advertising opportunity is huge and we're just still in the early days of penetrating that opportunity considering the size of our audience. And frankly, especially on broadcast the weakness in competition.
We have purposefully in order to maintain that user base and not aggressively grown that as much as we could. We grew it to a point in the mid 50s but where we had enough contribution margin coming off of that, part of CRB and through this year to fund the business essentially. That was the first priority over the last three and half years, whereas drive monetization so that we could grow the business using internally generated profits from the ad business as we worked on new products to bring to market.
And I think we've done that extremely well. Ad load being relatively static over the last few years, is probably the biggest factor there. Pricing is also a factor as we reinvest back and grow local markets, which are enabled by ad mode. We introduced ad, much more video inventory, which is 3x the CPMs of audio inventory. So there is a lots of ways we think we can do it, but I think the way we're most comfortable is that we feel like if we had decided instead of going what we did, stay out, supported and statutory rates, we would have invested a lot more in growing the ad business and growing ad RPMs. We think there's a lot of room to do that still out there. From a user grow perspective, you want to talk about that.
Unidentified Company Representative
Yeah. Excuse me. So, I mean, first and foremost, it's start with 100 million listeners that are engaging with us quarterly and that really gives us the rich opportunities to bring the amount and start engaging that more on a monthly basis. So, we already have a big chunk of that in front of us that we have to convert. And I think, one of the things and then of course, it was new listeners who went to bring on there is still a large audience that are listening to a broadcast radio or we also know that the just rise of a lot of the competition is creating awareness. So, when we talk about the fact that we're flat in the last quarter and I've mentioned earlier that our October is actually up. And we're starting to see the growth engines kick in, that's not because we've just kept the same users.
We actually do have some sense of erosion that happens and that's through any service and what we've been finding is that, we have our loyal listeners, but we've been bringing people back in and that – it's bending that curve and capturing more of those folks to come back in and use the offering more often and that's why we were – I was really wanted to make our point around. How we're seeing people come back because of the new futures. They are coming back with a new content programming and really just is like drumbeat, a of new thing is coming on, we think is really key to drive in that growth and our listener activity from the 100 million and from people who won't use in Pandora.

Like some of the new and it's like 10% to 14% of the usage on these new CE devices, our brand new accounts so, it's still – it's a small of it, but it's growing and were city people reengage. And at the end of the day, we know that we've been somewhat operating with hands tied behind our back, because we didn't have licensing to offer certain features that now we're able to unlock in as reported with replacing sched, with our 499 subsription offering and then with premium that have been causing people to start using other services, and so the idea is that having the right offering makes us much more attractive to keep people on platform, reduce the churn off, attract people back, keep them sticky, and that's basically the formula for us bending that curve up, bringing those people in and growing even beyond that, and I think that's where pump that we are seeing the positive trajectory of those things are working and now we just have to kind of keep showing you the results of those capabilities.
Unidentified Company Representative
And just quickly on the last one. Did you want to add to that? So, I mean, the math you're talking about is like 80% of people spend the equivalent of a CD on music prior – until Napster and other things sort of destroyed the CD business. There is lots of sort of lore around what happened to music and we least kind of restore those dollars. Our view is that that market – the music market of tomorrow, it looks nothing like the music market of 1999 before any of that happened, and that's why I think why I just struggled with that number, right?
They've increased their target for 2020, 20% last year to $51 million. I'm glad at the reasonably large number because I can use that mind as a justification for why they're investing these dollars and do we think we can drive that kind of penetration, but the reality is they're using that same math to try and figure these things out and it's changing dramatically. Internally, we try and get it on a lot of different things. We try and get it on consumers' willingness to pay for cable services turning into on-demand video, to consumers willing to pay for serious 20 million people – 30 million people paying for that now. Look at the way it's changed, consumers the way they pay for software now, in subscription business. We changed our whole – we as a consumer base, changed our perspective as to what we pay for, how we measure value over time. That has not got to music yet, it started to. The music subscriptions are starting to get there, but it's still behind in part because there are too many free options that don't monetize while there's too many and there has historically been a lot of piracy in the market. And we taught a whole generation that they don't need to pay for music. As that changes, I think you'll see that market have a totally different shape than the market of 1999, and CDs were still king. It won't be – CDs aren't coming back, but there is a whole new dynamic coming that we believe and we think that the music labels and the publishers and the Pandora have all gotten the same title, let's say that not only cannot be big, but a lot more valuable.
We started thinking about value of annuity stream versus ups and downs of CD releases. So, lots of different ways to think about it. I would drop closer analogies to the evolution in the way videos have changed over time and the way we pay for that. And even services like serious, it was proven once people engage and find value and something and develop habit. They're much more willing to pay for subscription over a long period of time.
Unidentified Company Representative
I'd also add to that. Right now, on demand services are basically 30 million songs in the search box for $10 a month, good luck. And on the surface that sounds like a, wow, the keys for the records for $10 a month. But in fact, that's such as a debilitating consumer experience. And so, a big part of this is solving the easy use problem, and making it intuitive, then that I think is part of attracts the mass consume to the product as well and just to understand what Chris said earlier. Right now, it looks like the growth from this September to October, right now. The last time we grew this fast was five years ago, 2012, when we were in hyper growth. So, year after we went public and our product was growing like a weed. Now with couple of weeks in, like beware of making drawing trajectories so early, but that should at least be indicative of what happens when you start to add features to the product that really do meet the consumer need and we certainly feel like we picked the right ones.

Barton Crokett
Hi, it's Barton Crockett from FBR. I wanted to get your views on the rest of the price composition subscription, with Amazon coming out with the cheap offer, the discount for prime subscribers, competing obviously with the Amazon and Apple is going to need to make money in this business could be a loss leader for other objectives that they might have. So, is there something in the licenses that you think should alleviate our concern about potential price competition in this service.
Unidentified Company Representative
So, I can start and you can add to it. I'll just talk about price composition generally. Having price discipline is important. At this price level, all our testing shows that what matters more is features and functionality and differentiation. And so, within this sort of $8 to $10 range, it's less important that your $2 is cheaper, $3 is cheaper. It's much more important that you're delivering on the right product promise and value proposition.
So, if we deliver on that we think we're in a price point that works for us. I would point out that a lot of that kind of gives a lot of noise if we see how much conversion that happens into smaller population. We're talking about the entire U.S population, not Amazon users or specific group that they are trying to up-sell who are already paying a certain amount, maybe they will pay an additional amount for Amazon Music. I don't know the answer to that question. What I do know is that we do very well on their devices that is in all our price setting shows that kind of price differentiation isn't what matters at the end of the day. The reality though is that most – other than a handful of players most products out there are maintaining that 999 price and when you talk about Apple and such, and then it's important and I think over the long term you're going to see music industry really focused on maintaining that price discipline as an industry because they led that squib over the long term they'll move in the right leverage in order to maintain the revenue streams they're giving even if in the short term there, there being propped up.

That's what I was going to add to that certainly in the context of our conversations, they're sensitive to two things, one is price compression that makes a consumer think it's cheaper and that's not good for the industry, and the second thing is they don't want to wind up being the equivalent of the CD collection in the back of the warmer where you are lastly get someone to walk through refrigerators and toasters to get to the shrinking [ph] sound of music. They know that, right. They look – right now their current partners for whom music is not the focus, and that's going to [Indiscernible] not one of them, they fear the day that one of these folks hand them a term sheet they can't refuse, because of a big distributor. It's been built into their product. They get that, I think woken up to that, and I think they see in Pandora the perfect sort of ally that won't go down that path. So we have an ally I think in them when price disciplined, and the Amazon Echo thing, that's a tiny audience now, right. It's a good price point, but it's addressing a very small audience.
Barton Crokett
Okay. Right. And if I can just ask one other separate question on the numbers. You threw out the $700 million of prepaid is coming at you, could you put a little bit of more flesh on the bones of how much cash burn, this is going to gender over the next couple of years as you're ramping up? And similarly, you talked about the $24 million of extra spend in the fourth quarter, this is a launch, you're spending $120 million on this going into it, is the cost base now next year like $200 million or is that a one-time spend?

Unidentified Company Representative
We'll talk about, it's not a new level of spend, and we'll talk a lot more about that when you we get to February. On the $700 million in sort of those are more commitments over multiple years. So, that's not a check, I guess to write anytime soon. The checks we have to write soon or the $120 million, we've already wrote, that I talked about in cash flow so, and we amortized that pretty quickly. It will – our total funding cost this year becoming like $700 million. So, those kind of prepayments, those commitments are well within the envelope of what we're going to pay over the next few years.
Barton Crokett
These prepayments hit like once a year basically or?
Unidentified Company Representative
It depends. They all dependent came out each deals different. I mean, that's one of the – each deal is different and the terms are confidential. So, I'm trying to give you a picture and the queue will drop in for the obligations at a little more detail on it, but the reality is that they're all over the place in terms of how those payments were structured and how they are recoupable, but they are well within the arm of our expected royalty obligation.
Barton Crokett
Okay. Thanks.
Unidentified Company Representative
Thanks.
Kunal Madhukar
Question on revenue and the – on the advertising side, you talked about the RPM going up significantly from current levels. And you talked about video as well as local as well as sponsored radio being the key drivers of value. How are you thinking in terms of how much video contribution would be to that increase in RPM versus sponsored listing versus local?
Unidentified Company Representative
I think ad load will be the dominant piece of that. So, over the last year or so, the biggest driver of RPM growth has really been pricing. As we kept ad load pretty tight over that timeframe and we just increased pricing through things like Sponsored Listening increases pricing. So, when we think about RPM, it's really price times quantity divided by hours. So, in order to increase RPM, we need price or quantity to increase to drive revenue, and hours stay at the same, as hours go up as it has, it's the headwind in the RPM, one of the reasons RPM has grown lower is that our denominator that hours has grown very quickly this year. But when you think about pricing and quantity, quantity is the ad load increases, something that we've kept relatively tame over the last two years and we focused on price. I think that's going to shift a little bit. So, we're asking what's going to have that larger effect. It's the things that we're going to do around ad load, which is increasing opportunities to insert video ads through value-added – value propositions through listener as well as just increasing overall ad load through technology improvements like Kronos, which increases ad load through intelligent insertions, you heard a lot about that today as well as just overall increasing envelope of total potential ads, someone might see in and [indiscernible] .
Kunal Madhukar
Thank you.
Unidentified Company Representative
Sure.
Mike Graham
Hey, it's Mike Graham from Canaccord. Thanks for all the info today. I wanted to ask you about the interplay between the ad business and the subscription businesses. It seems like in the early days most of the new subscribers will be up sales and then later on you might have to market for like fresh listeners in to Pandora, I'm wondering if that's the way you're looking at and in those early days have you made an assumption about the ad supported listeners that come over, are they high RPM, low RPM are you just assuming average and then as a quick follow on to that. In the slide you put up about the amount of contribution process that drops to operating profits, it look like it was lower for the subscription products and I'm wondering if the difference there is marketing spend, like you expect longer-term, that you are going to have to spend a lot to get those subscribers?

Unidentified Company Representative
Yeah. So start with the last one. There is some assumptions around subscription conditions that effect that number, which is one it's harder to drive leverage on to know we will. Like we make some assumptions, but they're relatively conservative as to what the mix is between an app versus to the question earlier. So, we take some very conservative views on that, we think there is upside there as we work closely with Apple and Google to improve that.
In terms of which listeners migrate, I'll tell you there is a two-prong approach. One is incredibly detailed approach that says, well with this population it moves and probably then we convert three times higher here than we do here, because there is a propensity to pay for a box or you just take a blanket number.
Over time, the difference is actually relatively small because the number of views are so big. If you had 30 million users and you are converting 10 million, it'd be a much bigger deal. When you have 80 million users and you are converting 10 million, but impact to overall add RPM, even if all 10 million come out of the 30 million to 40 million. There are your highest RPM users. The impact over the ad business is meaningful, but it's not enough for you to worry about, oh! I shouldn't target those people aggressively.
Historically, that was different, recent target or used to a month ago, target users who listened a lot, we would not try and up-sell them because the activities, the subscription relatively made was based on a per stream basis. So these stream 70 hours or more, we lost money on you as a subscriber, the old Netflix problem, where they lost money on their best subscriber. This was 15 years ago for Netflix, right. Different world and a streaming world. Well, different world and Pandora post Labor Day world, where now it's no longer based on that streaming. So those high volume listeners we can convert, if those high volume listeners happen to be at a very valuable segment from an advertising perspective, you might say, well, we're going to beat them there and increase advertising there and make more money off of them. There is a direct correlation with churn and retention associated with that, and if you can decrease churn and the propensity for that person is stay with Pandora for a longer period of time, if you convert them, even if you come at a lower – it would have to be a pretty big swing, even if you come over it at a lower contribution margin, you just decrease churn like 50 basis points, the lifetime value is still higher on a subscription business.
And you have to think about optimizing the portfolio product based upon lifetime value, that's why go to the trouble of calculating those numbers and it's from – it's vibrant that we spend the time to just try and talk about that concept here, because we're not throwing products out there and hoping people convert doing it blindly. We're priced, we have a go-to-market strategy. We have built a royalty structure that optimizes as we move up that chain in every – and mainly there is a five people in New York that don't qualify for what I just told you. But when you think about when you put in churn and retention, customer delight into the equation, then you have a balanced portfolio where you can optimize where users will retain the longest, that's always the better choice for the business and that's our approach and I think that that's going to prove out to be the right one over the long term.
Unidentified Company Representative
And just to put a final point on that, engagement and churn are inversely related, right? And the great challenge that all subscription services are facing now is churn, their hunger for – they would kill for the engagement we have on Pandora. To get engagement, they do stuff like saying, how do they stay listening, here's this and here's that, and here's that, come back, come on, spend more time because they know if they can get you using it just like a health club, eventually you're going to sign off. We go into this business, the kings of engagement. So as Mike said, yes, highly engaged is a valuable asset for a user, but that engagement will translate to a lower churn on subs. That's a good business.

So I think we have solved the hardest problem. Not to repeat ourselves, I think it embarrasses repeating, we have spent 17 years building a product that's addictive. We know how to play music for people, how to engage and how to keep them. That's the hardest part. Now we go in and take that into these new products in a way no one else can do, and it gives us I think a level of flexibility and go to market that just no one else has. So, I'm glad you asked that question, the cornerstone question for us.
Unidentified Company Representative
Yeah. And one additional piece on that I suspect you guys both agree with all of that, is on how we're marketing and talking, so it's not just pure farming of those monthly listeners and moving them over. As we talked about, we have a number of listeners who use us less often and maybe move from the monthly active to a quarterly active, and some of that's being driven because they're speaking other platforms to solve these on-demand needs. We see a lot of people, and back to the competitive question earlier using multiple services, so we really not had the capability that we know is directly pointing to why people might have slowed down some of their use. They still come back, we still keep engaging them, so a lot of it is bringing them back in, selling them. So while we are talking to our existing base, and we have the opportunity to sell them, we're also bringing people back in and we're tracking new, and we have this really great relationship with them, which is why so many people came back and use Thumbprint Radio, like Oh! man I love Pandora, it's so perfect, and they fall in love again, and that's the kind of story we can have whether they go back in and use ad-supported more, but they come back in fresh and they take Plus or Premium. So it is hunting and farming, is part of the game plan.
Unidentified Analyst
Hi. It's a [indiscernible] Partners. Just two follow-up questions. Number one, I know it's early days for the skip and replay ad-supported products. Are there any data points that you have? And number two, varying now between – between now and 2020, do you anticipate that we'll have to have another capital raise?
Unidentified Company Representative
I'll take maybe the first question. So earlier in the presentation we talked about we are seeing some really great interaction with replays and skips. Even though our marketing engines are just now kicking in to tell our listeners about these feature, both on platform and off platform. Earlier we talked about 5% of our actives even this is the first few weeks, are already starting to use skips and replays, and is driving 7% increase in video ad capacity from that use. So that is a great single on something brand new because you've got to get new – you've got to get your listeners using your new things.
And the whole idea is that we feel pretty good that we're doing a great job getting people to our new things, but we can do way more, there is a tons of headroom.
Unidentified Analyst
[Question Inaudible]
Unidentified Company Representative
Yeah. Exactly. So that's video ads load.
Unidentified Company Representative
In video ad because you have to engage with the video ad in order to unlock that handful of replay and unlock that handful of skips. And then using those triggers and upsell where you get hey, we felt that you love replay, you might love our 499 offering. So as that starts to kind of more awareness, people start to oh! my gosh I can replay a song, they started to replay all the time. It gives us multiple touch points over time to start to talking about subscribing. And if they don't subscribe, that's okay, we're making more money with those video ads, and we're keeping them from leaving our app and going to YouTube. I mean that's why adding value to each of the tiers in our lineup is so important.

And just to your second question before we [indiscernible] spend a little time on the cash flow statement or the cash flows for the quarter. We have committed to new obligations in these deals, but they are well within the envelope of our operating model, as we see it's going to occur. So, right now we don't see any current need to raise additional capital.
Peter C. Stabler
Thanks very much. Peter Stabler, Wells Fargo. One on engagement for Chris, and then one on advertising for Mike. On the engagement side, Chris. I think your slide showed that for the ad supported model, you didn't assume that engagement was going to increase much over the next couple of years from 22 hours. So just wondering, do you think the improvements you've made to the ad supported products, could increase engagement? And then, how are you currently thinking about the car opportunity, which I think a lot of us have looked at over the years, and thought about the 40% of radio that's happening in the car, when do you access that in a more meaningful fashion? And then, I got one for Mike on ad spend.
Unidentified Company Representative
So, I mean we do think that engagement hours are going to grow. I mean Mike showed us one of the options that can really help us achieve a lot more amortization opportunities as the hours growth. And really that's one of the things we're most excited about, and what we're seeing in 2016 is we're bringing people back in, and they're spending more time, they are engaging more. So, we do believe that hours will go up and that's a good thing. Our average hours per listener is increasing. So Dave, did you wanted to add.
Unidentified Company Representative
Yeah. I just wanted to add.
Unidentified Company Representative
You answer, and I'll go to the audio question.
Unidentified Company Representative
Okay. So there is also a modeling aspect of this, which is we definitely assume that people – the higher their engagement as an ads per user, their propensity subscribe is higher. They're going to hit more conversion points, they're going to use things like skips and replays more frequently. And when we build that into our conversion model, that – those people will have 30 hours or 40 hours a month or have a much higher propensity subscriber as so many [indiscernible] as you can.
So even though it might look like, oh!, ad product is not growing, it's really because it's a shift of the conversion, the subscribers that are converting are the higher use. And if you look at the average hours per user from a subscriber perspective, it's around 50. And – by the way, all these slides are going to be available to be downloaded in PDF afterwards. So all these numbers would be available to torching with over the next few years.
Peter C. Stabler
Great. That's helpful.
Unidentified Company Representative
And on auto, do you want to me to talk about auto?
Peter C. Stabler
Yeah. That's correct.
Unidentified Company Representative
So, I think, we – we're really excited about auto and CE as I mentioned earlier. And actually coming soon, I'm not going to kind of promise any specific date, but I can tell you, there will be a drumbeat of a new connected cars coming on with GM and Honda, and so forth. So, they're kind of rolling out different models and different time periods, but literally over the upcoming months and quarters, you'll see more connected cars come on line with Pandora lid up and we see really great engagement when you could actually leave your phone at home, and your car has Pandora rolling. So, that is – we think that the repeat use, the engagement can get deeper with the emergence with to the connected car, but we also are seeing more and more engagement with people using their phone, and continue to kind of tether into their speakers using their phone. So, we're going to invest on multiple fronts in how capture more of the listening in the car. We actually think that even our move into the podcast theme and spoken where we see a lot of people engagement in that kind of content during drive times. So, think of it as it's like making it really easy to access. Think about it as having the right content and creating awareness around that, we see there was a lot of upside and a lot of that is kind of just engines, they're going to kind of keep cranking out results that ultimately map out and grow.

Peter C. Stabler
Right. Then Mike on the advertising side and you said 25% in revenue this quarter on a local side, local accounts were about 90%...
Unidentified Company Representative
28%, sorry.
Peter C. Stabler
I'm sorry, 28%.
Unidentified Company Representative
Yeah. If I've said 25% I apologies, 28%.
Peter C. Stabler
My mistake 28%. So, when we think about the market, about 90% of our audio advertising is local, whether it's spot local or national local. Just wondering if you're looking at the market any differently now than you were a couple of years ago, where do you think that 28% could go over the next couple of years and as your enthusiasm from the local audio ad market then develops. Thanks.
Unidentified Company Representative
Yeah. Despite the fact that we are a number of local sellers hasn't grown in the year or nearly a year. Our enthusiasm has never been more so, frankly for the local opportunity, it does take more work, we do think there is a self serve opportunity long-term local. So, we think it's definitely a north of 50% of broadcast revenue.
Certainly it is going to come from that channel, at the end the enthusiasm in the field, I was just recently took our Detroit team out there who is neck and neck with Dallas, in terms of our top performing regional offices, right now in terms of 2016 performance and they are as bullish as they ever have been. So, you ever want to feel good about yourself as a Pandora employee go meet with our sales people in the field, but that makes me think that, like there is a lot of room to grow there. We need to enable that through technology through ad load. There is a lot of pieces that still have to happen to make that work well. The block, heavy blocking and tackling getting to this point, I heard an amazing effort by our sales team to get to where we are today to continue the momentum they've had. The enthusiasms there and we think that will continue to grow, I definitely think it will be more than 50% over time.
Unidentified Company Representative
And definitely – one of my own focus as a CEO is definitely nailing that local. We look back in hindsight at this year – how it planned for this year, projected our inventory and how you've hired, didn't accordingly in local, I can answer, you do that differently. I've been probably on a 500 sales calls over my lifetime at Pandora. I've been to the local [indiscernible] as discounter in Dallas with a local seller. And if you just look kind of squint at our business, where is the math of opportunity is there. And you talked as somebody has been at Pandora for a year that come over from Clear Channel of Cumulus or what not. If that got, really want us take, and that we'll take it. They're going to their same customers, but they have been selling broadcast radio and they're putting firmness portfolio of ad products that have targeting and reporting all these is itself evident, if that is a massive competitive advantage. So, now I have been pushing the tech team like we're going to invest in power that capability at Pandora. We should be crushing that opportunity to sort of over inducting as a company and how we drive revenue locally. So, we're learning things every year and we have to kind of enjoy to get that right, but we'll see it, I think really being laser focused on accessing that opportunities in that.
Doug Anmuth
Thanks. Doug Anmuth from JP Morgan. Mike, just a couple of questions on the cost side. On the ad supportive business, what's the right way to think about LPMs going forward, is that stable or is that increased with CPI over time. And then secondly, I think you showed the content costs for Pandora Plus coming down over time in the longer term model. How does that work and other certain hurdle rates you need to hit for that perhaps.

Unidentified Company Representative
So, to get questions on so you'll see that our LPMs get to a higher level than $33 by 2020 in the model, that's assuming a CPI increase somewhere to what's built into the CRB over the same timeframe. So, that's exactly what is in our assumptive model for 2020, and then for both Plus and Premium, the royalty structures change over time depending on scale.
And there does – a very important aspect of our fields with the music industry in order to align both our incentives to grow in certain ways and also to help fund our ability to grow those businesses by making the return on making those investments higher. So if I get better returns for hitting a certain levels of subscribers over time, because I – my content cost go down and we're willing to invest in that now, right. You can calculate a lifetime value of a customer at a certain contribution margin, you compare that to a customer acquisition cost, that's the mechanism which justifies that marketing spend, where that conversion, allocation from advertising to subscription, and a lot of things CP said here.
That's a big part of what we spent the last two years, was getting the music industry to understand and buy into that strategy, where if you want big subscription businesses to thrive out there and pay you $2 billion a year, which we're forecasting paying the music industry by the time we get to 2020. So that's where we go in and we say, we're not here to ask for price rates, we're saying, let's put a structure in place that rewards us for driving a business that's going to pay – go from paying $700 million a year, this year to $2 billion a year on an annuity basis only four years from now. And by the way, that can only happen if we are making money on the bottom-line perspective and have the right incentives to drive the right growth. And that's why those things are built in that way. I can't give you specific milestones and exactly what drives that because the terms are confidential, but the philosophy behind the way we structured these deals and built the relationships with the labels and the publishers was based upon that central tenant.
Doug Anmuth
Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on – recognize this is a multiyear process, and I kind of think about 2017 as the first normalized year...
Unidentified Company Representative
Let's hope so.
Doug Anmuth
Hope so. But within that context, can you help us think about near-term profitability or loss? So, you saw the ranges in 2020. They're almost as big for 2017 in this context of subscription numbers, and Premium, adoption, et cetera. So, we will give some idea around that in the February call. But it will be definitely range based. We will have – we'll be 90 days into Plus really on our earnings call from Q4. And so, we'll have probably a lot more information and talk of – what's that...?
Unidentified Company Representative
Premium.
Unidentified Company Representative
No, 90 days of Plus.
Unidentified Company Representative
Right.
Unidentified Company Representative
Premium would be – it's going to launch early 2017. So we'll have just launched Premium, we'll have 90 days of Plus experience. We can be a little more definitive about expectations for subscription growth, shifting from our user growth generally. We've seen some good initial things over the next first 30 days, but it's a data point, not a trend at this point, but we like the data point. So it's hard for me to say now and it's going to be hard for me to say that, it's impossible for me to say that, maybe the best way of putting it. We've built the structure to optimize this business over the long term. How we get there in the trajectory to which we achieve these milestones that drive the target margins that we expect, those are going to be self-evident through acquisition and that's why we laid out the metrics that we're going to share so you can measure our progress and evaluate our performance and hold this accountable and the milestones that we think we need to reach $80 RPM, things like that, certain milestones in terms of subscriber numbers in order to achieve that level of profitability and that level of revenue growth. We'll know more in February, we'll know a little bit more as each quarter kind of unfolds, we'll try and be transparent as possible, but it's too hard for me to say right now and will do the best we can over time.

Unidentified Company Representative
Okay, thanks.
Unidentified Company Representative
Thanks, Doug.
Operator
Great. [indiscernible] do you have any final questions in the room, but we have one from the web from Jason Helfstein of Oppenheimer.
Jason Helfstein
Do you believe that the Swedish-based company that is currently negotiating – renegotiating this deal, is that the music industry is trying to shut down the free service the premium or simply get compensated at the level of the ad supported for that usage?
Unidentified Company Representative
I think what you're going to start seeing is discipline from the industry around requiring all sort of parts music services to be value accretive to the business. So in our case, we have an ad supported foundation that we're upselling from, we make money on from which we generate large royalties. Companies will not be able to get away with over time on monetized funnels that are essentially not only loss creators, they are also the ones that train consumers that music is not – has no value. Perhaps in even more damaging effect of those things and everything we are hearing from the industry is they really want to be disciplined about that, so I think we're going to see more and more deals as it going to affect every company in doing this. Some already have this discipline, are very sort of cut and drive out of that's just going to get more and more I think constrained.
Unidentified Analyst
It's [ph] Tony Gruff from Stifel. I just had one question on the cost structure reconciling a few things in a deck. Mike you mentioned that subscriptions won't be incorporating usage-based charges anymore, but there is a slide in the deck, which is Pandora Plus deals are now based on percentage of revenue per sub minimum or a per track rate. So, I just want to reconcile. Is it just a Premium that does not user space.
Unidentified Company Representative
Yeah. It's – so I can't seek specifically to the term, but the royalty rates associated with that are based on calculations that are based on the ARPU of the consumer and so do not fluctuate with usage stacks. So, that in terms of modeling that's a way I think about it, in terms of performance, the way to think about it.
Unidentified Analyst
Yes. Thanks.
Unidentified Company Representative
Sorry. I can't answer to you directly.
Unidentified Company Representative
All right. Thank you all for joining us. We invite you to head downstairs and enjoy some refreshments and some music. We have...
Unidentified Company Representative
Maybe before we adjourn. Thank you all again for spending so much time with us today. We have some alcohol downstairs to ease the pain. Really I appreciate your comment here. We're going to hang out to take any additional questions. I hope you sense kind of our excitement and confidence of what's ahead. We don't – we feel like as might – we done a kind of foundational work, really, really hard stuff, and we feel to adopt to expand the business. So, thanks a lot.

Pandora's Long Strange Trip


Online radio that's cool, addictive, free, and-just maybe-a lasting business.

Radio On Pandora founder Tim Westergren seeks headphone blissâ€”and a business model that works.
CREDIT: Michael Edwards







Michael Edwards
Iâ€™m With the Band Most of Pandoraâ€™s analysts are professional musicians. They all work part time. 



Michael Edwards
Close Listeners Pandora analysts rate songs on the basis of 400 different qualities at a rate of no more than six songs per hour. 











Tim Westergren is due to take the stage in an hour, yet he seems half asleep. His shoulders are rolled forward, his hair floppy and unbrushed, and he's wearing loose blue jeans and scuffed hiking boots. He ambles around the auditorium he's rented at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art while the staff of Pandora, the online radio company he founded, buzzes around him. The salespeople smile at the advertisers, the biz-dev folks pump the arms of partners, the engineers form a nervous little knot. Meanwhile, the crowd gathering outside the auditorium doors keeps getting larger.
Pandora has been around in one form or another since 1999 and has spent most of its existence on the brink of shutting down. Yet Westergren has always found a way to rescue his company and infuse it with new hope, new direction. Tonight is one more of those times: Pandora's biggest product launch since its debut. The company is announcing a move into mobile products, which will let listeners access their personalized radio stations over Sprint (NYSE:S) phones or Sonos and Slim Devices in-home music players.
Finally, at 6:45, the doors open and Westergren, 41, snaps to life. Most companies have customers. Pandora has fans. Nearly 300 of them stream in to hear what Westergren has to say. There are guys in short-sleeve button-downs, a red-haired middle-aged woman who's brought her digital camera, a man with long ropey dreadlocks, a girl with highlighted hair and precise bangs, and a couple with a tiny baby sucking a pacifier. They look more like they're headed to a downtown wine bar than to a high-tech product launch. The fact that they've given up their Tuesday night to listen to Westergren suggests that he has built something unique.
With almost all the seats filled, Westergren takes the stage. He's donned a jacket for his moment in the spotlight, although it's teal, zip-up, and made of fleece. "I'm Tim Westergren, and I'm the founder of Pandora," he says. The audience claps and shouts. "So I've done a bunch of these town halls, and I am jacked up," he says. "Ask any questions you have about the company. The more we can, sort of, talk to each other, the better." He means it. As Westergren details the battered history of his company, the crowd laughs and claps and oohs and aahs. Westergren has that rare talent of seeming chatty and intimate with an audience of hundreds. Listeners raise their hands and suggest ways that Pandora might outwit regulators; others volunteer to view more ads on their Pandora radio players if that will help the company make money. It's tough to imagine even the most rabid consumers, like Apple's customers, offering to view more advertising. Now it's up to Westergren to turn that adulation into action to save his company once again.
He's in a common enough position. He's trying to make a real business of this product he passionately believes in, but he's never quite gotten his baby out of start-up mode. Still, after eight years of being tossed around, Westergren isn't talking about just making Pandora turn the corner. He wants to make it huge.
Pandora has developed a proprietary method to analyze music--Westergren calls it the music genome--that lets users create online radio stations generated by the software's recommendations. Tell Pandora your favorite song is "Casey Jones" by the Grateful Dead, and within seconds it will create a station--Casey Jones Radio--that streams nonstop songs from artists such as the Youngbloods, the Byrds, and the Beatles, along with stuff you might not expect, like R.E.M., the Jam, and Tom Petty. It's undeniably cool and completely addictive, but Pandora has never quite found its footing as a business. Indeed, the company has been through an almost unbelievable number of setbacks, a series of blows that would make the most determined entrepreneur throw in the towel. Westergren has run out of money, which forced to him to lay off his entire staff (except for those willing to work for free). He's been rejected some 350 times by venture capitalists. He has faced bankruptcy, haggled with anxious creditors, and been sued by employees. Deal after deal has fallen through at the last minute.
Yet somehow Westergren has managed to amass more than eight million very enthusiastic listeners, advertisers like Microsoft and Lexus, and a database of some 500,000 songs. Over the years, he's raised more than $30 million in funding, most recently an undisclosed amount from Hearst Interactive Media, the media company's venture capital arm, in 2006. "I've got to give Tim the all-time award for persistence. I probably turned him down at least three or four times," says Peter Gotcher, a venture capitalist who eventually participated in a $12 million round in 2005. "I liked his passion and entrepreneurial spirit." Call it passion, spirit, an obstinate refusal to quit. It's kept Pandora alive.
But now, just when Westergren thought he'd finally moved Pandora into safe territory, he's facing his biggest battle yet: steep hikes in music royalty rates that were announced earlier this year. Every time Pandora plays a song, it must pay a small fee to the music's publisher, songwriter, performer, and label. Westergren has lobbied Congress and organized a grass-roots campaign of millions of Internet radio listeners. Why the urgency? The rate hike has sent Pandora's operating expenses soaring and threatens to silence Pandora for good.
Westergren plays the piano, the bassoon, the recorder, the drums, and the clarinet. His personal Pandora stations are based on songs by Muddy Waters, Ben Folds, Josh Fix, Oscar Peterson, Art Farmer, Elvis Costello, and James Taylor. He studied music at Stanford--Stan Getz was one of his professors--and graduated in 1988 with a deep understanding of music theory and computer applications for music, and a notion that he could somehow make money as a musician. He played piano in a series of taking-themselves-seriously acoustic rock bands called Late Coffee and Oranges, Barefoot, and Yellowwood Junction. But after years of driving a van all over the West Coast, crashing in friends' basements, he became frustrated with how hard it was to get noticed. Band life fell apart in 1995.
Westergren started composing scores for low-budget independent films, and that's when he began thinking differently about music. He'd ask directors about the sounds they were searching for and listen as otherwise articulate, creative people struggled to find the right words, usually falling back on descriptions like "something like Natalie Merchant, but more scary." Sitting at his piano, trying to evoke a frightening Natalie Merchant, Westergren thought about what terms such as "scarier" and "darker" and "happier" meant in purely musical terms. Would changing the rhythm, the melody, or the alto sax arrangement produce the desired result? If so, then wouldn't it be possible to create a giant database of music based on its underlying characteristics, which would make it easier for listeners to find exactly what they were looking for?
Around the same time, he read an article about the plight of singer-songwriter Aimee Mann. Though Mann's two previous records had sold a respectable 227,000 copies and won critical acclaim, her record label was refusing to release her current effort; it was focusing instead on blockbuster artists with sales in the millions. For Westergren, Mann's story brought back bitter feelings about Yellowwood Junction, which had built a strong following in the western United States but had no way to get its music out to larger audiences. "All the ideas that had been swimming in my head coalesced at that point," he says.
Lucky for him, it was 1999, and everyone in the Bay Area seemed to be starting a company. Westergren founded his, Savage Beast Technologies, with two friends, Jon Kraft and Will Glaser. Kraft, who'd already started and sold a tech business, helped Westergren sketch out a business plan, Glaser worked on the software, and Westergren worked on the music.
His premise was that music could be broken down in an objective way by trained musicians; he called his effort the Music Genome Project, a riff on the drive to map human DNA. Westergren began by thinking about how any musician would describe a piece of music and came up with about 600 qualities. He hired a professional musicologist to refine the approach and Glaser created an algorithm based on the work. The system now includes about 400 different "genes" for each genre (pop, classical, jazz, and hip-hop) that break down the music's form, the instruments used and their tone (is the saxophone gravelly?), the level of virtuosity, and the overall mood and style. (For classical music, is the mood pastorale, giocoso, or agitato? For jazz, is there an R&B or a smooth jazz influence?) It analyzes lyrical content, along with harmony, rhythm, and pretty much any other factor you can think of. Westergren was insistent on having humans analyze each song, arguing that computers alone would not be able to pick up the nuances and mood. Analysts rate each song on a 10-point scale on each of the 400 attributes. Those ratings constitute the song's musical DNA, which is entered into a database. The goal is to point listeners toward music they might enjoy based on an analysis of what they already like.
The question was how to make money with this thing. In 2000, Westergren pitched the company as an e-commerce site that would recommend music based on the genome, and in March he raised $1.5 million in venture capital. Two weeks later, the stock market crashed, rendering an underfunded e-commerce site a very bad idea. The next four years saw a plethora of different business plans for Pandora. "The first day I started, I sat down with Tim and I said tell me about the product," says Dan Lythcott-Haims, who joined Westergren in 2000 and is now Pandora's creative director. "He said, 'No, you tell us about the product.' There was no product, just a loose idea." Westergren set out to license the genome to other sites as a recommendation engine, but after more than a year his efforts resulted only in a meager $20,000 development fee from Barnes & Noble.com. His next idea was to put the technology into in-store kiosks at music retailers. At the end of 2002, Westergren reached a licensing deal with AOL Music, and Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) chose Pandora over 15 competitors to run a trial kiosk program. Both deals stretched payments out over a few years.
But Pandora already was deep in debt and the cash problems continued to mount. By this point, Jon Kraft had left and Westergren had about 15 employees and 30 part-time music analysts on staff. He paid office rent from his own checkbook. The only solution he could think of was asking employees to defer their salaries. "There was this core group of people that just believed in it. There was no quitting," says Lythcott-Haims. Westergren, meanwhile, kept knocking on the doors of VCs. He's a likable guy, casual and well-informed, but the VCs objected to his business plan, in its third iteration by now. Gotcher, for example, thought there were only a handful of customers in either the licensing or the kiosk business. "But I also thought Tim was a refreshing entrepreneur," he says. "Most entrepreneurs, if you bring up a flaw in the business model, will just adamantly try to claim they've got it all figured out. Tim said, 'Well, that's our best idea right now.' It was a good reaction."
But the situation at the company was increasingly dire. At the end of 2003, four former employees slapped Pandora with a lawsuit. They'd discovered that deferring salaries was illegal, a possibility Westergren hadn't even considered. He had to argue his case before the California Division of Labor Standards, which forced him to settle with the employees with the last of his remaining money. He let the rest of the employees go, though a few true believers continued to pitch in.
By now, Westergren had pitched Pandora to venture capitalists about 350 times and had finally learned to hint that his was a hot investment, that other VCs were about to pour money into it. The Best Buy trial was also showing good results, and Westergren convinced Walden Venture Capital to lead an $8 million round in 2004. The money meant that Westergren could hand out salary checks for $60,000 or $80,000 to employees who had been working for free. Meanwhile, he and the board decided to bring in a new CEO. They tapped Joe Kennedy, a former Saturn executive, in spring 2005. Hiring a CEO with consumer experience turned out to be a prescient move. Six months after Kennedy joined, deals with Borders (NYSE:BGP) and Best Buy fell through, and the company once again had to reinvent itself. Having exhausted their business-to-business ideas, Kennedy and Westergren turned to the consumer market, where online radio was an obvious option. The company decided to develop a website offering personalized radio stations and charge $36 a year for subscriptions.
Pandora radio runs counter to nearly every Internet trend. It eschews automation in favor of actual human musicians doing data entry. Unlike rival webcasters such as Last.fm, Mog, and Rhapsody, it ignores social networks and the wisdom of crowds in favor of expert selection. "It's profoundly unscalable. Our method is really absurd in that regard," Westergren says. "That was the VCs' biggest objection: How could you use this approach given how much music is out there? In the end, the only way to answer that question is to look at the experience itself and to ask, does this approach give you noticeably better results?" The site has a simple interface that asks users to enter a song or an artist they like. Pandora then streams a radio station that plays songs with a similar genome profile; you can give thumbs-up or thumbs-down votes to guide Pandora or add additional seeds. Say you're in the mood for a power ballad and enter Guns N' Roses' "Patience" as the seed song. Pandora will begin streaming similar songs that are slow, heavy on guitar, and cool sounding: "Distant Mornings" by Gustav and the Seasick Sailors, a Swedish rock band with slight folk influences, and "Hell Just Ain't the Same" by Theory of a Deadman, a Canadian band. It delivers surprises--you're tempted to dismiss Cat Stevens's "Hard Headed Woman" immediately, but then you find that it does sound kind of like "Patience." You also can direct Pandora. If, for instance, you want more power and less ballad, you can give Cat the thumbs-down or add another seed--say, Aerosmith's "What It Takes." Now the mix changes to Meat Loaf, U2, and, surprisingly, Guided By Voices and Dinosaur Jr., a pair of postpunk bands that fit in well.
The genome doesn't work perfectly, as Westergren admits. When you enter an eclectic artist like the Beatles as a seed, the system doesn't know which direction to take--do you want psychedelia like "Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds," British Invasion pop like "Love Me Do," or electric blues like "Yer Blues"? And for some reason it misfires altogether with Beck and Frank Zappa. Still, when you seed a station with a song, rather than an artist, and use the thumbs-up or thumbs-down ratings to guide the system, you end up with hours upon hours of very good radio.
Pandora launched in September 2005. After a quiet rollout to friends and family, the company had to double capacity three times in the first week. "Nobody--nobody--had dreamed it would be as popular as it was," says Lythcott-Haims. E-mails poured in, gushing about how cool it was.
Unfortunately, Westergren's latest business model turned out, again, to be not so cool. Pandora offered listeners 10 hours for free before requiring them to subscribe, but users easily could log in with different e-mail addresses and continue getting the free version. Fortunately, by now Westergren was a pro at, as he puts it, "jumping to another lily pad." Pandora scrapped the subscription model and decided to make money via advertisements on its site. Users interacted with the site a lot to rate songs or refine their stations, and every time they did so, Pandora could load a new ad. It could offer advertisers segmentation, so a Lexus ad would be shown on a jazz station, while a BET Awards ad would be shown on a rap station. Soon the company was doubling the number of listeners every month. Investors liked the new model and gave the company another $12 million. "That was the most enjoyable year of my adult life," Westergren says. Pandora was working at last. But just over a year later, it would be in crisis mode again.
Westergren was taking a bus to work on March 2 when his Treo buzzed with a news alert. He read it and called Joe Kennedy right away, frantic. The Copyright Royalty Board--an arm of the Library of Congress that oversees radio stations' royalty payments--had changed the amounts that Internet radio stations had to pay. Web radio stations are charged on a per listener, per hour basis. Starting next year they will be charged on a per listener, per song basis. Pandora's costs will almost triple, to about three cents an hour for each listener. The CRB also added a new charge of $500 a year per individual station--which in Pandora's case, with its millions of personalized channels, would be catastrophic. The new fees would triple Pandora's costs and Westergren and Kennedy debated shutting down immediately. At the new rates, says Kennedy, "the business model falls apart."
SoundExchange, the body that collects royalties for the recording industry, is lobbying for the increase, arguing that artists and songwriters need to be paid when their music airs. Online broadcasters agree that some payment is necessary, but argue that it should be at rates they can afford; they insist that they're helping market music that wouldn't otherwise be heard. Westergren, for his part, finds the rate change inherently unfair. AM/FM broadcasters pay royalties only to publishers and songwriters, not to artists or labels. Satellite radio stations pay a flat fee of less than 4 percent of revenue for royalties. But the new system charges Web broadcasters based on a range of factors, many of them on the esoteric side, such as whether use of the service serves to promote or substitute for record sales, and the fees tend to be higher. At an emergency meeting, some board members argued that the company should fight the rates; others suggested striking separate deals with the record labels themselves, which was deemed unrealistic. Pandora uses music from more than 6,000 different labels; it would be impossible to arrange agreements with all of them.
Westergren rallied. He began by calling other webcasters, who together founded SaveNetRadio, then hired a D.C. lobbying firm, Qorvis, which has done work for AOL, Amazon.com, and Halliburton, to get behind it. The firm helped place op-eds and solicit endorsements from nearly 7,000 artists and managers. It arranged a tour of Capitol Hill, where small groups of broadcasters and musicians met with congressional staffers, explaining their side of the story. The coalition also named June 26 a day of silence for Web radio; when listeners tuned in to Pandora, Yahoo Music, Live365, and other online broadcasters, they'd hear no music, just a message telling them about the rate changes and directing them to contact their representatives.
Westergren realized he had a huge weapon in his arsenal: his customers. Westergren sends a welcome e-mail to everyone that signs up. It's an automated e-mail from an alias address, but whenever anyone replies, he replies back. Last year, when he was touring the country looking for new music, Westergren decided to begin holding meetings with listeners. He'd choose a locale, post it on the Pandora blog, and invite anyone in the area to attend. Four people attended the first meetup in Austin, but as he traveled to a senior center in Phoenix, a taco joint in San Antonio, and a lecture hall at MIT, the groups grew, and soon dozens, even hundreds, of listeners were attending. All the effort spent courting nonpaying customers might seem excessive, but it lets Pandora spend next to nothing on marketing. In any case, the listeners responded. Some have become so fanatic that they've written songs about the site, sent boxes of fudge, and even made donations.
That work turning customers into fans, Westergren realized, meant he could rally them behind the royalty rate issue. So he sent an e-mail to all the Pandora listeners that identified their representative and senator and asked them to write in. Pandorans responded. Westergren estimates that about one million e-mails, phone calls, or faxes were made or sent by Pandora listeners. California Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein received 25,000 e-mails; in the office of Jay Inslee, a Seattle-area representative, correspondence about Internet radio equaled that concerning the Iraq war. Inslee and Illinois Representative Don Manzullo drafted a bill that brought Internet radio rates in line with those of satellite stations; in the Senate, Sam Brownback and Ron Wyden sponsored a companion bill. "I said, 'Oh, my gosh, this is a bombshell ready to explode with the small radio stations," says Manzullo. The legislation has been referred to committee.
The bills show little chance of passing. Even Manzullo points out that "the last thing you want to do is have Congress regulate [royalty rates]; industry should regulate them." But the threat of legislative action seems to have pushed SoundExchange to the negotiating table. The group has agreed to meet with broadcasters and is making conciliatory gestures. "Both sides are working toward resolving it," says John Simon, SoundExchange's executive director. "These are our partners. They pay us royalties. We want to make sure Internet radio survives and thrives because they do pay us." The new fees kicked in on July 15; for now, Pandora is paying them as it hopes for a reprieve.
After the SFMoma announcement, Westergren stayed out until midnight--listeners were invited to a postparty at a South of Market art gallery with Pandora employees--but he is in the office the next morning at 7. The offices are in a rundown section of Oakland and look cash-strapped but cheerful. There are beige cubicles, but also columns painted with famous album covers and a metal cabinet full of free Kit Kats and Slim Jims.
Over on the side of the room, there are several rows of tables where the music analysts sit. It's an odd sight at a tech company that's pushing the music industry forward, these rows of humans clicking through screens and mutely analyzing songs at a rate of two to six per hour. All 50 of them work part-time. They have an incredible knowledge of music. On one job application for a music analyst opening, the applicant sketched out the chord structure of David Bowie's "Life on Mars"; another analyst explained the classical music genome (which hasn't yet launched) using terms like homophony versus polyphony versus antiphony, even though he wasn't a classical musician. The part-time arrangement gives analysts time to work on their own music, and anyone who works 20 hours a week gets health insurance. "Almost everyone that works here is an active working musician, and an active working musician needs supplemental income," says Rick Higgs, a silver-haired analyst who teaches guitar. "You can hardly find anything better for a musician. This stuff makes a lot more sense than landscaping."
At this early hour, thanks to musicians' schedules and last night's party, there's no one in the office but Westergren. He has a bunch of interviews today. He'll talk to an NPR reporter about the rate increase, then chat about the same thing with a sympathetic podcaster named Jeremy. Westergren's cell phone isn't working, and the Internet and VoIP in his office are both down. With the forbearance that only eight years at Pandora could give, Westergren isn't fazed. He tries some different lines, tries his cell phone, and shrugs. It's not the first time things haven't gone as planned and it won't be the last. "I've never, ever given up, even when we were in the most depressive bleak times," he says. "I always thought it was a good idea and would have a day." When the phone finally rings, it turns out to be a listener, calling with a question about his Pandora station. Westergren jots down his number to call him back later. He's finally got the adoring audience he always sought, finally figured out how to make a living at music. He thinks he's got it right at last. If not, another change of tune will be easy to make, given all the practice he's had.

OAKLAND, Calif.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Pandora (NYSE:P), the go-to music source for fans and artists, today 
      announced management team changes to accelerate the company’s growth 
      strategy.
    


      Effective immediately, the board appointed founder Tim Westergren as 
      CEO. Tim is a visionary who forever changed how music is enjoyed by 
      leading the development of Pandora’s Music Genome Project in the early 
      2000s. A seasoned entrepreneur, and former band member and composer 
      himself, Tim is personally committed to advancing the careers of working 
      musicians everywhere.
    

      Tim has been a strong and highly engaged leader throughout Pandora’s 
      history and has been deeply involved in the company’s growth strategy 
      and evolution. He also plays an essential role in engaging employees, 
      listeners, music makers, advertisers and partners.
    

      “I am incredibly excited about the future of Pandora. We're on the cusp 
      of realizing an extraordinary vision: fundamentally changing the way 
      listeners discover and enjoy music, and the way artists build and 
      sustain their careers," said Tim Westergren, Pandora’s Founder and CEO. 
      “We are pursuing a once-in-a-generation opportunity to create a massive, 
      vibrant music marketplace. We have the audience, the technology 
      infrastructure, the monetization engine and most importantly the right 
      team with the passion and commitment to do it. I’m 100 percent committed 
      to Pandora’s growth strategy, as is our executive team and Board.”
    

      Pandora also introduced a new management structure:

        monetization of Pandora’s core business covering revenue, music 
        licensing, finance, legal, and information technology. He will also

        Sara Clemens, as Chief Operating Officer, focuses on growing and 
        scaling the business and operating new ventures. Her responsibilities 
        include music makers, Ticketfly, international, human resources and 
        corporate development.
      

        Pandora’s Chief Product Officer Chris Phillips, is responsible for 
        product, engineering and marketing. His team will develop, deliver and 
        drive adoption of products that connect fans and artist in new ways, 
        including on-demand, and help advertisers reach their audiences.
      


      Brian McAndrews is leaving the company. “I am honored to have been the 
      CEO of Pandora for the past two and a half years, and I am proud of what 
      I and our team of talented and highly passionate colleagues have 
      achieved during this time. We have put in place a robust strategy to 
      make Pandora the go-to source for fans and artists and position the 
      company for long-term success in a highly dynamic space. With the team 
      and strategy in place and execution underway, I am passing the baton on 
      to Tim. I wish the Company all the best as it continues on its next 
      phase of growth.”
    

      Current independent board member Jim Feuille is Chairman of the Board.
    

      “Pandora today is in a strong position to maximize our full potential 
      and expand the music marketplace. Tim is the ideal CEO for Pandora as we 
      embark on our next phase of growth. As the original founder, Tim carries 
      the vision for how Pandora can transform the music industry and he is 
      uniquely able to connect with listeners, music makers and employees,” 
      said Chairman Jim Feuille. “Pandora has become a stronger company under 
      Brian’s leadership, and we thank him for his commitment and 
      contributions to building Pandora’s core leadership team and 
      strengthening its position in the market. Moving forward, we have an 
      excellent executive leadership team that is focused on activating 
      Pandora’s strategy and driving long-term value through a relentless 
      focus on execution and operational excellence.”
    

      Pandora also reaffirms its previously announced revenue and adjusted 
      EBITDA guidance. The company expects to come in at the high end range of 
      revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance for the quarter, and reaffirms 2016 
      full year targets. Further detail on the company’s performance will be 
      provided during Pandora’s first quarter results.

Pandora CEO: 'We intend to be profitable this year'

            Pandora CEO: We're solving the ease of use problem of subscription services   
			                        Monday, 13 Mar 2017 | 11:21  AM ET |  02:55 




Pandora CEO Tim Westergren said "we intend to be profitable this year" on "Squawk Alley." That would be a big turnaround for the company, whose losses more than doubled from $170 million in 2015 to $343 million last year. 
Westergren dodged questions about whether the company was for sale, comparing questions about Pandora's viability with similar questions from when the company began. " We've seen this movie before, 10, 11 years ago when we launched Internet radio, a lot of folks said the same thing – AOL, Microsoft, Yahoo had large personalized radio products with big distribution, but we built a much better product, and here we are years later the king of that category. We just think we've seen this before."
With the launch this week of Pandora Premium — the company's first ever on-demand streaming service — the company can out-compete tech giants like Apple and Amazon, he said. 

"I am confident about our ability in this space," he said. "These are early days in the subscription of music and listeners don't know what a real premium product looks like yet and that's what Pandora is."
The service will cost $9.99 a month, on a par with pricing from competitors Spotify Premium and Apple Music, and offer on-demand  access to any track or album in Pandora's library and tailored playlists. Users will still be able to access the regular Pandora radio-like service if they don't want to choose songs.

            Pandora CEO: We benefit from connectivity tailwind   
			                        Monday, 13 Mar 2017 | 11:27  AM ET |  04:09 




Pandora's unique advantage is its understanding of what users like, making the service like "a friend you have known for a while," Westergren said. There are more than 112 million listeners on Pandora who have created at least four stations, said Westergren.
"There's no cold start problem," he said. 
Users can drop in a song and "rather than having to hunt and peck your way to a playlist," Pandora rolls out a whole host of songs uniquely picked for the user, he said.
Westergren dismissed speculation about an acquisition by SiriusXM as part of the "joys of being a public company," and said he is focused on the company's product, artist partnerships, advertisers and shareholders.
Westergren has not ruled out taking on private equity financing, but plans to do this "from a position of strength," he said. The launch of a new Samsung phone, the next Apple iPhone and the success of the Amazon Echo are all good for Pandora's business, he said.
"We love new products that come out for distribution," he said. "We are the most used app on pretty much every one of these devices."
