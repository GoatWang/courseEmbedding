Organization

 

Realmark
Property Investors Limited Partnership - VI A (the Partnership), a
Delaware limited partnership, was formed on September 21, 1987, to
invest in a diversified portfolio of income-producing real estate
investments. The general partners are Realmark Properties, Inc.
(the corporate general partner) and Joseph M. Jayson (the
individual general partner). Joseph M. Jayson is the sole
shareholder of J.M. Jayson & Company, Inc. Realmark Properties,
Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary of J.M. Jayson & Company,
Inc. Under the partnership agreement, the general partners and
their affiliates can receive compensation for services rendered and
reimbursement for expenses incurred on behalf of the
Partnership.

 

Basis of
Presentation

 

As a result of
the plan of termination and liquidation, the Partnership changed
its basis of accounting to the liquidation basis effective January
1, 2007. Under the liquidation basis of accounting, assets are
stated at their estimated net realizable values and liabilities are
stated at their estimated settlement amounts.

 

The
accompanying unaudited interim consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America and the
instructions to Form 10-Q.  Accordingly, they do not
include all of the information and notes required by accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America for
complete financial statements. The balance sheet at December 31,
2009 has been derived from the audited financial statements at that
date.  In the opinion of management, all adjustments
(consisting of normal recurring adjustments) considered necessary
for a fair presentation, have been included. The
Partnership’s significant accounting policies are set forth
in its December 31, 2009 Form 10-K. The interim financial
statements should be read in conjunction with the financial
statements included therein. The interim results should not be
considered indicative of the annual results. Subsequent events were
evaluated through May 17, 2010, the date the financial statements
were issued.

 

Property and
Equipment

 

At March 31,
2010, the Partnership has an interest in a joint venture, as
described below.  The joint venture property was sold in
December 2006 for a purchase price of $5,300,000.  The
mortgage on the property was paid off in the amount of
$4,117,763.  The Partnership sold its remaining
wholly-owned property in 2003.

 

 

Investment
in Research Triangle Industrial Park Joint Venture

 

The Partnership
has a 50% interest in Research Triangle Industrial Park Joint
Venture (the Venture) with Realmark Property Investors Limited
Partnership - II (RPILP - II), an entity affiliated through common
general partners.  The joint venture owned and operated
the Research Triangle Industrial Park West, an office/warehouse
facility in Durham, North Carolina, which was sold in December
2006.  The joint venture agreement provides that any
income, loss, gain, cash flow, or sale proceeds be allocated 50% to
the Partnership and 50% to RPILP - II.   Summary
financial information of the Venture follows

Industrial Park West, which amounted to $1,037,269 at March 31,

Item 1), it is anticipated that due to the sale of the remaining
joint venture, the Partnership may be in a position to make
distributions to the limited partners.  As a result of

remaining property, the Partnership began reporting on the
liquidation basis of accounting effective January 1,
2007.
