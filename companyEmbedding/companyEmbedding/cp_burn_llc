Choosing Nozzles 




FIXED WING AIRCRAFT 
When making decisions about which nozzles to use, several things should be considered:

Airspeed, Swath
Droplet Spectrum
Gallons per Acre
For a comparison of CP® nozzle styles at various airspeeds and droplet
ranges, click here. Metric version here. 

CP-11TT’s are the most versatile nozzles for the full range of airspeeds. In most instances, flat fan tips offer the best drift control and narrowest relative spans. The wide range of tips styles available make both large and small droplet spectra possible. Nozzles are set up with tips meeting the specific needs of each aircraft. Tips are color coded for flow rate and click into place with a detent spring and ball. 
 
CP-06 Swivels, used with CP-11TT flat fan nozzles, make it possible to adjust the nozzle downward into the airstream at 15° increments. These adjustments create the smaller droplet spectrum needed for insecticides and fungicides.
   
CP-07’s and CP-09’s are nozzles with four orifices (0.062, 0.078, 0.125 and 0.172) and three-way deflectors with a straight stream setting and 5° and 30° deflection. These nozzles were designed for aircraft flying at speeds of 130 mph and higher.

CP-03’s, the original aerial nozzles, work well for airspeeds of 120 mph or less depending on the application. At higher airspeeds, these nozzles will produce more driftable fines than CP-11TT’s or CP-07/09’s. They have the same four orifices as the CP07/09’s but the deflector angles are 30°, 55° and 90°.
To calculate the number of nozzles you need, click here. Metric calculator here. 
To calculate the tip or orifice sizes you need, click here. 
For droplet spectrum information, click here. 

ROTARY AIRCRAFT 
Generally, the challenge with rotorcraft is producing a droplet spectrum small enough to be effective for insecticides
and fungicides. While drift control is critical for many applications, producing the droplet spectrum needed is less problematic.
For a comparison of CP®11TT Flat Fan nozzle styles at various airspeeds and droplet ranges, click here.
For a comparison of CP®03 Standard nozzle styles at various airspeeds and droplet ranges, click here. 
 

CP-11TT’s, with the wide selection of flat fan tips, offer the most versatility. There are 40° and 110° flat fan tips available. Spray nozzle models which calculate droplet spectrum are available for all tips.

CP-03’s, the original CP° nozzles, work well for rotorcraft. The four orifices and three deflector planes offer many choices depending on the aircraft and product being applied.
To calculate the number of nozzles you need, click here. Metric calculator here.

A Practical Beginning
Back in the 1960's the Chemstrand Company was developing a new synthetic fiber for use in carpeting. They were encouraged by the Ford Foundation to use this technology to develop an urban playing surface. It seemed that urban kids were less physically fit than kids living in rural areas. With the goal of creating a natural looking play area that could be set up and maintained easily inside a city, Chemstrand turned its attention to creating a product that "looks like grass and acts like grass." They worked for years to formulate something that could replicate the look and feel of natural grass. Early results were marginally successful; however, the initial technology, used primarily on athletic fields, did not allow the athletes a full range of natural movement. Throughout the 1960s, Chemstrand worked to improve the technology.
Branching Out Beyond Athletic Fields
As the industry grew, synthetic turf spread from playing fields to large-scale sports arenas and beyond. What has once been impossible became possible, and the uses for this new synthetic turf exploded. Research and development continued to improve and diversify the range and quality of products and services that were available. In the 1990’s, new technologies allowed for the creation of more durable and versatile turf, and the industry experienced a complete revolution, thanks to scientific breakthroughs on everything from synthetic materials to adhesives and backing systems.
Ten Years of Advancements - Information and Technology Transform the industry
The industry as a whole has seen more advancement in the last 10 years than in the previous 40 years. Focus on infilled polyethylene and polypropylene products has expanded the uses for synthetic turf exponentially. Ideal for residential and commercial landscaping, golf courses and playgrounds, there are new ideas constantly springing up as the technology allows for more diverse applications. Thanks to new developments, there are hundreds of new ways to utilize synthetic turf.
An Industry Leader Sets the Pace
Safety, loyalty, and quality go hand in hand. We build long term relationships with each dealer and customer that we work with, ensuring that each distributor receives the products and support relevant to their needs.
