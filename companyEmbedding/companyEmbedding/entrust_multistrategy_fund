		What I Should Know 
Before Investing




All investments are subject to risk, including the possible loss of principal. In addition to the Fund's operating expenses, you will indirectly bear the operating expenses of the underlying funds, which can be substantially higher than fees associated with mutual funds. The Fund may invest in unregistered hedge funds which are highly speculative investments that employ aggressive investment strategies, and carry substantial risk. Investments in hedge funds are generally illiquid, difficult to value and may carry significant restrictions for transferring assets. Some of the underlying funds employ leverage, which increases the volatility of investment returns and subjects the Fund to magnified losses if an underlying fund's investments decline in value. The Fund and some of the underlying funds may use derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses, and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance. Some of the underlying funds may employ short selling, a speculative strategy. Unlike the possible loss on a security that is purchased, there is no limit on the amount of loss on an appreciating security that is sold short. The Fund and each underlying fund may engage in active and frequent trading, resulting in higher portfolio turnover and transaction costs. There is no assurance that these and other strategies used by the Fund or underlying funds will be successful. Equity securities are subject to price fluctuation. International investments are subject to special risks including currency fluctuations, social, economic and political uncertainties, which could increase volatility. These risks are magnified in emerging markets. Small-and mid-cap stocks involve greater risks and volatility than large-cap stocks. Fixed income securities involve interest rate, credit, inflation, and reinvestment risks. As interest rates rise, the value of fixed income securities fall. High-yield bonds possess greater price volatility, illiquidity, and possibility of default. Asset-backed, mortgage-backed or mortgage related securities are subject to additional risks such as prepayment and extension risks. 
 Please see the prospectus for a more complete discussion of the Fund's risks.

 Performance 






Performance




Performance shown represents past performance and is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance shown. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than the original cost. Fund performance figures reflect fee waivers and/or expense reimbursements, without which the performance would have been lower. For the period prior to January 1, 2013, the performance shown is that of the Fund’s Service Shares incepted on February 1, 2012.
Fund performance figures are net of fees, including a 1.10% management fee, acquired fund (underlying manager) fees, and other Fund expenses. Performance results for the Fund are short-term and may not provide an adequate basis for evaluating performance potential over varying market conditions or market cycles. Total return figures are based on the NAV per share applied to shareholder subscriptions and redemptions, which may differ from the NAV per share disclosed in Fund shareholder reports.








Net Asset Value (NAV): An investment option’s net asset value (“NAV”) per unit or unit price is calculated by dividing the value of its net assets by the total number of units outstanding. 


































**Gross expenses are the Fund's total annual operating expenses for the share class(es) shown.  Net expenses for Class(es) Institutional & Service reflect contractual fee waivers and/or reimbursements, where these reductions reduce the Fund's gross expenses, which cannot be terminated prior to Dec 31, 2017 without Board consent. The Gross and Net Expenses listed include 4.21 of Acquired Fund Fees and Expenses ("AFFE") that are required to be shown in the Fund's prospectus. AFFE reflects the Fund's pro rata share of fees and expenses relating to its investments in acquired funds; however, AFFE are not incurred directly by the Fund. Therefore, AFFE are not reflected in the Fund's audited financial statements or financial highlights.


Underlying manager fees: In addition to the Fund's operating expenses, Fund shareholders will indirectly bear the operating expenses of the underlying funds. Generally, underlying manager fees include 1% to 3% management fee and a 15% to 25% incentive fee.

 Characteristics 






characteristics












Weighted Average Life (WAL) is the average number of years for which each dollar of unpaid principal on a loan or mortgage remains outstanding. Once calculated, WAL tells how many years it will take to pay half of the outstanding principal. 


Effective duration is a duration calculation for bonds with embedded options. Effective duration takes into account that expected cash flows will fluctuate as interest rates change. Duration measures the sensitivity of price (the value of principal) of a fixed-income investment to a change in interest rates. The higher the duration number, the more sensitive a fixed-income investment will be to interest rate changes.

 Holdings 






Holdings








IMPORTANT HOLDINGS INFORMATION: Portfolio holdings are based on total portfolio, and are subject to change at any time. Holdings are provided for informational purposes only and should not be construed as a recommendation to purchase or sell any security. Any negative allocations or allocations in excess of 100% are primarily due to unsettled trade activities.
Derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance.

 Distributions 






Distributions









The per share distribution amounts presented above reflect the distribution rates that were paid to shareholders on the indicated payable dates. The character of distributions for certain funds may have been subsequently adjusted for tax purposes. Shareholders can determine which funds may have reclassified the tax character of distributions by visiting the Tax Center in Account Services. Information on reclassifications for distributions paid during the current calendar year will not be available until the first quarter of the following year.


An XBRL file is not a fund's complete prospectus. XBRL is an interactive data format and is provided in addition to a fund's prospectus and annual and semi-annual reports linked to this page. An XBRL file is not viewable without a viewer tool. A viewer tool is available on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. You can download an XBRL zip file and view it on the SEC website or use the data for analysis with any comparison tool.








IMPORTANT INFORMATION: An investment in the Fund is not suitable for all investors, is illiquid and should be considered speculative. An investment in the Fund entails unique risks because the Portfolio Funds in which the Fund will invest are private entities with limited regulatory oversight and disclosure obligations. Because the Fund invests in underlying Portfolio Funds, the managers may not be able to shift allocations in time to capture an immediate or sudden spike in the market. Diversification does not guarantee a profit or protect against a loss.
The information shown above relates to Permal Hedge Strategies Portfolio, the registered investment company in which the Fund invests substantially all of its investable assets. The Fund utilizes a master/feeder structure by investing all of its assets in the Permal Hedge Strategies Portfolio. Assets are reported at the master portfolio level.
Tapering of the Federal Reserve Board's quantitative easing program and a general rise in interest rates may lead to increased portfolio volatility.

Objective

            The Fund seeks maximum total return, consistent with prudent investment management.
        
Primary Portfolio

            Underlying PIMCO Funds, PIMCO exchange-traded funds and may also invest in unaffiliated funds, fixed-income instruments, equity securities and other instruments
        



























Overview






Fund Overview
An “all-in-one” liquid alternative strategy
PIMCO Multi-Strategy Alternative Fund invests across the full suite of PIMCO’s liquid alternative strategies as it targets attractive risk-adjusted returns through various market environments, while potentially limiting portfolio downside during large corrections in equity or bond markets.
Why Invest In This Fund
Allocated across a broad opportunity set
The fund actively allocates across a range of PIMCO’s liquid alternative mutual funds, including absolute return fixed income, equity long/short, equity market neutral and managed futures strategies. The fund also has the ability to directly invest in individual securities to gain exposure to liquid alternative strategies not offered as standalone mutual funds or to manage overall portfolio risks.
Diversification potential
The fund provides investors with dynamically managed exposure to a wide range of independent liquid alternative strategies in a single mutual fund with daily liquidity. Importantly, the fund seeks to generate attractive risk-adjusted returns with substantially lower volatility and downside potential relative to stocks, while seeking to provide important diversification benefits to a traditional portfolio of stocks and bonds.
Liquid alternatives leader
PIMCO has one of the longest track records managing liquid alternative strategies in the industry and is among the largest providers of liquid alternatives by assets under management. Through a single investment in the fund, investors gain access to PIMCO’s extensive platform and global presence, the deep expertise of our sector specialists, and the firm’s 40+ years of active management expertise across asset classes.
Our Expertise
The fund is managed by Josh Davis, executive vice president and member of the Quantitative Portfolios Group, Mihir Worah, CIO Real Return and Asset Allocation, and Mohsen Fahmi, managing director and generalist portfolio manager. The portfolio managers work closely together to evaluate strategies for inclusion in the fund and collaborate on all major risk allocation decisions.

Disclosures 




Performance quoted represents past performance. Past performance is not a guarantee or a reliable indicator of future results.

This material is authorized for use only when preceded or accompanied by the current PIMCO funds prospectus or summary prospectus, if available and the current fund card.

A word about risk: Investing in the bond market is subject to certain risks including market, interest-rate, issuer, credit, and inflation risk; investments may be worth more or less than the original cost when redeemed. The value of most bond funds and fixed income securities are impacted by changes in interest rates.Bonds and bond funds with longer durations tend to be more sensitive and more volatile than securities with shorter durations;bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise. Investing in foreign denominated and/or domiciled securities may involve heightened risk due to currency fluctuations,and economic and political risks, which may be enhanced in emerging markets. High-yield,lower-rated, securities involve greater risk than higher-rated securities; portfolios that invest in them may be subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk than portfolios that do not. Equities may decline in value due to both real and perceived general market, economic and industry conditions. Investments in value securities involve the risk the market's value assessment may differ from the manager and the performance of the securities may decline. Derivatives may involve certain costs and risks such as liquidity, interest rate, market, credit, management and the risk that a position could not be closed when most advantageous.

Performance quoted represents past performance and is not a guarantee or a reliable indicator of future results. Investment return and the principal value of an investment will fluctuate. Shares may be worth more or less than original cost when redeemed. Current performance may be lower or higher than average annual returns shown. Performance quoted does not reflect any sales charges, if applicable, and performance would be lower if it did.


Differences in the Fund’s performance versus the index and related attribution information with respect to particular categories of securities or individual positions may be attributable, in part, to differences in the pricing methodologies used by the Fund and the index.
        


No assurance is being made that any fund that may have experienced high or unusual performance for one or more periods will continue to experience such performance. High performance is defined as an unusual growth in alpha between reporting periods or total return when measured to historical returns. Unusual performance is defined as an unusual change in performance (+/-) between reporting periods and the portfolio experienced unusual performance for one or more periods.

Market NAV as of 






Market-Based NAV (Per Share): The Market-Based NAV is the net asset value per share, calculated using available market quotations (or an appropriate substitute that reflects current market conditions) rounded to the fourth decimal place.  The Market-Based NAV is not indicative of future Market-Based NAVs or the future performance of any of the Funds and classes set forth above. The Market-Based NAV may change daily and may deviate from $1.0000 even when financial markets are stable. Although the Market-Based NAV is intended to reflect the price at which a Fund's securities could be sold, the actual sales price could be more or less.


Money Market funds are not insured or guaranteed by FDIC or any other government agency and although such funds seek to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it is possible to lose money by investing in Money Market funds.

Past performance is not a guarantee or a reliable indicator of future results. For funds with at least a 3-yr history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees) with an emphasis on downward variations and consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating is a weighted average of the performance figures for its 3-, 5- and 10-yr (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Morningstar, Inc.® 2017. All rights reserved.

Hollow stars represent a class of shares with inception dates that is different than the inception date of the fund. For the period prior to the inception date of these shares, performance information is based on the performance of the fund’s Institutional Class shares, adjusted to reflect the actual distribution and/or service (12b-1) fees and other expenses paid by the newer share class.
        

             The Lipper Category returns and rankings are calculated by Lipper Inc., a Reuters Company, which is a nationally recognized organization that compares the performance of mutual funds with similar investment objectives. The Category returns represent the average performance of included funds, while rankings compare an individual fund's returns to those of the other funds in its category. Both are based on total return performance, with capital gains and dividends reinvested, with annual operating expenses deducted, but without including front- or back-end sales charges. Rankings begin with the actual share class inception. Rankings are relative to a peer group and do not necessarily mean that the fund had high total returns.

Disclosures 




Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the funds carefully before investing. This and other information are contained in the fund’s prospectus and summary prospectus, if available, which may be obtained by contacting your investment professional or PIMCO representative.   Please read them carefully before you invest or send money.


A word about risk:

 
The Fund invests in other funds and performance is subject to underlying investment weightings which will vary.  The cost of investing in the Fund will generally be higher than the cost of investing in a fund that invests directly in individual stocks and bonds. Absolute return portfolios may not fully participate in strong positive market rallies. Investing in the bond market is subject to risks, including market, interest rate, issuer, credit, inflation risk, and liquidity risk. The value of most bonds and bond strategies are impacted by changes in interest rates. Bonds and bond strategies with longer durations tend to be more sensitive and volatile than those with shorter durations; bond prices generally fall as interest rates rise, and the current low interest rate environment increases this risk. Current reductions in bond counterparty capacity may contribute to decreased market liquidity and increased price volatility. Bond investments may be worth more or less than the original cost when redeemed. Investing in foreign denominated and/or domiciled securities may involve heightened risk due to currency fluctuations, and economic and political risks, which may be enhanced in emerging markets. High-yield, lower-rated, securities involve greater risk than higher-rated securities; portfolios that invest in them may be subject to greater levels of credit and liquidity risk than portfolios that do not. Equities may decline in value due to both real and perceived general market, economic, and industry conditions. Mortgage and asset-backed securities may be sensitive to changes in interest rates, subject to early repayment risk, and their value may fluctuate in response to the market’s perception of issuer creditworthiness; while generally supported by some form of government or private guarantee there is no assurance that private guarantors will meet their obligations. Commodities contain heightened risk including market, political, regulatory, and natural conditions, and may not be suitable for all investors. Derivatives may involve certain costs and risks, such as liquidity, interest rate, market, credit, management and the risk that a position could not be closed when most advantageous. Investing in derivatives could lose more than the amount invested. Diversification does not ensure against loss.

        

             Investments made by a Fund and the results achieved by a Fund are not expected to be the same as those made by any other PIMCO-advised Fund, including those with a similar name, investment objective or policies.  A new or smaller Fund’s performance may not represent how the Fund is expected to or may perform in the long-term.  New Funds have limited operating histories for investors to evaluate and new and smaller Funds may not attract sufficient assets to achieve investment and trading efficiencies.  A Fund may be forced to sell a comparatively large portion of its portfolio to meet significant shareholder redemptions for cash, or hold a comparatively large portion of its portfolio in cash due to significant share purchases for cash, in each case when the Fund otherwise would not seek to do so, which may adversely affect performance.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
