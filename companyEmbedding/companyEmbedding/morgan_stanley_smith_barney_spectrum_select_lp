(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  As of September 30, 2015, the percentage of assets allocated to each market sector was approximately as follows: Interest Rate 26.41%; Currency 29.10%; Equity 9.19%; and Commodity 35.30%.  Liquidity. The Partnership deposits its assets with MS&Co. as its clearing commodity broker in separate futures, forward and option trading accounts established for each Trading Advisor. Such assets are used as margin to engage in trading and may be used as margin solely for the Partnership's trading. The assets are held either in non-interest bearing bank accounts or in securities and instruments permitted by the CFTC for investment of customer segregated or secured funds. Since the Partnership's sole purpose is to trade in futures, forwards, options and U.S. Treasury bills, it is expected that the Partnership will continue to own such liquid assets for margin purposes.  The Partnership's investment in futures, forwards, options and U.S. Treasury bills may, from time to time, be illiquid. Most U.S. futures exchanges limit fluctuations in prices during a single day by regulations referred to as "daily price fluctuation limits" or "daily limits." Trades may not be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. If the price for a particular futures or options contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in that futures or options contract can neither be taken nor liquidated unless traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit. Futures prices have occasionally moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading. These market conditions could prevent the Partnership from promptly liquidating its futures or options contracts and result in restrictions on redemptions.  There is no limitation on daily price movements in trading forward contracts on foreign currencies. The markets for some world currencies have low trading volume and are illiquid, which may prevent the Partnership from trading in potentially profitable markets or prevent the Partnership from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions in such markets, subjecting it to substantial losses. Either of these market conditions could result in restrictions on redemptions. For the periods covered by this report, illiquidity has not materially affected the Partnership's assets.  There are no known material trends, demands, commitments, events, or uncertainties at the present time that are reasonably likely to result in the Partnership's liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way.  As of September 30, 2015, approximately 85.61% of the Partnership's total investment exposure is futures contracts which are exchange-traded while approximately 14.39% is forward contracts which are off-exchange traded.  Capital Resources. The Partnership does not have, nor does it expect to have, any capital assets. The Partnership's only assets are its equity in trading accounts, consisting of restricted and unrestricted cash, net unrealized gain on open contracts and investments in U.S. Treasury bills at fair value, if applicable. Redemptions of Units in the future will affect the amount of funds available for investments in futures, forwards, options and U.S. Treasury bills in subsequent periods. It is not possible to estimate the amount, and therefore the impact, of future outflows of Units.  There are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, that would affect, nor any expected material changes to the Partnership's capital resource arrangements at the present time.  Table of Contents  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations. The Partnership does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements,  nor does it have contractual obligations or commercial commitments to make future payments that would affect its liquidity or capital resources.  Results of Operations  General. The Partnership's results depend on the Trading Advisors and the ability of each Trading Advisor's trading program to take advantage of price movements in the futures, forward and options markets.  Altis trades its Global Futures Portfolio Program on behalf of the Partnership. It is a systematic, automated trading program that builds on the market experience of Altis' principals and employs a unique proprietary Advanced Asset Allocator. The Advanced Asset Allocator was specifically developed to manage portfolios of derivative instruments in a robust and scalable manner. The portfolio management technology combines original, traditional and contrasting investment techniques into one complete and comprehensive trading system. Investment changes are implemented after considering their effect on the whole portfolio and not just on the individual markets concerned.  Graham currently trades its allocated portion of the Partnership's assets pursuant to Graham's Global Diversified Program, as described below, at 150% Leverage. The Global Diversified Program features the first trend system that Graham developed, which began trading client accounts in 1995. It utilizes multiple computerized trading models and offers broad diversification in both financial and non-financial markets, trading in approximately 65 global markets. The Global Diversified Program's trend system is primarily long-term in nature and is intended to generate significant returns over time with an acceptable degree of risk and volatility. The computer models analyze on a daily basis the recent price action, the relative strength and the risk characteristics of each market and compare statistically the quantitative results of this data to years of historical data on each market.  EMC currently trades its Classic Program for the Partnership. EMC's investment strategies are technical rather than fundamental in nature. In other words, they are developed from analysis of patterns of actual monthly, weekly, and daily price movements and are not based on analysis of fundamental supply and demand factors, general economic factors, or anticipated world events. EMC relies on historical analysis of these price patterns to interpret current market behavior and to evaluate technical indicators for trade initiations and liquidations.  EMC's investment strategies used in its program are trend-following. This means that initiation and liquidation of positions in a particular market are generally in the direction of the price trend in that market, although at times counter-trend elements also may be employed.  EMC employs an investment strategy which utilizes a blend of systems (or, stated another way, a number of systems simultaneously). The strategies are diversified in that its program follows a number of futures interests and often invests in more than ten different interests at one time.  Rabar trades its investment strategy on behalf of the Partnership. The objective of Rabar's investment strategy is to generate capital appreciation over the long run by investing exclusively in futures interests, including exchange-traded futures contracts, options on futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and, to a very limited extent, cash commodities. Rabar may also engage in exchange for physical transactions, more commonly referred to as "EFPs". Rabar's strategy employs a diversified, systematic, technical, and trend-following approach, utilizing a blend of several separate and distinct quantitative models.  Prior to August 8, 2014, Northfield traded the Diversified Program on behalf of the Partnership. The Diversified Program was conceived, tested, and refined by Northfield's principals. The approach was fully computerized and nondiscretionary. Money management principles were a critical element of the Diversified Program and had been carefully constructed and were rigorously applied to minimize risk exposure and to protect asset appreciation.  Table of Contents  The following chart sets forth the percentage and the amount of the Partnership's net assets allocated to each Trading Advisor as of September 30, 2015 and June 30, 2015, respectively, and the change during the three months ended September 30, 2015.   Allocations as of Allocations as of Allocations as of Allocations as of Change September 30, June 30, September 30, June 30, during the Trading Advisor 2015 (%) 2015 (%) 2015 ($) 2015 ($) period (%) Altis 22.91 20.95 23,190,615 22,032,084 5.26 Graham 33.37 31.64 33,788,610 33,275,767 1.54 Rabar 24.12 31.16 24,423,997 32,766,948 (25.46 ) EMC 19.60 16.25 19,847,024 17,091,483 16.12  The following presents a summary of the Partnership's operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2015 and 2014, and a general discussion of its trading activities during each period. It is important to note, however, that the Trading Advisors trade in various markets at different times and that prior activity in a particular market does not mean that such market will be actively traded by the Trading Advisors or will be profitable in the future. Consequently, the results of operations of the Partnership are difficult to discuss other than in the context of the Trading Advisors' trading activities on behalf of the Partnership during the period in question. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.  The Partnership's results of operations set forth in the financial statements on pages 2 through 17 of this report are prepared in accordance with GAAP, which require the use of certain accounting policies that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements, including the following: the contracts the Partnership trades are accounted for on a trade-date basis and marked to market on a daily basis. The difference between their original contract value and market value is recorded on the Statements of Income and Expenses as "Net change in unrealized trading profit (loss)" on open contracts, and recorded as "Net realized trading profit (loss)" when open positions are closed out. The sum of these amounts constitutes the Partnership's trading results. The market value of a futures contract is the settlement price on the exchange on which that futures contract is traded on a particular day. The value of a foreign currency forward contract is based on the spot rate as of approximately 3:00 P.M. (E.T.), the close of the business day. Interest income, as well as management fees, incentive fees, brokerage fees, General Partner fees and ongoing placement agent fees of the Partnership are recorded on an accrual basis.  The General Partner believes that, based on the nature of the operations of the Partnership, no assumptions relating to the application of critical accounting policies other than those presently used could reasonably affect reported amounts.  For the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2015  The Partnership recorded total trading results including interest income totaling $1,658,077 and expenses totaling $1,493,439, resulting in net income of $164,638 for the three months ended September 30, 2015. The Partnership's net asset value per Unit increased from $28.83 at June 30, 2015 to $28.88 at September 30, 2015.  During the third quarter, the Partnership posted a gain in Net Asset Value as trading gains in the global interest rate, metals, energy, and currency sectors more than offset trading losses in the global stock index and agricultural sectors. The most significant gains were experienced within the global interest rate sector during September from long positions in European and U.S. fixed income futures as prices rallied after the U.S. Federal Open Market Committee ("FOMC") decided to leave interest rates unchanged following its September meeting. Additional gains were recorded from long positions in Japanese fixed income futures. Within the metals sector, gains were experienced primarily during July from short positions in gold futures as prices declined as signs of further progress in the U.S. labor market boosted the case for the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. Additional gains were experienced from short copper and nickel futures positions. Within the energy sector, gains were experienced primarily during September from short positions in crude oil and its related products as prices declined as record production in the U.S. and Middle East indicated the global supply glut would continue to grow. Additional gains were recorded from short positions in natural gas futures as prices fell as mild weather blanketed much of the U.S., limiting demand. Within the currency sector, gains were experienced primarily during July from short positions in various currencies, particularly the Australian dollar and Canadian dollar, against the U.S. dollar as the value of the U.S. dollar advanced amid signals from U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen that the central bank may raise interest rates later in 2015 on the back of an improving U.S. economy. The Australian and Canadian dollars were also weighed down by falling commodity prices  Table of Contents  throughout the month. The Partnership's trading gains during the third quarter were partially offset by trading losses within the global stock index sector throughout the quarter from long positions in Pacific Rim, European, and U.S. equity index futures as prices declined amid continuing concerns that China's slowdown will weigh on the global economy. Within the agricultural sector, losses were incurred primarily during August from long positions in cocoa futures as prices declined amid good harvest conditions in West Africa and data indicating weak demand.  The Partnership recorded total trading results including interest income totaling $333,807 and expenses totaling $4,908,019, resulting in a net loss of $4,574,212 for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. The Partnership's net asset value per Unit decreased from $30.18 at December 31, 2014 to $28.88 at September 30, 2015.  During the first nine months of the year, the Partnership posted a loss in Net Asset Value as trading profits in currencies, global fixed income, and metals were more than offset by losses in the agricultural, global stock index, and energy sectors. The most significant losses were incurred in the agricultural sector primarily during June from short positions in soybean and wheat futures as prices rallied after heavy rainfall in the U.S. Midwest raised the potential for crop damage. Within the global stock index sector, losses were incurred throughout the third quarter from long positions in Pacific Rim, European, and U.S. equity index futures as prices declined amid continuing concerns that China's slowdown will weigh on the global economy. Within the energy sector, losses were incurred primarily during February from short positions in crude oil and its related products, particularly gas oil and heating oil, as prices rallied on signs of higher demand and lower supply, including more bullish forecasts from both the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries ("OPEC") and the U.S. government. Smaller losses in this sector were recorded during the second quarter. The Partnership's trading losses during the first nine months of the year were partially offset by trading gains within the currency sector from short positions in the euro versus the Swiss franc as the value of the Swiss franc soared against currencies globally during mid-January after the Swiss National Bank abandoned its exchange-rate cap, which had previously maintained a minimum exchange-rate for the Swiss franc against the euro. Additional currency gains were recorded from positions in the Canadian dollar during July. Within the global interest rate sector, gains were experienced primarily during January from long positions in U.S. fixed income futures as prices rose as tumbling oil prices crimped the outlook for inflation and fueled speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve may delay an interest-rate increase. Additional gains were experienced in the global interest rate sector during March from long positions in European fixed income futures as prices rose amid concern that Greece's solvency will erode, boosting demand for the relative safety of government debt. Within the metals sector, gains were experienced primarily during July from short futures positions in base metals as prices moved lower amid concern a slowdown in the Chinese economy would weaken demand.  For the Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2014  The Partnership recorded total trading results including interest income totaling $9,643,333 and expenses totaling $1,567,028, resulting in net income of $8,076,305 for the three months ended September 30, 2014. The Partnership's net asset value per Unit increased from $25.18 at June 30, 2014 to $27.05 at September 30, 2014.  During the third quarter, the Partnership posted a gain in net asset value per Unit as profits in the currency, agricultural, global interest rate, and metals sectors more than offset losses in the energy markets. Trading results in the global stock index sector were relatively flat for the quarter and had no material impact on the Partnership's performance. The most significant gains were achieved within the currency sector, primarily during September, from short positions in the Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. The value of the U.S. dollar advanced as the U.S. employment rate fell to its lowest level since 2008 and the economy added more jobs than forecast, bolstering the case for the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next year. Additional gains in this sector were recorded from positions in the euro, Swiss franc, and New Zealand dollar. Within the agricultural sector, gains were recorded primarily during July and September from short positions in wheat futures as prices dropped to the lowest level in four years on speculation that rising global production will curb exports from the U.S. Additional gains in this sector were recorded from futures positions in sugar and corn. Within the global interest rate sector, gains were experienced primarily during August from long positions in European fixed income futures as prices advanced after reports showed euro-area manufacturing output expanded less than expected during July, boosting speculation the European Central Bank would increase stimulus measures. Within the metals sector, gains were achieved primarily during September from short positions in gold futures as prices declined on speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve will raise U.S. interest rates sooner than forecast, crimping demand for the precious metal. A portion of the Partnership's gains for the quarter was offset by losses experienced within the energy sector, primarily during July, from long futures positions in crude oil and its related products as prices declined after an industry report showed crude stockpiles increased in the U.S.  Table of Contents  The Partnership recorded total trading results including interest income totaling $6,349,356 and expenses totaling $5,869,065, resulting in net income of $480,291 for the nine months ended September 30, 2014. The Partnership's net asset value per Unit increased from $26.48 at December 31, 2013 to $27.05 at September 30, 2014.  During the first nine months of the year, the Partnership posted a gain in net asset value per Unit as profits in the agricultural, global interest rate, and currency sectors more than offset losses in the energy, metals, and global stock index sectors. The most significant gains were recorded within the agricultural sector during January and February primarily from long positions in soybean and soybean meal futures as prices advanced after adverse weather conditions in the U.S. and Brazil lowered crop estimates. Additional gains were recorded from long positions in livestock futures as prices trended higher throughout a majority of the first half of the year. Within the global interest rate sector, gains were experienced during May from long positions in European fixed income futures as prices advanced as German unemployment unexpectedly increased and euro-area lending contracted, boosting demand for the relative "safety" of government debt. Additional gains were experienced during August as prices advanced after reports showed euro-area manufacturing output expanded less than expected during July, boosting speculation the European Central Bank would increase stimulus measures. Within the currency sector, gains were experienced primarily during September, from short positions in the euro and Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. The value of the U.S. dollar advanced as the U.S. employment rate fell to its lowest level since 2008 and the economy added more jobs than forecast, bolstering the case for the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next year. Additional gains in this sector were recorded from positions in the New Zealand dollar, Canadian dollar, and Swiss franc. A portion of the Partnership's gains during the first nine months of the year was offset by trading losses within the energy sector during March from long positions in crude oil and its related products as prices declined in the first half of the month on speculation that U.S. inventories climbed higher. Additional losses in this sector were recorded during July from long futures positions in crude oil and its related products as prices declined after an industry report showed crude stockpiles increased in the U.S. Within the metals sector, losses were incurred primarily during January and February from short positions in gold futures as prices moved higher after geo-political turmoil and concern over the strength of the U.S. economy increased demand for the precious metal. Additional losses were incurred during January from long positions in copper futures as prices declined on speculation that rising borrowing costs in emerging markets will dampen economic growth, eroding demand for industrial metals. Within the global stock index sector, losses were recorded during January from long positions in European and Pacific Rim equity index futures as prices declined amid growing concern the global economic recovery is faltering.

(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  Liquidity. The Partnership deposits its assets with MS&Co. as clearing commodity broker in separate Futures Interests trading accounts established for each Trading Advisor. Such assets are used as margin to engage in trading and may be used as margin solely for the Partnership's trading. The assets are held either in non-interest bearing bank accounts or in securities and instruments permitted by the CFTC for investment of customer segregated or secured funds. Since the Partnership's sole purpose is to trade in Futures Interests, it is expected that the Partnership will continue to own such liquid assets for margin purposes.  The Partnership's investment in Futures Interests, may, from time to time, be illiquid. Most U.S. futures exchanges limit fluctuations in prices during a single trading day by regulations referred to as "daily price fluctuation limits" or "daily limits." Trades may not be executed at prices beyond the daily limit. If the price for a particular futures or options contract has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit, positions in that futures or options contract can neither be taken nor liquidated unless traders are willing to effect trades at or within the limit. Futures prices have occasionally moved the daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no trading. These market conditions could prevent the Partnership from promptly liquidating its futures or options contracts and result in restrictions on redemptions.  There is no limitation on daily price movements in trading forward contracts on foreign currencies. The markets for some world currencies have low trading volume and are illiquid, which may prevent the Partnership from trading in potentially profitable markets or prevent the Partnership from promptly liquidating unfavorable positions in such markets, subjecting it to substantial losses. Either of these market conditions could result in restrictions on redemptions. For the periods covered by this report, illiquidity has not materially affected the Partnership's assets.  There are no known material trends, demands, commitments, events, or uncertainties at the present time that are reasonably likely to result in the Partnership's liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way.  Capital Resources. The Partnership does not have, nor does it expect to have, any capital assets. The Partnership's only assets are its (i) equity in trading account, consisting of restricted and unrestricted cash, net unrealized appreciation on open futures contracts, net unrealized appreciation on open forward contracts and investment in U.S. Treasury bills at fair value, if applicable, (ii) cash at bank and (iii) interest receivable. Redemptions of Units in the future will affect the amount of funds available for investments in Futures Interests in subsequent periods. It is not possible to estimate the amount, and therefore the impact, of future outflows of Units.  There are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, that would affect, nor any expected material changes to, the Partnership's capital resource arrangements at the present time.  Results of Operations  General. The Partnership's results depend on the Trading Advisors and the ability of each Trading Advisor's trading program to take advantage of price movements in the futures, forwards and options markets.  Graham currently trades its allocated portion of the Partnership's assets pursuant to Graham's Global Diversified Program, as described below, at 150% Leverage. The Global Diversified Program features the first trend system that Graham developed, which began trading client accounts in 1995. It utilizes multiple computerized trading models and offers broad diversification in both financial and non-financial markets, trading in approximately 65 global markets. The Global Diversified Program's trend system is primarily long-term in nature and is intended to generate significant returns over time with an acceptable degree of risk and volatility. The computer models analyze on a daily basis the recent price action, the relative strength and the risk characteristics of each market and compare statistically the quantitative results of this data to years of historical data on each market.  EMC currently trades its Classic Program for the Partnership. EMC's investment strategies are technical rather than fundamental in nature. In other words, they are developed from analysis of patterns of actual monthly, weekly and daily price movements and are not based on analysis of fundamental supply and demand factors, general economic factors, or anticipated world events. EMC relies on historical analysis of these price patterns to interpret current market behavior and to evaluate technical indicators for trade initiations and liquidations. EMC's investment strategies used in its program are trend-following. This means that initiation and liquidation of positions in a particular market are generally in the direction of the price trend in that market, although at times counter-trend elements also may be employed. EMC employs an investment strategy which utilizes a blend of systems (or, stated another way, a number of systems simultaneously). The strategies are diversified in that its program follows a number of Futures Interests and often invests in more than ten different interests at one time.  Rabar trades its investment strategy on behalf of the Partnership. The objective of Rabar's investment strategy is to generate capital appreciation over the long run by investing exclusively in Futures Interests, including exchange-traded futures contracts, options on futures contracts, foreign currency forward contracts and, to a very limited extent, cash commodities. Rabar may also engage in exchange for physical transactions, more commonly referred to as "EFPs". Rabar's strategy employs a diversified, systematic, technical, and trend-following approach, utilizing a blend of several separate and distinct quantitative models.  Prior to its termination on June 30, 2016, Altis traded its Global Futures Portfolio Program on behalf of the Partnership. It was a systematic, automated trading program built on the market experience of Altis' principals and employing a unique proprietary Advanced Asset Allocator. The Advanced Asset Allocator was specifically developed to manage portfolios of derivative instruments in a robust and scalable manner. The portfolio management technology combined original, traditional and contrasting investment techniques into one complete and comprehensive trading system. Investment changes were implemented after considering their effect on the whole portfolio and not just on the individual markets concerned.  Prior to its termination on August 8, 2014, Northfield traded its Diversified Program on behalf of the Partnership. The Diversified Program was conceived, tested, and refined by Northfield's principals. The approach was fully computerized and nondiscretionary. Money management principles were a critical element of the Diversified Program and were carefully constructed and rigorously applied to minimize risk exposure and to protect asset appreciation.  The following chart sets forth the percentage and the amount of the Partnership's net assets allocated to each Trading Advisor for the periods ended December 31, 2016 and September 30, 2016, respectively, and the change during the applicable period.   Allocation as of Allocation as of Allocation as of Allocation as of Change December 31, September 30, December 31, September 30, during the Trading Advisor 2016 (%) 2016 (%) 2016 ($) 2016 ($) period (%) Graham 50.25% 47.96% $ 30,143,981 $ 34,255,386 (12.00)% Rabar 29.30 29.68 17,578,213 21,199,541 (17.08) EMC 20.45 22.36 12,268,204 15,971,086 (23.18)  The following presents a summary of the Partnership's operations for each of the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, and a general discussion of its trading activities during each period. It is important to note, however, that the Trading Advisors trade in various markets at different times and that prior activity in a particular market does not mean that such market will be actively traded by the Trading Advisors or will be profitable in the future. Consequently, the results of operations of the Partnership are difficult to discuss other than in the context of the Trading Advisors' trading activities on behalf of the Partnership during the period in question. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.  The Partnership's results of operations set forth in the financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("GAAP"), which requires the use of certain accounting policies that affect the amounts reported in these financial statements, including the following: the contracts the Partnership trades are accounted for on a trade-date basis and marked to market on a daily basis. The difference between their original contract value and market value is recorded in the Statements of Income and Expenses as "Net change in unrealized gains (losses) on open contracts", and recorded as "Net realized gains (losses) on closed contracts" when open positions are closed out. The sum of these amounts constitutes the Partnership's trading results. The market value of a futures contract is the settlement price on the exchange on which that futures contract is traded on a particular day. The fair value of a foreign currency forward contract is extrapolated on a forward basis from the spot prices quoted as of approximately 3:00 P.M. (E.T.), the close of the business day. Interest income, as well as management fees, General Partner fees, ongoing placement fees, incentive fees and brokerage fees, as applicable, of the Partnership are recorded on an accrual basis.  The General Partner believes that, based on the nature of the operations of the Partnership, no assumptions relating to the application of critical accounting policies other than those presently used could reasonably affect reported amounts.  For the year ended December 31, 2016, the net asset value per Unit decreased 15.7% from $27.93 to $23.54. For the year ended December 31, 2015, the net asset value per Unit decreased 7.5% from $30.18 to $27.93. For the year ended December 31, 2014, the net asset value per Unit increased 14.0% from $26.48 to $30.18.  The Partnership experienced a net trading loss of $8,663,403 before fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016. Losses were primarily attributable to the Partnership's trading of Futures Interests in the commodity and equity sectors, and were partially offset by gains in the currencies and interest rates sectors. The net trading gain (or loss) realized from the Partnership is disclosed under "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."  The most significant losses were recorded in the metals sector during February from short positions in gold futures as prices advanced amid increased investor demand for precious metals. Meanwhile, losses were recorded during May from long positions in gold futures as prices declined as a strengthening U.S. dollar diminished investor demand for precious metals. Losses from long gold positions were also recorded during August. Additional losses in the metals sector were incurred throughout the year from positions in copper, aluminum, platinum, and tin futures. Within the energy sector, losses were incurred during August from short positions in crude oil and its related products as prices rallied amid speculation that crude producers were going to revive talks to stabilize prices at informal OPEC discussions in September. Additional losses were incurred during November from short positions in natural gas futures as prices advanced in the latter half of the month as demand from power generation, private homes, and businesses spiked. Within the global stock index sector, losses were incurred during the first quarter from long positions in U.S. equity index futures as prices declined sharply during January and February amid mounting investor concerns about declining oil prices and a China-led slowdown in global growth. Additional losses were incurred throughout the second quarter from positions in Asian equity index futures as prices moved without consistent direction amid speculation regarding the potential for increased stimulus measures from Japan and China. Within the agricultural sector, losses were incurred during January from long positions in cocoa futures as prices tumbled as funds cut bets on higher prices and signs emerged that the crop in Ghana, the second-biggest cocoa producer, was recovering from a five-year low. Additional losses were incurred during March from short positions in coffee futures as prices were boosted by a combination of fund buying, a weaker U.S. dollar, and concerns about dry weather in Colombia and Vietnam. Meanwhile, agricultural losses were incurred throughout the second half of the year from mixed positioning in corn futures as prices moved without consistent direction. The Partnership's trading losses for the year were partially offset by trading gains within the global interest rate sector during January and February from long positions in European and Pacific Rim fixed income futures as prices advanced after weakness in Chinese economic data revived concern about the stability of the global economy. Additional gains were experienced during June from long positions in European and U.S. fixed income futures as prices advanced as uncertainty surrounding the economic and political fallout following the U.K.'s vote in late June to leave the European Union increased demand for the relative "safety" of government debt. Within the currency sector, gains were experienced during October from short positions in the British pound versus the U.S. dollar as the relative value of the pound continued to weaken due to concerns regarding the political and economic implications of the U.K. referendum to leave the European Union. Additional gains were experienced throughout the year from positions in the Mexican peso and Canadian dollar.  The Partnership experienced a net trading loss of $1,474,902 before fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015. Losses were primarily attributable to the Partnership's trading of Futures Interests in the commodity, equity and interest rates sectors, and were partially offset by gains in the currencies sector.  The most significant losses were incurred within the global stock index sector, primarily during August and December, from long positions in U.S., European, and Pacific Rim equity index futures as prices declined sharply amid continuing concerns that China's slowdown will weigh on the global economy. Losses in this sector were also incurred during June. Within the agricultural sector, losses were incurred primarily during June from short positions in soybean and wheat futures as prices rallied after heavy rainfall in the U.S. Midwest raised the potential for crop damage. Additional losses in the agricultural sector were incurred throughout much of the year from long positions in cotton futures. Within the global interest rate sector, losses were incurred during the second quarter from long positions in European fixed income futures, specifically German bunds, as prices extended a decline as European leaders and the head of the International Monetary Fund agreed to step up the intensity of talks over Greece's financial fate. Additional fixed income losses were incurred during the fourth quarter from long positions in European fixed income futures after prices reversed sharply lower as European Central Bank ("ECB") president Mario Draghi disappointed markets early in December with an underwhelming ECB stimulus announcement. The Partnership's trading losses during the year were partially offset by trading gains within the energy markets, primarily during November and December, from short positions in crude oil futures as prices declined as U.S. crude supplies rose and OPEC production increased, signaling the global supply glut will persist. Further gains were recorded in energies during September and October. Within the currency sector, gains were experienced from short positions in the euro versus the Swiss franc as the value of the Swiss franc soared against currencies globally during mid-January after the Swiss National Bank abandoned its exchange-rate cap, which had previously maintained a minimum exchange-rate for the Swiss franc against the euro. Additional currency gains were recorded from positions in the Canadian dollar during July and in the Swiss franc during November. Within the metals sector, gains were experienced primarily during July from short futures positions in base metals as prices moved lower amid concern that a slowdown in the Chinese economy would weaken demand.  The Partnership experienced a net trading gain of $20,704,997 before fees and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2014. Gains were primarily attributable to the Partnership's trading of Futures Interests in the commodity, currencies and interest rates sectors, and were partially offset by losses in the equity sector.  The most significant gains were recorded within the global interest rate sector during May from long positions in European fixed income futures as prices advanced as German unemployment unexpectedly increased and euro-area lending contracted, boosting demand for the relative "safety" of government debt. Additional gains were experienced during August, October, November, and December as prices advanced amid speculation the ECB may turn to quantitative easing to stimulate the economy if the outlook in the region continued to worsen. Within the agricultural sector, gains were recorded during January and February primarily from long positions in soybean and soybean meal futures as prices advanced after adverse weather conditions in the U.S. and Brazil lowered crop estimates. Additional gains were recorded from long positions in livestock futures as prices trended higher throughout a majority of the first half of the year. Within the energy sector, gains were experienced during October, November, and December from short positions in crude oil and its related products as prices moved lower as U.S. oil production advanced to record levels and after OPEC decided not to reduce crude oil production amid a global supply glut. Within the currency sector, gains were experienced primarily during September, from short positions in the euro and Japanese yen versus the U.S. dollar. In September, the value of the U.S. dollar advanced as the U.S. employment rate fell to its lowest level since 2008 and the economy added more jobs than forecast, bolstering the case for the U.S. Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in 2015. Additional gains in this sector were recorded from positions in the Swiss Franc, New Zealand dollar, and Canadian dollar. A portion of the Partnership's gains during the year was offset by trading losses within the global stock index sector, primarily during January, from long positions in Pacific Rim and European equity index futures as prices declined amid growing concern the global economic recovery was faltering. Additional losses were incurred during December from long positions in European equity index futures as prices fell as a decline in oil prices and manufacturing data increased concern over slowing inflation and global growth. Within the metals sector, losses were incurred primarily during January and February from short positions in gold futures as prices moved higher after geo-political turmoil and concern over the strength of the U.S. economy increased demand for the precious metal. Additional losses were incurred during January from long positions in copper futures as prices declined on speculation that rising borrowing costs in emerging markets will dampen economic growth, eroding demand for industrial metals.  For an analysis of unrealized gains and losses by contract type and a further description of 2016 trading results, refer to the Partnership's Annual Report to Limited Partners for the year ended December 31, 2016, which is incorporated by reference to Exhibit 13.01 of this Form 10-K.  The Partnership's gains and losses are allocated among its partners for income tax purposes.  Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations  The Partnership does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, nor does it have contractual obligations or commercial commitments to make future payments, that would affect its liquidity or capital resources.  Market Risk  The Partnership is a party to financial instruments with elements of off-balance sheet market and credit risk. The Partnership, trade Futures Interests, including, but not limited to, foreign currencies, financial instruments, metals, energy, and agricultural products. In entering into these contracts, the Partnership are subject to the market risk that such contracts may be significantly influenced by market conditions, such as interest rate volatility, resulting in such contracts being less valuable. If the markets should move against all of the positions held by the Partnership at the same time, and the Trading Advisors were unable to offset positions of the Partnership, the Partnership could lose all of its assets and the limited partners would realize a loss equal to 100% of their capital accounts.  In addition to the Trading Advisors' internal controls, the Trading Advisors must comply with the Partnership's trading policies that include standards for liquidity and leverage that must be maintained. The Trading Advisors and Ceres monitor the Partnership's trading activities to ensure compliance with the trading policies and Ceres can require the Trading Advisors to modify positions of the Partnership if Ceres believes they violate the Partnership's trading policies.  Credit Risk  In addition to market risk, in entering into Futures Interests, there is a credit risk to the Partnership that the counterparty on a contract will not be able to meet its obligations to the Partnership. The ultimate counterparty or guarantor of the Partnership for Futures Interests traded in the U.S., and most foreign exchanges on which the Partnership trade, is the clearinghouse associated with such exchange. In general, a clearinghouse is backed by the membership of the exchange and will act in the event of non-performance by one of its members or one of its member's customers, which should significantly reduce this credit risk. There is no assurance that a clearinghouse, exchange, or other exchange member will meet its obligations to the Partnership, and Ceres and the commodity brokers will not indemnify the Partnership against a default by such parties. Further, the law is unclear as to whether a commodity broker has any obligation to protect its customers from loss in the event of an exchange or clearinghouse defaulting on trades effected for the broker's customers. In cases where the Partnership trade off-exchange forward contracts with a counterparty, the sole recourse of the Partnership will be the forward contract's counterparty.  Ceres deals with these credit risks of the Partnership in several ways. First, Ceres monitors the Partnership's credit exposure to each exchange on a daily basis. The commodity brokers inform the Partnership, as with all of their customers, of the Partnership's net margin requirements for all of its existing open positions, and Ceres has installed a system which permits it to monitor the Partnership's potential net credit exposure, exchange by exchange, by adding the unrealized trading gains on each exchange, if any, to the Partnership's margin liability thereon.  Second, the Partnership's trading policies limit the amount of its net assets that can be committed at any given time to futures contracts and require a minimum amount of diversification in the Partnership's trading, usually over several different products and exchanges. Historically, the Partnership's exposure to any one exchange has typically amounted to only a small percentage of its total net assets and, on those relatively few occasions where the Partnership's credit exposure climbs above such level, Ceres deals with the situation on a case by case basis, carefully weighing whether the increased level of credit exposure remains appropriate.  Third, with respect to forwards and options on forward contract trading, the Partnership trades with only those counterparties which Ceres, together with MS&Co., has determined to be creditworthy. The Partnership presently deals with MS&Co., as the sole counterparty on all trading of foreign currency forward contracts and options on foreign currency forward contracts.  Material changes to the trading policies may be made only with the prior written approval of the limited partners owning more than 50% of Units then outstanding.  Third, with respect to forwards and options on forward contract trading, the Partnership trades with only those counterparties which Ceres, together with MS&Co., has determined to be creditworthy. The Partnership presently deals with MS&Co. as the sole counterparty on all trading of foreign currency forward contracts.  For additional information, see Note 5, "Financial Instruments" under "Notes to Financial Statements" in the Partnership's Annual Report to Limited Partners for the year ended December 31, 2016, which is incorporated by reference to Exhibit 13.01 of this Form 10-K.  Inflation has not been a major factor in the Partnership's operations.  Critical Accounting Policies.  The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires the General Partner to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting period. As a result, actual results could differ from these estimates. A summary of the Partnership's significant accounting policies is described in Note 2 to the Partnership's financial statements included in "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data."  The Partnership's most significant accounting policy is the valuation of its investments in Futures Interests and U.S. Treasury bills, as applicable. The fair value of exchange-traded futures, option and forward contracts is determined by the various exchanges, and reflects the settlement price for each contract as of the close of business on the last business day of the reporting period. The fair value of foreign currency forward contracts is extrapolated on a forward basis from the spot prices quoted as of approximately 3:00 P.M. (E.T.) on the last business day of the reporting period from various exchanges. The fair value of non-exchange-traded foreign currency option contracts is calculated by applying an industry standard model application for options valuation of foreign currency options, using as inputs the spot prices, interest rates, and option implied volatilities quoted as of approximately 3:00 P.M. (E.T.) on the last business day of the reporting period. U.S. Treasury bills are valued at the last available bid price received from independent pricing services as of the close of the last business day of the reporting period.  Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.  The Partnership is a commodity pool engaged primarily in the speculative trading of futures, forwards and options.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS



June 30, 2002


(Unaudited)


The unaudited financial statements contained herein include, in
the opinion of management, all adjustments necessary for a fair
presentation of the results of operations and financial condition
of Morgan Stanley Spectrum Select L.P. (the "Partnership").  The
financial statements and condensed notes herein should be read in
conjunction with the Partnership's December 31, 2001 Annual Report
on Form 10-K.


1.  Organization
Morgan Stanley Spectrum Select L.P. is a Delaware limited
partnership organized to engage primarily in the speculative
trading of futures contracts, options on futures contracts, and
forward contracts on physical commodities and other commodity
interests, including, but not limited to foreign currencies,
financial instruments, metals, energy and agricultural products.
The Partnership is one of the Morgan Stanley Spectrum Series of
funds, comprised of the Partnership, Morgan Stanley Spectrum
Commodity L.P., Morgan Stanley Spectrum Currency L.P., Morgan
Stanley Spectrum Global Balanced L.P., Morgan Stanley Spectrum
Strategic L.P., and Morgan Stanley Spectrum Technical L.P.






MORGAN STANLEY SPECTRUM SELECT L.P.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)



The general partner for the Partnership is Demeter Management
Corporation ("Demeter"). The non-clearing commodity broker is
Morgan Stanley DW Inc. ("Morgan Stanley DW").  The clearing
commodity brokers are Morgan Stanley & Co., Inc. ("MS & Co.") and
Morgan Stanley & Co. International Limited ("MSIL").  Demeter,
Morgan Stanley DW, MS & Co., and MSIL are wholly-owned
subsidiaries of Morgan Stanley.  The trading advisors to the
Partnership are EMC Capital Management, Inc., Rabar Market
Research, Inc., Sunrise Capital Management, Inc., and Northfield
Trading L.P. (collectively, the "Trading Advisors").


Effective June 20, 2002, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Co. changed
its name to Morgan Stanley.


2.  Related Party Transactions
The Partnership's cash is on deposit with Morgan Stanley DW, MS &
Co., and MSIL in futures, forwards, and options trading accounts
to meet margin requirements as needed.  Morgan Stanley DW pays
interest on these funds based on a prevailing rate on U.S.
Treasury bills.  The Partnership pays brokerage fees to Morgan
Stanley DW.

3.  Financial Instruments
The Partnership trades futures contracts, options on futures
contracts, and forward contracts on physical commodities and other
commodity interests, including, but not limited to foreign
currencies, financial instruments, metals, energy and agricultural
products.  Futures and forwards represent contracts for delayed
delivery of an instrument at a specified date and price.  Risk
arises from changes in the value of these contracts and the
potential inability of counterparties to perform under the terms
of the contracts.  There are numerous factors which may
significantly influence the market value of these contracts,
including interest rate volatility.


The market value of contracts is based on closing prices quoted
by the exchange, bank or clearing firm through which the
contracts are traded.


The Partnership's contracts are accounted for on a trade-date
basis and marked to market on a daily basis.  The Partnership
accounts for its derivative investments in accordance with the
provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 133,
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities"






MORGAN STANLEY SPECTRUM SELECT L.P.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)



("SFAS No. 133").  SFAS No. 133 defines a derivative as a
financial instrument or other contract that has all three of the
following characteristics:


1)      One or more underlying notional amounts or payment
provisions;

2)      Requires no initial net investment or a smaller initial net
investment than would be required relative to changes in
market factors;

3)      Terms require or permit net settlement.


Generally derivatives include futures, forward, swaps or options
contracts, and other financial instruments with similar
characteristics such as caps, floors and collars.


The net unrealized gains on open contracts, reported as a
component of "Equity in futures interests trading accounts" on the
statements of financial condition, and their longest contract
maturities were as follows:

The Partnership has credit risk associated with counterparty non-
performance.  The credit risk associated with the instruments in
which the Partnership is involved is limited to the amounts
reflected in the Partnership's statements of financial condition.


The Partnership also has credit risk because Morgan Stanley DW, MS
& Co., and MSIL act as the futures commission merchants or the
counterparties, with respect to most of the Partnership's assets.
Exchange-traded futures and futures-styled options contracts are
marked to market on a daily basis, with variations in value
settled on a daily basis.  Each of Morgan Stanley DW, MS & Co.,
and MSIL, as a futures commission merchant for the Partnership's
exchange-traded futures and futures-styled options contracts, are
required, pursuant to regulations of the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission ("CFTC"), to segregate from their own assets, and for
the sole benefit of their commodity customers, all funds held by






MORGAN STANLEY SPECTRUM SELECT L.P.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONCLUDED)



them with respect to exchange-traded futures and futures-styled
options contracts, including an amount equal to the net unrealized
gains on all open futures and futures-styled options contracts,
which funds, in the aggregate, totaled $262,738,330 and
$236,193,605 at June 30, 2002 and December 31, 2001, respectively.
With respect to the Partnership's off-exchange-traded forward
currency contracts, there are no daily settlements of variations
in value nor is there any requirement that an amount equal to the
net unrealized gains on open forward contracts be segregated. With
respect to those off-exchange-traded forward currency contracts,
the Partnership is at risk to the ability of MS & Co., the sole
counterparty on all of such contracts, to perform.  The
Partnership has a netting agreement with MS & Co.  This agreement,
which seeks to reduce both the Partnership's and MS & Co.'s
exposure on off-exchange-traded forward currency contracts, should
materially decrease the Partnership's credit risk in the event of
MS & Co.'s bankruptcy or insolvency.





Item 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL



CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS



Liquidity.  The Partnership deposits its assets with Morgan
Stanley DW as non-clearing broker, and MS & Co. and MSIL as
clearing brokers in separate futures, forwards, and options
trading accounts established for each Trading Advisor, which
assets are used as margin to engage in trading.  The assets are
held in either non-interest bearing bank accounts or in securities
and instruments permitted by the CFTC for investment of customer
segregated or secured funds.  The Partnership's assets held by the
commodity brokers may be used as margin solely for the
Partnership's trading.  Since the Partnership's sole purpose is to
trade in futures, forwards, and options, it is expected that the
Partnership will continue to own such liquid assets for margin
purposes.


The Partnership's investment in futures, forwards, and options
may, from time to time, be illiquid.  Most U.S. futures exchanges
limit fluctuations in prices during a single day by regulations
referred to as "daily price fluctuations limits" or "daily
limits".  Trades may not be executed at prices beyond the daily
limit.  If the price for a particular futures or options contract
has increased or decreased by an amount equal to the daily limit,
positions in that futures or options contract can neither be taken
nor liquidated unless traders are willing to effect trades at or





within the limit.  Futures prices have occasionally moved the
daily limit for several consecutive days with little or no
trading.  These market conditions could prevent the Partnership
from promptly liquidating its futures or options contracts and
result in restrictions on redemptions.


There is no limitation on daily price moves in trading forward
contracts on foreign currency.  The markets for some world
currencies have low trading volume and are illiquid, which may
prevent the Partnership from trading in potentially profitable
markets or prevent the Partnership from promptly liquidating
unfavorable positions in such markets, subjecting it to
substantial losses.  Either of these market conditions could
result in restrictions on redemptions.


There are no material trends, events, or uncertainties known at
the present time that will result in or that are reasonably likely
to result in the Partnership's liquidity increasing or decreasing
in any material way.


The Partnership has never had illiquidity affect a material
portion of its assets.





The Partnership has no off-balance sheet arrangements, nor
contractual obligations or commercial commitments to make future
payments that would affect the Partnership's liquidity or capital
resources.  The contracts traded by the Partnership are accounted
for on a trade-date basis and marked to market on a daily basis.
The value of foreign currency forward contracts is based on the
spot rate as of the close of business, New York City time, on a
given day.


Capital Resources.  The Partnership does not have, nor expect to
have, any capital assets.  Redemptions, exchanges, and sales of
additional units of limited partnership interest ("Unit(s)") in
the future will affect the amount of funds available for
investment in futures, forwards, and options in subsequent
periods. It is not possible to estimate the amount and therefore,
the impact of future redemptions of Units.


There are no known material trends, favorable or unfavorable, nor
any expected material changes to the Partnership's capital
resource arrangements at the present time.


Results of Operations

General.  The Partnership's results depend on the Trading Advisors
and the ability of the Trading Advisors' trading programs to take





advantage of price movements or other profit opportunities in the
futures, forwards, and options markets.  The following presents a
summary of the Partnership's operations for the three and six
month periods ended June 30, 2002 and 2001, and a general
discussion of its trading activities during each period.  It is
important to note, however, that the Trading Advisors trade in
various markets at different times and that prior activity in a
particular market does not mean that such market will be actively
traded by the Trading Advisors or will be profitable in the
future.  Consequently, the results of operations of the
Partnership are difficult to discuss other than in the context of
the Trading Advisors' trading activities on behalf of the
Partnership and how the Partnership has performed in the past.


The Partnership's results of operations are set forth in financial
statements prepared in accordance with United States generally
accepted accounting principles, which require the use of certain
accounting policies that affect the amounts reported in these
financial statements, including the following.  The contracts the
Partnership trades are accounted for on a trade-date basis and
marked to market on a daily basis.  The difference between their
cost and market value is recorded on the Statements of Operations
as "Net change in unrealized profit/loss" for open (unrealized)
contracts, and recorded as "Realized profit/loss" when open





positions are closed out, and the sum of these amounts constitutes
the Partnership's trading revenues.  Earned interest income
revenue, as well as management fees, incentive fees and brokerage
fees expenses of the Partnership are recorded on an accrual basis.
Demeter believes that, based on the nature of the operations of
the Partnership, no assumptions other than those presently used
relating to the application of critical accounting policies are
reasonably plausible that could affect reported amounts.


For the Quarter and Six Months Ended June 30, 2002
For the quarter ended June 30, 2002, the Partnership recorded
total revenues, including interest income, of $35,775,689 and
posted an increase in net asset value per Unit.  The most
significant gains of approximately 15.8% were recorded in the
currency markets primarily during May and June from previously
established long positions in the euro, Swiss franc and Japanese
yen relative to the U.S. dollar as the value of these currencies
strengthened against the dollar amid falling equity prices,
concerns regarding corporate accounting integrity and weak
economic data.  Additional gains of approximately 1.6% were
recorded in the global stock index futures markets from short
positions in U.S and European stock index futures as prices
trended lower on geopolitical concerns and uncertainty
surrounding a global economic recovery.  A portion of the





Partnership's overall gains for the quarter was offset by losses
of approximately 2.3% in the energy markets primarily from
previously established long futures positions in crude oil and
its related products as prices moved lower on supply and demand
concerns.  Elsewhere in the energy markets, losses were recorded
in natural gas futures from long positions as prices reversed
lower during May on supply and demand concerns.  Total expenses
for the three months ended June 30, 2002 were $6,090,700,
resulting in net income of $29,684,989.  The net asset value of a
Unit increased from $22.86 at March 31, 2002 to $25.67 at June
30, 2002.


For the six months ended June 30, 2002, the Partnership recorded
total trading revenues, including interest income of $30,809,741
and posted an increase in net asset value per Unit.  The most
significant gains of approximately 11.3% were recorded in the
currency markets primarily during May and June from previously
established long positions in the euro, Swiss franc and Japanese
yen relative to the U.S. dollar as the value of these currencies
strengthened against the dollar amid falling equity prices,
concerns regarding corporate accounting integrity and weak
economic data.   Additional gains of approximately 0.8% were
recorded in the energy markets primarily during March following a
higher supplies report and forecasts of mild weather for the





Eastern U.S., resulting in gains from previously established
short futures positions.  A portion of the Partnership's overall
gains for the year was offset by losses of approximately 0.8% in
the global interest rate futures markets primarily during April
from previously established short Japanese and European interest
rate futures as prices trended higher, drawing strength from
declining equity prices.  Total expenses for the six months ended
June 30, 2002 were $12,156,252, resulting in net income of
$18,653,489.  The net asset value of a Unit increased from $23.96
at December 31, 2001 to $25.67 at June 30, 2002.


For the Quarter and Six Months Ended June 30, 2001
For the quarter ended June 30, 2001, the Partnership recorded
total trading losses, net of interest income, of $16,536,822 and
posted a decrease in net asset value per Unit.  The most
significant losses of approximately 4.7% were experienced
primarily during April in the global interest rate futures
markets as a portion of previously recorded profits was given
back from long positions in U.S and European interest rate
futures markets as a portion of previously recorded profits was
given back from long positions in U.S. and European interest rate
futures as prices reversed sharply downward, after trending
higher earlier this year, as investors deserted fixed income
securities in an asset shift to equities. Losses were also





recorded from short positions in U.S. interest rate futures as
prices moved higher in a flurry of flight-to-quality buying
spawned by Middle East instability on June 22nd and in
anticipation of the Federal Reserve interest rate cut in late
June.  Additional losses were recorded during the third week of
June from short positions in German interest rate futures as
prices increased following a drop in German business confidence
data and signs that inflation may have peaked in that region,
strengthening the possibility of European interest rate cuts.  In
the global stock index futures markets, losses of approximately
2.3% were incurred primarily during the first half of April from
short positions in DAX Index futures as prices reversed higher on
renewed hopes that the worst may have been over for badly beaten
technology and telecom stocks. During May and June, additional
losses were recorded from DAX Index futures positions as prices
generally moved in an erratic, directionless pattern on
conflicting economic information and investor sentiment.  In the
currency markets, losses of approximately 1.3% were recorded
primarily during early June from long positions in the British
pound as its value weakened relative to the U.S. dollar in
reaction to reports that British Prime Minister Blair would push
for Great Britain's entry into the European Monetary Union.  In
the metals markets, small losses were experienced primarily
during late May from newly established long gold futures





positions as gold prices sharply reversed lower, after spiking
higher earlier in May, following the return of more bearish
sentiment regarding the outlook for the U.S. economy.  These
losses were partially offset by gains of approximately 0.5%
recorded primarily during May and June in the energy markets from
short natural gas futures positions as prices declined on
continued concerns about rising U.S. natural gas inventories and
mild weather across the United States.  Total expenses for the
three months ended June 30, 2001 were $6,075,120, resulting in a
net loss of $22,611,942.  The net asset value of a Unit decreased
from $26.12 at March 31, 2001 to $23.75 at June 30,2001.


For the six months ended June 30, 2001, the Partnership recorded
total trading revenues, including interest income, of $13,988,194
and posted an increase in net asset value per Unit.  The most
significant gains of approximately 3.7% were recorded during
January in the global interest rate futures markets from long
positions in Japanese government bond futures as prices moved
higher on concerns regarding that country's economy.  During May
and June, profits were recorded from long positions in Japanese
interest rate futures as prices rose in response to Japanese
government's pledge for fiscal reform.  Additional gains were
recorded throughout the majority of the first quarter from long
positions in eurodollar futures as prices rose amid a rattled





stock market, shaky consumer confidence, positive inflation data
and interest rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve.  In the
currency markets, profits of approximately 2.0% were recorded
throughout a majority of the first quarter from short positions
in the Japanese yen as its value weakened relative to the U.S.
dollar on continuing concerns for the Japanese economy and in
both anticipation and reaction to the Bank of Japan's decision to
reinstate its zero interest rate policy.  In the metals markets,
gains of approximately 0.6% were recorded from short copper
futures positions as the slowdown in the U.S. economy and weak
demand continued to drive prices lower.  These gains were
partially offset by losses of approximately 1.2% recorded
throughout a majority of the quarter in the energy markets from
long positions in natural gas futures as prices reversed the
sharp upward trend experienced in late 2000 amid bearish
inventory data and forecasts for favorable weather.  In the
agricultural markets, losses of approximately 0.3% were
experienced primarily during the first quarter from long corn
futures positions as prices moved lower due to favorable South
American weather.  Total expenses for the six months ended June
30, 2001 were $12,553,302, resulting in net income of $1,434,892.
The net asset value of a Unit increased from $23.57 at December
31, 2000 to $23.75 at June 30, 2001.










Item 3.         QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET

RISK



Introduction

The Partnership is a commodity pool engaged primarily in the
speculative trading of futures, forwards, and options.  The
market-sensitive instruments held by the Partnership are acquired
for speculative trading purposes only and, as a result, all or
substantially all of the Partnership's assets are at risk of
trading loss.  Unlike an operating company, the risk of market-
sensitive instruments is central, not incidental, to the
Partnership's main business activities.


The futures, forwards, and options traded by the Partnership
involve varying degrees of related market risk.  Market risk is
often dependent upon changes in the level or volatility of
interest rates, exchange rates, and prices of financial
instruments and commodities.  Fluctuations in market risk based
upon these factors result in frequent changes in the fair value
of the Partnership's open positions, and, consequently, in its
earnings and cash flow.


The Partnership's total market risk is influenced by a wide
variety of factors, including the diversification among the
Partnership's open positions, the volatility present within the
markets, and the liquidity of the markets.  At different times,





each of these factors may act to increase or decrease the market
risk associated with the Partnership.


The Partnership's past performance is not necessarily indicative
of its future results.  Any attempt to numerically quantify the
Partnership's market risk is limited by the uncertainty of its
speculative trading.  The Partnership's speculative trading may
cause future losses and volatility (i.e., "risk of ruin") that
far exceed the Partnership's experience to date or any reasonable
expectations based upon historical changes in market value.


Quantifying the Partnership's Trading Value at Risk
The following quantitative disclosures regarding the Partnership's
market risk exposures contain "forward-looking statements" within
the meaning of the safe harbor from civil liability provided for
such statements by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995 (set forth in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and

Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934).  All
quantitative disclosures in this section are deemed to be forward-
looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor, except for
statements of historical fact.


The Partnership accounts for open positions on the basis of mark-
to-market accounting principles.  Any loss in the market value of
the Partnership's open positions is directly reflected in the





Partnership's earnings, whether realized or unrealized, and its
cash flow.  Profits and losses on open positions of exchange-
traded futures, forwards, and options are settled daily through
variation margin.


The Partnership's risk exposure in the market sectors traded by
the Trading Advisors is estimated below in terms of Value at Risk
("VaR"). The VaR model used by the Partnership includes many
variables that could change the market value of the Partnership's
trading portfolio.  The Partnership estimates VaR using a model
based upon historical simulation with a confidence level of 99%.
Historical simulation involves constructing a distribution of
hypothetical daily changes in the value of a trading portfolio.
The VaR model takes into account linear exposures to price and
interest rate risk.  Market risks that are incorporated in the
VaR model include equity and commodity prices, interest rates,
foreign exchange rates, and correlation among these variables.
The hypothetical changes in portfolio value are based on daily
percentage changes observed in key market indices or other market
factors ("market risk factors") to which the portfolio is
sensitive.  The historical observation period of the Partner-
ship's VaR is approximately four years.  The one-day 99%
confidence level of the Partnership's VaR corresponds to the
negative change in portfolio value that, based on observed market
risk factors, would have been exceeded once in 100 trading days.





In other words, one-day VaR for a portfolio is a number such that
losses in this portfolio are estimated to exceed the VaR only one
day in 100.


VaR is calculated using historical simulation.  Demeter uses
approximately four years of daily market data (1,000
observations) and revalues its portfolio (using delta-gamma
approximations) for each of the historical market moves that
occurred over the time period.  This generates a probability
distribution of daily 'simulated profit and loss' outcomes.  The
VaR is the appropriate percentile of this distribution.  For
example, the 99% one-day VaR would represent the 10th worst
outcome from Demeter's simulated profit and loss series.


VaR models, including the Partnership's, are continuously
evolving as trading portfolios become more diverse and modeling
techniques and systems capabilities improve.  Please note that
the VaR model is used to numerically quantify market risk for
historic reporting purposes only and is not utilized by either
Demeter or the Trading Advisors in their daily risk management
activities.  Please further note that VaR as described above may
not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other
entities.





The Partnership's Value at Risk in Different Market Sectors
The following table indicates the VaR associated with the
Partnership's open positions as a percentage of total net assets
by primary market risk category at June 30, 2002 and 2001. At
June 30, 2002 and 2001, the Partnership's total capitalization
was approximately $272 million and $229 million, respectively.








   Primary Market           June 30, 2002      June 30, 2001
Risk Category                   Value at Risk          Value at Risk

   Currency                                        (1.62)%           (2.21)%
   Interest Rate                           (1.35)            (0.76)
   Equity                                  (0.55)            (0.33)
   Commodity                                       (0.78)            (0.72)
   Aggregate Value at Risk         (2.44)%           (2.27)%








The VaR for a market category represents the one-day downside risk
for the aggregate exposures associated with this market category.
The aggregate VaR, listed above for the Partnership, represents
the aggregate VaR of the Partnership's open positions across all
the market categories, and is less than the sum of the VaRs for
all such market categories due to the diversification benefit
across asset classes.


The table above represents the VaR of the Partnership's open
positions at June 30, 2002 and 2001 only and is not necessarily
representative of either the historic or future risk of an





investment in the Partnership. Because the Partnership's only
business is the speculative trading of futures, forwards, and
options, the composition of its trading portfolio can change
significantly over any given time period, or even within a single
trading day. Any changes in open positions could positively or
negatively materially impact market risk as measured by VaR.


The table below supplements the quarter-end VaR by presenting the
Partnership's high, low, and average VaR, as a percentage of
total net assets for the four quarterly reporting periods from
July 1, 2001 through June 30, 2002.








Primary Market Risk Category        High      Low      Average
        Currency                                        (2.02)  (0.46)  (1.17)
        Interest Rate                           (1.46)  (0.49)  (1.18)
        Equity                                  (0.71)  (0.30)  (0.47)
        Commodity                                       (1.62)  (0.40)  (0.87)
        Aggregate Value at Risk         (2.54)  (1.69)  (2.24)








Limitations on Value at Risk as an Assessment of Market Risk
The face value of the market sector instruments held by the
Partnership is typically many times the applicable margin
requirements.  Margin requirements generally range between 2% and
15% of contract face value. Additionally, the use of leverage
causes the face value of the market sector instruments held by the





Partnership to typically be many times the total capitalization of
the Partnership.  The value of the Partnership's open positions
thus creates a "risk of ruin" not typically found in other
investments.  The relative size of the positions held may cause
the Partnership to incur losses greatly in excess of VaR within a
short period of time, given the effects of the leverage employed
and market volatility.  The VaR tables above, as well as the past
performance of the Partnership, give no indication of such "risk
of ruin". In addition, VaR risk measures should be viewed in light
of the methodology's limitations, which include the following:

?       past changes in market risk factors will not always result in
accurate predictions of the distributions and correlations of
future market movements;

?       changes in portfolio value caused by market movements may
differ from those of the VaR model;

?       VaR results reflect past trading positions while future risk
depends on future positions;

?       VaR using a one-day time horizon does not fully capture the
market risk of positions that cannot be liquidated or hedged
within one day; and

?       the historical market risk factor data used for VaR estimation
may provide only limited insight into losses that could be
incurred under certain unusual market movements.





The VaR tables above present the results of the Partnership's VaR
for each of the Partnership's market risk exposures and on an
aggregate basis at June 30, 2002, and 2001, and for the end of the
four quarterly reporting periods from July 1, 2001 through June
30, 2002.  Since VaR is based on historical data, VaR should not
be viewed as predictive of the Partnership's future financial
performance or its ability to manage or monitor risk.  There can
be no assurance that the Partnership's actual losses on a
particular day will not exceed the VaR amounts indicated above or
that such losses will not occur more than once in 100 trading
days.


Non-Trading Risk

The Partnership has non-trading market risk on its foreign cash
balances not needed for margin.  These balances and any market
risk they may represent are immaterial.


At June 30, 2002, the Partnership's cash balance at Morgan Stanley
DW was approximately 79% of its total net asset value.  A decline
in short-term interest rates will result in a decline in the
Partnership's cash management income. This cash flow risk is not
considered to be material.


Materiality, as used throughout this section, is based on an
assessment of reasonably possible market movements and any





associated potential losses, taking into account the leverage,
optionality and multiplier features of the Partnership's market-
sensitive instruments, in relation to the Partnership's net assets.


Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Primary Trading Risk Exposures
The following qualitative disclosures regarding the Partnership's
market risk exposures - except for (A) those disclosures that are
statements of historical fact and (B) the descriptions of how the
Partnership manages its primary market risk exposures - constitute
forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of
the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act.
The Partnership's primary market risk exposures as well as the
strategies used and to be used by Demeter and the Trading Advisors
for managing such exposures are subject to numerous uncertainties,
contingencies and risks, any one of which could cause the actual
results of the Partnership's risk controls to differ materially
from the objectives of such strategies.  Government interventions,
defaults and expropriations, illiquid markets, the emergence of
dominant fundamental factors, political upheavals, changes in
historical price relationships, an influx of new market
participants, increased regulation and many other factors could
result in material losses as well as in material changes to the
risk exposures and the risk management strategies of the
Partnership.  Investors must be prepared to lose all or
substantially all of their investment in the Partnership.





The following were the primary trading risk exposures of the
Partnership at June 30, 2002, by market sector.  It may be
anticipated, however, that these market exposures will vary
materially over time.


Currency.  The primary market exposure of the Partnership at June
30, 2002 was to the currency complex.  The Partnership's currency
exposure is to exchange rate fluctuations, primarily fluctuations
which disrupt the historical pricing relationships between
different currencies and currency pairs.  Interest rate changes
as well as political and general economic conditions influence
these fluctuations.  The Partnership trades a large number of
currencies, including cross-rates - i.e., positions between two
currencies other than the U.S. dollar.  At June 30, 2002, the
Partnership's major exposures were to outright U.S. dollar
positions.  Outright positions consist of the U.S. dollar vs.
other currencies.  These other currencies include major and minor
currencies.  Demeter does not anticipate that the risk profile of
the Partnership's currency sector will change significantly in
the future.  The currency trading VaR figure includes foreign
margin amounts converted into U.S. dollars with an incremental
adjustment to reflect the exchange rate risk inherent to the
U.S.-based Partnership in expressing VaR in a functional currency
other than U.S. dollars.


Interest Rate.  The second largest market exposure of the





Partnership at June 30, 2002 was to the global interest rate
sector.  The Partnership's exposure in the interest rate market
complex was primarily spread across the U.S., European and
Japanese interest rate sectors.  Interest rate movements directly
affect the price of the sovereign bond futures positions held by
the Partnership and indirectly affect the value of its stock
index and currency positions.  Interest rate movements in one
country as well as relative interest rate movements between
countries materially impact the Partnership's profitability.  The
Partnership's primary interest rate exposure is generally to
interest rate fluctuations in the U.S. and the other G-7
countries.  The G-7 countries consist of France, the U.S.,
Britain, Germany, Japan, Italy, and Canada.  However, the
Partnership also takes futures positions in the government debt
of smaller nations - e.g. Australia.  Demeter anticipates that G-
7 and Australian interest rates will remain the primary interest
rate exposure of the Partnership for the foreseeable future.  The
speculative futures positions held by the Partnership may range
from short to long-term instruments.  Consequently, changes in
short, medium or long-term interest rates may have an effect on
the Partnership.


Equity. The third largest exposure at June 30, 2002 was to
equity price risk in the G-7 countries.  The stock index futures
traded by the Partnership are by law limited to futures on
broadly-based indices.  At June 30, 2002, the Partnership's





primary exposures were to the NASDAQ (U.S.), S&P 500 (U.S.),
Nikkei (Japan) and Hang Seng (China) stock indices.  The
Partnership is primarily exposed to the risk of adverse price
trends or static markets in the U.S and Japanese indices.  Static
markets would not cause major market changes but would make it
difficult for the Partnership to avoid being "whipsawed" into
numerous small losses.


Commodity.

Energy.  At June 30, 2002, the Partnership's energy exposure
was shared primarily by futures contracts in crude oil and
its related products, and natural gas.  Price movements in
the energy markets result from political developments in the
Middle East, weather patterns and other economic
fundamentals.  Significant profits and losses, which have
been experienced in the past, are expected to continue to be
experienced in these markets.  Natural gas has exhibited
volatility in prices resulting from weather patterns and
supply and demand factors and may continue in this choppy
pattern.


Soft Commodities and Agriculturals.  At June 30, 2002, the
Partnership had exposure to the markets that comprise these
sectors.  Most of the exposure was to cotton, coffee, sugar,
corn and soybean markets.  Supply and demand inequalities,
severe weather disruption and market expectations affect
price movements in these markets.





Metals. The Partnership's metals exposure at June 30, 2002
was to fluctuations in the price of precious metals, such as
gold and silver, and base metals, such as copper, nickel,
lead, zinc and aluminum.  Economic forces, supply and demand
inequalities, geopolitical factors and market expectations
influence price movement in these markets.  The Trading
Advisors, from time to time, take positions when market
opportunities develop.  Demeter anticipates that the
Partnership will continue to be exposed to the precious and
base metals markets.


Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Non-Trading Risk Exposure
The following was the only non-trading risk exposure of the
Partnership at June 30, 2002:


Foreign Currency Balances. The Partnership's primary foreign
currency balances at June 30, 2002 were in Hong Kong
dollars, euros and Japanese yen.  The Partnership controls
the non-trading risk of these balances by regularly
converting them back into U.S. dollars upon liquidation of
their respective positions.


Qualitative Disclosures Regarding Means of Managing Risk Exposure
The Partnership and the Trading Advisors, separately, attempt to
manage the risk of the Partnership's open positions in essentially





the same manner in all market categories traded.  Demeter attempts
to manage market exposure by diversifying the Partnership's assets
among different Trading Advisors, each of whose strategies focus
on different market sectors and trading approaches, and monitoring
the performance of the Trading Advisors daily.  In addition, the
Trading Advisors establish diversification guidelines, often set
in terms of the maximum margin to be committed to positions in any
one market sector or market-sensitive instrument.


Demeter monitors and controls the risk of the Partnership's non-
trading instrument, cash.  Cash is the only Partnership investment
directed by Demeter, rather than the Trading Advisors.
