      Fitch Expects to Rate Honda Auto Receivables 2013-2 Owner Trust; Presale 
      Issued
    





April 15, 2013 09:20 AM Eastern Daylight Time



NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Fitch Ratings expects to assign the following ratings to the Honda Auto 
      Receivables 2013-2 Owner Trust notes:
    

      --$283,000,000 class A-1 'F1+sf';
    

      --$313,000,000 class A-2 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$294,000,000 class A-3 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    

      --$110,000,000 class A-4 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable.
    

      Key Rating Drivers
    

      Strong Credit Quality: The credit quality of 2013-2, as measured by the 
      weighted average (WA) Fair Isaac Corp. (FICO) score of 752 and internal 
      credit score tiering, is consistent with 2013-1 and prior 2012 and 2011 
      pools. A major portion of the 2013-2 pool is subvented. New vehicles 
      total 86.41% in 2012-3, consistent with prior transactions, and the pool 
      has 12.61 months of seasoning.
    

      Consistent Credit Enhancement Structure: The cash flow distribution is a 
      sequential-pay structure, consistent with prior transactions. Initial 
      hard credit enhancement (CE) is 2.75% (subordination of 2.50% and a 
      0.25% reserve). A yield supplement account (YSA) boosts the effective WA 
      APR and, thus, excess spread (XS) is higher, which totals 2.25% in 
      2013-2.
    

      Strong Portfolio/Securitization Performance: Losses and delinquencies on 
      AHFC's portfolio and 2009-2012 securitizations are improved over those 
      of 2006-2008, supported by strong credit quality, enhanced servicing 
      policies, improvement in the economy (albeit volatile) and strong 
      recovery rates.
    

      Stable Corporate Health: Fitch rates AHFC 'F1' and its parent, Honda, 
      'F1/A' with a Stable Rating Outlook. AHFC has recorded positive 
      corporate financial results in recent years, while the overall health of 
      Honda has remained strong.
    

      Consistent Origination/Underwriting/Servicing: AHFC demonstrates 
      capabilities as originator, underwriter, and servicer, as evidenced by 
      historical portfolio delinquency and loss experience and securitization 
      performance. Fitch deems AHFC capable to adequately service the 2013-2 
      transaction.
    

      Legal Structure Integrity: The legal structure of the transaction should 
      provide that a bankruptcy of AHFC would not impair the timeliness of 
      payments on the securities.
    

      The presale report is available to all investors on Fitch's website at 'www.fitchratings.com'.

Substitute information provided in accordance with General
Instruction J to Form 10-K:
 
Item 1112(b) of Regulation AB.    Significant Obligors of Pool
Assets (Financial Information).
 
No single obligor represents more than 10% of the pool assets
held by Honda Auto Receivables 2013-3 Owner Trust (the “Trust”).
 
Item 1114(b)(2) of Regulation AB.    Credit Enhancement and
Other Support, Except for Certain Derivatives Instruments (Information Regarding Significant Enhancement Providers).
 
No entity or group of affiliated entities provides any external
credit enhancement or other support with respect to either payment on the pool assets held by the Trust or payments on the notes
(the “Notes”) or certificates (the “Certificates”) issued by the Trust.
 
Item 1115(b) of Regulation AB.    Certain Derivatives Instruments
(Financial Information).
 
No entity or group of affiliated entities provides any derivative
instruments that are used to alter the payment characteristics of the cashflows from the Trust.
 
Item 1117 of Regulation AB.    Legal Proceedings.
 
No legal proceedings are pending, and no proceedings are known
to be contemplated by governmental authorities, against any of the following companies: American Honda Finance Corporation (the
“Sponsor”), American Honda Receivables LLC (the “Depositor”), U.S. Bank Trust National Association (the
“Owner Trustee”) or the Trust that are or would be material to holders of the Notes or the Certificates.
 
Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas (the “Indenture Trustee”)
has provided the information contained in the following paragraphs for purposes of compliance with Regulation AB.
 
“On June 18, 2014, a group of investors, including funds
managed by Blackrock Advisors, LLC, PIMCO-Advisors, L.P., and others, filed a derivative action against Deutsche Bank Trust Company
Americas (“DBTCA”) and Deutsche Bank National Trust Company (“DBNTC”) in New York State Supreme Court purportedly
on behalf of and for the benefit of 544 private-label residential mortgage-backed securities (“RMBS”) trusts asserting
claims for alleged violations of the U.S. Trust Indenture Act of 1939, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and negligence
based on DBNTC and DBTCA's alleged failure to perform their duties as trustees for the trusts. Plaintiffs subsequently dismissed
their state court complaint and filed a derivative and class action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District
of New York (the “SDNY Action”) on behalf of and for the benefit of 564 private-label RMBS trusts, which substantially
overlapped with the trusts at issue in the state court action. The complaint alleges that the trusts at issue have suffered total
realized collateral losses of U.S. $89.4 billion, but the complaint does not include a demand for money damages in a sum certain.
DBNTC and DBTCA filed a motion to dismiss, and on January 19, 2016, the court partially granted the motion on procedural grounds:
as to the 500 trusts that are governed by pooling and servicing agreements, the court declined to exercise jurisdiction. The court
did
 

 - 2 - 
 
 
not rule on substantive defenses asserted in the motion to dismiss
as to the 64 trusts formed under indentures for which it retained jurisdiction. Instead, the court ordered plaintiffs to file an
amended complaint as to those indenture trusts. On February 23, 2016, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint as to 62 of the 64
indenture trusts included in the original U.S. District Court complaint. DBNTC and DBTCA will have an opportunity to file new defensive
motions with respect to this amended complaint.
 
On March 25, 2016, plaintiffs filed a new state court complaint
in California against DBTCA as to 513 trusts governed by pooling and servicing agreements, most of which had been dismissed from
the U.S. District Court action. (Plaintiffs removed 19 of the original 500 and have added 32 new trusts.) DBTCA serves as trustee
on only one of these 513 trusts.
 
On December 30, 2015, IKB International, S.A. and IKB Deutsche
Industriebank A.G. filed a Summons With Notice in New York state court naming as defendants DBNTC and DBTCA, as trustees of 37
RMBS trusts (the "IKB Action"). The claims in the IKB Action appear to be substantively similar to the SDNY Action. The
IKB Action is not styled as a putative class action, but may attempt to bring derivative claims on behalf of the named RMBS Trusts.
DBTCA intends to vigorously defend the IKB Action.
 
DBTCA has no pending legal proceedings (including, based on
DBTCA's present evaluation, the litigation disclosed in the foregoing paragraphs) that would materially affect its ability to perform
its duties as indenture trustee for this transaction.”
 
PART II
 
The following items have been omitted in accordance with
General Instruction J to Form 10-K:
 

(a)Item 5, Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities

(d)Item 13, Certain Relationships and Related Transactions

(e)Item 14, Principal Accountant Fees and Services
 
Substitute information provided in accordance with General
Instruction J to Form 10-K:
 
Item 1119 of Regulation AB.     Affiliations and Certain
Relationships and Related Transactions.
 
The Sponsor is the originator, as contemplated by Item 1110
of Regulation AB, of all of the pool assets owned by the Trust. The Sponsor is also the primary servicer. The Depositor is a wholly-owned
subsidiary
 

 - 3 - 
 
 
of the Sponsor and, therefore, a wholly-owned subsidiary of
the originator and the primary servicer. Through its purchase of the Certificates, the Depositor has acquired a 100% ownership
interest in the Trust; therefore, the Trust is an affiliated party of the Depositor and, indirectly, of the Sponsor (including
in its role as originator and primary servicer).
 
The Indenture Trustee is not affiliated with the Sponsor (including
in its role as originator and primary servicer), the Depositor, the Owner Trustee or the Trust. The Owner Trustee is not affiliated
with the Sponsor (including in its role as originator and primary servicer), the Depositor, the Indenture Trustee or the Trust.
 
There are no significant obligors, external enhancement or support
providers, or other material parties related to the Notes or Certificates.
 
In addition, there are no business relationships, agreements,
arrangements, transactions or understandings outside the ordinary course of business or on terms other than would be obtained in
an arm’s length transaction with an unrelated party, apart from the transaction involving the issuance of the Notes and Certificates
by the Trust, among the Sponsor, the Depositor or the Trust and any of the parties mentioned in this Item.
 
Item 1122 of Regulation AB.     Compliance with Applicable
Servicing Criteria.
 
The Sponsor (in its role as servicer) and the Indenture Trustee
(together, the “Servicing Parties”) have each been identified by the registrant as a party participating in the servicing
function with respect to the asset pool held by the Trust. Each of the Servicing Parties has completed a report on an assessment
of compliance with the servicing criteria applicable to it (each, a “Servicing Report”), which Servicing Reports are
attached as exhibits to this Form 10-K. In addition, each of the Servicing Parties has provided an attestation report (each, an
“Attestation Report”) by one or more registered public accounting firms, which Attestation Reports are also attached
as exhibits to this Form 10-K. Neither of the Servicing Reports prepared by the Sponsor or the Indenture Trustee, or the Attestation
Reports provided by the Sponsor or the Indenture Trustee, has identified any material instance of noncompliance with the servicing
criteria applicable to the respective Servicing Party.
 
Item 1123 of Regulation AB.      Servicer Compliance
Statement.
 
The Sponsor (in its role as servicer) has been identified by
the registrant as a servicer with respect to the asset pool held by the Trust. The Sponsor has completed a statement of compliance
with applicable servicing criteria (a “Compliance Statement”), signed by an authorized officer of the Sponsor. The
Compliance Statement is attached as an exhibit to this Form 10-K.
 
PART IV
 

Item 15.Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules.

 

(a)(1)Not applicable.

 

(a)(2)Not applicable.
 

(a)(3)The exhibits filed in response to Item 601 of Regulation S-K are listed in Item 15(b) below.

                6The rating history for this credit rating accurately reflects the current status of the (sf) indicator but, due to technical limitations, does not accurately reflect the (sf) indicator history. Please visit the Research tab to view the press release(s) announcing when the (sf) indicator was added or removed.


For credit ratings that are derived exclusively from an existing credit rating of a program, series, category/class of debt, support provider or primary rated entity, or that replace a previously assigned provisional rating at the same rating level, Moody’s publishes a rating announcement on that series, category/class of debt or program as a whole, on the support provider or primary rated entity, or on the provisional rating, but often does not publish a specific rating announcement on each subsequent bond or note for which the credit rating is derived from the existing credit rating. Rating announcements are usually press releases classified as Rating Actions on www.moodys.com. Please refer to the Research tab on the issuer/entity page for the rating announcement.
