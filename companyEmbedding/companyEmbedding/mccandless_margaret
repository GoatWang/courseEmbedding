For schools, museums, seniors, & libraries, I plan a program to fit your needs. Call to discuss my unusual musical instruments, true tales, & audience participation.


After 14 years collaborating on scenic design at Bancroft School's theater in Worcester, MA, we recently won the TAMY award. Call to plan a design meeting for the visual effects you need.


When you need Drama classes, improvisation workshops, or a director, call me. We can plan the sequence and content that fit with 
your students, residents, or audience.

Where else could children see and hear a hurdy-gurdy, rebec, chalumeau, fanfare trumpet, and more? Lady Margaret's middle ages program is a visual and musical treat.

Becky Ellis, Music teacher, The Wheeler School, Providence, RI













There is a story to tell for every situation, every relationship, and all of the hopes with which we live. I like to make those stories lively and vivid.

Visitors to Tully Lake Campground are in a marvelous landscape. My murals invite them to see more wonderful  TTOR sites nearby. It's engagement by inspiration.
