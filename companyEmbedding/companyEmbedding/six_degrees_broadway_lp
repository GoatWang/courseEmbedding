Theater Review: ‘Six Degrees of Separation’ 
What we are willing to believe and why 

By Judd Hollander  |

Last Updated: June 1, 2017 5:51 pm






















































Ouisa (Allison Janney) finds a would-be son in the stranger Paul (Corey Hawkins) who comes into her life, in "Six Degrees of Separation." (Joan Marcus) 
NEW YORK—There’s a fine line between believing the truth of a situation and wanting to believe it.  The powerful Broadway revival of John Guare’s 1990 drama “Six Degrees of Separation,” based on a true story, examines that fine line.
One night, in their comfortable New York apartment, husband and wife Flan (John Benjamin Hickey) and Ouisa (Allison Janney) and their friend Geoffrey (Michael Siberry) are interrupted by the sudden arrival of Paul (Corey Hawkins), a young man who has been attacked and stabbed. Brought in by their doorman (Tony Carlin), Paul claims to be a classmate of Flan and Ouisa’s children and, since he knew they lived nearby, this was the first place he thought to go.
Any serious attempt to judge the different characters is left up to the audience.
Paul knows many details about their family—down to the Kandinsky painting hanging in their home. Flan and Ouisa take him in, treat his wounds, and offer him a place to stay. However, as is soon discovered, just about everything Paul says is a lie, including his claim to be the son of the famous actor Sidney Poitier, who is working on the movie version of the Broadway musical “Cats.”
As the play unfolds, it becomes apparent that Paul doesn’t pull his scams with financial gain in mind—though he does begrudgingly take $50 when offered. Rather, he demonstrates an almost pathological need to be one of the “beautiful people” and enjoy the advantages he feels he would never experience otherwise.
Coupled with this need is Paul’s desire to see just how much he can actually get away with. It’s a weakness that ultimately backfires on him.
(L–R) Paul (Corey Hawkins) cons his way into the lives of the affluent couple Flan (John Benjamin Hickey) and Ouisa (Allison Janney) while their friend Geoffrey (Michael Siberry) looks on, in “Six Degrees of Separation.” (Joan Marcus)
The entire play turns on the question of what people want to believe. Why would Flan, Ouisa, and their friends, who were also the victims of Paul’s lies, willingly accept this man into their homes without first checking with their children to see if his story is true? Paul claims to know all of them, after all. 
The children’s eventual comments on the subject reveal more than a bit of contempt for their elders—not only in how their parents were so easily duped, but also in how they feel treated by them in general. Yet one has to ask if the kids would have been the wiser if Paul had targeted them. 
An interesting irony is that the adults have an easier time relating to Paul than they do to their own children, which points back to the undercurrent that Paul’s stories are ones these adults want to believe.
As time goes on, though, and one sees Paul creating one story after another, the entire effect takes on a much more ominous meaning. This comes into play when Paul spins his tales for a young couple (Peter Mark Kendall and Sarah Mezzanotte) who can’t afford to lose what he takes from them.
Lisa Emery, Michael Countryman, Allison Janney, Ned Eisenberg, and John Benjamin Hickey in a scene from “Six Degrees of Separation.” (Joan Marcus)
More significantly, any serious attempt at judging the different characters is left up to the audience, rather than those on stage. We, just like the parents, are left to believe the best or the worst of people. This especially applies to Paul, who goes from affable to desperate as the play progresses.
Also coming into play in Paul’s schemes is the almost unspoken question of race as it applies to those in Flan and Ouisa’s circle. Would they have so easily welcomed an unknown black man into their homes if he were not in a suit and tie and continually dropping the names of their kids, and of his supposed lineage?
Janney is excellent as Ouisa, a woman determined to ensure this entire episode does not simply become an after-dinner anecdote. She demonstrates a deep passion to understand this man who comes from a world so different from her own.
Hawkins plays the role of Paul perfectly—a highly intelligent and driven, yet self-destructive young man who always sounds perfectly believable in whatever he says, even when it’s apparent to the audience what the truth really is.
Hickey does well as Flan, a man who just wants things to go back to the way they were.

Mark Wendland’s set is nicely done, with just the right mix of the tasteful and the ostentatious. Direction by Trip Cullman is strong; he ably blends both humor and tension, while never letting the characters seem anything less than real.
When all is said and done, “Six Degrees of Separation” will leave you asking if you’ll ever be able to trust others in the same way again. Even more importantly, should you?
Also in the cast are James Cusati-Moyer, Lisa Emery, Michael Countryman, Paul O’Brien, Colby Minifie, Keenan Jolliff, Ned Riseley, Ned Eisenberg, Cody Kostro, Jim Bracchitta, and Chris Perfetti. ‘Six Degrees of Separation’ Ethel Barrymore Theatre 243 W. 47th St. Tickets: 212-239-6200 or Telecharge.com Running Time: 1 hour, 30 minutes (no intermission) Closes: July 16

The revival of “Six Degrees of Separation” on Broadway, which won neither of the Tony Awards it was nominated for and has struggled to gain traction at the box office, will close a month earlier than planned.Like “The Glass Menagerie,” which also closed prematurely despite luxury casting (Sally Field) and a script by a respected playwright (Tennessee Williams), “Six Degrees” was greeted with shrugs by critics and failed to catch on in a crowded Broadway market. It will close on June 18, instead of July 16.The play, by John Guare, will have been open for 21 previews and 63 regular performances. It had been planned for a 15-week limited run. The original 1990 Broadway production, which was a Tony nominee and a Pulitzer Prize finalist, ran for 485 performances.

Directed by Trip Cullman, who also directed the short-lived Broadway run of “Significant Other” this past season, the revival starred Allison Janney, John Benjamin Hickey and the “Straight Outta Compton” star Corey Hawkins. Ben Brantley, in his New York Times review, admired the play but was ambivalent about this staging.

The production earned two Tony nominations: for best revival (it lost to “Jitney”) and for best leading actor (Mr. Hawkins lost to Kevin Kline).In the week ending June 11, the days leading to the Tonys, “Six Degrees” brought in $271,320 — up from $259,703 the previous week, but still just 29.1 percent of its gross potential.

Broadway is a difficult market for many plays. Even Lynn Nottage’s “Sweat” and Paula Vogel’s “Indecent,” both Tony nominees by Pulitzer Prize-winning playwrights, earned a respective 46.4 percent and 30 percent of their gross potential that week.

TheaterSix Degrees of Separation: EW stage review

Joan Marcus


We gave it an A-

If there’s one thing to be learned from the beautifully unsettling Broadway revival of Six Degrees of Separation it’s this: There’s no expiration date on a Cats joke. Nearly 30 years after John Guare’s drama premiered, the most absurd (and absurdly funny) thread isn’t that a clutch of wealthy Manhattanites were hoodwinked by a sweet-talking stranger claiming to be Sidney Poitier’s son; it’s that he promised them all parts in the movie version of Cats — and they were thrilled.
“You went to Cats. You said it was an all-time low in a lifetime of theater-going,” spits Tess (Colby Minifie) accusingly to her parents, Louisa, aka Ouisa (seven-time Emmy winner Allison Janney, absolutely sublime) and Flanders, aka Flan (The Normal Heart Tony winner John Benjamin Hickey). “Film is a different medium,” Ouisa sighs.
As for the rest of Guare’s delicious social satire, it’s aged nearly as well as the Cats quips — far better than you’d expect, considering that the title phrase is now firmly entrenched in our vernacular. “I am bound to everyone on this planet by a trail of six people,” says Ouisa. “It’s a profound thought.” (Side note: Does anyone still play the resultant pop-culture parlor game “Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon”?)

The way that Ouisa and Flan — and their friends — get fooled by Paul (Straight Outta Compton’s Corey Hawkins, appropriately mysterious), the faux Poitier, provides plenty of comic fodder: a face-off with a hyperactive naked hustler; the appearance of assorted sullen, rancorous college-age children (sample insult: “Dad, sometimes it is so obvious to me why Mom left”); the suspicious delivery of a pot of jam.
But there’s plenty of profundity as well. In the span of 90 minutes, Ouisa goes from talking about touring South Africa to see super-poor people to promising Paul that she’ll take him under her wing, teach him, and love him. She’s no longer content with her high-stakes art-dealer husband. On the outside, she is polished and buffed and shined to perfection — not a hair out of place in that shellacked East Side matron bob; but inside, she’s “a collage of unaccounted-for brush strokes.” In an argument with Flan, she asks him this question — one that I suspect Guare wants us all to ask ourselves: “How much of your life can you account for?” Three days later, I still don’t have my answer.

Allison Janney, a seven-time Emmy Award winner now starring in the CBS sitcom “Mom,” is returning to Broadway to lead a revival of “Six Degrees of Separation” next spring.Ms. Janney will play Ouisa Kittredge, a role made famous by Stockard Channing in a stage production in 1990 and on film in 1993. The play, by John Guare, is about a young impostor who lies his way into the home, and the lives, of a wealthy Upper East Side family.“I saw Stockard do it onstage, and was amazed that there hadn’t been a revival since then — it’s a really great play, and I jumped right on board,” Ms. Janney said in a telephone interview. “I’m actually a little nervous about it, because I’ve been away from the theater for a bit, but it’s what I love, and I feel like it is what I was meant to do.”Ms. Janney said she found herself drawn to the conceit expressed in the play’s title, as well as the details of the story.“I love the idea of six degrees of separation — that we’re all connected somehow, universally — and there are some really human things that drive this play, with the con artist, and the art,” she said. “It’s a lovely multilayered play that’s complex, and I can’t wait to discover the character.”The play was originally produced by Lincoln Center Theater, first Off Broadway and then on Broadway, where it ran for nearly 500 performances and won a Tony Award for best direction, by Jerry Zaks.

The revival, scheduled to open at the Barrymore Theater in April, will also star John Benjamin Hickey, a 2011 Tony Award winner for “The Normal Heart,” as Flan Kittredge. It is being produced by Stuart Thompson and Tim Levy, and directed by Trip Cullman, who is also directing “Significant Other” this season. The revival is scheduled to run for 15 weeks; the rest of the cast has not been announced.The play will be Ms. Janney’s fourth Broadway show. She performed in a 1996 revival of “Present Laughter,” a 1997 revival of “A View from the Bridge” and the 2009 musical “9 to 5.” She was nominated for Tony Awards for her work in “A View from the Bridge” and “9 to 5.”“Six Degrees of Separation” joins a Broadway season rich with play revivals. “The Cherry Orchard,” “The Front Page” and “Les Liaisons Dangereuses” have already begun performances, and still to come are “Burn This,” “The Glass Menagerie,” “The Price,” “Present Laughter” and “The Little Foxes.”There are also productions of “Jitney,” an August Wilson play never previously staged on Broadway, and “The Present,” newly adapted from a Chekhov play best known as “Platonov,” that could be considered either revivals or new plays by the Tony Awards administration committee.
