That still left the pan-Asian hedge fund down 5 percent since its April launch, but 10 percent above its benchmark, the MSCI Emerging Markets index, Lloyd George said. Markets across Asia have been roiled this year by growing concerns around China's growth outlook and the impact of rising interest rates in the United States, with China's CSI300 index  still 30 percent off its June high. The fund has assets of around $50 million currently. Lloyd George told Reuters on Tuesday that he expected the fund, which he runs out of Hong Kong, to grow to $250-$300 million by the end of the first quarter, buoyed initially by high-net-worth and family office cash, before being capped at around $1 billion. Marianne Scordel, founder of Bougeville Consulting, which is helping introduce Lloyd George to potential clients in Europe, said some investors were now thinking about re-entering the market after the heavy market falls earlier in the year. "A lot of investors wouldn't come out of an existing manager to invest in a new Asian manager, but some are considering it now (given) they've already come out." A fixture in Asian markets for more than 30 years, Lloyd George ran as much as $17 billion in his first company, Lloyd George Management, before selling out to Bank of Montreal  in 2014 and then setting up his current firm, Lloyd George Advisory. Lloyd George, the great grandson of former British Prime Minister David Lloyd George, said he was avoiding capital-heavy industries including property, energy and mining, and was focused instead on around 30 solid "core bets" in the consumer, Internet, technology and basic service industries, among others. The fund, which does not use leverage or bet on falling share prices but does charge a performance fee, had 30 percent invested in Hong Kong firms, 20 percent in mainland China, 15 percent in India and 15 percent in Japan, as well as smaller investments in Singapore, Thailand and Taiwan, he said. With more than 400 company visits so far this year, Lloyd George said his favoured investments included China Lodging , a Nasdaq-listed play on China's domestic tourism industry, and wealth management firm Noah, which already has $10 billion in assets and is growing fast. Lloyd George said he was looking to set up a second, Indian Ocean strategy, which would focus on Indian mid-caps, as well as those in Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and surrounding countries. "With the oil price coming down... the biggest beneficiary in the world is the sub-continent," he said, citing its young consumer population and 20-year lag to China in terms of developing infrastructure and an export sector.

While other publications tend to brush the surface of this industry, HFM’s strength is its ability to really cover a huge array of issues. The level of technical detail it provides serves a vital information need. We often pick up valuable insight in HFM before being told by our primes and external counsel.

Wow thank you all so much for your pledges I have reached my target in 48 hours and I look forward to making your pledges, I feel overwhelmed at the support from everyone from family, friends to total strangers I am so grateful to you all.My campaign still has until the end of the month so please do keep pledging as any extra funding will go towards portable handheld printer £75, fold down table for Fairs £60, a second Badge Machine which makes larger badges £175I look forward to purchasing and showing you what you have invested in and completing your pledges.Welcome and thank you for reading my crowd funding page, I am a 21 year old Student called George I am studying my Masters Degree in Computer Science at Beckett University Leeds,I am the youngest in a set of triplets! I am having the first of a series of major operations on my feet this summer and I desperately want to work and start up a business which I can run from home and online I am currently making badges by hand. I want to be able to be more efficient by buying a machine it will make it faster and cheaper and I will be able to do this whilst recuperating.I love design and making things as well as designing web sites and Apps for people. I want an opportunity to purchase equipment for a badge making machine,  key ring puncher, plus all the keyrings, badges and fridge magnets. I intend to sell to local businesses, online sales, build a web site (I can do this myself at no cost) and at a later date attend school fairs to offer make your own badge/magnet/key ring stall to children where they draw their own designs on the inserts (with their parents supervision) and I will make them instantly to take away on the day. Obviously if I do this I need to include public liability insurance in my funding. I have already purchased a number of key rings to test the water and these are proving extremely popular selling more than anticipated.I need the funding to kick start my business by bulk buying supplies and equipment I really hope you will support my venture.

I have selected a number of rewards for anyone who pledges money I hope that you will enjoy them should you wish to support meI am honest, trustworthy and reliable I may only be 21 years old but I am a Charity Trustee for Yorkshire Multiples Group a registered Charity No 1090898 who provide Advice, Information & Support to Multiple Birth Families. I have actively helped for several years helping raise funds and helping out at events.



Risks and challenges
The main challenge I face is keeping up with the production of orders should I be inundated I have the support of my siblings and family who will help out. My triplet sister is an artist and triplet brother doing a Business Degree and my parents are both in business so I have experience on hand should I need advice.
I have already invested time and some of my own money buying products to test the market so far it has been a little overwhelming with great response but the limitations have been money to proceed in turning it from a hobby into business, 
The funding will enable bulk purchases so that will bring down the cost so I am able to provide a competitive price for my products. Plus with my computer skills I will be able build a web site with an online shop to enable greater sales.
I also need to use some of the funds for public liability, stall fees (when I am able to attend when physically fit).
I would very much like to attend our charity group and offer a session at reduced fees so that the families with more than one child of the same age can take part in a parent/child led activity. Often multiple birth families are alienated due to costs of two or three times due to having twins, triplets or more of the same age so therefore miss out on craft activities.
