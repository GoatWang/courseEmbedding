US$6 billion the largest-ever pan-Asian private equity fund

	July 9, 2013 - Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. L.P. (together with its affiliates, “KKR”) today announced the closing of its Asian II Fund at US$6 billion, making it the largest-ever pan-Asian private equity fund.

	The Asian II Fund marks the firm’s third successful fund raising in the region, following its US$4 billion regional fund in 2007 and its US$1 billion China Growth Fund in 2010.

	Having first established its presence in Asia Pacific in 2005, KKR has invested over US$5.5 billion in private equity investments in 30 companies across the region. In Asia, KKR has more than 100 executives and senior advisors in seven offices, located in Beijing, Hong Kong, Mumbai, Seoul, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo.

	Joseph Bae, Member & Managing Partner of KKR Asia said, “The successful close of our second Asian fund is a testament to our strong track record in the region.  We look forward to continuing to generate positive results for all our stakeholders. Having invested more than US$5.5 billion in Asia since 2005, we have demonstrated to investors our commitment to the region, as well as the effectiveness of our successful global-local and partnership approach.”

	KKR’s partnership approach enables Asian companies to tap into KKR’s global best practices to expand their businesses and improve operations to grow in their own markets and expand internationally.

	For its Asian II Fund, KKR sees opportunities in Asia arising from an increase in domestic consumption, and KKR focuses on local industries that can take advantage of this trend such as consumer, retail, healthcare, education and certain industrials. KKR also sees opportunities in: the rapid development of the financial services industry; the increasing demand for better and improved infrastructure; availability from non-core carve-outs and corporate divestitures as well as divestments from state-owned enterprises; the increasing global demand for specialized technology & precision manufacturing, which is present in selected Asian markets; and, increasing growth and generational-change opportunities with entrepreneurs.

	KKR’s private equity portfolio is diversified by country, industry and sector, and it includes both traditional control transactions as well as growth equity stakes in companies. KKR focuses on long-term business fundamentals, looking for companies that are market leaders in their sectors and that would benefit from partnering with KKR for greater growth.

	KKR’s Asian portfolio companies employ nearly 100,000 people, and, when combined with its global portfolio companies, KKR’s overall portfolio companies employ in Asia more than 150,000 people. In Asia, every company in which KKR has invested for more than two years has experienced employment growth. KKR is a long term investor, holding its private equity investments an average of five to seven years.

                            		By Herald Chen Jun 10, 2016		  	
                            	
Last week, Ping Identity – the leader in Identity Defined Security – announced an agreement to successfully sell the business. KKR’s TMT (Technology, Media, Telecommunications) team led Ping’s last growth equity investment round as part of the company’s product platform expansion and focus on the global corporate enterprise market.  Since our investment, Ping’s annual recurring revenue grew by more than 40 percent in 2015, and today over 1,500 enterprises, including over half of the Fortune 100, have adopted the Ping Identity platform. We were pleased to have a strong partnership with the Ping management team, in particular Andre Durand, CEO and Founder, and Ping’s strong existing investors, including General Catalyst, W Capital, DFJ, Triangle Peak and Ten Eleven Ventures.
Consistent with our growth equity investing strategy, KKR was able to source an attractive risk-return investment and prove our ability to add value post-investment through the investment in Ping.  We were able to assist Ping management with not only our capital, but importantly with strategic and tactical assistance to accelerate Ping’s growth and prospects to become a long-standing enterprise in the security infrastructure marketplace.  
KKR’s investment in Ping centered on two primary premises. First, we believed behind Andre Durand, the company was well positioned to foster and benefit from the burgeoning Identity Defined Security market –an increasingly important market. Second, KKR had the tools to help scale Ping Identity into a large, profitable enterprise. KKR assets include a strong network for recruiting senior talent, 21 KKR offices around the world, a deep bench of senior advisors – former and current CEOs – as well as over 100 portfolio companies representing over $5 billion in annual IT spend. 
KKR is invested in over a dozen other growth stage companies, where we are working hard to create new longstanding enterprises like Ping’s.  For KKR, growth equity means focusing on market-leading, high-growth companies for which we can be a unique partner in helping a company reach scale and the next level of growth -- beyond just providing capital. 

The specific portfolio company identified is not representative of all of the securities purchased, sold or recommended for advisory clients, and it should not be assumed that the investment in the company identified was or will be profitable. Senior Advisors, Industry Advisors, and KKR Advisors are engaged as consultants and are not employees of KKR.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/29/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

Content drawn from FICS affiliated entities is marked and labeled as such. FICS selected and published content is not intended to provide tax, legal, insurance or investment advice and should not be construed as an offer to sell, a solicitation of an offer to buy, or a recommendation for any security by any Fidelity Entity or any third party. Certain tools published by FICS may provide general information and guidance based upon your personalized input. Securities quotes are delayed unless otherwise noted. FICS is owned by FMR LLC and is an affiliate of Fidelity Brokerage Services LLC, among others.

These services provide discretionary money management for a fee.
 
 Mutual funds 
You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. Although the fund seeks to preserve the value of your investment at $1.00 per share, it cannot guarantee it will do so. An investment in the fund is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Fidelity Investments and its affiliates, the fund’s sponsor, have no legal obligation to provide financial support to money market funds and you should not expect that the sponsor will provide financial support to the fund at any time.
Before investing, consider the funds' investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.
 
 Life insurance and variable annuities 

Before investing, consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the fund or annuity and its investment options. Contact Fidelity for a prospectus or, if available, a summary prospectus containing this information. Read it carefully.

 Workplace savings plans 
Some of the funds and services described on the Fidelity Sites may not be available or appropriate in a workplace savings plan. Check with your employer for information on any investment restrictions associated with your 401(k), 401(a), 403(b), or 457 savings plan, or nonqualified deferred compensation plan at work. Or, if your workplace savings plan is already with Fidelity, call your toll-free retirement benefits line or log on to Fidelity NetBenefits® to find out more about the investment options available to you in your workplace savings plan.
If you hold Fidelity Advisor Fund assets outside of your employer-sponsored retirement plan, accounts with such assets are not included in the list of Fidelity accounts.
Company Stock Funds are not mutual funds and are unmanaged, non-diversified investment options. The value of your investment in the Company Stock Fund is affected by the performance of the company and the overall stock market, as well as the amount and performance of any short term investments held by the fund.
Managed Income Funds, Commingled Pools and individually managed options, such as Strategies, are not mutual funds. Although individual investment contracts purchased for a managed income fund are backed by the issuer of the debt, units of the fund are not guaranteed by the manager, Plan sponsor or insured by the FDIC.
A summary of the benefits provided under a workplace savings plan is contained in the Summary Plan Description for the plan. Full details are provided in the official plan document, which governs the operation of the plan. In the event that the content of a Fidelity Site or any oral representations made by any person regarding the plan conflict with or are inconsistent with the provisions of the governing plan document, the provisions of the governing plan documents are controlling. The information presented on a Fidelity Site is not intended to create, nor is it to be construed to create, a contract between (1) an employer or a Fidelity Entity and (2) any one of the employer’s employees or other plan participants. Each employer reserves the right to amend, modify, suspend, replace or terminate any of its plans, policies or programs, in whole or in part, including any level or form of coverage, by appropriate company action, without the consent or concurrence of persons affected.

Units of the College Savings Plan Portfolios are municipal securities and may be subject to market volatility and fluctuation.
Please carefully consider the Plan's investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses before investing. For this and other information on any 529 College Savings Plan managed by Fidelity, contact Fidelity for a free Fact Kit, or view online. Read it carefully before you invest or send money.
 
 Information for foreign investors 
The Fidelity Sites are intended to be made available only to individuals in the United States, and the information on the Fidelity Sites is only for such persons.

About Environmental, Social & Governance Summary (ESG)



GMI ESG Ratings


GMI AGR® Score & Rating






GMI ESG Ratings
Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Flags:  GMI Ratings publishes Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) ratings on over 6,000 companies worldwide. These ratings provide an independent assessment of the sustainable investment value of public companies.  The ESG Ratings model is based on a carefully crafted and applied list of KeyMetrics® that result in an overall ESG concern level as expressed by Red (High Concern), Yellow (Average Concern), and Green (Low Concern) flags.  Unlike traditional ESG risk models, GMI's rating methodology is designed to identify risks most likely to affect equity valuations. Specifically, these ratings reflect actual corporate behaviors rather than policies or affirmations of intent to adhere to best ESG practices. Further, unlike other models with evenly weighted metrics, we assign context-sensitive relative weightings to our key metrics, based on market, regional, ownership or sector differences.  Individual company scores are then assigned as a percentile rank, ranging from 1 (worst ranked) to 100 (best) on the basis of these KeyMetrics® and then converted to the Red, Yellow or Green flag designation.
Company Reports:  In addition to a company's overall risk rating, ESG reports also include an industry rating based on a comparison between the company's risk levels in each ESG component area relative to its industry peers.  Further, the ESG analysis serves as a summary of behavioral events that contributed to the company's overall risk level.

 More About GMI



GMI Accounting and Governance Risk (AGR) Score & Rating
The GMI Accounting and Governance Risk (AGR) Score & Rating is widely recognized as an indicator of the confidence level surrounding a company's management and reported financials.
Scores range from 0 to 100, and correspond to a risk classification for each company ranging from "Very Aggressive" to "Conservative." The AGR Score is a percentile ranking among the approximately 8,000 companies rated by GMI. Through continued back-testing, GMI has demonstrated a strong correlation between its quarterly AGR Score and the likelihood of adverse events, including securities class action litigation, financial restatements, regulatory enforcement actions, and stock price declines.
				Thus, a company's AGR Score can help investors looking to manage risk or enhance investment performance. GMI forensically analyzes the financial reporting and governance practices of over 8,000 North American-based publicly traded companies.
About GMI
GMI is an independent risk research firm which provides a statistically modeled assessment of corporate integrity. Founded in 2002 in direct response to the growing number of scandals, lawsuits and investor losses resulting from fraudulent corporate behavior, the firm identifies potential high-risk company accounting and governance activity, which in turn has been historically correlated to stock price declines, securities class-action litigation, and material financial restatements. The product of GMI's analysis is a unique risk measure - the AGR Score which can be used by investors as a way to more effectively manage corporate risk.

Fidelity is not recommending or endorsing this security by making it available to customers.  You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.
