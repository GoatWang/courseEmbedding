Letter from the Fund's President











Dear Shareholder,

The past two-plus years have been a very challenging
time for the global stock markets. Slowing economic
growth and weaker corporate earnings have
produced a difficult investment environment around
the world. As 2002 progresses, however, the picture
is becoming brighter as global economic growth
appears to be picking up steam. This has proven
beneficial for investors in funds that invest in
international equities, as the asset class has enjoyed a
modest comeback since September 11.

As the rebound in the global economy unfolds, we urge investors to
remain patient since the process of recovery is likely to be slow and
uneven in many parts of the world. Against this backdrop, it is
reasonable to expect that stock prices will remain highly sensitive to
short-term news developments, making days where the markets rise or
fall 2-3 percent fairly commonplace. It is at these times - when stock
prices are gyrating wildly and the market outlook is changing by the day
- that it becomes more important than ever to keep your long-term
goals in mind and to remain focused on stocks' long-term potential
rather than their daily fluctuations.

Sincerely,

William F. Glavin, Jr.
President
Scudder Global Discovery Fund

+ The Salomon Smith Barney World Equity Extended Market Index is an unmanaged
small-capitalization stock universe of 22 countries. Index returns assume reinvestment of dividends
and, unlike Fund returns, do not reflect any fees or expenses. It is not possible to invest directly
into an index.
All performance is historical, assumes reinvestment of all dividends and capital gains, and is not
indicative of future results. Investment return and principal value will fluctuate, so an investor's shares,
when redeemed, may be worth more or less than when purchased. Performance figures do not reflect
the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on fund distributions or the redemption of fund
shares.

Investments in funds involve risk. Some funds have more risk than others. These include funds that
allow exposure to or otherwise concentrate investments in certain sectors, geographic regions, security
types, market capitalization or foreign securities (e.g., political or economic instability, which can be
accentuated in emerging market countries). Please read this fund's prospectus for specific details
regarding its investments and risk profile.

Portfolio Management Review











In the following interview, Lead Portfolio Manager Gerry Moran discusses Scudder
Global Discovery Fund's strategy and the market environment during the six-month
period ended April 30, 2002.

Q:  Please provide a brief overview of global equity
markets for the semiannual period ending April 30, 2002.

A:  Global markets rebounded in October and November
following their sharp declines in the wake of the
September 11 attacks in the United States. December was
more mixed, and 2002 has thus far been greeted with
several critical events:

•  The collapse of Enron in the United States and the
subsequent attention to accounting concerns around the
world

•  A stronger-than-expected pickup in the U.S. economy
sparked by the American consumer but generally not
supported by corporate profits

•  Military activity in Afghanistan

•  Increasing violence in the Middle East and the related
focus on oil prices

In January, many investors in the United States and
Europe took profits after the run-up in late 2001. Since
then, markets have stabilized somewhat in response to
improving economic indicators as well as more optimistic
business and consumer sentiment.

Given this improving scenario fueled so strongly by the
consumer, it's no surprise which industries performed the
best for the period under review. Consumer durables,
apparel companies and other luxury goods manufacturers
all had a nice rebound on prospects for economic growth,
as did automobiles, capital goods, transportation and
materials businesses. Food, beverage and tobacco
companies also did well. On the flip side,
telecommunications led the list of laggards for the
six-month period, followed closely by technology
hardware and equipment. Insurance, media,
pharmaceuticals, and food and drug retailing also
struggled.

Q:  What was the performance of Scudder Global
Discovery Fund against this six-month backdrop?

A:  Against what we believe is a clearly improving
economic environment, the Salomon Smith Barney World
Equity EMI gained 14.77 percent for the semiannual
period ending April 30, 2002, while Scudder Global
Discovery Fund posted 8.36 percent (Class S shares). The
SSB World Equity EMI benchmark is an unmanaged,
capitalization-weighted measure of small-capitalization
stocks in 22 countries around the world.

The fund's growth bias currently gravitates against our
efforts to remain on par with the fund's benchmark. Value
outpaced growth by nearly six percentage points during
the period, a trend that was particularly evident over the
past two months. We had hoped to shield the portfolio
from the economically sensitive areas of the economy by
focusing on health care. However, biotechnology stocks
were very weak during the period under review, and even
those businesses that produce consumables used in
medical and other types of testing were hurt by the sector's
downturn.

There's a clear dichotomy in the health care industry,
though, because while the fund's biotech-related holdings
hurt us, the fund's stake in hospitals, health care
equipment and pharmacy management businesses all
contributed significantly to performance. In fact, nearly
half of the portfolio's top 10 holdings at the end of the
period were in health care. The other half of the top
holdings fall among financials, including Irish Life &
Permanent, Anglo Irish Bank, Legg Mason and Deutsche
Boerse. These all gave a nice boost to the fund's returns for
the semiannual period.

Q:  You've indicated that the value bias of the markets has
held the fund back for a while. When do you foresee these
circumstances changing, and have there been any
adjustments to the portfolio to accommodate the market's
bias?

A:  All the attention to value stocks will eventually drive
up their prices. Then, of course, they cease to be value
stocks by definition (value being akin to a stock "on sale").
Capital spending will need to revive, and unemployment
will need to stabilize in order for us to have a sustainable
economic recovery in which growth stocks could perform
well. There are also other considerations with respect to
catalysts for this fund's performance, though. Most
significantly, the United States may cease to be the engine
for global growth. In this case, we would expect to see
our holdings in Europe and Japan do better than those
in the United States. In the 1990s, the strength of the
U.S. markets worked against the fund because of its
substantial holdings in these markets. I believe the next
10 years could be quite different. What's more, in my
view, a decline in the strength of the dollar will
immediately be translated into a positive for this
portfolio and all global funds. 

It's important to note that during time periods when
markets were more hospitable to growth-biased small
companies, our stock selection stands out. This is
evidenced in the fund's longer-term performance,
which includes more hospitable environments. As of
April 30, 2002, Scudder Global Discovery Fund
(Class S shares) has outperformed its benchmark and the
average of its Lipper peers for the three-, five- and 10-year
periods. (Please see page <Click Here> for details on Lipper
rankings.)1

1 Scudder Global Discovery Fund (Class S shares) ranked 35, 19, 9 and 2 for the 1-year, 3-year,
5-year and 10-year periods ended 4/30/02. There were 80, 49, 32 and 29 funds, respectively, in
Lipper's Global Small-Cap Funds category. Ranking is based on the fund's total return during the
periods cited. Performance includes reinvestment of dividends and capital gains and is no
guarantee of future results. 
  Source: Lipper, Inc. as of 4/30/02.
For now, however, to position the portfolio in the current
environment, we have made some changes to the
weightings in the fund's structure, which is centered on
four building blocks:

•  Stable growth stocks (40 to 60 percent of the portfolio,
57 percent as of April 30, 2002)

•  Stocks with growth-at-reasonable-value prices (10 to
20 percent of the portfolio, 18 percent as of April 30,
2002)

•  Specialized growth stocks2 (10 to 20 percent of the
portfolio, 13 percent as of April 30, 2002)

•  High-growth stocks (10 to 20 percent of the portfolio,
12 percent as of April 30, 2002)

2 An example of a specialized stock could be a pharmaceutical that focuses on one or two very
specific kinds of products, such as prosthetics or a specific family of medications.
We have positioned the portfolio so that the
higher-growth stocks (specialized and high growth) are at
the lower end of their ranges while stable growth and
growth-at-value stocks are slightly more heavily weighted.
In theory, these latter stocks can perform marginally better
in a value-biased environment.

Q:  The fund recently experienced a change in its
investment advisor. How has this change affected the
management of this portfolio?

A:  Since the last annual report, there has been a portfolio
management change that is associated with the change in
investment advisor. Sewall Hodges, who had previously
served as portfolio manager on this fund, is once again
part of the team, replacing Steve Stokes. Two-thirds of
Sewall's career has been devoted to following companies
on a global basis. Sewall joined the firm in 1995 with
10 years of investment research, portfolio management
and corporate finance experience. He holds two bachelor's
degrees from Cornell University and an M.B.A. from the
Wharton School of Business. While there has been no
change to the way the fund is managed, we are pleased to
now have access to a vast global network of analysts. This
includes Ruth Keattch, a specialist in European small caps
located in London. Ruth joined Deutsche Asset
Management in 2001 after 19 years of experience in the
industry. She is a graduate of Oxford University. Paul
Danes is located in Tokyo and contributes analysis of
Japanese small caps. He joined Deutsche Asset
Management in 1993 with several years of industry
experience. Paul holds a graduate degree from Cambridge
University.

The views expressed in this report reflect those of the portfolio managers only through the end of the
period of the report as stated on the cover. The manager's views are subject to change at any time,
based on market and other conditions and should not be construed as a recommendation.

(a)  The cost for federal income tax purposes was $451,209,625.  At April 30, 2002, net unrealized
appreciation for all securities based on tax cost was $49,719,926.  This consisted of aggregate
gross unrealized appreciation for all securities in which there was an excess of value over tax cost
of $112,336,263 and aggregate gross unrealized depreciation for all securities in which there was
an excess of tax cost over value of $62,616,337.
(b)  Security valued at fair value by management and approved in good faith following procedures
approved by the Directors, amounted to $405,479 (.08% of net assets). The value has been
estimated by management in the absence of readily ascertainable market values. However,
because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation, the estimated value may differ significantly from
the value that would have been used had a ready market for the security existed, and the
difference could be material. The cost of the security at April 30, 2002 aggregated $1,477,500.
The security may also have certain restrictions as to resale.

Notes to Financial Statements  (Unaudited) 











A. Significant Accounting Policies

Scudder Global Discovery Fund (the "Fund") is a diversified series of
Global/International Fund, Inc. (the "Corporation") which is registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "1940 Act"), as an open-end
management investment company organized as a Maryland Corporation.

The Fund offers multiple classes of shares which provide investors with different
purchase options. Class A shares are offered to investors subject to an initial sales
charge. Class B shares are offered without an initial sales charge but are subject to
higher ongoing expenses than Class A shares and a contingent deferred sales charge
payable upon certain redemptions. Class B shares automatically convert to Class A
shares six years after issuance. Class C shares are offered without an initial sales charge
but are subject to higher ongoing expenses than Class A shares and a contingent
deferred sales charge payable upon certain redemptions within one year of purchase.
Class C shares do not convert into another class. Shares of Class AARP are designed
for members of AARP. Class S shares of the Fund are generally not available to new
investors. Class AARP and S shares are not subject to initial or contingent deferred
sales charges. Certain detailed information for the Class A, B and C shares is
provided separately and is available upon request.Certain detailed information for the
Class AARP and S shares is provided separately and is available upon request.

Investment income, realized and unrealized gains and losses, and certain fund-level
expenses and expense reductions, if any, are borne pro rata on the basis of relative net
assets by the holders of all classes of shares, except that each class bears certain
expenses unique to that class such as distribution service fees, administrative fees and
certain other class-specific expenses. Differences in class-level expenses may result in
payment of different per share dividends by class. All shares of the Fund have equal
rights with respect to voting subject to class-specific arrangements.

The Fund's financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America which require the use of
management estimates. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The policies
described below are followed consistently by the Fund in the preparation of its
financial statements.

Security Valuation. Investments are stated at value determined as of the close of
regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange on each day the exchange is open
for trading. Equity securities are valued at the most recent sale price reported on the
exchange (U.S. or foreign) or over-the-counter market on which the security is traded
most extensively. Securities for which no sales are reported are valued at the
calculated mean between the most recent bid and asked quotations on the relevant
market or, if a mean cannot be determined, at the most recent bid quotation.

Debt securities are valued by independent pricing services approved by the Directors
of the Fund. If the pricing services are unable to provide valuations, securities are
valued at the most recent bid quotation or evaluated price, as applicable, obtained
from one or more broker-dealers. Such services may use various pricing techniques
which take into account appropriate factors such as yield, quality, coupon rate,
maturity, type of issue, trading characteristics and other data, as well as broker quotes.

Money market instruments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of sixty
days or less, maturing at par, are valued at amortized cost.

Securities and other assets for which market quotations are not readily available or for
which the above valuation procedures are deemed not to reflect fair value are valued
in a manner that is intended to reflect their fair value as determined in accordance
with procedures approved by the Directors.

Repurchase Agreements. The Fund may enter into repurchase agreements with
certain banks and broker/dealers whereby the Fund, through its custodian or
sub-custodian bank, receives delivery of the underlying securities, the amount of
which at the time of purchase and each subsequent business day is required to be
maintained at such a level that the value is equal to at least the principal amount of
the repurchase price plus accrued interest.

Foreign Currency Translations. The books and records of the Fund are maintained
in U.S. dollars. Investment securities and other assets and liabilities denominated in a
foreign currency are translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing exchange rates at
period end. Purchases and sales of investment securities, income and expenses are
translated into U.S. dollars at the prevailing exchange rates on the respective dates of
the transactions.

Net realized and unrealized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions
represent net gains and losses between trade and settlement dates on securities
transactions, the disposition of forward foreign currency exchange contracts and
foreign currencies, and the difference between the amount of net investment income
accrued and the U.S. dollar amount actually received. That portion of both realized
and unrealized gains and losses on investments that results from fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates is not separately disclosed but is included with net
realized and unrealized gains and losses on investment securities.

Federal Income Taxes. The Fund's policy is to comply with the requirements of the
Internal Revenue Code, as amended, which are applicable to regulated investment
companies, and to distribute all of its taxable income to its shareholders. Accordingly,
the Fund paid no federal income taxes and no federal income tax provision was
required.

At October 31, 2001 the Fund had a net tax basis capital loss carryforward of
approximately $56,925,000 which may be applied against any realized net taxable
capital gains of each succeeding year until fully utilized or until October 31, 2009,
the expiration date, whichever occurs first.

Distribution of Income and Gains. Distributions of net investment income, if any,
are made annually. Net realized gains from investment transactions, in excess of
available capital loss carryforwards, would be taxable to the Fund if not distributed,
and, therefore, will be distributed to shareholders at least annually.

The timing and characterization of certain income and capital gains distributions are
determined annually in accordance with federal tax regulations which may differ
from accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These
differences primarily relate to certain securities sold at a loss. As a result, net
investment income (loss) and net realized gain (loss) on investment transactions for a
reporting period may differ significantly from distributions during such period.
Accordingly, the Fund may periodically make reclassifications among certain of its
capital accounts without impacting the net asset value of the Fund.

Other. Investment transactions are accounted for on the trade date. Interest income
is recorded on the accrual basis. Dividend income is recorded on the ex-dividend date
net of foreign withholding taxes. Certain dividends from foreign securities may be
recorded subsequent to the ex-dividend date as soon as the Fund is informed of such
dividends. Realized gains and losses from investment transactions are recorded on an
identified cost basis.

B. Purchases and Sales of Securities

During the six months ended April 30, 2002, purchases and sales of investment
securities (excluding short-term investments) aggregated $132,693,095 and
$170,781,667, respectively.

C. Related Parties

On April 5, 2002, 100% of Zurich Scudder Investments, Inc. ("ZSI") was acquired
by Deutsche Bank AG with the exception of Threadneedle Investments in the U.K.
Upon the closing of this transaction, ZSI became part of Deutsche Asset
Management and changed its name to Deutsche Investment Management Americas
Inc. ("DeIM" or the "Advisor"). Effective April 5, 2002, the investment management
agreements with ZSI were terminated and DeIM became the investment advisor for
the Fund. The Investment Management Agreement (the "Management Agreement")
is the same in all material respects as the corresponding previous Management
Agreement.

Management Agreement. Under the Management Agreement, the Advisor directs
the investments of the Fund in accordance with its investment objectives, policies
and restrictions. The Advisor determines the securities, instruments and other
contracts relating to investments to be purchased, sold or entered into by the Fund.
In addition to portfolio management services, the Advisor provides certain
administrative services in accordance with the Management Agreement. The
management fee payable under the Management Agreement is equal to an annual
rate of 1.10% of the Fund's average daily net assets, computed and accrued daily and
payable monthly.

Administrative Fee. Under the Administrative Agreement (the "Administrative
Agreement"), the Advisor provides or pays others to provide substantially all of the
administrative services required by the Fund (other than those provided by the
Advisor under its Management Agreement with the Fund, as described above) in
exchange for the payment by each class of the Fund of an administrative services fee
(the "Administrative Fee") of 0.375%, 0.375%, 0.40%, 0.45% and 0.425% of the
average daily net assets for Class AARP, S, A, B and C, respectively, computed and
accrued daily and payable monthly.

Various third-party service providers, some of which are affiliated with the Advisor,
provide certain services to the Fund under the Administrative Agreement. Scudder
Fund Accounting Corporation, a subsidiary of the Advisor, computes the net asset
value for the Fund and maintains the accounting records of the Fund. Scudder
Investments Service Company, an affiliate of the Advisor, is the transfer, shareholder
service and dividend-paying agent for Class A, B, and C shares of the Fund. Scudder
Service Corporation, also a subsidiary of the Advisor, is the transfer, shareholder
service and dividend-paying agent for Class AARP and S shares of the Fund. Scudder
Trust Company, also an affiliate of the Advisor, provides subaccounting and
recordkeeping services for the shareholders in certain retirement and employee
benefit plans. In addition, other service providers not affiliated with the Advisor
provide certain services (i.e., custody, legal and audit) to the Fund under the
Administrative Agreement. The Advisor pays the service providers for the provision
of their services to the Fund and pays other Fund expenses, including insurance,
registration, printing, postage and other costs. Certain expenses of the Fund will not
be borne by the Advisor under the Administrative Agreement, such as taxes,
brokerage, interest and extraordinary expenses, and the fees and expenses of the
Independent Directors (including the fees and expenses of their independent
counsel). For the six months ended April 30, 2002, the Administrative Fee was as
follows:

Distribution Service Agreement. Under the Distribution Service Agreement, in
accordance with Rule 12b-1 under the 1940 Act, Scudder Distributors, Inc. ("SDI"),
a subsidiary of the Advisor, receives a fee ("Distribution Fee") of 0.75% of average
daily net assets of Class B and C shares. Pursuant to the agreement, SDI enters into
related selling group agreements with various firms at various rates for sales of Class B
and C shares. For the six months ended April 30, 2002, the Distribution Fee was as
follows:

In addition, SDI provides information and administrative services ("Service Fee") to
Class A, B and C shareholders at an annual rate of up to 0.25% of average daily net
assets for each such class. SDI in turn has various agreements with financial services
firms that provide these services and pays these fees based upon the assets of
shareholder accounts the firms service. For the six months ended April 30, 2002, the
Service Fee was as follows:

Underwriting Agreement and Contingent Deferred Sales Charge. SDI is the
principal underwriter for Class A, B and C shares. Underwriting commissions paid in
connection with the distribution of Class A shares for the six months ended April 30,
2002 aggregated $17,221.

In addition, SDI receives any contingent deferred sales charge ("CDSC") from
Class B share redemptions occurring within six years of purchase and Class C share
redemptions occurring within one year of purchase. There is no such charge upon
redemption of any share appreciation or reinvested dividends. The CDSC is based on
declining rates ranging from 4% to 1% for Class B and 1% for Class C, of the value
of the shares redeemed. For the six months ended April 30, 2002, the CDSC for
Class B and C shares aggregated $90,206 and $748, respectively. A deferred sales
charge of up to 1% is assessed on certain redemptions of Class A shares. For the six
months ended April 30, 2002, SDI received $41,565.

Directors' Fees and Expenses. The Fund pays each Director not affiliated with the
Advisor retainer fees plus specified amounts for attended board and committee
meetings.

Other Related Parties. AARP through its affiliates monitors and approves the
AARP Investments Program from the Advisor. The Advisor has agreed to pay a fee to
AARP and/or its affiliates in return for the use of the AARP trademark and services
relating to investments by AARP members in Class AARP shares of the Fund. This
fee is calculated on a daily basis as a percentage of the combined net assets of the
AARP classes of all funds managed by the Advisor. The fee rates, which decrease as
the aggregate net assets of the AARP classes become larger, are as follows: 0.07% for
the first $6,000,000,000 of net assets, 0.06% for the next $10,000,000,000 of such
net assets and 0.05% of such net assets thereafter. These amounts are used for the
general purposes of AARP and its members.

D. Line of Credit

The Fund and several other affiliated Funds (the "Participants") share in a
$1.3 billion revolving credit facility administered by J.P. Morgan Chase Bank for
temporary or emergency purposes, including the meeting of redemption requests that
otherwise might require the untimely disposition of securities. The Participants are
charged an annual commitment fee which is allocated, pro rata based upon net assets,
among each of the Participants. Interest is calculated at the Federal Funds Rate plus
0.5 percent. The Fund may borrow up to a maximum of 33 percent of its net assets
under the agreement.

risks, advisory fees, distribution charges, and other expenses, please order a free prospectus. Read the
prospectus before investing in any fund to ensure the fund is appropriate for your goals and risk
tolerance. There is no assurance that the objective of any fund will be achieved, and fund returns and
net asset values fluctuate. Shares are redeemable at current net asset value, which may be more or less
than their original cost.

Convenient ways
to invest, quickly
and reliably



Automatic Investment Plan
A convenient investment program in which money is electronically
debited from your bank account monthly to regularly purchase fund
shares and "dollar cost average" - buy more shares when the fund's
price is lower and fewer when it's higher, which can reduce your
average purchase price over time.*
Automatic Dividend Transfer
The most timely, reliable, and convenient way to purchase shares -
use distributions from one Scudder fund to purchase shares in
another, automatically (accounts with identical registrations or the
same social security or tax identification number).
QuickBuy
Lets you purchase Scudder fund shares electronically, avoiding
potential mailing delays; money for each of your transactions is
electronically debited from a previously designated bank account.
Payroll Deduction and Direct Deposit
Have all or part of your paycheck - even government checks -
invested in up to four Scudder funds at one time.
*  Dollar cost averaging involves continuous investment in securities
regardless of price fluctuations and does not assure a profit or protect
against loss in declining markets. Investors should consider their ability
to continue such a plan through periods of low price levels.

Extremely low volatility could lead to a sharp, but short-lived, decline in stocks 
              
              Still, a chart of the S&P 500 reveals an undercurrent of bullishness, says Lawrence G. McMillan.

Who trades options the most? Millennial investors
              
              Millennials are frequently criticized by market experts for the way they invest—or, more accurately, the way they’re not investing—but recent research indicates that at least some young market participants are going about things in a more sophisticated way than they’re typically given credit for.

Dollar spins wheels ahead of GDP report expected to show faster clip of growth
              
              The U.S. dollar churned lower against most rivals save for the depreciating Swiss franc on Friday ahead of an update on the broadest measure of the U.S. economy—a GDP report that could help shape the Federal Reserve’s so far slow-moving approach to interest rates.

Dollar rises from 13-month low
              
              The U.S. dollar rises on Thursday, gaining against major rivals in what analysts suggest a mild consolidation following precipitous declines over recent weeks.

It is not possible to invest directly in an index.closeWhy Choose This Fund Investing in international equities may help investors seeking to capture growth opportunities outside the United States while diversifying their portfolio. This may however be accompanied by additional risks of investing in foreign stocks. Portfolio Management intends to select approximately 50 stocks from among large cap companies in global developed markets outside North America, utilizing the CROCI® strategy as the primary factor. The fund is reviewed periodically and adjusted in accordance with the CROCI® strategy’s rules, and the regional weighting in the fund is targeted to match the fund’s benchmark. The CROCI® strategy is supplied by the CROCI® investment strategy and valuation group, a unit within Deutsche Asset Management, through a licensing agreement with the fund’s advisor. The CROCI® valuation process is not managed or executed by Deutsche Investment Management Americas, Inc. The members of the CROCI team are not employees of DIMA nor do they provide investment advisory services on behalf of DIMA.Diversification by asset class or among real estate sectors does not necessarily protect against losses.

    R-001833.8 (4/17) Additional Performance InformationFund performance includes reinvestment of all distributions. Important Objectives, Strategy and Risk InformationThe fund seeks long-term growth of capital.Portfolio management intends to select approximately 50 stocks from among the largest stocks under CROCI® coverage (excluding financial stocks) in global developed markets outside North America, that offer economic value, utilizing the CROCI® strategy as one factor, among other factors. Under the CROCI® strategy, economic value is measured using various metrics such as the CROCI® Economic Price Earnings Ratio. This ratio is a proprietary measure of company valuation using the same relationships between valuation and return as an accounting P/E ratio (i.e. price/ book value divided by return on equity). CROCI® is a proprietary valuation methodology, which dates back to 1996 when it was developed by Deutsche Bank and attempts to understand the real value of a company. Portfolio management has the discretion from time to time to utilize forward foreign currency contracts to hedge against changes in value of the non−U.S. currency exposure of the Fund’s investments. The amount of the hedge, if any, is within management’s discretion depending on its outlook for currency markets.The fund will be managed using the CROCI® Investment Process which is based on portfolio management’s belief that, over time, stocks which display more favorable financial metrics (for example, the CROCI® Economic P/E Ratio) as generated by this process may outperform stocks which display less favorable metrics. This premise may not prove to be correct and prospective investors should evaluate this assumption prior to investing in the fund. The fund’s use of forward currency contracts may not be successful in hedging currency exchange rates changes and could eliminate some or all of the benefit of an increase in the value of a foreign currency versus the US dollar. Investing in derivatives entails special risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and/or increase volatility. Investing in foreign securities presents certain risks, such as currency fluctuations, political and economic changes, and market risks. The fund may lend securities to approved institutions. Stocks may decline in value. See the prospectus for details. Important Information and Definitions©2017 Morningstar, Inc. All rights reserved. Morningstar, Inc., shall not be responsible for investment decisions, damages or other losses resulting from use of this rating. For each fund with at least a 3-year history, Morningstar calculates a Rating based on a risk-adjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads and redemption fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in a category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.)Source: Morningstar, Inc. The Morningstar® International Equity Style Box™ placement is based on a fund’s price-to-earnings and price-to-cash-flow ratios relative to the MSCI EAFE® index, as well as the size of the companies in which it invests, or median market capitalization. It represents a snapshot of a fund’s portfolio on a single day, but it’s not exact because a portfolio changes from day to day. A longer term view is represented by the fund’s Morningstar category, which is based on actual investment style as measured by its underlying holdings over the past three years. For funds younger than three years, the Morningstar category is estimated.Morningstar Risk is based on the calculation of the difference between the Morningstar Return (adjusted for loads and excess over the risk-free rate) and the Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return (adjusted for loads, excess over risk-free rate and risk). The calculation results in a rating system such that for each time period (3-, 5-, 10-years), the top 10% are given a risk score of 5 or High, next 22.5% of 4 or Above Average, next 35% of 3 or Average, next 22.5% of 2 or Below Average and the bottom 10% of 1 or Low. Source: Morningstar, Inc. Beta is a historical measure of a fund’s sensitivity to the movements of the fund’s benchmark index. A fund with a beta greater than 1 is more volatile than the benchmark. A fund with a beta less than 1 is less volatile. Source: Morningstar, Inc. R-squared (R2) is a historical measure that indicates how closely a fund’s past fluctuations have correlated with those of the fund’s benchmark. An R2 of 100% means that all movements of a fund are explained by benchmark movements. Both beta and R2 are based on a 3-year period relative to the index. Source: Morningstar, Inc. Standard deviation is a 3-year statistical measure of the volatility of a fund’s returns. Generally, the greater the standard deviation, the greater the fund’s volatility. Source: Morningstar, Inc. The Price/Earnings Ratio, or P/E Ratio, is a stock’s current price divided by the company’s trailing 12-month earnings per share from continuous operations.Source: Morningstar, Inc. Turnover rate is the rate of trading activity in a fund’s portfolio of investments, equal to the lesser of purchases or sales, for a year, divided by average total assets for that year.

Risk Considerations
Investments in mutual funds involve risk. Stocks may decline in value. Bond investments are subject to interest-rate, credit, liquidity and market risks to varying degrees. Credit risk refers to the ability of an issuer to make timely payments of principal and interest. Investing in derivatives entails special risks relating to liquidity, leverage and credit that may reduce returns and/or increase volatility. Investing in foreign securities, particularly those of emerging markets, presents certain risks, such as currency fluctuations, political and economic changes, and market risks. There are additional risks associated with investing in commodities, high-yield bonds, aggressive growth stocks, non-diversified/concentrated funds and small- and mid-cap stocks which are more fully explained in the prospectuses. Please read the prospectus for more information.
