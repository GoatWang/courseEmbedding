Strategy and process

Tax-advantaged income: The fund offers California residents the potential for high current income that is free from federal income tax and California State personal income taxes.
Focus on performance: The portfolio managers seek to provide a competitive yield through a combination of careful security selection and portfolio construction strategies.
A high-quality portfolio: A diversified portfolio of low-risk, high-quality investments enables the managers to pursue current income while maintaining a relatively stable share value.



 Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. To obtain the most recent month-end performance, visit putnam.com. 
Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes. Returns before sales charge do not reflect the current maximum sales charges as indicated below. Had the sales charge been reflected, returns would be lower. Returns at public offering price (after sales charge) for class A and class M shares reflect the current maximum initial sales charges of 5.75% and 3.50% for equity funds and Putnam Absolute Return 500 Fund and 700 Fund, and 4.00% and 3.25% for income funds (1.00% and 0.75% for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund, and Putnam Short-Term Municipal Income Fund), respectively. Class B share returns reflect the applicable contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC), which is 5% in the first year, declining to 1% in the sixth year, and is eliminated thereafter (except for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund, and Putnam Short-Term Municipal Income Fund, which is 1% in the first year, declining to 0.5% in the second year, and is eliminated thereafter). Class C shares reflect a 1% CDSC the first year that is eliminated thereafter. Performance for class B, C, M, R, T1, and Y shares prior to their inception is derived from the historical performance of class A shares, adjusted for the applicable sales charge (or CDSC) and, except for class Y shares, the higher operating expenses for such shares (with the exception of Putnam Tax-Free High Yield Fund and Putnam AMT-Free Municipal Fund, which are based on the historical performance of class B shares). Class R5/R6 shares, available to qualified employee-benefit plans only, are sold without an initial sales charge and have no CDSC. Class Y shares are generally only available for corporate and institutional clients and have no initial sales charge. Performance for Class R5/R6 shares before their inception are derived from the historical performance of class Y shares, which have not been adjusted for the lower expenses; had they, returns would have been higher. Class A, M, and T1 shares of Putnam money market funds have no initial sales charge. For a portion of the period, some funds had expenses limitations or had been sold on a limited basis with limited assets and expenses, without which returns would be lower.



Objective
The fund seeks as high a level of current income exempt from federal income tax and California personal income tax as we believe to be consistent with the preservation of capital.

Lipper rankings are based on total return without sales charge
relative to all share classes of funds with similar objectives as
determined by Lipper. Past performance is not indicative of future
results.


The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.


The up-market capture ratio is used to evaluate how well an investment manager performed relative to an index during periods when that index has risen. The ratio is
calculated by dividing the manager’s returns by the returns of the index during the up-market, and multiplying that factor by 100. The down-market capture ratio
is used to evaluate how well an investment manager performed relative to an index during periods when that index has dropped. The ratio is calculated by dividing the
manager’s returns by the returns of the index during the down-market and multiplying that factor by 100.

The unclassified sector (where applicable) includes exchange traded funds and other securities not able to be classified by sector.
Sectors will vary over time. Represents the equity portion of the portfolio.



Fund characteristics will vary over time.
Due to rounding, percentages may not equal 100%.


 Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. To obtain the most recent month-end performance, visit putnam.com. 
Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes. Returns before sales charge do not reflect the current maximum sales charges as indicated below. Had the sales charge been reflected, returns would be lower. Returns at public offering price (after sales charge) for class A and class M shares reflect the current maximum initial sales charges of 5.75% and 3.50% for equity funds and Putnam Absolute Return 500 Fund and 700 Fund, and 4.00% and 3.25% for income funds (1.00% and 0.75% for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund, and Putnam Short-Term Municipal Income Fund), respectively. Class B share returns reflect the applicable contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC), which is 5% in the first year, declining to 1% in the sixth year, and is eliminated thereafter (except for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund, and Putnam Short-Term Municipal Income Fund, which is 1% in the first year, declining to 0.5% in the second year, and is eliminated thereafter). Class C shares reflect a 1% CDSC the first year that is eliminated thereafter. Performance for class B, C, M, R, T1, and Y shares prior to their inception is derived from the historical performance of class A shares, adjusted for the applicable sales charge (or CDSC) and, except for class Y shares, the higher operating expenses for such shares (with the exception of Putnam Tax-Free High Yield Fund and Putnam AMT-Free Municipal Fund, which are based on the historical performance of class B shares). Class R5/R6 shares, available to qualified employee-benefit plans only, are sold without an initial sales charge and have no CDSC. Class Y shares are generally only available for corporate and institutional clients and have no initial sales charge. Performance for Class R5/R6 shares before their inception are derived from the historical performance of class Y shares, which have not been adjusted for the lower expenses; had they, returns would have been higher. Class A, M, and T1 shares of Putnam money market funds have no initial sales charge. For a portion of the period, some funds had expenses limitations or had been sold on a limited basis with limited assets and expenses, without which returns would be lower.

The Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond Index is an unmanaged index of long-term fixed-rate investment-grade tax-exempt bonds. You cannot invest directly in an index.
 Consider these risks before investing: Bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons, including general financial market conditions, changing market perceptions (including perceptions about the risk of default and expectations about monetary policy or interest rates), changes in government intervention in the financial markets, and factors related to a specific issuer or industry. These and other factors may lead to increased volatility and reduced liquidity in the fund's portfolio holdings. Single-state investments are at risk of common economic forces and other factors affecting a state's tax-exempt investments. This may result in greater losses and volatility. Capital gains, if any, are taxed at the federal and, in most cases, state levels. For some investors, investment income may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax. Bond investments are subject to interest-rate risk (the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise) and credit risk (the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments). Interest-rate risk is greater for longer-term bonds, and credit risk is greater for below-investment-grade bonds. Unlike bonds, funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses. Tax-exempt bonds may be issued under the Internal Revenue Code only by limited types of issuers for limited types of projects. As a result, the fund's investments may be focused in certain market segments and be more vulnerable to fluctuations in the values of the securities it holds than a more broadly invested fund. Interest the fund receives might be taxable. You can lose money by investing in the fund.
Credit qualities are shown as a percentage of net assets. A bond rated BBB or higher (SP-3 or higher, for short-term debt) is considered investment grade. This chart reflects the highest security rating provided by one or more of Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch. Short-term cash bonds are included in the cash and net other assets category. Ratings and portfolio credit quality will vary over time. Derivative instruments, including currency forwards, are only included to the extent of any unrealized gain or loss on such instruments and are shown in the cash and net other assets category. Cash is also shown in the cash and net other assets category. The fund itself has not been rated by an independent rating agency.

Strategy and process

Tax-advantaged income: The fund offers California residents the potential for high current income that is free from federal income tax and California State personal income taxes.
Focus on performance: The portfolio managers seek to provide a competitive yield through a combination of careful security selection and portfolio construction strategies.
A high-quality portfolio: A diversified portfolio of low-risk, high-quality investments enables the managers to pursue current income while maintaining a relatively stable share value.



 Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. To obtain the most recent month-end performance, visit putnam.com. 
Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes. Returns before sales charge do not reflect the current maximum sales charges as indicated below. Had the sales charge been reflected, returns would be lower. Returns at public offering price (after sales charge) for class A and class M shares reflect the current maximum initial sales charges of 5.75% and 3.50% for equity funds and Putnam Absolute Return 500 Fund and 700 Fund, and 4.00% and 3.25% for income funds (1.00% and 0.75% for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund, and Putnam Short-Term Municipal Income Fund), respectively. Class B share returns reflect the applicable contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC), which is 5% in the first year, declining to 1% in the sixth year, and is eliminated thereafter (except for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund, and Putnam Short-Term Municipal Income Fund, which is 1% in the first year, declining to 0.5% in the second year, and is eliminated thereafter). Class C shares reflect a 1% CDSC the first year that is eliminated thereafter. Performance for class B, C, M, R, T1, and Y shares prior to their inception is derived from the historical performance of class A shares, adjusted for the applicable sales charge (or CDSC) and, except for class Y shares, the higher operating expenses for such shares (with the exception of Putnam Tax-Free High Yield Fund and Putnam AMT-Free Municipal Fund, which are based on the historical performance of class B shares). Class R5/R6 shares, available to qualified employee-benefit plans only, are sold without an initial sales charge and have no CDSC. Class Y shares are generally only available for corporate and institutional clients and have no initial sales charge. Performance for Class R5/R6 shares before their inception are derived from the historical performance of class Y shares, which have not been adjusted for the lower expenses; had they, returns would have been higher. Class A, M, and T1 shares of Putnam money market funds have no initial sales charge. For a portion of the period, some funds had expenses limitations or had been sold on a limited basis with limited assets and expenses, without which returns would be lower.

Lipper rankings are based on total return without sales charge
relative to all share classes of funds with similar objectives as
determined by Lipper. Past performance is not indicative of future
results.


The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.


The up-market capture ratio is used to evaluate how well an investment manager performed relative to an index during periods when that index has risen. The ratio is
calculated by dividing the manager’s returns by the returns of the index during the up-market, and multiplying that factor by 100. The down-market capture ratio
is used to evaluate how well an investment manager performed relative to an index during periods when that index has dropped. The ratio is calculated by dividing the
manager’s returns by the returns of the index during the down-market and multiplying that factor by 100.

The unclassified sector (where applicable) includes exchange traded funds and other securities not able to be classified by sector.
Sectors will vary over time. Represents the equity portion of the portfolio.



Fund characteristics will vary over time.
Due to rounding, percentages may not equal 100%.


 Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. To obtain the most recent month-end performance, visit putnam.com. 
Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes. Returns before sales charge do not reflect the current maximum sales charges as indicated below. Had the sales charge been reflected, returns would be lower. Returns at public offering price (after sales charge) for class A and class M shares reflect the current maximum initial sales charges of 5.75% and 3.50% for equity funds and Putnam Absolute Return 500 Fund and 700 Fund, and 4.00% and 3.25% for income funds (1.00% and 0.75% for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund, and Putnam Short-Term Municipal Income Fund), respectively. Class B share returns reflect the applicable contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC), which is 5% in the first year, declining to 1% in the sixth year, and is eliminated thereafter (except for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund, and Putnam Short-Term Municipal Income Fund, which is 1% in the first year, declining to 0.5% in the second year, and is eliminated thereafter). Class C shares reflect a 1% CDSC the first year that is eliminated thereafter. Performance for class B, C, M, R, T1, and Y shares prior to their inception is derived from the historical performance of class A shares, adjusted for the applicable sales charge (or CDSC) and, except for class Y shares, the higher operating expenses for such shares (with the exception of Putnam Tax-Free High Yield Fund and Putnam AMT-Free Municipal Fund, which are based on the historical performance of class B shares). Class R5/R6 shares, available to qualified employee-benefit plans only, are sold without an initial sales charge and have no CDSC. Class Y shares are generally only available for corporate and institutional clients and have no initial sales charge. Performance for Class R5/R6 shares before their inception are derived from the historical performance of class Y shares, which have not been adjusted for the lower expenses; had they, returns would have been higher. Class A, M, and T1 shares of Putnam money market funds have no initial sales charge. For a portion of the period, some funds had expenses limitations or had been sold on a limited basis with limited assets and expenses, without which returns would be lower.

The Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond Index is an unmanaged index of long-term fixed-rate investment-grade tax-exempt bonds. You cannot invest directly in an index.
 Consider these risks before investing: Bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons, including general financial market conditions, changing market perceptions (including perceptions about the risk of default and expectations about monetary policy or interest rates), changes in government intervention in the financial markets, and factors related to a specific issuer or industry. These and other factors may lead to increased volatility and reduced liquidity in the fund's portfolio holdings. Single-state investments are at risk of common economic forces and other factors affecting a state's tax-exempt investments. This may result in greater losses and volatility. Capital gains, if any, are taxed at the federal and, in most cases, state levels. For some investors, investment income may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax. Bond investments are subject to interest-rate risk (the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise) and credit risk (the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments). Interest-rate risk is greater for longer-term bonds, and credit risk is greater for below-investment-grade bonds. Unlike bonds, funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses. Tax-exempt bonds may be issued under the Internal Revenue Code only by limited types of issuers for limited types of projects. As a result, the fund's investments may be focused in certain market segments and be more vulnerable to fluctuations in the values of the securities it holds than a more broadly invested fund. Interest the fund receives might be taxable. You can lose money by investing in the fund.
Credit qualities are shown as a percentage of net assets. A bond rated BBB or higher (SP-3 or higher, for short-term debt) is considered investment grade. This chart reflects the highest security rating provided by one or more of Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch. Short-term cash bonds are included in the cash and net other assets category. Ratings and portfolio credit quality will vary over time. Derivative instruments, including currency forwards, are only included to the extent of any unrealized gain or loss on such instruments and are shown in the cash and net other assets category. Cash is also shown in the cash and net other assets category. The fund itself has not been rated by an independent rating agency.

Strategy and process

Tax-advantaged income: The fund offers California residents the potential for high current income that is free from federal income tax and California State personal income taxes.
Focus on performance: The portfolio managers seek to provide a competitive yield through a combination of careful security selection and portfolio construction strategies.
A high-quality portfolio: A diversified portfolio of low-risk, high-quality investments enables the managers to pursue current income while maintaining a relatively stable share value.



 Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. To obtain the most recent month-end performance, visit putnam.com. 
Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes. Returns before sales charge do not reflect the current maximum sales charges as indicated below. Had the sales charge been reflected, returns would be lower. Returns at public offering price (after sales charge) for class A and class M shares reflect the current maximum initial sales charges of 5.75% and 3.50% for equity funds and Putnam Absolute Return 500 Fund and 700 Fund, and 4.00% and 3.25% for income funds (1.00% and 0.75% for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund, and Putnam Short-Term Municipal Income Fund), respectively. Class B share returns reflect the applicable contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC), which is 5% in the first year, declining to 1% in the sixth year, and is eliminated thereafter (except for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund, and Putnam Short-Term Municipal Income Fund, which is 1% in the first year, declining to 0.5% in the second year, and is eliminated thereafter). Class C shares reflect a 1% CDSC the first year that is eliminated thereafter. Performance for class B, C, M, R, T1, and Y shares prior to their inception is derived from the historical performance of class A shares, adjusted for the applicable sales charge (or CDSC) and, except for class Y shares, the higher operating expenses for such shares (with the exception of Putnam Tax-Free High Yield Fund and Putnam AMT-Free Municipal Fund, which are based on the historical performance of class B shares). Class R5/R6 shares, available to qualified employee-benefit plans only, are sold without an initial sales charge and have no CDSC. Class Y shares are generally only available for corporate and institutional clients and have no initial sales charge. Performance for Class R5/R6 shares before their inception are derived from the historical performance of class Y shares, which have not been adjusted for the lower expenses; had they, returns would have been higher. Class A, M, and T1 shares of Putnam money market funds have no initial sales charge. For a portion of the period, some funds had expenses limitations or had been sold on a limited basis with limited assets and expenses, without which returns would be lower.



Objective
The fund seeks as high a level of current income exempt from federal income tax and California personal income tax as we believe to be consistent with the preservation of capital.

Lipper rankings are based on total return without sales charge
relative to all share classes of funds with similar objectives as
determined by Lipper. Past performance is not indicative of future
results.


The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods.


The up-market capture ratio is used to evaluate how well an investment manager performed relative to an index during periods when that index has risen. The ratio is
calculated by dividing the manager’s returns by the returns of the index during the up-market, and multiplying that factor by 100. The down-market capture ratio
is used to evaluate how well an investment manager performed relative to an index during periods when that index has dropped. The ratio is calculated by dividing the
manager’s returns by the returns of the index during the down-market and multiplying that factor by 100.

The unclassified sector (where applicable) includes exchange traded funds and other securities not able to be classified by sector.
Sectors will vary over time. Represents the equity portion of the portfolio.



Fund characteristics will vary over time.
Due to rounding, percentages may not equal 100%.


 Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. Share price, principal value, and return will vary, and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares. To obtain the most recent month-end performance, visit putnam.com. 
Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes. Returns before sales charge do not reflect the current maximum sales charges as indicated below. Had the sales charge been reflected, returns would be lower. Returns at public offering price (after sales charge) for class A and class M shares reflect the current maximum initial sales charges of 5.75% and 3.50% for equity funds and Putnam Absolute Return 500 Fund and 700 Fund, and 4.00% and 3.25% for income funds (1.00% and 0.75% for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund, and Putnam Short-Term Municipal Income Fund), respectively. Class B share returns reflect the applicable contingent deferred sales charge (CDSC), which is 5% in the first year, declining to 1% in the sixth year, and is eliminated thereafter (except for Putnam Floating Rate Income Fund, Putnam Absolute Return 100 Fund and 300 Fund, and Putnam Short-Term Municipal Income Fund, which is 1% in the first year, declining to 0.5% in the second year, and is eliminated thereafter). Class C shares reflect a 1% CDSC the first year that is eliminated thereafter. Performance for class B, C, M, R, T1, and Y shares prior to their inception is derived from the historical performance of class A shares, adjusted for the applicable sales charge (or CDSC) and, except for class Y shares, the higher operating expenses for such shares (with the exception of Putnam Tax-Free High Yield Fund and Putnam AMT-Free Municipal Fund, which are based on the historical performance of class B shares). Class R5/R6 shares, available to qualified employee-benefit plans only, are sold without an initial sales charge and have no CDSC. Class Y shares are generally only available for corporate and institutional clients and have no initial sales charge. Performance for Class R5/R6 shares before their inception are derived from the historical performance of class Y shares, which have not been adjusted for the lower expenses; had they, returns would have been higher. Class A, M, and T1 shares of Putnam money market funds have no initial sales charge. For a portion of the period, some funds had expenses limitations or had been sold on a limited basis with limited assets and expenses, without which returns would be lower.

The Bloomberg Barclays Municipal Bond Index is an unmanaged index of long-term fixed-rate investment-grade tax-exempt bonds. You cannot invest directly in an index.
 Consider these risks before investing: Bond prices may fall or fail to rise over time for several reasons, including general financial market conditions, changing market perceptions (including perceptions about the risk of default and expectations about monetary policy or interest rates), changes in government intervention in the financial markets, and factors related to a specific issuer or industry. These and other factors may lead to increased volatility and reduced liquidity in the fund's portfolio holdings. Single-state investments are at risk of common economic forces and other factors affecting a state's tax-exempt investments. This may result in greater losses and volatility. Capital gains, if any, are taxed at the federal and, in most cases, state levels. For some investors, investment income may be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax. Bond investments are subject to interest-rate risk (the risk of bond prices falling if interest rates rise) and credit risk (the risk of an issuer defaulting on interest or principal payments). Interest-rate risk is greater for longer-term bonds, and credit risk is greater for below-investment-grade bonds. Unlike bonds, funds that invest in bonds have fees and expenses. Tax-exempt bonds may be issued under the Internal Revenue Code only by limited types of issuers for limited types of projects. As a result, the fund's investments may be focused in certain market segments and be more vulnerable to fluctuations in the values of the securities it holds than a more broadly invested fund. Interest the fund receives might be taxable. You can lose money by investing in the fund.
Credit qualities are shown as a percentage of net assets. A bond rated BBB or higher (SP-3 or higher, for short-term debt) is considered investment grade. This chart reflects the highest security rating provided by one or more of Standard & Poor's, Moody's and Fitch. Short-term cash bonds are included in the cash and net other assets category. Ratings and portfolio credit quality will vary over time. Derivative instruments, including currency forwards, are only included to the extent of any unrealized gain or loss on such instruments and are shown in the cash and net other assets category. Cash is also shown in the cash and net other assets category. The fund itself has not been rated by an independent rating agency.

PUTNAM ANNOUNCES COMPREHENSIVE INITIATIVE FOR CLOSED-END 
FUNDS, INCLUDING FUND MERGERS AND TENDER OFFERS
BOSTON, Massachusetts (February 15, 2007) -- Putnam Investments and the Board of Trustees of the Putnam Funds announced today approval of a comprehensive initiative that would (1) concentrate the lineup of closed-end funds managed by Putnam Investments (together, the �Funds�) through mergers combining certain Funds, and (2) provide shareholders of each Fund with enhanced liquidity opportunities either through merger into an open-end fund or through a tender offer by the Fund to purchase up to 10% of the outstanding common shares. 
Mergers to Combine Certain Closed-End Funds 
The Board of Trustees have approved in principle plans to merge five tax-exempt closed-end Funds as follows: Putnam Investment Grade Municipal Trust (NYSE: PGM) and Putnam Municipal Bond Fund (NYSE: PMG) would be merged into Putnam Municipal Opportunities Trust (NYSE: PMO), and Putnam High Yield Municipal Trust (NYSE: PYM) would be merged into Putnam Managed Municipal Income Trust (NYSE: PMM). The mergers would significantly increase the size of the surviving Funds, to total assets of approximately $1 billion (PMO) and approximately $750 million (PMM), respectively, which would likely 






reduce Fund expenses and increase the liquidity in the trading market for the shares of each surviving Fund. It is currently expected that each merger would be concluded later this year.

Mergers of Three Closed-End Funds into Open-End Funds

The Trustees have approved in principle a plan to merge Putnam Tax-Free Health Care Fund (NYSE: PMH) into Putnam Tax Exempt Income Fund, an open-end fund also managed by Putnam Investments. As previously announced on February 5,
the Trustees also approved in principle the mergers of each of Putnam California Investment Grade Municipal Trust (AMEX: PCA) and Putnam New York Investment Grade Municipal Trust (AMEX: PMN) into a similar open-end Putnam Fund. Each of these mergers
would give shareholders shares of an open-end fund, with the opportunity to realize the full net asset value of their shares following the merger (less any applicable temporary redemption fees, which are not expected to exceed 1% of amounts
redeemed). In giving their approval in principle, the Trustees considered, among other things, the possibility that these Funds would not be able to continue to operate in their present closed-end form, the pattern of trading discounts, changes in
the Funds� shareholder base over time, and requests from shareholders for enhanced liquidity. It is currently expected that the merger of PMH into Putnam Tax Exempt Income Fund would be concluded in the third quarter of 2007. As previously
announced, the mergers of PCA into Putnam California Tax Exempt Income Fund and PMN into Putnam New York Tax Exempt Income Fund are expected to close in June and later this summer, respectively. 

Each of the plans of merger described above is subject to the approval of Fund shareholders and certain other conditions. 

Tender Offers to Fund Shareholders

Following extended discussions with Putnam Investments and taking into consideration requests from shareholders for enhanced liquidity, the Board of Trustees have approved a program for eight Funds to conduct tender offers to
purchase up to 10% of each Fund�s outstanding common shares for cash at a price per share equal to 98% of the net asset value per share (NAV) as of the purchase date. Subject to the exercise by the Trustees of their fiduciary duties in the
event of a material change in circumstances, each of the following Funds intends to conduct a tender offer under the program:







��������� 
Putnam High Income Securities Fund (NYSE: PCF)� 





Putnam High Yield Municipal Trust (NYSE: PYM)� 





Putnam Investment Grade Municipal Trust (NYSE: PGM)� 





Putnam Managed Municipal Income Trust (NYSE: PMM)� 





Putnam Master Intermediate Income Trust (NYSE: PIM)� 





Putnam Municipal Bond Fund (NYSE: PMG)� 





Putnam Municipal Opportunities Trust (NYSE: PMO)� 





Putnam Premier Income Trust (NYSE: PPT)� 
In approving this program, the Trustees considered that tender offers would give shareholders an opportunity to sell at least some of their shares at a price close to NAV, and the tender offer price of 98% of NAV would help offset the costs that shareholders who retain their shares might otherwise bear in connection with the tender offers. Certain Funds with outstanding preferred shares may elect to redeem a portion of the preferred shares in order to adjust the amount of leverage following the reduction in assets caused by tender offers. It is anticipated that the tender offers will commence during the second quarter of 2007.
A Comprehensive Approach to Addressing Closed-End Fund Issues
The initiative announced today is part of a continuing effort by Putnam Investments and the Funds� Trustees to maintain a diverse array of closed-end products, while taking into account changing market circumstances. Putnam Investments believes that the closed-end Funds continue to hold an important position in the broad range of Putnam products. 
The Trustees meet regularly with Putnam Investments regarding the closed-end Funds, and they carefully monitor the Funds� performance, the trading prices of Fund shares and the expressed views of shareholders in the Funds. In managing the closed-end Funds, especially during periods of significant trading discounts, Putnam Investments works with the Trustees to take actions that they believe are in the long-term best interests of Fund shareholders. The mergers and tender offer program announced today are consistent with actions taken by Putnam Investments and the Trustees in recent years, including:





� Instituting a share repurchase program, under which each Fund is authorized to repurchase up to 10% of its outstanding shares over a 2-year period ending in October 2007. This program enhances shareholder value, as repurchases made at a discount increase the net asset value per share of a Fund�s remaining shares, and has made a meaningful contribution to investment return. The program has been suspended indefinitely for PCA, PMH and PMN because of the announced mergers, but remains in effect for all other Funds. 
� Management fee reductions for most of the closed-end Funds, effective January 1, 2006.
� Merging two pairs of closed-end Funds together for greater efficiencies in 2005, and merging one closed-end Fund into an open-end fund managed by Putnam Investments in 2006.
� Promoting the Funds with enhanced disclosure and providing greater transparency to investors on the merits of the closed-end Funds.
� Expanding the tools available to Fund management teams, including a 2005 initiative to allow the taxable income Funds to employ leverage through borrowing.
* * * * * 
The foregoing is not an offer to sell, nor a solicitation of an offer to buy, shares of any fund, nor is it a solicitation of any proxy. For more information regarding the Putnam Funds, or to receive a free copy of materials filed with the SEC, including a prospectus/proxy statement relating to a proposed merger (and containing important information about fees, expenses and risk considerations) once a registration statement relating to such merger has been filed with the SEC and becomes effective, please visit www.putnam.com. Free copies of such materials can also be found on the SEC�s website (http://www.sec.gov). Please read any applicable prospectus/proxy statement carefully before making any investment decisions.
This announcement is not a recommendation, an offer to purchase or a solicitation of an offer to sell shares of any fund. None of the Funds has commenced any self-tender offer described 





in this press release. Upon commencement of each tender offer, the applicable Fund will file with the Securities and Exchange Commission a tender offer statement on Schedule TO and related exhibits, including an offer to purchase, letter of transmittal, and other related documents. Shareholders of each such Fund should read the offer to purchase and the tender offer statement on Schedule TO and related exhibits when such documents are filed and become available, as they will contain important information about that Fund�s tender offer. Shareholders can obtain these documents when they are filed and become available free of charge from the Securities and Exchange Commission�s website at www.sec.gov, or from Putnam Investments by directing a request to Putnam Investments� shareholder servicing group at 1-800-225-1581.

Do jetpacks exist?



A:
There are multiple examples of functional jetpack technology, though not all of these machines make use of jet propulsion technology, and very few of them approach the functionality of those jet packs seen in science fiction or cartoons. Some real-life jet packs only make very limited flights, while others are more like machine-powered parachutes that don't have the ability to lift off from the ground independently.
