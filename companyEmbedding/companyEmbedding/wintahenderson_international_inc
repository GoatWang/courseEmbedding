CAUTIONARY
STATEMENT ON FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION

 

This
Annual Report on Form 10-K (this “Report”) contains
“forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the
Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities
Act”), and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as amended (the “Exchange
Act”).  Forward-looking statements discuss matters
that are not historical facts.  Because they discuss
future events or conditions, forward-looking statements may include
words such as “anticipate,” “believe,”
“estimate,” “intend,” “could,”
“should,” “would,” “may,”
“seek,” “plan,” “might,”
“will,” “expect,” “predict,”
“project,” “forecast,”
“potential,” “continue” negatives thereof
or similar expressions.  Forward-looking statements speak
only as of the date they are made, are based on various underlying
assumptions and current expectations about the future and are not
guarantees.  Such statements involve known and unknown
risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual
results, level of activity, performance or achievement to be
materially different from the results of operations or plans
expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

 

We cannot
predict all of the risks and uncertainties.  Accordingly,
such information should not be regarded as representations that the
results or conditions described in such statements or that our
objectives and plans will be achieved and we do not assume any
responsibility for the accuracy or completeness of any of these
forward-looking statements.  These forward-looking
statements are found at various places throughout this Report and
include information concerning possible or assumed future results
of our operations, including statements about potential acquisition
or merger targets; business strategies; future cash flows;
financing plans; plans and objectives of management, any other
statements regarding future acquisitions, future cash needs, future
operations, business plans and future financial results, and any
other statements that are not historical facts.

 

These
forward-looking statements represent our intentions, plans,
expectations, assumptions and beliefs about future events and are
subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors.  Many
of those factors are outside of our control and could cause actual
results to differ materially from the results expressed or implied
by those forward-looking statements.  In light of these
risks, uncertainties and assumptions, the events described in the
forward-looking statements might not occur or might occur to a
different extent or at a different time than we have described. You
are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking
statements, which speak only as of the date of this
Report.  All subsequent written and oral forward-looking
statements concerning other matters addressed in this Report and
attributable to us or any person acting on our behalf are expressly
qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained
or referred to in this Report.

 

Except to
the extent required by law, we undertake no obligation to update or
revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new
information, future events, a change in events, conditions,
circumstances or assumptions underlying such statements, or
otherwise.

PART
I

 





Item
1.



Business.




 

Business
Development

 

The
Company was incorporated in the State of Nevada on June 30,
2010.   The Company was formed as a vehicle to pursue a
business combination and has made no efforts to identify a possible
business combination.  Since inception, the Company has
been engaged in organizing efforts and obtaining initial
financing.  As a result, the Company has not conducted
negotiations or entered into a letter of intent concerning any
target business.  

 

On October
1, 2010 (the “Closing Date”), the Company entered into
a Stock Purchase Agreement (the “Agreement”) by and
among the Company, Peter Reichard and Peter Coker, each a former
stockholder of the Company, and Beige Holdings, LLC
(“Beige”) and Marlin Financial Group, Inc.
(“Marlin”) pursuant to which Beige and Marlin acquired
all of the Company’s then outstanding shares of common stock
in exchange for payment by Beige and Marlin to Messrs. Reichard and
Coker in the aggregate amount of $15,000 (the “October
Transaction”).  Such shares represented all of our
then outstanding shares of common stock.

 

Upon the
closing of the October Transaction, Mr. Reichard resigned as our
President, effective immediately, and Gregory Schwartz was
appointed as our President and Chief Executive Officer, effectively
immediately.  In addition, Mr. Reichard resigned as a
member of our Board of Directors and Mr. Schwartz was appointed as
the Chairman of the Board of Directors.  In accordance
with Rule 14f-1 under the Exchange Act, Mr. Reichard’s
resignation from, and Mr. Schwartz’s appointment to, our
Board of Directors became effective on October 18, 2010.

 

On January
13, 2011, the Company, Beige, Marlin and Allan C. Schwartz entered
into a stock purchase agreement pursuant to which Beige and Marlin
sold an aggregate of 90,000 shares of our common stock, which
represented 90% of the then outstanding shares of our common stock,
to Allan C. Schwartz for a total purchase price of $18,750 (the
“January Transaction”).  In addition, the
Company and Allan C. Schwartz covenanted to Beige that Gregory
Schwartz shall not be removed from any of his positions with the
Company without the prior written consent by Beige.

 

On May 11,
2012, Gregory Schwartz resigned as our President, effective
immediately, and Allan Schwartz was appointed as our President and
Chief Executive Officer, effectively immediately.  In
addition, Mr. G. Schwartz resigned as a member of our Board of
Directors and Mr. A. Schwartz was appointed as the Chairman of the
Board of Directors.  In accordance with Rule 14f-1 under
the Exchange Act, Mr. G. Schwartz’s resignation from, and Mr.
A. Schwartz’s appointment to, our Board of Directors became
effective on May 11, 2012.

 

On July 8,
2016, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of
Incorporation (the “Amendment”) to change the name of
the company from “Europa Acquisition 1, Inc.” to
“Wintahenderson International, Inc.”. The Amendment was
effective July 8, 2016.

 

 

Business
of Issuer

 

The
Company is a “blank check” company. The SEC defines
those companies as “any development stage company that is
issuing a penny stock, within the meaning of Section 3 (a)(51) of
the Exchange Act, and that has no specific business plan or
purpose, or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with
an unidentified company or companies.” Pursuant to Rule 12b-2
under the Exchange Act, the Company also qualifies as a
“shell company,” because it has no or nominal assets
(other than cash) and no or nominal operations. Many states have
enacted statutes, rules and regulations limiting the sale of
securities of “blank check” companies in their
respective jurisdictions. Management does not intend to undertake
any efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities, either
debt or equity, until we have successfully concluded a business
combination. The Company intends to comply with the periodic
reporting requirements of the Exchange Act for so long as it is
subject to those requirements.

 

The
Company was organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such
investigation warrants, acquire a target company or business
seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held
corporation. The Company’s principal business objective for
the next twelve (12) months and beyond such time will be to achieve
long-term growth potential through a combination with a business
rather than immediate, short-term earnings. The Company will not
restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific
business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire
any type of business.

The
analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or
under the supervision of Allan Schwartz, our sole officer and
director. As of this date, the Company has not entered into any
definitive agreement with any party, nor have there been any
specific discussions with any potential business combination
candidate regarding business opportunities for the Company. The
Company has unrestricted flexibility in seeking, analyzing and
participating in potential business opportunities. In its efforts
to analyze potential acquisition targets, the Company will consider
the following factors:

 




●



Potential
for growth, indicated by new technology, anticipated market
expansion or new products;





●



Competitive
position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience
within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a
whole;





●



Strength
and diversity of management, either in place or scheduled for
recruitment;





●



Capital
requirements and anticipated availability of required funds, to be
provided by the Company or from operations, through the sale of
additional securities, through joint ventures or similar
arrangements or from other sources;





●



The cost
of participation by the Company as compared to the perceived
tangible and intangible values and potentials;





●



The extent
to which the business opportunity can be advanced;





●



The
accessibility of required management expertise, personnel, raw
materials, services, professional assistance and other required
items; and





●



Other
relevant factors.




 

In
applying the foregoing criteria, no one of which will be
controlling, management will attempt to analyze all factors and
circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable
investigative measures and available data. Potentially available
business opportunities may occur in many different industries, and
at various stages of development, all of which will make the task
of comparative investigation and analysis of such business
opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Due to the
Company’s limited capital available for investigation, the
Company may not discover or adequately evaluate adverse facts about
the opportunity to be acquired.

 

Form of
Acquisition

 

The manner
in which the Company participates in an opportunity will depend
upon the nature of the opportunity, the respective needs and
desires of the Company and the promoters of the opportunity, and
the relative negotiating strength of the Company and such
promoters.  We do not intend to solicit prospective
investors for any transaction. We will rely on word of mouth to
locate potential merger candidates.

 

It is
likely that the Company will acquire its participation in a
business opportunity through the issuance of common stock or other
securities of the Company. Although the terms of any such
transaction cannot be predicted, it should be noted that in certain
circumstances the criteria for determining whether or not an
acquisition is a so-called “tax free” reorganization
under Section 368(a)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the “Code”) depends upon whether the owners of
the acquired business own 80% or more of the voting stock of the
surviving entity. If a transaction were structured to take
advantage of these provisions rather than other “tax
free” provisions provided under the Code, all prior
stockholders would in such circumstances retain 20% or less of the
total issued and outstanding shares of the surviving entity. Under
other circumstances, depending upon the relative negotiating
strength of the parties, prior stockholders may retain
substantially less than 20% of the total issued and outstanding
shares of the surviving entity. This could result in substantial
additional dilution to the equity of those who were stockholders of
the Company prior to such reorganization.

 

The
present stockholders of the Company will likely not have control of
a majority of the voting securities of the Company following a
reorganization transaction. As part of such a transaction, all, or
a majority of, the Company’s directors may resign and one or
more new directors may be appointed without any vote by
stockholders.

 

In the
case of an acquisition, the transaction may be accomplished upon
the sole determination of management without any vote or approval
by stockholders. In the case of a statutory merger or consolidation
directly involving the Company, it will likely be necessary to call
a stockholders’ meeting and obtain the approval of the
holders of a majority of the outstanding securities. The necessity
to obtain such stockholder approval may result in delay and
additional expense in the consummation of any proposed transaction
and will also give rise to certain appraisal rights to dissenting
stockholders. Most likely, management will seek to structure any
such transaction so as not to require stockholder
approval.  Notwithstanding same since we currently have
only 1 shareholder, we intend to provide our shareholders with
complete disclosure concerning a possible target entity and its
business, including audited financial statements (if available to
us) prior to any merger or acquisition.

 

It is
anticipated that the investigation of specific business
opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of
relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments
will require substantial management time and attention and
substantial cost for accountants, attorneys and others. If a
decision is made not to participate in a specific business
opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related
investigation might not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an
agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business
opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result
in the loss to the Company of the related costs
incurred.

 

We
presently have no employees apart from our management. Our officers
and directors are engaged in outside business activities and
anticipate that they will devote to our business very limited time
until the acquisition of a successful business opportunity has been
identified. We expect no significant changes in the number of our
employees other than such changes, if any, incident to a business
combination.

Item 2.
         
Properties.




 

The
Company neither rents nor owns any properties.  We

activities.

 





Item

Legal Proceedings.




 

We are
currently not involved in any litigation that we believe could have
a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of
operations. There is no action, suit, proceeding, inquiry or
investigation before or by any court, public board, government
agency, self-regulatory organization or body pending or, to the
knowledge of the executive officers of our company or any of our
subsidiaries, threatened against or affecting our company, our
common stock, any of our subsidiaries or of our companies or our
subsidiaries’ officers or directors in their capacities as
such, in which an adverse decision could have a material adverse
effect.

Item
5.            
Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder
Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.




 

No
established public trading market exists for the Company’s
common stock. There are no plans, proposals, arrangements or
understandings with any person with regard to the development of a
trading market in any of the Company’s common
stock.

 

Common
Stock

 

Our
Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to
100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per
share.  The Common Stock is not listed on a
publicly-traded market.  As of September 15, 2016, there
was one stockholder of record holding an aggregate of 100,000
shares of common stock.

 

Preferred
Stock

 

Our
certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to
10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per
share.  As of September 15, 2016, there were no shares of
preferred stock issued and outstanding.

 

Dividends

 

To date,
we have not declared or paid any dividends on our common stock. We
currently do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the
foreseeable future on our common stock, when issued pursuant to
this offering. Although we intend to retain our earnings, if any,
to finance the exploration and growth of our business, our Board of
Directors will have the discretion to declare and pay dividends in
the future.

 

Payment of
dividends in the future will depend upon our earnings, capital
requirements, and other factors, which our Board of Directors may
deem relevant.

 

Unregistered
Sales of Equity Securities

 

None.

 

Securities
Authorized for Issuance Under Equity Compensation
Plans

 

We
presently do not have any equity based or other long-term incentive
programs.  In the future, we may adopt and establish an
equity-based or other long-term incentive plan if it is in the best
interest of the Company and our stockholders to do so.

Item
7.           
Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operation.




 

The
following discussion provides information which management believes
is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of
operations and financial condition. The discussion should be read
along with our financial statements and notes thereto contained
elsewhere in this Report. The following discussion and analysis
contains forward-looking statements, which involve risks and
uncertainties. Our actual results may differ significantly from the
results, expectations and plans discussed in these forward-looking
statements. 

 

Plan of
Operation

 

We were
organized as a vehicle to investigate and, if such investigation
warrants, acquire a target company or business seeking the
perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation. Our
principal business objective for the next 12 months and beyond such
time will be to achieve long-term growth potential through a
combination with a business rather than immediate, short-term
earnings.  We will not restrict our potential candidate
target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical
location and, thus, may acquire any type of business.

 

We do not
currently engage in any business activities that provide cash flow.
The costs of investigating and analyzing business combinations for
the next 12 months and beyond such time will be paid with money in
our treasury or with additional amounts, as necessary, to be loaned
to or invested in us by our stockholders, management or other
investors.

 

During the
next twelve (12) months we anticipate incurring costs related to
filing of Exchange Act reports and consummating an
acquisition.

 

We believe
we will be able to meet these costs through use of funds in our
treasury and additional amounts, as necessary, to be loaned by or
invested in us by our stockholders, management or other
investors.

 

We have
negative working capital, negative stockholders’ equity and
have not earned any revenues from operations to date. These
conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as
a going concern. We are currently devoting our efforts to locating
merger candidates. Our ability to continue as a going concern is
dependent upon our ability to develop additional sources of
capital, locate and complete a merger with another company, and
ultimately, achieve profitable operations.

 

We may
consider a business which has recently commenced operations, is a
developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into
new products or markets, is seeking to develop a new product or
service, or is an established business which may be experiencing
financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional
capital. In the alternative, a business combination may involve the
acquisition of, or merger with, a company which does not need
substantial additional capital, but which desires to establish a
public trading market for its shares, while avoiding, among other
things, the time delays, significant expense, and loss of voting
control which may occur in a public offering.

 

Our
officers and directors have not had any preliminary contact or
discussions with any representative of any other entity regarding a
business combination with us. Any target business that is selected
may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early
stages of development or growth, including entities without
established records of sales or earnings. In that event, we will be
subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations
of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging
growth companies. In addition, we may effect a business combination
with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of
risk, and, although our management will endeavor to evaluate the
risks inherent in a particular target business, there can be no
assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant
risks.

 

Our
management anticipates that it will likely be able to effect only
one business combination, due primarily to our limited financing
and the dilution of interest for present and prospective
stockholders, which is likely to occur as a result of our
management’s plan to offer a controlling interest to a target
business in order to achieve a tax-free reorganization. This lack
of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in
investing in us, because it will not permit us to offset potential
losses from one venture against gains from another.

 

 

 




 



4



 




  

 

We
anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be
complex and extremely risky. Because of general economic
conditions, rapid technological advances being made in some
industries and shortages of available capital, our management
believes that there are numerous firms seeking even the limited
additional capital which we will have and/or the perceived benefits
of becoming a publicly traded corporation. Such perceived benefits
of becoming a publicly traded corporation include, among other
things, facilitating or improving the terms on which additional
equity financing may be obtained, providing liquidity for the
principals of and investors in a business, creating a means for
providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key
employees, and offering greater flexibility in structuring
acquisitions, joint ventures and the like through the issuance of
stock. Potentially available business combinations may occur in
many different industries and at various stages of development, all
of which will make the task of comparative investigation and
analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and
complex.

 

Recent
Developments

 

On October
1, 2010, Messrs. Reichard and Coker sold an aggregate of 75,000
shares of our common stock to Beige and an aggregate of 25,000
shares of our common stock to Marlin for an aggregate purchase
price of $15,000.  Such shares represented all of our
then outstanding shares of common stock.  In addition,
Mr. Reichard resigned as our President, effective immediately, and
Mr. Schwartz was appointed as our President and Chief Executive
Officer, effectively immediately.  In addition, Mr.
Reichard resigned as a member of our Board of Directors and Mr.
Schwartz was appointed as the Chairman of the Board of
Directors.  In accordance with Rule 14f-1 under the
Exchange Act, Mr. Reichard’s resignation from, and Mr.
Wang’s appointment to, our Board of Directors became
effective on October 18, 2010.

 

On January
13, 2011, the Company, Beige, Marlin and Allan C. Schwartz entered
into a stock purchase agreement pursuant to which Beige and Marlin
sold an aggregate of 90,000 shares of our common stock, which
represented 90% of the then outstanding shares of our common stock,
to Allan C. Schwartz for a total purchase price of
$18,750.  In addition, the Company and Allan C. Schwartz
covenanted to Beige that Gregory Schwartz shall not be removed from
any of his positions with the Company without the prior written
consent by Beige.

 

On May 11,
2012, Gregory Schwartz resigned as our President, effective
immediately, and Allan Schwartz was appointed as our President and
Chief Executive Officer, effectively immediately.  In
addition, Mr. G. Schwartz resigned as a member of our Board of
Directors and Mr. A. Schwartz was appointed as the Chairman of the
Board of Directors.  In accordance with Rule 14f-1 under
the Exchange Act, Mr. G. Schwartz’s resignation from, and Mr.
A. Schwartz’s appointment to, our Board of Directors became
effective on May 11, 2012.

 

On July 8,
2016, we filed a Certificate of Amendment to our Articles of
Incorporation (the “Amendment”) to change the name of
the company from “Europa Acquisition 1, Inc.” to
Wintahenderson International, Inc.”. The Amendment was
effective July 8, 2016.

 

Results of
Operation

 

We did not
have any operating income from inception through June 30,
2016.

 

For the
fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, we recognized a net loss
of $27,443 and $19,906. Expenses for the fiscal years ended June
30, 2016 and 2015 were comprised of costs mainly associated with
legal, accounting and office expense.

 


Liquidity
and Capital Resources

 

At June
30, 2016, we had cash of $441.  We intend to rely upon
the issuance of common stock and loans from shareholders to fund
administrative expenses pending acquisition of an operating
company.  However, our shareholders are under no
obligation to provide such funding.

 

Management
anticipates seeking out a target company through
solicitation.  Such solicitation may include newspaper or
magazine advertisements, mailings and other distributions to law
firms, accounting firms, investment bankers, financial advisors and
similar persons, the use of one or more internet sites and similar
methods.  No estimate can be made as to the number of
persons who will be contacted or solicited. Management may engage
in such solicitation directly or may employ one or more other
entities to conduct or assist in such solicitation. Management and
its affiliates will pay referral fees to consultants and others who
refer target businesses for mergers into public companies in which
management and its affiliates have an interest.  Payments
are made if a business combination occurs, and may consist of cash
or a portion of the stock in the Company retained by management and
its affiliates, or both.

 

As
discussed above, we incurred a net loss of $27,443 and $19,906 for
fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.  Cash used in
operating activities during fiscal years ended June 30, 2016 and
2015 were $28,393 and $23,756.  As of June 30, 2016 and
2015, we had a stockholders’ deficiency of $124,320 and
$96,877.  Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about
our ability to continue as a going concern.  Our ability
to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to raise
additional capital and implement our business plan.  The
financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be
necessary if we are unable to continue as a going
concern.

Management
believes that actions presently being taken to obtain additional
funding and implement its strategic plans provide the opportunity
for us to continue as a going concern

 

Allan
Schwartz will supervise the search for target companies as
potential candidates for a business combination. Allan Schwartz
will pay, at his own expense, any costs he incurs in supervising
the search for a target company. Allan Schwartz may enter into
agreements with other consultants to assist in locating a target
company and may share stock received by it or cash resulting from
the sale of its securities with such other consultants.

 

Critical
Accounting Policies

 

We have
identified the policies outlined below as critical to our business
operations and an understanding of our results of operations. The
list is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our
accounting policies.  In many cases, the accounting
treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, with
no need for management's judgment in their application.

 

The
Company accounts for income taxes under FASB Codification Topic
740-10-25 (“ASC 740-10-25”).  Under ASC
740-10-25, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases.  Deferred tax
assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates
expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those
temporary differences are expected to be recovered or
settled.  Under ASC 740-10-25, the effect on deferred tax
assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in
income in the period that includes the enactment date of
operations, financial position or liquidity for the periods
presented in this report.

 

Recent
Accounting Pronouncements

 

The
Company has adopted all recently issued accounting pronouncements.
The adoption of the accounting pronouncements, including those not
yet effective, is not anticipated to have a material effect on the
financial position or results of operations of the
Company.

 

Off
Balance Sheet Arrangements

 

None.

Savings through the Seasons
Insulation acts as a thermal barrier against heat loss and heat gain. In most buildings insulation is the most practical and effective method to keep structures cool in the summer months and warm during the winter months. Insulation helps to reduce energy use and save money on energy bills. Reflective Insulation fortifies normal insulation by reflecting radiant heat. Properly installed radiant barriers can result in substantial year round savings. Contact Us








  







  








Construction Grade Durability
Our products are engineered to withstand the stresses commonly encountered during installation and shipping. Many of our products are reinforced with threading that resists tearing and punctures. As a result, installation is not only easier but the risk of losing product from damage is less likely. Furthermore, our reflective insulation continues to stay strong day in and day out providing durability throughout the entirety of the products use. At International Insulation Products we understand the need for superior product performance. Likewise, we understand the need for a product that can withstand the common hazards of a construction environment while also being easy to ship and handle. Contact Us


  



  












Solar Heat Blocking
International Insulation Product’s reflective insulation and radiant barriers incorporate polished aluminum facing that blocks radiant heat from the sun.






  












Heat Retention
Our reflective insulation utilizes a heat absorbing core that retains heated air during colder weather resulting in lower power bills.






  












Reduce Peak Hours
By using reflective insulation, temperatures are slower to increase from radiant heat throughout the day thereby reducing peak hour energy rates.






  












Comfort Zone
Make your home a comfort zone with International Insulation Products. Save money on energy bills while keeping the thermostat at a comfortable level.
