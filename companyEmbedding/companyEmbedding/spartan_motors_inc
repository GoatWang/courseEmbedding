(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.  General  Spartan Motors, Inc. was organized as a Michigan corporation on September 18, 1975, and is headquartered in Charlotte, Michigan. Spartan Motors began development of its first product that same year and shipped its first fire truck chassis in October 1975.  We are known as a leading, niche market engineer and manufacturer in the heavy-duty, custom vehicles marketplace. Our operating activities are conducted through our wholly-owned operating subsidiary, Spartan Motors USA, Inc. ("Spartan USA"), with locations in Charlotte, Michigan; Brandon, South Dakota; Ephrata, Pennsylvania; and Bristol, Indiana along with contract manufacturing in Kansas City, Missouri and Saltillo, Mexico. In addition, as a result of a recent acquisition described below, we now also have facilities in Snyder and Neligh, Nebraska; Delavan, Wisconsin; and a second location in Ephrata, Pennsylvania.  We recently completed a corporate reorganization. On July 1, 2015, our former Spartan Motors Chassis, Inc. subsidiary (which operated our Charlotte, Michigan location) and our former Crimson Fire Aerials, Inc. subsidiary (which operated our Ephrata, Pennsylvania location) were merged into Spartan USA. On January 1, 2016, our former Utilimaster Corporation subsidiary (which operated our Bristol and Wakarusa, Indiana locations) was also merged into Spartan USA. These transactions were primarily completed in order to consolidate our U.S. operations into a single subsidiary and to simplify our corporate structure.  On January 1, 2017, Spartan USA acquired substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of Smeal Fire Apparatus Co., Smeal Properties, Inc., Ladder Tower Co., and U.S. Tanker Co. When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, " Smeal"� refers to the assets, liabilities, and operations acquired from such entities. The assets acquired consist of the assets used by the former owners of Smeal in the operation of its business designing, manufacturing, and distributing emergency response vehicle bodies and aerial devices for the fire service industry. Smeal has operations in Snyder and Neligh, Nebraska; Delavan, Wisconsin; and Ephrata, Pennsylvania and will be operated as part of our Emergency Response Vehicles segment.  Our Charlotte, Michigan location manufactures heavy duty chassis and vehicles and supplies aftermarket parts and accessories under the Spartan Chassis and Spartan ERV brand names. Our Brandon, South Dakota and Ephrata, Pennsylvania locations manufacture emergency response vehicles under the Spartan ERV brand name, while our Bristol, Indiana location manufactures vehicles used in the parcel delivery, mobile retail and trades and construction industries, and supplies related aftermarket parts and services under the Utilimaster brand name. Our Kansas City, Missouri and Saltillo, Mexico locations sell and install equipment used in fleet vehicles. Spartan USA is also a participant in Spartan-Gimaex Innovations, LLC (" Spartan-Gimaex"�), a 50/50 joint venture with Gimaex Holding, Inc. that was formed to provide emergency response vehicles for the domestic and international markets. Spartan-Gimaex is reported as a consolidated subsidiary of Spartan Motors, Inc. In February 2015, Spartan USA and Gimaex Holding, Inc. mutually agreed to begin discussions regarding the dissolution of the joint venture. In June 2015, Spartan USA and Gimaex Holding, Inc. entered into court proceedings to determine the terms of the dissolution. In February 2017, by agreement of the parties, the court proceeding was dismissed with prejudice and the judge entered an order to this effect as the parties agreed to seek a dissolution plan on their own. No dissolution terms have been determined as of the date of this Form 10-K.  Our business strategy is to further diversify product lines and develop innovative design, engineering and manufacturing expertise in order to be the best value producer of custom vehicle products. Our diversification across several sectors provides numerous opportunities while reducing overall risk. Additionally, our business model provides the agility to quickly respond to market needs, take advantage of strategic opportunities when they arise and correctly size operations to ensure stability and growth.  We have an innovative team focused on building lasting relationships with our customers. This is accomplished by striving to deliver premium custom vehicles, vehicle components, and services. We believe we can best carry out our long-term business plan and obtain optimal financial flexibility by using a combination of borrowings under our credit facilities, as well as internally or externally generated equity capital, as sources of expansion capital.  Executive Overview  ? Revenue of $590.8 million in 2016, compared to $550.4 million in 2015.  ? Gross Margin of 12.3% in 2016, compared to 8.6% in 2015, driven by favorable product mix in 2016.  ? Operating expense of $63.9 million, or 10.8% of sales in 2016, compared to $59.6 million or 10.8% of sales in 2015.  ? Operating income of $8.6 million in 2016, compared to an operating loss of $12.5 million in 2015.  ? Income tax expense of $0.1 million in 2016, compared to $4.9 million in 2015, due to increases in deferred tax asset valuation allowance recorded in 2015.  ? Net income of $8.6 million in 2016, compared to a net loss of $17.0 million in 2015.  ? Earnings per share of $0.25 in 2016, compared to loss of $0.50 in 2015.  ? Operating cash flow of $23.5 million in 2016, compared to $12.9 million in 2015.  ? Order backlog of $249.5 million at December 31, 2016, compared to $270.8 million at December 31, 2015.  The following table shows our sales by market for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 as a percentage of total sales:   2016 2015 2014 Emergency response vehicles 29.7 % 34.0 % 36.4 % Defense vehicles 1.0 % 0.7 % 0.0 % Aftermarket parts and accessories 3.0 % 3.4 % 3.2 % Total government 33.7 % 38.1 % 39.6 % Motor home chassis 16.6 % 18.8 % 17.0 % Fleet vehicles 47.1 % 41.4 % 41.6 % Other vehicles 2.6 % 1.7 % 1.8 % Total business/consumer 66.3 % 61.9 % 60.4 %  We continue to focus on growth by expanding our market share in existing markets, pursuing new commercial opportunities through our alliance with Isuzu and other manufacturers and pursuing strategic acquisitions that enable us to expand into existing or new markets as opportunities occur.  We are well positioned to take advantage of long-term opportunities as a result of:  ? Our diversified business model. We believe the major strength of our business model is market diversity and customization. Our Fleet Vehicles and Specialty Chassis and Vehicles segments serve mainly business and consumer markets, effectively diversifying our company and complementing our Emergency Response Vehicles segment, which primarily serves governmental entities. Additionally, the fleet vehicle market is an early-cycle industry, complementary to the late-cycle emergency response vehicle industry. We intend to continue to pursue additional areas that build on our core competencies in order to further diversify our business.  ? Our acquisition of Smeal, completed in January 2017 which will bring significant scale to our Emergency Response Vehicles segment, expand the geographic reach of our dealer network and add complementary products to our existing emergency response product portfolio.  ? The development of our new facility in Kansas City, Missouri which will support Ford Transit van equipment up-fit operations for our current customer base.  ? Our Spartan Select and 180 truck programs, designed to provide the custom apparatus that emergency response professionals need with unprecedented order-to-delivery cycle times as short as 180 days.  ? Spartan Connected Care, a new mobile application that provides owners of motor homes built on Spartan chassis with instant access to a pre-trip inspection checklist, coach-specific diagnostic codes and an interactive map to locate the closest Spartan authorized service center. Spartan Connected Care also provides notifications of events and rallies where owners can meet with Spartan engineers and service technicians, and participate in training sessions.  ? The introduction of the Velocity, a new delivery vehicle design that combines the productivity of a walk-in van for multi-stop deliveries with the superior fuel economy of the Ford Transit chassis.  ? The expansion of our alliance with Isuzu to include the assembly of Isuzu's new F-Series truck. This expanded relationship demonstrates Isuzu's confidence in Spartan's quality, people, flexibility and expertise and provides another positive example of our successful execution of our multi-year plan for improving performance.  ? The strength of our balance sheet, which includes robust working capital, low debt and access to credit through our revolving line of credit and private shelf agreement.  The following section provides a narrative discussion about our financial condition and results of operations. The comments that follow should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto appearing in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  Results of Operations  The following table sets forth, for the periods indicated, the components of our consolidated statements of income, as a percentage of revenues (percentages may not sum due to rounding):   Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Sales 100.0 100.0 100.0 Cost of products sold 87.7 91.4 89.1 Gross profit 12.3 8.6 10.9 Operating expenses: Research and development 1.1 0.8 0.8 Selling, general and administrative 9.7 10.0 10.4 Operating income (loss) 1.5 (2.3 ) (0.2 ) Other income, net - - - Income (loss) before taxes on income 1.5 (2.3 ) (0.2 ) Income tax expense (benefit) - 0.9 (0.4 ) Net earnings (loss) 1.5 (3.2 ) 0.2 Non-controlling interest - (0.1 ) - Net earnings (loss) attributable to Spartan Motors, Inc. 1.5 (3.1 ) 0.2  During 2016, we recorded restructuring charges of $1.1 million or 0.2% of sales, related to the restructuring of our Emergency Response Vehicles segment operations. During 2015, we recorded restructuring charges of $2.9 million, or 0.5% of sales, related to the restructuring of our Emergency Response Vehicles segment operations and the consolidation of our Ocala, Florida operations into our Charlotte, Michigan and Brandon, South Dakota locations. During 2015, we also recorded a $2.2 million charge for the impairment of certain long-lived assets related to our Emergency Response Vehicles segment. During 2014, we recorded restructuring charges of $2.2 million, or 0.5% of sales, related to the restructuring of our Emergency Response Vehicles segment operations and the consolidation of our Ocala, Florida operations into our Charlotte, Michigan and Brandon, South Dakota locations. During 2014, we also incurred $0.7 million of expense due to changes in the fair value of the contingent liability for earn-out consideration related to our Utilimaster acquisition in 2009.  Year Ended December 31, 2016 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2015  Consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $40.4 million, or 7.3% to $590.8 million from $550.4 million in 2015, driven by a $50.7 million increase in our Fleet Vehicles and Services segment. This increase was partially offset by decreases of $10.2 million in our Emergency Response Vehicles segment and $0.1 million in our Specialty Chassis and Vehicles segment. These changes in revenue are discussed more fully in the discussion of our segments below.  Cost of products sold increased by $14.9 million, or 3.0%, to $518.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $503.3 million in 2015, primarily due to increased sales volume in 2016.  Gross profit increased by $25.4 million, or 53.9%, to $72.5 million in 2016 from $47.1 million in 2015. The increase was mainly due to the higher equipment up-fit and other specialty chassis sales in 2016. Also contributing to the increase was an approximately $4.0 million increase resulting from improved manufacturing performance in our Emergency Response Vehicles segment, along with reductions of $1.7 million in accruals for warranty and recalls, $0.7 million in asset impairment charges and $0.4 million in restructuring charges recorded in 2016 compared to 2015. In addition, we incurred $1.0 million of charges related to the wind-down of our Spartan-Gimaex joint venture in 2015 that did not recur in 2016.  Gross margin increased by 370 basis points to 12.3% in 2016 from 8.6% in 2015, mainly driven by a more favorable product mix resulting from the increase in equipment up-fit and other specialty chassis sales in 2016.  Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $4.3 million, or 7.2%, to $63.9 million from $59.6 million in 2015. Research and development expense increased by $2.2 million in 2016, with approximately equal amounts due to charges incurred for testing related to product recalls in our Emergency Response Vehicles segment, new vehicle development expenses incurred in our Fleet Vehicles and Services segment, and increased engineering management and administrative costs experienced in 2016. Selling, general and administrative expense increased by $3.5 million in 2016 compared to 2015. This increase was due to a $4.4 million increase in incentive compensation in 2016 based on company performance, along with $0.8 million of costs related to the Smeal acquisition that closed on January 1, 2017 and a $0.5 million increase in legal fees in 2016. These increases were partially offset by charges of $1.2 million for asset impairments and $1.0 million for a NHTSA penalty recorded in 2015 that did not recur in 2016. Restructuring charges recorded in 2016 were $1.4 million lower than those recorded in 2015 as the activities related to our Emergency Response Vehicles segment restructuring initiated in 2015 wind down.  Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by $4.8 million to expense of $0.1 million compared to $4.9 million in 2015. Our effective tax rate in 2016 was 1.1% compared to (38.7)% in 2015. Our effective tax rate in 2016 was impacted by a $2.9 million reduction to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a result of the taxable income generated in 2016. Our effective tax rate in 2015 was heavily impacted by an increase in the valuation allowances for various deferred tax assets.  During the year ended December 31, 2015, we recorded an increase to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance, representing the portion of our deferred tax assets, net of the deferred tax liabilities, that, based on an assessment of available positive and negative evidence, may not be realizable in future periods. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we reversed a portion of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a result of the taxable income we generated. We will continue to evaluate whether the valuation allowance is needed in future reporting periods. It is possible that sufficient positive evidence, including sustained profitability, may become available in future periods to allow us to reach a conclusion that all or part of the valuation allowance could be reversed.  Net earnings for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $26.1 million to income of $8.6 million compared to a loss of $17.5 million in 2015. Driving this increase were the increases in gross profit of $25.4 million and decrease of $4.8 million in taxes, which were offset by the $4.3 million increase in operating expenses as discussed above.  Net loss attributable to non-controlling interest consists of the portion of the after-tax loss related to the Spartan-Gimaex joint venture that is attributable to our joint venture partner.  Net earnings attributable to Spartan Motors, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by $25.6 million to income of $8.6 million compared to a loss of $17.0 million in 2015. On a per share basis, net earnings increased by $0.75 to income of $0.25 per share in 2016 compared to a loss of $0.50 per share in 2015, due to the factors discussed above.  Year Ended December 31, 2015 compared to Year Ended December 31, 2014  Consolidated sales for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $43.6 million, or 8.6% to $550.4 million from $506.8 million in 2014, driven by increases of $23.2 million in our Specialty Chassis and Vehicles segment, $17.2 million in our Fleet Vehicles and Services segment and $3.2 million in our Emergency Response Vehicles segment. These changes in revenue are discussed more fully in the discussion of our segments below.  Cost of products sold increased by $51.8 million, or 11.5%, to $503.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2015 from $451.5 million in 2014, primarily due to increased sales volume in 2015.  Gross profit decreased by $8.2 million, or 14.8%, to $47.1 million in 2015 from $55.3 million in 2014. $8.9 million of this decrease was due to higher warranty accruals due to various repair campaigns initiated during 2015 along with higher claims cost data utilized in estimating general warranty reserves in 2015. Additional causes of the decrease include: $3.6 million due to a pricing adjustment on certain motor home chassis enacted in 2015; $1.9 million due to production inefficiencies as a result of the relocation of certain Emergency Response Vehicles operations in 2015; $1.0 million due to impairment charges on certain long-lived assets recorded in 2015; and $0.8 million for an increase in charges related to the wind-down of our Spartan-Gimaex joint venture recorded in 2015. These decreases were partially offset by increases of $1.3 million due to a more favorable product mix in 2015, $6.4 million due to the higher overall sales volumes experienced in 2015 and a $0.3 million reduction in restructuring charges recorded in 2015.  Gross margin decreased by 230 basis points to 8.6% in 2015 from 10.9% in 2014. Higher warranty expense in 2015 accounted for 260 basis points of the decrease. Additional causes of the decrease include: 100 basis points due to competitive pricing adjustments enacted on certain motor home chassis; 50 basis points due to production inefficiencies resulting from the relocation of certain Emergency Response Vehicles operations in 2015; 30 basis points due to asset impairment charges recorded in 2015; and 20 basis points due to an increase in charges related to the wind-down of our Spartan-Gimaex joint venture recorded in 2015. These decreases were partially offset by increases of 180 basis points resulting from the higher overall sales volume in 2015, 40 basis points due to a more favorable product mix in 2015 and 10 basis points due to lower restructuring charges recorded in 2015.  Operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $3.2 million, or 5.7%, to $59.6 million from $56.4 million in 2014. Research and development expense increased by $0.7 million in 2015, mainly due to additional resources devoted to product development projects in our Fleet Vehicles and Services segment. Selling, general and administrative expense increased by $1.5 million in 2015 compared to 2014. $1.2 million of this increase was due to impairment charges on certain long-lived assets of our Emergency Response Vehicles segment recorded in 2015, while an additional $1.0 million of the increase was due to a NHTSA penalty recorded in 2015. These increases were partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease resulting from additional earnout contingency recorded in 2014 that did not recur in 2015. We also recorded an additional $1.0 million of restructuring charges, related to our Emergency and Response Vehicles segment, in 2015 in excess of the amount recorded in 2014.  Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2015 increased by $7.0 million to expense of $4.9 million compared to a benefit of $2.1 million in 2014, mainly due to an increase in a deferred tax asset valuation allowance that was recorded in 2015. Our effective tax rate in 2015 was (38.7)% compared to 195.8% in 2014. Our effective tax rate in 2015 was heavily impacted by an increase in the valuation allowances for various deferred tax assets, while our effective tax rate in 2014 was heavily impacted by the reduction of valuation allowances related to state tax net operating loss carry forwards as a result of our subsidiary legal entity reorganization and adjustments to unrecognized tax benefits.  During the year ended December 31, 2015 we recorded an increase to our deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $5.1 million, representing the portion of our deferred tax assets, net of the deferred tax liabilities, that, based on an assessment of available positive and negative evidence, may not be realizable in future periods. We will continue to evaluate whether the valuation allowance is needed in future reporting periods. It is possible that sufficient positive evidence, including sustained profitability, may become available in future periods to allow us to reach a conclusion that all or part of the valuation allowance could be reversed.  Net earnings (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $18.5 million to a loss of $17.5 million compared to income of $1.0 million in 2014. Driving this decrease were the decreases of gross profit of $8.2 million and increases of $3.2 million in operating expense and $7.0 million in taxes discussed above.  Net loss attributable to non-controlling interest of $0.5 million in 2015 consists of the portion of the after-tax loss related to the Spartan-Gimaex joint venture that is attributable to our joint venture partner. This loss is mainly attributable to reserves recorded during 2015 to adjust certain inventory items to their fair market value at December 31, 2015.  Net earnings (loss) attributable to Spartan Motors, Inc. for the year ended December 31, 2015 decreased by $18.2 million to a loss of $17.0 million compared to earnings of $1.2 million in 2014. On a per share basis, net earnings (loss) decreased by $0.53 to a loss of $0.50 per share in 2015 from earnings of $0.03 per share in 2014, due to the factors discussed above.  Our Segments  We identify our reportable segments based on our management structure and the financial data utilized by our chief operating decision makers to assess segment performance and allocate resources among our operating units. We have three reportable segments: Emergency Response Vehicles, Fleet Vehicles and Services, and Specialty Chassis and Vehicles.  The Emergency Response Vehicles segment consists of the emergency response chassis operations at our Charlotte, Michigan location and our operations at our Brandon, South Dakota and Ephrata, Pennsylvania locations, along with our Spartan-Gimaex joint venture. In addition, as a result of our recent acquisition of Smeal, this segment now also has operations in Snyder and Neligh, Nebraska; Delavan, Wisconsin; and a second facility in Ephrata, Pennsylvania. This segment engineers and manufactures emergency response chassis and vehicles and distributes related aftermarket parts and accessories.  The Fleet Vehicles and Services segment consists of our operations at our Bristol, Indiana location and focuses on designing and manufacturing walk-in vans for the parcel delivery, mobile retail, and trades and construction industries, and supplies related aftermarket parts and services under the Utilimaster brand name.  The Specialty Chassis and Vehicles segment consists of our Charlotte, Michigan operations that engineer and manufacture motor home chassis, defense vehicles and other specialty chassis and distribute related aftermarket parts and accessories.  As a result of a realignment of our operating segments completed during the second quarter of 2016, aftermarket parts and accessories related to emergency response vehicles, which were formerly reported under the Specialty Chassis and Vehicles segment, are now included in the Emergency Response Vehicles segment. Segment results from 2015 and 2014 are shown reflecting the change. Appropriate expense amounts are allocated to the three reportable segments and are included in their reported operating income or loss.  For certain financial information related to each segment, see Note 16, Business Segments, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements appearing in Item 8 of this Form 10-K.  Emergency Response Vehicles Segment Financial Data (Dollars in Thousands) Year Ended December 31, 2016 2015 2014 Amount Percentage Amount Percentage Amount Percentage Sales $ 182,981 100.0 % $ 193,220 100.0 % $ 190,003 100.0 % Operating loss $ (13,660 ) -7.5 % $ (23,722 ) -12.3 % $ (6,280 ) -3.3 % Segment assets $ 77,887 $ 76,030 $ 81,748  Year ended December 31, 2016 compared to year ended December 31, 2015  Sales in our Emergency Response Vehicles segment decreased by $10.2 million, or 5.3%, from 2015 to 2016. A $23.2 million sales decrease due to lower unit volume was partially offset by a $13.0 million sales increase due to the product mix sold in 2016, which included fewer low content fire trucks. International sales accounted for 13.5% of revenue in our Emergency Response Vehicles segment in 2016. There were no significant changes in the pricing of the products in our Emergency Response Vehicles segment during 2016.  Operating loss in the segment decreased by $10.0 million, or 42.2%, from 2015 to 2016. $4.0 million of the decrease was due to improved manufacturing performance, largely accomplished through the production outsourcing of lower priced units. Higher asset impairments recorded in 2015 accounted for $1.8 million of the decrease, while $1.6 million was due to lower warranty costs in 2016 resulting from various repair campaigns and higher overall warranty accruals recorded in 2015. $0.9 million of the decrease was due to reduced selling expenses in 2016, mainly resulting from headcount reductions, while $0.7 million of the decrease was due to the NHTSA fine incurred in 2015 that did not recur in 2016 and $1.8 million of the decrease was due to reduced restructuring charges incurred in 2016. These decreases were partially offset by a $0.7 . . .  Mar 03, 2017  (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc. All Rights Reserved

ANY ROAD. ANY RESCUE. ALWAYS SPARTAN.
The road to rescues is changing. New technologies and increasing demands on productivity and safety are putting even more pressure on getting the rig right the first time. Spartan understands these changing needs, and is looking ahead with agile designs, enhanced safety features and a focus on building trucks faster and more reliably than ever before.
Our legacy of chassis expertise means your apparatus is built from the ground up on a foundation ready to handle your specific response equipment and route needs. We work with you to strategically configure your truck’s specs into a design that represents the best possible mix of safety, speed, agility, ergonomics, and serviceability. And we don’t stop once the truck is delivered. For over thirty years, Spartan has remained staunchly committed to training service technicians across the country on how to quickly and efficiently service and maintain rigs to last, so firefighters can reliably keep fighting the good fight.





Stock Units

When it comes to emergency response, there’s no time to waste. Spartan has reinvented apparatus manufacturing to get a head start on building customized rigs. See if one might work for you.

            Hey there! Are you maybe looking for Firebase instead?

            







    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

22 GB gzip250 GB uncompressed

Download



The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF
<http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/g.11vjz1ynm> <http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/measurement_unit.dated_percentage.date> "2001-02"^^<http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#gYearMonth>  .

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.




Total triples: 63 million

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

2013 Spartan Gladiator with Evolution fascia


Spartan Motors, Inc. (NASDAQ: SPAR) is an American automobile design company that designs, engineers and manufactures specialty chassis, specialty vehicles, truck bodies and aftermarket parts for the recreational vehicle (RV), emergency response, government services, defense, and delivery and service markets. The company is based in Charlotte, Michigan, and employs approximately 1,800 workers at facilities in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nebraska, South Dakota, Indiana and Florida. Spartan reported sales of $471 million in 2012. It was started in 1976 by Charles Robert McManamey[1][2] and a group of individuals whose employer, Diamond Reo, went bankrupt.[3]

Active subsidiaries[edit]
Spartan Chassis, Inc.[edit]
Spartan Chassis is involved in the engineering, manufacturing and marketing of chassis and aftermarket parts for emergency-response, recreational vehicle (RV), defense and specialty vehicles. Spartan Chassis' beginnings date back to 1975 when the Diamond Reo Trucking Company of Michigan went bankrupt. A group of four young Diamond Reo engineers saw an opportunity to strike out on their own and continue doing what they loved to do—build trucks—and build them well. George Sztykiel, Bill Foster, Jerry Geary and John Knox sacrificed everything they could to establish Spartan Motors, Inc.; taking out second mortgages on their homes for capital and pinching every penny to make their endeavor successful.[citation needed]

Spartan Emergency Response Vehicles[edit]
Spartan Emergency Response Vehicles (Spartan ERV) is a manufacturer of custom fire trucks and other rescue vehicles. Spartan ERV manufactures pumpers, tankers, rescues, aerials, quick-attack/urban interface vehicles and other emergency-rescue vehicles from its facilities in Florida, Pennsylvania and South Dakota. After several years of supplying chassis for fire trucks, Spartan acquired fire apparatus body manufacturers Luverne and Quality Manufacturing in the mid-1990s. Luverne used its early expertise in the automotive and heavy truck industries to begin building fire apparatus in 1912. Quality got its start six decades later, catering to the Southern firefighting market. In 2003, Luverne and Quality were consolidated under the names Crimson Fire and Crimson Fire Aerials. In 2012, these units were consolidated again to become Spartan ERV. Customers of Spartan ERV include, but are not limited to the Buffalo Fire Department, Chicago Fire Department, Dallas Fire Department and San Francisco Fire Department. There have also been several deliveries to fire services in Canada, Peru, Chile and China.

Utilimaster Corp.[edit]
Utilimaster Corporation is a manufacturer of walk-in vans and commercial truck bodies for the delivery and service marketplace. Utilimaster designs, develops and manufactures products to customer specifications for use in the package delivery, one-way truck rental, bakery/snack delivery, utility and linen/uniform rental businesses. The company serves a diverse customer base and also sells aftermarket parts and accessories. It was founded in 1973 in Wakarusa, Indiana. Previously owned by Holiday Rambler and then Harley-Davidson, it was later acquired by senior management along with an investment group led by Kirkland Messina in 1996. In November 2009, it was purchased by Spartan Motors.

Active subsidiaries[edit]
Spartan Chassis, Inc.[edit]
Spartan Chassis is involved in the engineering, manufacturing and marketing of chassis and aftermarket parts for emergency-response, recreational vehicle (RV), defense and specialty vehicles. Spartan Chassis' beginnings date back to 1975 when the Diamond Reo Trucking Company of Michigan went bankrupt. A group of four young Diamond Reo engineers saw an opportunity to strike out on their own and continue doing what they loved to do—build trucks—and build them well. George Sztykiel, Bill Foster, Jerry Geary and John Knox sacrificed everything they could to establish Spartan Motors, Inc.; taking out second mortgages on their homes for capital and pinching every penny to make their endeavor successful.[citation needed]

Spartan Emergency Response Vehicles[edit]
Spartan Emergency Response Vehicles (Spartan ERV) is a manufacturer of custom fire trucks and other rescue vehicles. Spartan ERV manufactures pumpers, tankers, rescues, aerials, quick-attack/urban interface vehicles and other emergency-rescue vehicles from its facilities in Florida, Pennsylvania and South Dakota. After several years of supplying chassis for fire trucks, Spartan acquired fire apparatus body manufacturers Luverne and Quality Manufacturing in the mid-1990s. Luverne used its early expertise in the automotive and heavy truck industries to begin building fire apparatus in 1912. Quality got its start six decades later, catering to the Southern firefighting market. In 2003, Luverne and Quality were consolidated under the names Crimson Fire and Crimson Fire Aerials. In 2012, these units were consolidated again to become Spartan ERV. Customers of Spartan ERV include, but are not limited to the Buffalo Fire Department, Chicago Fire Department, Dallas Fire Department and San Francisco Fire Department. There have also been several deliveries to fire services in Canada, Peru, Chile and China.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

Our story
At Spartan Motors, understanding and planning for the road ahead is our business. Financial pressures are intensifying, budgets are tightening and productivity must be continually increased. At the same time, new technologies are forcing everyone to reconfigure old models and customize better and faster in order to stay competitive with relevant products. In today’s rapidly changing environment, companies are vulnerable unless they can offer better value, a new solution and more productivity.
At Spartan Motors, we understand that better than most. In our 41-year history, we’ve had to adjust to a changing climate as well. As one the largest vehicle-specific engineering, manufacturing, assembly, and service companies in the world, we challenge ourselves to know more, offer more, and apply more, so our customers get more. Our driving philosophy is to always improve our customers’ end game, and we charge every person who works here to contribute to that goal as well.
At Spartan Motors, we strategize about the road our customers travel and the challenges they face.  We innovate for them, we engineer for them, we customize for them, and we service for them. We believe that our customers’ road is our road, and our focus is on the sole goal of helping them command it.

Our core values


Spartan motors core values
Honesty & Integrity

Spartans road to success is paved with the honesty and integrity of our people. How we interact with team members, partners, customers, vendors, and others reflects directly on our company and who we are as people. We owe it to our shareholders, our brand, and ourselves to behave ethically, to be upfront with those we work with, and to be proud of what were building together.
Do whats right every time.



Spartan motors core values
Accountability

The road to a better Spartan runs through YOU. That means accepting responsibility for your actions, your performance and outcomes, and expecting the same from other team members. Passing the buck, ignoring problems, or turning a blind eye to issues or inconsistencies doesnt help you, co-workers, or our company.
Own it.



Spartan motors core values
Trust

We must trust one another to do whats right, alert others when something is wrong, and push to continuously improve our product, process, and our company. Being trustworthy earns us the right to speak our minds and do whats best for the business, our customers, and our shareholders, without questioning our integrity.
With trust comes empowerment.



Spartan motors core values
Performance Excellence

The road to continuous improvement relies on individuals with specific roles that work together to make our end product and our companys path forward the best it can be. Always asking how we can make the performance of our department, our lines, and ourselves more effective. Lets work every day to ensure that Spartan delivers products that pave the way to better rescues, better adventures, and better efficiencies for those we serve.
Improving never ends.











Principles of a Lean Culture

To accomplish our mission, Spartan Motors believes that certain principles should be practiced by all Spartan Motors Associates.

Why spartan?







Out maneuver. Outlast. Outperform.
The road to better adventures runs through Spartan.
Riding on the industry’s best Class A motorhome chassis means something more. From a superior ride to better handling, coach owners who choose a Spartan chassis can “feel the difference” from the first time they take the wheel. RVs riding on Spartan chassis offer a smoother, safer ride, because we selectively source materials and component parts from the very best suppliers. We work hand-in-hand with our coach manufacturer OEMs to build the highest quality, longest lasting Class A chassis on the market, that retain their value, owner after owner.
More Access. Better Service. Broader Support.
We consider our network of owners to be a part of our family. That’s why we do what it takes to ensure our support and service network are accessible no matter where, no matter when. In fact, with hundreds of authorized service centers across North America, no matter how far your travels have taken you from home base, the Spartan support network is never more than a phone call or a click away, and is available 24/7/365.
