Flowers Foods' Voluntary Employee Separation Incentive Plan Amid Restructuring

 (RTTNews.com) - Flowers Foods, Inc. ( FLO ), a producer of fresh packaged bakery foods, announced Monday a voluntary employee separation incentive plan or VSIP as part of its effort to restructure, streamline operations, and better position the company for profitable growth.
The VSIP is available to certain salaried employees who meet certain defined age, length-of-service, and business function criteria. Employees who elect the VSIP will receive enhanced separation benefits. The VSIP is expected to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2017.
The company said it is unable to estimate cost of the program as it is not known at present which employees will elect to participate in the VSIP. The cost will consist primarily of employee severance and benefits-related costs.
Earlier this year, Flowers announced an enhanced organizational structure focused on the company's strategic objectives of brand growth and innovation, enhanced accountability, cost and complexity reductions, and a strengthened long-term strategy.
The changes result from Project Centennial, an extensive operational review and multiyear plan to improve the company's performance.

Flowers Foods Announces Voluntary Employee Separation Incentive Plan
PR Newswire






THOMASVILLE, Ga., July 17, 2017


 THOMASVILLE, Ga., July 17, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Flowers Foods, Inc. (NYSE: FLO) today announced a voluntary employee separation incentive plan (VSIP) as part of its effort to restructure, streamline operations, and better position the company for profitable growth. The VSIP is available to certain salaried employees who meet certain defined age, length-of-service, and business function criteria. Employees who elect the VSIP will receive enhanced separation benefits. The VSIP is expected to be substantially completed by the end of fiscal 2017.
Currently, it is not known which employees will elect to participate in the VSIP, so the company is unable to estimate cost, which will consist primarily of employee severance and benefits-related costs. An estimate of the amount or range of costs and benefit will be provided when a good faith determination can be made, which is expected to be in the third quarter of 2017.
Earlier this year, Flowers announced an enhanced organizational structure focused on the company's strategic objectives of brand growth and innovation, enhanced accountability, cost and complexity reductions, and a strengthened long-term strategy. The changes result from Project Centennial, an extensive operational review and multiyear plan to improve the company's performance.

(NYSE: FLO) is one of the largest producers of fresh packaged bakery foods in the United States with 2016 sales of $3.9 billion.

  Forward-Looking Statements  Statements contained in this press release that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking statements relate to current expectations regarding the expected timing of the completion of the VSIP, the expected cost of the VSIP and the expected benefits of the VSIP and are often identified by the use of words and phrases such as "anticipate," "believe," "continue," "could," "estimate," "expect," "intend," "may," "plan," "predict," "project," "should," "will," "would," "is likely to," "is expected to" or "will continue," or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology. All forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from those projected.  Other factors that may cause actual results to differ from the forward-looking statements contained in this release and that may affect the company's prospects in general include, but are not limited to, (a) the impact of the level and timing of employee participation in the VSIP on separation costs, (b) competitive conditions in the baked foods industry, including promotional and price competition, (c) changes in consumer demand for our products, including changes in consumer behavior, trends and preferences, including health and whole grain trends, and the movement toward more inexpensive store-branded products, (d) the success of productivity improvements and new product introductions, (e) a significant reduction in business with any of our major customers including a reduction from adverse developments in any of our customer's business, (f) fluctuations in commodity pricing, (g) energy and raw material costs and availability and hedging and counterparty risk, (h) our ability to fully integrate recent acquisitions into our business, (i) our ability to achieve cash flow from capital expenditures and acquisitions and the availability of new acquisitions that build shareholder value, (j) consolidation within the baking industry and related industries, (k) disruptions in our direct-store delivery system, including litigation or an adverse ruling from a court or regulatory or government body that could affect the independent contractor classification of our independent distributors, and (l) the failure of our information technology systems to perform adequately, including any interruptions, intrusions or security breaches of such systems.  The foregoing list of important factors does not include all such factors, nor necessarily present them in order of importance.  In addition, you should consult other disclosures made by the company, including the risk factors included in our most recently filed Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and disclosures made in other filings with the SEC and company press releases, for other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those projected by the company.  We caution you not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, as they speak only as of the date made and are inherently uncertain.  The company undertakes no obligation to publicly revise or update such statements, except as required by law.

US fresh bread value sales have flat-lined so far in 2017, but there are some rising stars, IRI data for the 52 weeks, ending June 11, 2017 shows.
 


 
The 120-year old former Irish co-op Aryzta experienced a whopping 7.6% increase in retail sales over the period, while Sara Lea maker Grupo Bimbo and Dave’s Killer Bread producer Flowers Foods continued to shine in the sector, each noting a 2.2% rise in retail sales.However, there was not much change in the overall bakery sector, with a mere 0.1% rise to $13.31bn from the year prior, according to IRI data.Unit sales dropped -0.4% to just more than 5.7bn units, while price rose a nominal $0.01 to an average price of $2.31.Top selling bakery categories (excluding sweet baked goods)Source: IRI 52w/3 June 11, 2017.

Changing tastes and other challenges  


Bread endures as a staple of the US diet, although consumers are eating it less frequently and in smaller quantities.Changing nutrition trends has negatively impacted US bread production over the past five years.Market researcher Mintel said consumers generally have a negative health image of bread

Soft startCompounding this, the industry has faced volatile input costs – especially from wheat and sugar – and rising competition.According to Allen Shiver, CEO of Dave’s Killer Breads producer, Flower Foods, the bakery market remains highly competitive “as retailers and bakers finds a balance between improving margins and building market share”.Alfred Penny, president of Bimbo Bakeries USA, concurred, stating during Grupo Bimbo’s Q1 2017 earnings call that the industry has definitely experienced a soft start to the year.Armed with IRI data for the 52 weeks, ending June 11, 2017, BakeryandSnacks examined retail sales performance of the largest suppliers in key bread sectors (excluding sweet baked goods) of the US market in 2017 so far.Mexican conglomerate Grupo Bimbo continued to dominate the entire sector, claiming the number one spot in several sub-categories; and no less than third or fourth position in others.Flowers Foods followed, along with Campbell Soup, General Mills, United States Bakery and Lewis Bakeries.Top 10 US suppliers of other fresh rolls, buns and croissantsSource: IRI 52w/3 June 11, 2017.

Dive Brief:

Flowers Foods said in a statement it will offer buyouts to salaried employees who meet certain defined age, length-of-service and business function criteria. The effort is part of the bread and snack maker's plan to "restructure, streamline operations, and better position the company for profitable growth."
The initiative is expected to be largely completed by the end of this year. Flowers Foods does not know how many employees will participate, but expects to have an estimate before October.
Earlier this year, Flowers announced it would split the company into fresh bakery and specialty snacking, and realign key leadership roles to help grow its brands, reduce costs and strengthen the company's long-term strategy.















Dive Insight:
Flowers Foods did not provide many details in its buyout announcement, but the plan is the latest step in the company's broader effort to cut costs and improve the firm's financial position. In June, Flowers launched Project Centennial, a five-year plan to strengthen its competitive position and drive profitable revenue growth.
As part of that initiative, the company announced in May it would separate the business into two units. The bakery business, which includes Nature’s Own, Wonder and Dave’s Killer Bread, will focus on driving brand growth and profitability through incremental innovation, execution and cost-efficiency.
The snacking and specialty section, which includes the items outside of the bread aisle such as Tastykake and Mrs. Freshley's, will drive brand growth and profitability using new product innovation and building scale in growing categories. It appears the company is positioning much of its future growth by tapping into consumers' interest in snacking. Flowers could even consider acquiring another company or brand to help boost this side of the business. The buyouts announced Monday could be part of its snacking focus.
During its most recent earnings report, Flowers reported sales decreased 0.9% from the prior year. It noted that the company expects sales for its fiscal year to be in the lower end of its previously provided range of $3.927 billion to $4.006 billion, representing growth of approximately 0% to 2%. 
"During the first quarter, with Dave's Killer Bread, Nature's Own and Wonder, we gained share in our key segments of the bread category," Allen Shiver, Flowers Foods president and CEO, said in a statement in May. "We also delivered lower production costs as a percentage of sales, the result of investments in capacity and improved manufacturing efficiencies."
The improvement in the company's manufacturing operations, coupled with slumping sales that missed its own projections, place it in a good position for this move. While Flowers remains solidly profitable, it's smart for the bread and snack maker to tweak its business by seeking voluntary buyouts from some of its longer-tenured employees, who tend to earn more money and have larger benefits. The change may help the company better align itself with the current operating environment.

Flowers Foods, headquartered in Thomasville, Georgia, is a producer and marketer of packaged bakery foods in the United States. The company operates 46 bakeries that produce breads, buns, rolls, snack cakes, pastries, and tortillas. The company’s products are sold regionally through a direct store delivery network that encompasses the East, South, and Southwest, and are sold nationwide via delivery to retailers' warehouses.[1]
Flowers Foods has two operating segments. The Direct Store Delivery (DSD) Segment handles fresh breads, buns, rolls, and snack cakes that are sold regionally through a network of independent distributors. The company is continually expanding its market reach through acquisitions and by stretching its current territory. Flowers’ Warehouse Segment is responsible for the national distribution of frozen snack cakes and breads and rolls that are sold direct to customers' warehouses. Flowers' Mrs. Freshley's brand of snack cakes is available nationally to retail and vending customers through this segment, as is the European Bakers' brand of frozen specialty breads and rolls, which is available nationally to retail in-store bakeries and foodservice customers.[2]

In 1919, brothers William Howard and Joseph Hampton Flowers opened Flowers Baking Company in Thomasville, Georgia.[3] In 1944, Flowers became the 6th bakery in the U.S. to franchise Quality Bakers of America’s Sunbeam brand and Little Miss Sunbeam for its white bread.
In 1968, the company became Flowers Industries, and began trading over-the-counter. Less than a year later, Flowers was listed on the American Stock Exchange. In 1982, the company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol FLO.
In the mid-1990s, Flowers acquired the Keebler Company and Mrs. Smith's Pies. In 2001, Flowers sold its investment in Keebler to the Kellogg Company and delivered $1.24 billion to its shareholders.[citation needed] Flowers’ remaining business units, Flowers Bakeries and Mrs. Smith’s Bakeries, were then spun off into a new company called Flowers Foods. In 2003, Flowers Foods sold its Mrs. Smith’s frozen dessert business to the Schwan Food Company.
21st century acquisitions[edit]
On October 25, 2002, Flowers bought out Ideal Baking Company including one bakery in Batesville, AR. Ideal serves north Arkansas, southern Missouri, and the Memphis, TN market.[4]
In December 2002, Flowers Foods bought Bishop Baking Company from Kelloggs Company. The sale includes the bakery in Cleveland, TN.[5]
On September 21, 2005, Flowers Foods closed on the purchase of Royal Cake Company for $10 Million (USD). Flowers will continue to operate the Winston-Salem, NC bakery.[6]
In 2008, Flowers acquired ButterKrust Bakery in Lakeland, Florida, and acquired Holsum Bakery in Phoenix.[7][8]
In 2009, Flowers Foods purchased Leo's Foods.[9]
In 2011, Tastykake was acquired.[10]
In 2012, Sara Lee and Earthgrains in California and Earthgrains in Oklahoma City were bought from Bimbo Bakeries.[11]
In 2013, Flowers Foods entered into an agreement to purchase most of the bread brands of Hostess Brands, including Wonder Bread.[12][13]
In 2015, Flowers Foods purchased Dave's Killer Bread of Milwaukie, Oregon for $275 million in cash. [14]

History[edit]




Main bakery in Thomasville, Georgia







This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (June 2009) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


In 1919, brothers William Howard and Joseph Hampton Flowers opened Flowers Baking Company in Thomasville, Georgia.[3] In 1944, Flowers became the 6th bakery in the U.S. to franchise Quality Bakers of America’s Sunbeam brand and Little Miss Sunbeam for its white bread.
In 1968, the company became Flowers Industries, and began trading over-the-counter. Less than a year later, Flowers was listed on the American Stock Exchange. In 1982, the company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol FLO.
In the mid-1990s, Flowers acquired the Keebler Company and Mrs. Smith's Pies. In 2001, Flowers sold its investment in Keebler to the Kellogg Company and delivered $1.24 billion to its shareholders.[citation needed] Flowers’ remaining business units, Flowers Bakeries and Mrs. Smith’s Bakeries, were then spun off into a new company called Flowers Foods. In 2003, Flowers Foods sold its Mrs. Smith’s frozen dessert business to the Schwan Food Company.
21st century acquisitions[edit]
On October 25, 2002, Flowers bought out Ideal Baking Company including one bakery in Batesville, AR. Ideal serves north Arkansas, southern Missouri, and the Memphis, TN market.[4]
In December 2002, Flowers Foods bought Bishop Baking Company from Kelloggs Company. The sale includes the bakery in Cleveland, TN.[5]
On September 21, 2005, Flowers Foods closed on the purchase of Royal Cake Company for $10 Million (USD). Flowers will continue to operate the Winston-Salem, NC bakery.[6]
In 2008, Flowers acquired ButterKrust Bakery in Lakeland, Florida, and acquired Holsum Bakery in Phoenix.[7][8]
In 2009, Flowers Foods purchased Leo's Foods.[9]
In 2011, Tastykake was acquired.[10]
In 2012, Sara Lee and Earthgrains in California and Earthgrains in Oklahoma City were bought from Bimbo Bakeries.[11]
In 2013, Flowers Foods entered into an agreement to purchase most of the bread brands of Hostess Brands, including Wonder Bread.[12][13]
In 2015, Flowers Foods purchased Dave's Killer Bread of Milwaukie, Oregon for $275 million in cash. [14]

Flowers Foods, headquartered in Thomasville, Georgia, is a producer and marketer of packaged bakery foods in the United States.

Main bakery in Thomasville, Georgia







This section needs additional citations for verification. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. (June 2009) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)


In 1919, brothers William Howard and Joseph Hampton Flowers opened Flowers Baking Company in Thomasville, Georgia.[3] In 1944, Flowers became the 6th bakery in the U.S. to franchise Quality Bakers of America’s Sunbeam brand and Little Miss Sunbeam for its white bread.
In 1968, the company became Flowers Industries, and began trading over-the-counter. Less than a year later, Flowers was listed on the American Stock Exchange. In 1982, the company listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol FLO.
In the mid-1990s, Flowers acquired the Keebler Company and Mrs. Smith's Pies. In 2001, Flowers sold its investment in Keebler to the Kellogg Company and delivered $1.24 billion to its shareholders.[citation needed] Flowers’ remaining business units, Flowers Bakeries and Mrs. Smith’s Bakeries, were then spun off into a new company called Flowers Foods. In 2003, Flowers Foods sold its Mrs. Smith’s frozen dessert business to the Schwan Food Company.
21st century acquisitions[edit]
On October 25, 2002, Flowers bought out Ideal Baking Company including one bakery in Batesville, AR. Ideal serves north Arkansas, southern Missouri, and the Memphis, TN market.[4]
In December 2002, Flowers Foods bought Bishop Baking Company from Kelloggs Company. The sale includes the bakery in Cleveland, TN.[5]
On September 21, 2005, Flowers Foods closed on the purchase of Royal Cake Company for $10 Million (USD). Flowers will continue to operate the Winston-Salem, NC bakery.[6]
In 2008, Flowers acquired ButterKrust Bakery in Lakeland, Florida, and acquired Holsum Bakery in Phoenix.[7][8]
In 2009, Flowers Foods purchased Leo's Foods.[9]
In 2011, Tastykake was acquired.[10]
In 2012, Sara Lee and Earthgrains in California and Earthgrains in Oklahoma City were bought from Bimbo Bakeries.[11]
In 2013, Flowers Foods entered into an agreement to purchase most of the bread brands of Hostess Brands, including Wonder Bread.[12][13]
In 2015, Flowers Foods purchased Dave's Killer Bread of Milwaukie, Oregon for $275 million in cash. [14]

The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.

This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
