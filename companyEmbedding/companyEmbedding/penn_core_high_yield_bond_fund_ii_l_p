				Morningstar rated the U.S. High Yield Fund among 
591,
591,
N/A
and 
N/A
High Yield Bond
funds for the overall rating and the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (as applicable) 
ending 05/31/2017, respectively.


The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance 
figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The 
weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year 
rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating 
for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most 
weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is 
included in all three rating periods.
			

Performance Comparison
as of 
					
						06/30/2017
					
				







							This chart shows the value of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund over the past 10 years or since its inception (for funds lacking 10-year records). The result is compared with benchmarks, which may include a broad-based market index and a peer group average or index. Market indexes do not include expenses, which are deducted from fund returns as well as mutual fund averages and indexes.
						
Benchmark Definitions



1 The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, 
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at 
least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for 
comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation 
in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent 
performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 
35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating 
for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, 
and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of 
total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 
five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating 
formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest 
impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

				Current performance may be lower or higher than the quoted past performance, which cannot guarantee future results. 
Share price, principal value, yield and return will vary and you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.   
			


2 The 30-day dividend yield represents the average daily dividends for the 
30-day period, annualized and divided by the net asset values per share 
at the end of the period; it is available the first quarter after the 
fund's inception.  The SEC standardized yield is computed under an SEC 
standardized formula and reflects an estimated yield to maturity 
(assuming all portfolio securities are held to maturity); it is 
available the first month after the fund's inception.  
			

3 The Fund commenced operations on May 19, 2017.Performance prior to that date reflects the performance of the Class A of the Predecessor Fund.
Predecessor Fund performance reflects its actual operating expense at the time and was not adjusted to reflect the impact of the Fund's current fees.
Since inception returns are shown from the inception date of the Predecessor Fund, April 30, 2013.  
			

4 
					 
					
					Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions. 
For funds less than one year old, the Since Inception return figure is not annualized and represents an aggregate total return.
				


				The U.S. High Yield Fund charges a 2% 
redemption fee on shares held 90 days or less. 
The performance information shown does not reflect the deduction of the redemption fee; 
if it did, the performance would be lower.
			

^ The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's 
prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. 
The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.
If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net
expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.
	







** The T. Rowe Price US High Yield Fund (�Fund�) commenced operations on May 19, 2017.  At that time, the Fund received all of the assets and liabilities of the Henderson 
High Yield Opportunities Fund (the �Predecessor Fund�) and adopted its performance and accounting history.  
The Fund and the Predecessor Fund have substantially similar investment objectives and strategies.  
The Predecessor Fund was managed by the same portfolio manager as the Fund.

All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal.
*Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 5/31/17, 72 of 106 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

**This chart displays relative risk of each U.S. mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns. Those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart.
Methodology: We evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific risk/return category on an annual basis. A fund is generally placed in a risk/return category based on the 10-year standard deviation of its performance. If a fund is less than 10 years old, the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years. For an Asset Allocation fund with less than 10 years of performance history, sub-strategy returns are used. When a sub-strategy is less than 10 years old, the actual sub-strategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.
Risk return categories overlap; a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories, denoted by a plus (+), is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of T Rowe Price.
When a fund has a cash-like benchmark, denoted by a double plus (++), its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns. If the fund is less than 10 years old, benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full 10-year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate.
All investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal. Standard deviation of returns, a measure of price volatility, is one measure of risk. Please consult the funds’ prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the funds’ risks.

*144 of our 330 mutual funds had a 10-year track record as of 3/31/17 (includes all share classes and excludes funds used in insurance products). 122 of these 144 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 204 of 311 (66%), 175 of 213, 140 of 178 (79%), of T. Rowe Price funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 3/31/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
24 of our 39 Retirement Funds had a 10-year track record as of 3/31/17 (includes all share classes). 23 of these 24 funds beat their Lipper averages for the 10-year period. 38 of 39, 35 of 36, and 35 of 36 of the Retirement Funds outperformed their Lipper average for the 1-, 3-, and 5-year periods ended 3/31/17, respectively. Calculations are based on cumulative total return. Not all funds outperformed for all periods. (Source for data: Lipper Inc.)
Source: Lipper Inc. 168 of 213 funds (excluding institutional and bank institutional funds as defined by Lipper) more than 6 months old had expense ratios below their Lipper averages based on fiscal year-end data available as of 3/31/17.
The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

Finding Income in a Low-Rate World













“Even in a very low interest rate environment, we are able to find companies that can offer significant dividend yields and have some potential for capital appreciation.”
— Joyce Gordon









Joyce E. Gordon
Portfolio Manager

Historically low interest rates have put a damper on income for many investors. CDs, Treasury notes and other guaranteed investments, while once a source of modest income, have lagged over the years. For example, the typical five-year CD interest rate is 0.82%, and the five-year daily treasury yield curve rate is 1.83%.* That means many investors have had to adjust their expectations or look to other, more risky, investments to help them pursue income.

Four Ways to Pursue Income




















Municipal bonds These bonds are issued by local and state governments to raise money for building schools, highways and other public projects. 
Income & risk considerations:  Municipal bonds tend to be lower risk with less potential for income. Tax advantages can make them attractive to investors though, particularly those investors in higher tax brackets.











Investment-grade bonds These bonds are issued by governments, agencies and companies to help them finance their operations.
Income & risk considerations: Investment-grade bonds typically involve low-to-medium risk. Offerings are diverse, with issues that include U.S. Treasuries, mortgage-backed securities, inflation-protected bonds and a wide variety of corporate bonds.

















High-yield bonds Also known as “junk bonds,” these are typically issued by companies that may not have a proven history or are facing financial difficulty. 
Income & risk considerations:  Riskier than other bonds, these investments have the potential for higher yields. Volatility of high-yield bond funds can approach that of stocks, however. 











Dividend-paying stocks Dividends are a way for companies to share earnings with their investors. They’re typically issued by mature companies with steady earnings. 
Income & risk considerations:  Stocks involve the greatest amount of risk and volatility, but they also provide the greatest potential for yield.















Maintaining Your Balance







The average investor needs a mix of stocks and bonds to help balance risk and reward. One way to achieve this balance is through mutual funds. 
“Even in a very low interest rate environment, we are able to find companies that can offer significant dividend yields and have some potential for capital appreciation,” says American Funds portfolio manager Joyce Gordon. “Sectors such as utilities, tobacco, telecom and consumer staples have provided above-average and — in many cases — growing dividends. There are many companies in other industries that should do well in a rising rate environment. A diversified portfolio of these investments can help produce income without taking too much risk.”

 Fixed Income 3.0: How to Approach Bond Portfolios in a Post-Post-Crisis World  





     






It has been eight years since the global financial crisis, but in many ways, the impact is still being felt today — in lackluster economic growth around the world, in negative interest rates in several major economies, and in muted inflationary pressures. In order to build sustainable bond portfolios in today’s environment, it is important to understand how we got here, the structural changes in the global  economy and financial markets that have resulted from the crisis, and the challenges ahead that still need to be addressed.

Quantitative Easing on Turbocharge in Major Economies
In response to the global financial crisis and the muted growth that persists years later, central banks across the globe have aggressively expanded their balance sheets using a range of both traditional and unconventional policy tools. As of the end of June, the combined balance sheets of the U.S. Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and Bank of  Japan totaled over $12.1 trillion — a  283% increase since June 2007. Never before have the balance sheets of the central banks of these major economies  been so inflated.

U.S. Economy: Not an Environment for Aggressive Monetary Policy Tightening
It’s been said, and feared, for years that U.S. interest rates will quickly rise once the Federal Reserve starts to reverse course, resulting in declines in the prices of fixed income securities. Since the infamous “Taper Tantrum” in mid-2013, the Federal Reserve has been carefully trying to step away from the unprecedented easy money policy it has employed since the financial crisis. Yet, the power of the U.S. to  act in isolation has diminished over the past decade.

 American Balanced Fund: Balancing Risk and Reward in Volatile Markets   





     






In recent years, many investors have turned to balanced funds to navigate a challenging market environment. Although the U.S. remains a bright spot in global financial markets, low bond yields have made income generation more difficult while equities on the whole appear fully valued following a sharp run-up since the financial crisis. Managers of balanced funds can more nimbly explore evolving opportunity sets using both allocation and security selection. In this Q&A, three portfolio managers with American Balanced Fund® discuss their investment approach in the current environment

 Fed Rate Decision: Liftoff at Last, but No Cause for Panic  










    











The Federal Reserve has increased interest rates, as it appears confident about the U.S. labor market recovery, domestic inflation expectations and gradual economic recovery outside the U.S.
While the Fed has not laid out its precise path for normalization, it has stressed a careful approach to increasing rates, which may imply that this tightening cycle will be slower than past ones.
Although some areas of the bond market may lag in a rising rate environment, the income investors earn from bonds should benefit from higher yields going forward.
The impact on equities is more mixed, with some sectors benefitting as the economy continues to strengthen and others facing a headwind from higher financing costs.

 Slower Path to Higher Interest Rates  



 Lower for Longer  U.S. interest rates have remained low for extended periods at several junctures in U.S. history  


     



Source: Thomson Reuters Datastream. As of September 30, 2015.








The key question facing U.S. monetary policy is not whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year or next, but how far it can go given mixed economic conditions in the U.S. and intensifying financial pressures around the world.
Many are questioning whether the U.S. economy is strong enough to absorb a meaningful rise in rates — even 100 basis points — over the next couple of years, especially against the backdrop of weakness in Europe and emerging markets.
In the U.S., low inflation, slowing job growth and a strong dollar are the crucial factors that should prompt the central bank to move slower than market expectations.
Overall, we expect U.S. interest rates to remain suppressed for the foreseeable future, especially against the backdrop of cautious and measured Fed policy.

 MARKET COMMENTARY   |  September 2015 
 Fed Rate Decision: Near-Zero For Now, But Higher Soon?  












The Federal Reserve has decided to keep interest rates close to zero, as concern about global economic conditions cast a shadow over an otherwise fairly bright outlook for the U.S. economy.
Looking forward, the Fed is expected to raise rates gradually, and an increase of 0.25%, for example, would be unlikely to have a significant impact on the economy.
Over time, higher interest rates can be beneficial for bond investors, enabling reinvestment in issues offering higher yields.
Rising rates have a varied impact on stocks. Selective investors who emphasize company-specific research should continue to find attractive longer term income and return opportunities.

 The China Syndrome: Meltdown or Recovery Ahead?  



 The Rise and Fall of China’s Stock Market 


     



A powerful rally in Chinese stocks — and a subsequent sharp decline — were driven primarily by government statements and policy measures, including a series of interest rate cuts. China’s central bank cut rates again in late August and eased reserve requirements on banks. 
Source: Wind Financial 







A sharp selloff in China’s stock market, a surprise currency devaluation and a persistent slowdown in economic activity have raised doubts about the ability of the world’s second-largest economy to maintain the hypergrowth levels of the past two decades.
Against this backdrop, economist Stephen Green and China affairs specialist Andrew Dougherty discuss:

The outlook for China’s economy, which remains generally positive over the long term
The origins and potential implications of China’s stock market correction
Segments of the economy that are poised for growth despite an overall slowdown in activity
China’s uneasy shift toward a market-based foreign exchange regime

 Who Wins in a Rising Rate Environment?  



 In a Low-Yield Environment, Income Stocks Remain in Demand 


     



Heading into the sixth year of an equity bull market, U.S. stocks appear expensive in most sectors. Valuations for traditional dividend-paying sectors, including basic materials, consumer staples and utilities, are high both on a relative and an absolute basis. A notable exception is the telecommunications sector, which hasn’t benefited quite as much from the global search for yield. Source: FactSet. As of 5/29/15.







Portfolio manager Hilda Applbaum discusses income investing
With central banks around the world aggressively suppressing interest rates, the challenge of finding reliable income-producing investments has never been greater. Few investors are more familiar with this dilemma than portfolio manager Hilda Applbaum, the principal investment officer of The Income Fund of America®. In this conversation, Hilda shares her perspective on:

Income-oriented investing in a market where the prospect of higher rates looms large
The emerging role of information technology companies as high-quality dividend payers
The sustainability of corporate profits and expectations for P/E expansion

 Oil Price Declines Could Have Far-Reaching Effects  



 It Isn’t Just Shale: Oil Production Growth Is a Global Phenomenon 


     



While U.S. shale has certainly contributed to a steady rise in global supply, non-OPEC supply growth has also been robust in the face of increasing production from Saudi Arabia.
Annual World Oil Production, 1980–2014
Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration. Data for OPEC, Saudia Arabia and World production as of September 30, 2014. Data for U.S. production as of December 16, 2013. U.S. figures for 2013 and 2014 are forecasts.









Analysts and Portfolio Managers Weigh Valuations Amid Ongoing Volatility
In 2014, oil prices posted their largest annual decline since the global financial crisis, losing more than 45% as weaker demand and strong global crude output created a supply glut. The collapse saw prices at a five–year low, battering energy shares — which finished 2014 nearly 13% lower — and weighing heavily on financial markets in oil–exporting countries. In our view:

Oil prices could continue to remain low — and may even continue to decline — before supply–demand imbalances are corrected.
Some oil companies have begun to show signs of better capital discipline, but many have room to improve.
Despite lower prices in the near term, demand fundamentals over the longer term should remain supportive of higher oil prices.
Market declines may provide some attractive entry points for investors.

Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing. 
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds. Bond ratings, which typically range from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D (lowest), are assigned by credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's, Moody's and/or Fitch, as an indication of an issuer's creditworthiness. If agency ratings differ, the security will be considered to have received the highest of those ratings, consistent with the fund's investment policies. Securities in the Unrated category have not been rated by a rating agency; however, the investment adviser performs its own credit analysis and assigns comparable ratings that are used for compliance with fund investment policies. Investments in mortgage-related securities involve additional risks, such as prepayment risk, as more fully described in the prospectus. 
Investing outside the United States involves risks, such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries. 
Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reflect applicable fees and expenses. 


Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus. 
The Capital Group companies manage equity assets through three investment groups. These groups make investment and proxy voting decisions independently. Fixed income investment professionals provide fixed income research and investment management across the Capital organization; however, for securities with equity characteristics, they act solely on behalf of one of the three equity investment groups.

 Is Aggressive Central Bank Intervention Working?  





     






Quantitative Easing on Turbocharge in Major Economies
In response to the global financial crisis and the muted growth that persists years later, central banks across the globe have aggressively expanded their balance sheets using a range of both traditional and unconventional policy tools. As of the end of June, the combined balance sheets of the U.S. Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and Bank of  Japan totaled over $12.1 trillion — a  283% increase since June 2007. Never before have the balance sheets of the central banks of these major economies  been so inflated.

U.S. Economy: Not an Environment for Aggressive Monetary Policy Tightening
It’s been said, and feared, for years that U.S. interest rates will quickly rise once the Federal Reserve starts to reverse course, resulting in declines in the prices of fixed income securities. Since the infamous “Taper Tantrum” in mid-2013, the Federal Reserve has been carefully trying to step away from the unprecedented easy money policy it has employed since the financial crisis. Yet, the power of the U.S. to  act in isolation has diminished over the past decade.

 American Balanced Fund: Balancing Risk and Reward in Volatile Markets   





     






In recent years, many investors have turned to balanced funds to navigate a challenging market environment. Although the U.S. remains a bright spot in global financial markets, low bond yields have made income generation more difficult while equities on the whole appear fully valued following a sharp run-up since the financial crisis. Managers of balanced funds can more nimbly explore evolving opportunity sets using both allocation and security selection. In this Q&A, three portfolio managers with American Balanced Fund® discuss their investment approach in the current environment

 Uncovering Value in Emerging Markets Bonds Amid Political Change and Uneven Growth  





     






Emerging markets bonds have notched big gains in 2016, despite political turmoil and economic setbacks. Though it is difficult to definitively say that the market has turned for the better, portfolio manager Rob Neithart says there are good reasons for investors to feel positive. The yield advantage of emerging markets over developed markets is hard to ignore, and in some cases valuations are as attractive as they’ve been in years.

Investments are not FDIC-insured, nor are they deposits of or guaranteed by a bank or any other entity, so they may lose value.
Investors should carefully consider investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses. This and other important information is contained in the fund prospectuses and summary prospectuses, which can be obtained from a financial professional and should be read carefully before investing. 
The return of principal for bond funds and for funds with significant underlying bond holdings is not guaranteed. Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds. Bond ratings, which typically range from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D (lowest), are assigned by credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's, Moody's and/or Fitch, as an indication of an issuer's creditworthiness. If agency ratings differ, the security will be considered to have received the highest of those ratings, consistent with the fund's investment policies. Securities in the Unrated category have not been rated by a rating agency; however, the investment adviser performs its own credit analysis and assigns comparable ratings that are used for compliance with fund investment policies. Investments in mortgage-related securities involve additional risks, such as prepayment risk, as more fully described in the prospectus. 
Bond ratings, which typically range from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D (lowest), are assigned by credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's, Moody's and/or Fitch, as an indication of an issuer's creditworthiness.
Investing outside the United States involves risks, such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries. 
Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reflect applicable fees and expenses. 


Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus. 
Statements attributed to an individual represent the opinions of that individual as of the date published and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of Capital Group or its affiliates. This information is intended to highlight issues and not to be comprehensive or to provide advice.

Closed the Income Gap®
with Nuveen Closed-End Funds



Closed-End Funds Offer Attractive Income Potential
In the search for increased income opportunities, closed-end funds can be a smart choice. Designed and built for income, closed-end funds seek to provide regular, stable cash flow over time and can serve as a compelling tool for optimizing an income portfolio.

1


Enhance Income and Cash Flow
Because of their unique closed structure and ability to use leverage,2 closed-end funds offer potentially higher distributions3 than traditional income investments.4


2


Manage Interest Rate Risk 
Floating rate, shorter duration or equity closed-end funds may help reduce a portfolio’s interest rate sensitivity.


3


Protect Purchasing Power
Closed-end funds that invest in real assets and dividend-paying stocks, which typically increase their payments with rising inflation, may help buffer the effects of rising inflation.


4


Maximize After-Tax Efficiency
Nuveen offers a wide array of national, state specific and AMT-free municipal closed-end funds that may help reduce your tax liability on investment income.5


5

There is no guarantee that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives. For detailed information on the specific risks associated with each fund, please view the fund overview by clicking on the fund name above.
1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.

Chart Definitions
Income-oriented closed-end funds make payouts largely from interest	and dividends.
Income and capital appreciation funds seek regular cash	flow made up of interest and dividends, with the remainder from capital appreciation or, if necessary, return of capital.
Capital appreciation and income closed-end funds seek cash flow mainly from capital appreciation.
Single-asset-class funds invest primarily in one asset class, which can be used as components in a well-diversified income portfolio.
Pre-packaged combinations are funds featuring multiple asset types, which are designed to work together to diversify fund cash flow risks.

Higher Quality High Yield*
Fallen angel bonds have historically outperformed the broad high yield corporate bond market and the average high yield bond fund manager.

Not All High Yield Bonds are Created Equal
Fallen angels, high yield bonds originally issued as investment grade, are a subset of the high yield bond universe.1 Relative to the broad high yield bond market, fallen angels have had: 


Historically higher concentrations of BB-rated bonds
Outperformance with higher risk-adjusted returns  

Potential to Capture Embedded Value
Fallen angel high yield bond outperformance can be attributed to an embedded value proposition that is not common to the original-issue high yield bond market.
Historically, fallen angels: 


Tend to be issued by larger, more established companies
Have a higher rate of upgrades to investment grade2 
Offer a contrarian approach to invest in bonds exposed to heavy selling

On June 30, 2017 ANGL received a five star Morningstar rating on a three year and overall basis among 590 funds in the high yield bond category. For each fund with at least a three-year history,  Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating based on a Morningstar  Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly  performance (including the effects of sales charges, loads, and redemption  fees), placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent  performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the  next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5%  receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted  as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may  cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.) The Overall  Morningstar Rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the  performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if  applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. 
                                          
∗, 1         Historically higher average credit quality and risk-adjusted returns than the broad high yield bond universe, when comparing BofA Merrill Lynch US Fallen Angel High Yield Index and BofA Merrill Lynch US High Yield Index.  BofA Merrill Lynch composite ratings are simple averages of ratings from Moody’s, S&P, and Fitch and are not intended to be a credit opinion. Risk-adjusted returns are measured by Sharpe ratio, which is a statistical measure of the excess return of a portfolio over a risk-free rate of return (as found with a U.S. Treasury security) per unit of the portfolio’s standard deviation of returns.

RISK CONSIDERATIONS: An investment in the Fund may be subject to risk which include, among others, credit risk, call risk, and interest rate risk, all of which may adversely affect the Fund. High yield bonds may be subject to greater risk of loss of income and principal and are likely to be more sensitive to adverse economic changes than higher rated securities. International investing involves additional risks which include greater market volatility, the availability of less reliable financial information, higher transactional and custody costs, taxation by foreign governments, decreased market liquidity and political instability. The Fund’s assets may be concentrated in a particular sector and may be subject to more risk than investments in a diverse group of sectors.

Fund shares are not individually redeemable and will be issued and redeemed at their "Net Asset Value" (NAV) only through certain authorized broker-dealers in large, specified blocks of shares called "creation units" and otherwise can be bought and sold only through exchange trading. Creation units are issued and redeemed principally in kind. Shares may trade at a premium or discount to their NAV in the secondary market.
The NAV of a VanEck Vectors exchange-traded fund (ETF) is determined at the close of each business day, and represents the U.S. dollar value of one share of the fund; it is calculated by taking the total assets of the fund, subtracting total liabilities, and dividing by the total number of shares outstanding. The NAV is not necessarily the same as the ETF’s intraday trading value. Total returns are based upon closing “market price” (price) of the ETF on the dates listed. VanEck Vectors ETF investors should not expect to buy or sell shares at NAV.
Investing involves substantial risk and high volatility, including possible loss of principal. An investor should consider the investment objective, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund carefully before investing.

				Morningstar rated the U.S. High Yield Fund among 
591,
591,
N/A
and 
N/A
High Yield Bond
funds for the overall rating and the 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods (as applicable) 
ending 05/31/2017, respectively.


The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance 
figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The 
weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year 
rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating 
for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most 
weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is 
included in all three rating periods.
			

Performance Comparison
as of

							This chart shows the value of a hypothetical $10,000 investment in the fund over the past 10 years or since its inception (for funds lacking 10-year records). The result is compared with benchmarks, which may include a broad-based market index and a peer group average or index. Market indexes do not include expenses, which are deducted from fund returns as well as mutual fund averages and indexes.
						
Benchmark Definitions



1 The Morningstar Rating for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, 
variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at 
least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for 
comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation 
in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent 
performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 
35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating 
for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, 
and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of 
total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% 
five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating 
formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest 
impact because it is included in all three rating periods.

2 The 30-day dividend yield represents the average daily dividends for the 
30-day period, annualized and divided by the net asset values per share 
at the end of the period; it is available the first quarter after the 
fund's inception.  The SEC standardized yield is computed under an SEC 
standardized formula and reflects an estimated yield to maturity 
(assuming all portfolio securities are held to maturity); it is 
available the first month after the fund's inception.  
			

3 The Fund commenced operations on May 19, 2017.Performance prior to that date reflects the performance of the Class A of the Predecessor Fund.
Predecessor Fund performance reflects its actual operating expense at the time and was not adjusted to reflect the impact of the Fund's current fees.
Since inception returns are shown from the inception date of the Predecessor Fund, April 30, 2013.

					Average annual total return figures include changes in principal value, reinvested dividends, and capital gain distributions. 
For funds less than one year old, the Since Inception return figure is not annualized and represents an aggregate total return.
				


				The U.S. High Yield Fund charges a 2% 
redemption fee on shares held 90 days or less. 
The performance information shown does not reflect the deduction of the redemption fee; 
if it did, the performance would be lower.
			

^ The gross expense ratio reflects the fund expenses as stated in the fee table of the fund's 
prospectus prior to the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement. 
The net expense ratio reflects fund expenses after the deduction of any waiver or reimbursement.
If a fund has an active contractual expense ratio limitation, the expiration date is shown below the gross and net
expense ratio values above.  Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus.

All mutual funds are subject to market risk, including possible loss of principal.
*Morningstar gives its best ratings of 5 or 4 stars to the top 32.5% of all funds (of the 32.5%, 10% get 5 stars and 22.5% get 4 stars) based on their risk-adjusted returns. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with a fund's 3-, 5-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. As of 5/31/17, 72 of 106 of our rated funds (Investor class only) received an overall rating of 5 or 4 stars.
The Morningstar RatingTM for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for funds with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star.

**This chart displays relative risk of each U.S. mutual fund listed using standard deviation of returns. Those values are provided in the bars at the top of the chart.
Methodology: We evaluate the standard deviation and its resulting placement within a specific risk/return category on an annual basis. A fund is generally placed in a risk/return category based on the 10-year standard deviation of its performance. If a fund is less than 10 years old, the actual fund performance history is supplemented with the primary prospectus benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years. For an Asset Allocation fund with less than 10 years of performance history, sub-strategy returns are used. When a sub-strategy is less than 10 years old, the actual sub-strategy performance history is supplemented with benchmark history to obtain a full 10-year history, or longest time period available up to 10 years.
Risk return categories overlap; a fund with a standard deviation in the overlap between two categories, denoted by a plus (+), is placed so that its risk categorization is better aligned with anticipated return characteristics an investor may experience going forward at the discretion of T Rowe Price.
When a fund has a cash-like benchmark, denoted by a double plus (++), its standard deviation is estimated using only available fund returns. If the fund is less than 10 years old, benchmark returns are not used to obtain a full 10-year history because they would artificially suppress the volatility estimate.
All investments are subject to market risk, including the possible loss of principal. Standard deviation of returns, a measure of price volatility, is one measure of risk. Please consult the funds’ prospectuses for a more complete discussion of the funds’ risks.

The principal value of the Retirement Funds is not guaranteed at any time, including at or after the target date, which is the approximate year an investor plans to retire (assumed to be age 65) and likely stop making new investments in the fund. If an investor plans to retire significantly earlier or later than age 65, the funds may not be an appropriate investment even if the investor is retiring on or near the target date. The funds’ allocations among a broad range of underlying T. Rowe Price stock and bond funds will change over time. The funds emphasize potential capital appreciation during the early phases of retirement asset accumulation, balance the need for appreciation with the need for income as retirement approaches, and focus on supporting an income stream over a long-term postretirement withdrawal horizon. The funds are not designed for a lump-sum redemption at the target date and do not guarantee a particular level of income. The funds maintain a substantial allocation to equities both prior to and after the target date, which can result in greater volatility over shorter time horizons.

Finding Income in a Low-Rate World













“Even in a very low interest rate environment, we are able to find companies that can offer significant dividend yields and have some potential for capital appreciation.”
— Joyce Gordon









Joyce E. Gordon
Portfolio Manager
Los Angeles office 36 years of experience (as of 12/31/16) 
            








Historically low interest rates have put a damper on income for many investors. CDs, Treasury notes and other guaranteed investments, while once a source of modest income, have lagged over the years. For example, the typical five-year CD interest rate is 0.82%, and the five-year daily treasury yield curve rate is 1.83%.* That means many investors have had to adjust their expectations or look to other, more risky, investments to help them pursue income.
*Weekly CD rates analysis as of November 30, 2016, Bankrate.com. Five-year daily treasury yield curve as of November 30, 2016, U.S. Department of the Treasury.









Rates Aren’t What They Used to Be












 2000 






 2008 






 2017 



















5.43% U.S. Federal Funds Rate











4.11% U.S. Federal Funds Rate











0.66% U.S. Federal Funds Rate












 Source: Federal Reserve. Rates as of first business day of each year.


















 Rates Could Stay Lower for Longer  In the past, extended periods of low rates have been common  





    





Sources: Federal Reserve, Robert Shiller, Thomson Reuters Datastream. Data for 1876–1961 represents average monthly U.S. long-term government bond yields compiled by Robert Shiller. Data for 1962–2015 represents 10–year Treasury yields, as of December 31 each year within the period. Data for 2016 is as of September 30.










Four Ways to Pursue Income




















Municipal bonds These bonds are issued by local and state governments to raise money for building schools, highways and other public projects. 
Income & risk considerations:  Municipal bonds tend to be lower risk with less potential for income. Tax advantages can make them attractive to investors though, particularly those investors in higher tax brackets.











Investment-grade bonds These bonds are issued by governments, agencies and companies to help them finance their operations.
Income & risk considerations: Investment-grade bonds typically involve low-to-medium risk. Offerings are diverse, with issues that include U.S. Treasuries, mortgage-backed securities, inflation-protected bonds and a wide variety of corporate bonds.

















High-yield bonds Also known as “junk bonds,” these are typically issued by companies that may not have a proven history or are facing financial difficulty. 
Income & risk considerations:  Riskier than other bonds, these investments have the potential for higher yields. Volatility of high-yield bond funds can approach that of stocks, however. 











Dividend-paying stocks Dividends are a way for companies to share earnings with their investors. They’re typically issued by mature companies with steady earnings. 
Income & risk considerations:  Stocks involve the greatest amount of risk and volatility, but they also provide the greatest potential for yield.















Maintaining Your Balance







The average investor needs a mix of stocks and bonds to help balance risk and reward. One way to achieve this balance is through mutual funds. 
“Even in a very low interest rate environment, we are able to find companies that can offer significant dividend yields and have some potential for capital appreciation,” says American Funds portfolio manager Joyce Gordon. “Sectors such as utilities, tobacco, telecom and consumer staples have provided above-average and — in many cases — growing dividends. There are many companies in other industries that should do well in a rising rate environment. A diversified portfolio of these investments can help produce income without taking too much risk.”

 Fixed Income 3.0: How to Approach Bond Portfolios in a Post-Post-Crisis World  





     






It has been eight years since the global financial crisis, but in many ways, the impact is still being felt today — in lackluster economic growth around the world, in negative interest rates in several major economies, and in muted inflationary pressures. In order to build sustainable bond portfolios in today’s environment, it is important to understand how we got here, the structural changes in the global  economy and financial markets that have resulted from the crisis, and the challenges ahead that still need to be addressed.

Quantitative Easing on Turbocharge in Major Economies
In response to the global financial crisis and the muted growth that persists years later, central banks across the globe have aggressively expanded their balance sheets using a range of both traditional and unconventional policy tools. As of the end of June, the combined balance sheets of the U.S. Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and Bank of  Japan totaled over $12.1 trillion — a  283% increase since June 2007. Never before have the balance sheets of the central banks of these major economies  been so inflated.

U.S. Economy: Not an Environment for Aggressive Monetary Policy Tightening
It’s been said, and feared, for years that U.S. interest rates will quickly rise once the Federal Reserve starts to reverse course, resulting in declines in the prices of fixed income securities. Since the infamous “Taper Tantrum” in mid-2013, the Federal Reserve has been carefully trying to step away from the unprecedented easy money policy it has employed since the financial crisis. Yet, the power of the U.S. to  act in isolation has diminished over the past decade.

In recent years, many investors have turned to balanced funds to navigate a challenging market environment. Although the U.S. remains a bright spot in global financial markets, low bond yields have made income generation more difficult while equities on the whole appear fully valued following a sharp run-up since the financial crisis. Managers of balanced funds can more nimbly explore evolving opportunity sets using both allocation and security selection. In this Q&A, three portfolio managers with American Balanced Fund® discuss their investment approach in the current environment

 Fed Rate Decision: Liftoff at Last, but No Cause for Panic  










    











The Federal Reserve has increased interest rates, as it appears confident about the U.S. labor market recovery, domestic inflation expectations and gradual economic recovery outside the U.S.
While the Fed has not laid out its precise path for normalization, it has stressed a careful approach to increasing rates, which may imply that this tightening cycle will be slower than past ones.
Although some areas of the bond market may lag in a rising rate environment, the income investors earn from bonds should benefit from higher yields going forward.
The impact on equities is more mixed, with some sectors benefitting as the economy continues to strengthen and others facing a headwind from higher financing costs.

 Slower Path to Higher Interest Rates  



 Lower for Longer  U.S. interest rates have remained low for extended periods at several junctures in U.S. history  


     



Source: Thomson Reuters Datastream. As of September 30, 2015.








The key question facing U.S. monetary policy is not whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates this year or next, but how far it can go given mixed economic conditions in the U.S. and intensifying financial pressures around the world.
Many are questioning whether the U.S. economy is strong enough to absorb a meaningful rise in rates — even 100 basis points — over the next couple of years, especially against the backdrop of weakness in Europe and emerging markets.
In the U.S., low inflation, slowing job growth and a strong dollar are the crucial factors that should prompt the central bank to move slower than market expectations.
Overall, we expect U.S. interest rates to remain suppressed for the foreseeable future, especially against the backdrop of cautious and measured Fed policy.

 MARKET COMMENTARY   |  September 2015 
 Fed Rate Decision: Near-Zero For Now, But Higher Soon?  












The Federal Reserve has decided to keep interest rates close to zero, as concern about global economic conditions cast a shadow over an otherwise fairly bright outlook for the U.S. economy.
Looking forward, the Fed is expected to raise rates gradually, and an increase of 0.25%, for example, would be unlikely to have a significant impact on the economy.
Over time, higher interest rates can be beneficial for bond investors, enabling reinvestment in issues offering higher yields.
Rising rates have a varied impact on stocks. Selective investors who emphasize company-specific research should continue to find attractive longer term income and return opportunities.

 The China Syndrome: Meltdown or Recovery Ahead?  



 The Rise and Fall of China’s Stock Market 


     



A powerful rally in Chinese stocks — and a subsequent sharp decline — were driven primarily by government statements and policy measures, including a series of interest rate cuts. China’s central bank cut rates again in late August and eased reserve requirements on banks. 
Source: Wind Financial 







A sharp selloff in China’s stock market, a surprise currency devaluation and a persistent slowdown in economic activity have raised doubts about the ability of the world’s second-largest economy to maintain the hypergrowth levels of the past two decades.
Against this backdrop, economist Stephen Green and China affairs specialist Andrew Dougherty discuss:

The outlook for China’s economy, which remains generally positive over the long term
The origins and potential implications of China’s stock market correction
Segments of the economy that are poised for growth despite an overall slowdown in activity
China’s uneasy shift toward a market-based foreign exchange regime

 In a Low-Yield Environment, Income Stocks Remain in Demand 


     



Heading into the sixth year of an equity bull market, U.S. stocks appear expensive in most sectors. Valuations for traditional dividend-paying sectors, including basic materials, consumer staples and utilities, are high both on a relative and an absolute basis. A notable exception is the telecommunications sector, which hasn’t benefited quite as much from the global search for yield. Source: FactSet. As of 5/29/15.







Portfolio manager Hilda Applbaum discusses income investing
With central banks around the world aggressively suppressing interest rates, the challenge of finding reliable income-producing investments has never been greater. Few investors are more familiar with this dilemma than portfolio manager Hilda Applbaum, the principal investment officer of The Income Fund of America®. In this conversation, Hilda shares her perspective on:

Income-oriented investing in a market where the prospect of higher rates looms large
The emerging role of information technology companies as high-quality dividend payers
The sustainability of corporate profits and expectations for P/E expansion
Finding income opportunities in an aging bull market

 Oil Price Declines Could Have Far-Reaching Effects  



 It Isn’t Just Shale: Oil Production Growth Is a Global Phenomenon 


     



While U.S. shale has certainly contributed to a steady rise in global supply, non-OPEC supply growth has also been robust in the face of increasing production from Saudi Arabia.
Annual World Oil Production, 1980–2014
Source: U.S. Energy Information Administration. Data for OPEC, Saudia Arabia and World production as of September 30, 2014. Data for U.S. production as of December 16, 2013. U.S. figures for 2013 and 2014 are forecasts.









Analysts and Portfolio Managers Weigh Valuations Amid Ongoing Volatility
In 2014, oil prices posted their largest annual decline since the global financial crisis, losing more than 45% as weaker demand and strong global crude output created a supply glut. The collapse saw prices at a five–year low, battering energy shares — which finished 2014 nearly 13% lower — and weighing heavily on financial markets in oil–exporting countries. In our view:

Oil prices could continue to remain low — and may even continue to decline — before supply–demand imbalances are corrected.
Some oil companies have begun to show signs of better capital discipline, but many have room to improve.
Despite lower prices in the near term, demand fundamentals over the longer term should remain supportive of higher oil prices.
Market declines may provide some attractive entry points for investors.

Fund shares are subject to the same interest rate, inflation and credit risks associated with the underlying bond holdings. Lower rated bonds are subject to greater fluctuations in value and risk of loss of income and principal than higher rated bonds. Bond ratings, which typically range from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D (lowest), are assigned by credit rating agencies such as Standard & Poor's, Moody's and/or Fitch, as an indication of an issuer's creditworthiness. If agency ratings differ, the security will be considered to have received the highest of those ratings, consistent with the fund's investment policies. Securities in the Unrated category have not been rated by a rating agency; however, the investment adviser performs its own credit analysis and assigns comparable ratings that are used for compliance with fund investment policies. Investments in mortgage-related securities involve additional risks, such as prepayment risk, as more fully described in the prospectus. 
Investing outside the United States involves risks, such as currency fluctuations, periods of illiquidity and price volatility, as more fully described in the prospectus. These risks may be heightened in connection with investments in developing countries. 
Investment results assume all distributions are reinvested and reflect applicable fees and expenses. 


Expense ratios are as of the most recent prospectus. 
The Capital Group companies manage equity assets through three investment groups. These groups make investment and proxy voting decisions independently. Fixed income investment professionals provide fixed income research and investment management across the Capital organization; however, for securities with equity characteristics, they act solely on behalf of one of the three equity investment groups. 
Statements attributed to an individual represent the opinions of that individual as of the date published and do not necessarily reflect the opinions of Capital Group or its affiliates. This information is intended to highlight issues and not to be comprehensive or to provide advice. 
Past results are not predictive of results in future periods.

 INVESTMENT INSIGHTS   |  January 2017  |  FEATURING Joyce E. Gordon 
 Finding Income in a Low-Rate World  





     






Historically low interest rates have put a damper on income for many investors. CDs, Treasury notes and other guaranteed investments, while once a source of modest income, have lagged over the years. For example, the typical five-year CD interest rate is 0.82%, and the five-year daily treasury yield curve rate is 1.83%.* That means many investors have had to adjust their expectations or look to other, more risky, investments to help them pursue income.

 Fixed Income 3.0: How to Approach Bond Portfolios in a Post-Post-Crisis World  





     






It has been eight years since the global financial crisis, but in many ways, the impact is still being felt today — in lackluster economic growth around the world, in negative interest rates in several major economies, and in muted inflationary pressures. In order to build sustainable bond portfolios in today’s environment, it is important to understand how we got here, the structural changes in the global  economy and financial markets that have resulted from the crisis, and the challenges ahead that still need to be addressed.

 Is Aggressive Central Bank Intervention Working?  





     






Quantitative Easing on Turbocharge in Major Economies
In response to the global financial crisis and the muted growth that persists years later, central banks across the globe have aggressively expanded their balance sheets using a range of both traditional and unconventional policy tools. As of the end of June, the combined balance sheets of the U.S. Federal Reserve, European Central Bank and Bank of  Japan totaled over $12.1 trillion — a  283% increase since June 2007. Never before have the balance sheets of the central banks of these major economies  been so inflated.

U.S. Economy: Not an Environment for Aggressive Monetary Policy Tightening
It’s been said, and feared, for years that U.S. interest rates will quickly rise once the Federal Reserve starts to reverse course, resulting in declines in the prices of fixed income securities. Since the infamous “Taper Tantrum” in mid-2013, the Federal Reserve has been carefully trying to step away from the unprecedented easy money policy it has employed since the financial crisis. Yet, the power of the U.S. to  act in isolation has diminished over the past decade.

 American Balanced Fund: Balancing Risk and Reward in Volatile Markets   





     






In recent years, many investors have turned to balanced funds to navigate a challenging market environment. Although the U.S. remains a bright spot in global financial markets, low bond yields have made income generation more difficult while equities on the whole appear fully valued following a sharp run-up since the financial crisis. Managers of balanced funds can more nimbly explore evolving opportunity sets using both allocation and security selection. In this Q&A, three portfolio managers with American Balanced Fund® discuss their investment approach in the current environment

 Uncovering Value in Emerging Markets Bonds Amid Political Change and Uneven Growth  





     






Emerging markets bonds have notched big gains in 2016, despite political turmoil and economic setbacks. Though it is difficult to definitively say that the market has turned for the better, portfolio manager Rob Neithart says there are good reasons for investors to feel positive. The yield advantage of emerging markets over developed markets is hard to ignore, and in some cases valuations are as attractive as they’ve been in years.

Closed the Income Gap®
with Nuveen Closed-End Funds



Closed-End Funds Offer Attractive Income Potential
In the search for increased income opportunities, closed-end funds can be a smart choice. Designed and built for income, closed-end funds seek to provide regular, stable cash flow over time and can serve as a compelling tool for optimizing an income portfolio.
Consider closed-end funds if you’re seeking to:1


1


Enhance Income and Cash Flow
Because of their unique closed structure and ability to use leverage,2 closed-end funds offer potentially higher distributions3 than traditional income investments.4


2


Manage Interest Rate Risk 
Floating rate, shorter duration or equity closed-end funds may help reduce a portfolio’s interest rate sensitivity.


3


Protect Purchasing Power
Closed-end funds that invest in real assets and dividend-paying stocks, which typically increase their payments with rising inflation, may help buffer the effects of rising inflation.


4


Maximize After-Tax Efficiency
Nuveen offers a wide array of national, state specific and AMT-free municipal closed-end funds that may help reduce your tax liability on investment income.5


5


Improve Diversification
With strategies that provide access to specialized asset classes, including alternatives, Nuveen closed-end funds may enhance portfolio diversification.

There is no guarantee that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives. For detailed information on the specific risks associated with each fund, please view the fund overview by clicking on the fund name above.
1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.

Chart Definitions
Income-oriented closed-end funds make payouts largely from interest	and dividends.
Income and capital appreciation funds seek regular cash	flow made up of interest and dividends, with the remainder from capital appreciation or, if necessary, return of capital.
Capital appreciation and income closed-end funds seek cash flow mainly from capital appreciation.
Single-asset-class funds invest primarily in one asset class, which can be used as components in a well-diversified income portfolio.
Pre-packaged combinations are funds featuring multiple asset types, which are designed to work together to diversify fund cash flow risks.

Closed the Income Gap®
with Nuveen Closed-End Funds



Closed-End Funds Offer Attractive Income Potential
In the search for increased income opportunities, closed-end funds can be a smart choice. Designed and built for income, closed-end funds seek to provide regular, stable cash flow over time and can serve as a compelling tool for optimizing an income portfolio.
Consider closed-end funds if you’re seeking to:1


1


Enhance Income and Cash Flow
Because of their unique closed structure and ability to use leverage,2 closed-end funds offer potentially higher distributions3 than traditional income investments.4


2


Manage Interest Rate Risk 
Floating rate, shorter duration or equity closed-end funds may help reduce a portfolio’s interest rate sensitivity.


3


Protect Purchasing Power
Closed-end funds that invest in real assets and dividend-paying stocks, which typically increase their payments with rising inflation, may help buffer the effects of rising inflation.


4


Maximize After-Tax Efficiency
Nuveen offers a wide array of national, state specific and AMT-free municipal closed-end funds that may help reduce your tax liability on investment income.5


5


Improve Diversification
With strategies that provide access to specialized asset classes, including alternatives, Nuveen closed-end funds may enhance portfolio diversification.

There is no guarantee that any of the funds will achieve their stated objectives. For detailed information on the specific risks associated with each fund, please view the fund overview by clicking on the fund name above.
1 Goal classifications represent common investor concerns when evaluating portfolio needs, are provided for informational purposes only, and are not intended to be relied upon as investment advice or recommendations.
2 Leverage typically magnifies the total return of a fund’s portfolio, whether that return is positive or negative, and creates an opportunity for increased common share net income as well as higher volatility of net asset value, market price, and distributions. There is no assurance that a fund’s leveraging strategy will be successful.
3 Potential distribution sources include net investment income, realized gains and return of capital.  
4 Different types of asset investments have different types of risks, which may provide higher returns but also greater volatility. In general, equity securities tend to be more volatile that fixed income securities. The value of, and income generated by, debt securities will decrease or increase based on changes in market interest rates. As interest rates risk, bond prices fall. In general, below investment grade (high-yield) debt securities tend to be more volatile than investment grade securities. Preferred securities are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a company's capital structure, and therefore are subject to greater credit risk. The interest and principal payments of U.S. Treasury securities are guaranteed.
5 Income may be subject to state and local income taxes and the alternative minimum tax. Capital gains, if any, will be subject to capital gains tax.

The Global Bond Markets Are Changing





The global bond market is undergoing a series of profound changes, challenging the traditional role of income and stability that bonds have played and creating new opportunities. We believe investors should understand these changes and adapt their portfolios to the new fixed-income landscape.











Interest Rates May Challenge Investors
 






Opportunities Exist Across the Globe, Across the Spectrum
 






Divergence in Global Growth
 






Lower Liquidity, May Mean Higher Volatility
 











Can Your Portfolio Keep Up?





We believe investors should consider dynamic and flexible fixed income investments that attempt to neutralize or even benefit from rising interest rates. Investors should also consider strategies that seek value across all sectors of the global fixed income market, allowing them to diversify geographically and take advantage of diverging growth patterns.  Overall investors may prefer highly liquid mutual funds for their long-term investments, not individual bonds, and money market funds for their short-term investments.

Vanguard bond funds


94% of our low-cost bond funds performed better than their peer-group averages over the past 10 years.*




Find income and stability with bond funds
Get higher potential for income



Bond mutual funds give your portfolio the opportunity to earn income, unlike money market funds (which focus on protecting your cash) and stock funds (which aim for long-term growth).

Add stability to your portfolio



When included in a well-balanced portfolio, bond funds can help balance the risks associated with stock funds.

Spread out your exposure to risk



By potentially holding hundreds—sometimes thousands—of bonds in a single fund, you get more diversification than you would buying individual bonds.

Get broad exposure to the bond markets



You can use just a few funds to complete the bond portion of your portfolio. Each of these index funds gives you access to a wide variety of bonds in a single, diversified fund.






Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund holds more than 5,000 domestic investment-grade bonds.

Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund holds about 3,000 non-U.S. bonds.

How to choose a bond fund



There are a few questions to ask yourself while you're considering the right bond fund for your portfolio:

Am I investing outside of an IRA or other retirement account?



If you're in one of the highest tax brackets and investing outside of your retirement account, you may be able to reduce your tax exposure with a tax-exempt bond fund.
Find out if tax-exempt mutual funds are right for you
Cut your federal tax bill with a national tax-exempt fund. Get added state-tax savings if you live in:

				California

				Massachusetts

				New Jersey

				New York

				Ohio

				Pennsylvania


See a list of Vanguard tax-exempt bond funds


Do I want domestic or international bonds?



Investing in both U.S. and international bond funds can add another level of diversification to an already well-balanced portfolio.

How much risk am I comfortable with?



Knowing the general traits used to identify the different bonds within a bond fund can help you determine your overall tolerance for risk.

Average maturity. Bond funds come with short-, intermediate-, or long-term maturities. The longer the maturity, the more sensitive the fund is to changes in interest rates.

Credit quality. Bonds that are backed by the government or one of its agencies have the best "creditworthiness" and a lower chance of default than most corporate bonds. Corporate bonds with high credit quality are considered investment-grade bonds, and those below investment-grade are considered high-yield ("junk") bonds.



Would I prefer index or active funds?



Do you feel more comfortable tracking the market, or would you rather try to beat it?

Index funds try to track the performance of a specific market benchmark.

Actively managed funds are steered by our expert portfolio managers who select specific securities for the fund. While this gives you the chance to beat the benchmark, any actively managed fund could just as easily miss the mark.


Compare index funds vs. actively managed funds


Do I want to keep pace with inflation?



Inflation-protected bond funds invest in government bonds and are routinely adjusted for inflation.

	Bond funds are subject to interest rate risk, which is the chance bond prices overall will decline because of rising interest rates, and credit risk, which is the chance a bond issuer will fail to pay interest and principal in a timely manner or that negative perceptions of the issuer's ability to make such payments will cause the price of that bond to decline. Investments in bonds issued by non-U.S. companies are subject to risks including country/regional risk and currency risk.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
