2 As of 06/30/16, Voya IM assets of $218 billion include proprietary insurance general account assets of $93 billion calculated on a market value basis. Voya IM assets as reported in Voya Financial, Inc. SEC filings, include general account assets valued on a statutory book value basis and total approximately $204 billion.

4 Metrics presented use pre-determined criteria to measure each individual investment product based on its ability to either A) rank above the median of its peer category; or B) outperform its benchmark index on a gross-of-fees basis. Generally speaking, the results for unconstrained, fully-active investment products were based on relevant peer category rankings while those of "enhanced index", rules-based, risk-constrained, or client-specific investment products were based on benchmark-relative performance. Metrics are calculated on an annualized basis and includes mutual funds as well as pooled and separately-managed institutional portfolios that fall within our traditional (long-only) commercial book of business that remain open as of 6/30/16. If terminated and other accounts had been included, results may have differed from that shown. Source of performance returns and peer medians is Voya Investment Management but is based in part on data from Morningstar (mutual funds) and eVestment (institutional composites). Further detailed information regarding these calculations is available upon request.
5 Metrics are based on observations of rolling 3-year annualized returns over the last 30 months, calculated on an annualized, gross-of-fees basis, and includes mutual funds as well as pooled and separately-managed institutional portfolios that fall within our traditional (long-only commercial book of business that remain open as of 06/30/2016. If terminated and other accounts had been included, results may have differed from that shown. Source of performance returns is Voya Investment Management, and further detailed information regarding these calculations is available upon request.

Benefits



Investment Options+

Your clients can choose from over 100 mutual funds offered by more than 30 well-known fund companies – including American Funds, T. Rowe Price, JP Morgan, BlackRock, PIMCO, Ivy Funds, and Oppenheimer, to name a few – all available within one retirement account. We have well-known funds and over 30 funds with an Overall Morningstar Rating of 4 and 5 stars. Your clients can see the progress of their investments on their quarterly statements or by going online. View Fund Information 

Investable Assets+

Designed to accept initial contributions of $5,000 or more, rollovers or transfers from a qualified plan, including a 401(k), 403(b) and governmental 457(b) plan, as well as from other IRAs. SIMPLE IRAs can only accept rollovers from other SIMPLE IRAs. Will accept direct transfers. Rolling a 457(b) to an IRA before age 59½ should be carefully considered. Any amount rolled from a 457(b) to an IRA will become subject to the IRS 10% premature distribution penalty tax. 

Account Types+

Traditional IRA, Roth IRA, SEP IRA, SIMPLE IRA, Traditional Beneficiary Available IRA and Roth Beneficiary IRA. (Beneficiary IRAs are also known as Stretch IRAs or Inherited IRAs.) 

Additional Features+

Dollar Cost Averaging*
Dollar cost averaging (DCA) can help level out the effect of market fluctuation on the cost of an investment when contributions are made to an account on a regular basis. It is a fixed dollar amount that is invested in regular intervals, regardless of price. Available as a 6, 12, or 24-month schedule. DCA does not ensure a profit nor guarantee against loss. Investors should consider their financial ability to continue their purchases through periods of low price levels.
Automatic Asset Rebalancing*
Automatic Asset Rebalancing rebalances your clients’ portfolios back to their original allocation to help them stay in line with their risk tolerance. While rebalancing helps manage your investment allocation, it does not assure a profit or protect against loss in a declining market. Available quarterly, semi-annually, annually.*Dollar Cost Averaging and Automatic Rebalancing cannot be elected simultaneously.

Investment Risks:All investing involves risks of fluctuating prices and the uncertainties of rates of return and yield inherent in investing. High-Yield Securities, or “junk bonds”, are rated lower than investment-grade bonds because there is a greater possibility that the issuer may be unable to make interest and principal payments on those securities. To the extent that the Fund invests in Mortgage-Related Securities, its exposure to prepayment and extension risks may be greater than investments in other fixed-income securities. The Fund may use Derivatives, such as options and futures, which can be illiquid, may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on Fund performance. Foreign Investing does pose special risks including currency fluctuation, economic and political risks not found in investments that are solely domestic. As Interest Rates rise, bond prices fall, reducing the value of the Fund's share price. Other risks of the Fund include but are not limited to: Bank Instruments; Company; Credit; Credit Default Swaps; Currency; Floating Rate Loans; Interest in Loans; Interest Rate; Investment Models; Liquidity; Market; Market Capitalization; Municipal Securities; Other Investment Companies; Prepayment and Extension; Price Volatility; U.S. Government Securities and Obligations; Portfolio Turnover; and Securities Lending Risks. Investors should consult the Fund's Prospectus and Statement of Additional Information for a more detailed discussion of the Fund's risks.The Overall Morningstar risk-adjusted return rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five- and ten-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. Morningstar Ratings are for the A and I share classes only; other classes may have different performance characteristics.For each fund with at least a three-year history, Morningstar calculates a Morningstar Rating™ based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a fund’s monthly performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of funds in each category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. (Each share class is counted as a fraction of one fund within this scale and rated separately, which may cause slight variations in the distribution percentages.)Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of the Fund(s) carefully before investing. For a free copy of the Fund’s prospectus, which contains this and other information, visit us at voyainvestments.com or call Voya Investments Distributor, LLC at (800) 992-0180. Please read the prospectus carefully before investing.Diversification does not guarantee a profit or ensure against market loss.

You should carefully consider the provisions of your current retirement plan and the new product for differences in cost, benefits, surrender charges or other important features before transferring assets.  Consult your legal and tax advisors regarding your individual situation.
You should consider the investment objectives, risks, and charges and expenses of the mutual funds offered through a retirement plan, carefully before investing. The fund prospectuses contain this and other information, which can be obtained by contacting your local representative or calling Voya Financial. Please read the information carefully before investing.
Account values fluctuate with market conditions, and when redeemed the principal may be worth more or less than its original amount.

1The Adviser has contractually agreed to limit expenses of the Fund. This expense limitation agreement excludes interest, taxes, investment-related costs, leverage expenses, and extraordinary expenses and may be subject to possible recoupment. Please see the Fund's prospectus for more information.
					

2The expense limits will continue through at least October 1, 2017. Expenses are being waived to the contractual cap.
					

3The Fund’s Acquired (Underlying) Funds Fees and Expenses are based on a weighted average of the fees and expenses of the Underlying Funds in which it invests. The amount of fees and expenses of the Underlying Funds borne by a Fund will vary based on the Fund’s allocation of assets to, and annualized net expenses of, the particular Underlying Funds during the Fund’s fiscal year.
					

4The Adviser has contractually agreed to waive a portion of the management fee through October 1, 2017.
					


The performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance information shown. The investment return and principal value of an investment in the Portfolio will fluctuate, so that your shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. See above “Average Annual Total Returns %” for performance information current to the most recent month-end. Returns for the other share classes will vary due to different charges and expenses. Performance assumes reinvestment of distributions and does not account for taxes.Total investment return at net asset value has been calculated assuming a purchase at net asset value at the beginning of the period and a sale at net asset value at the end of the period; and assumes reinvestment of dividends, capital gain distributions and return of capital distributions/allocations, if any, in accordance with the provisions of the dividend reinvestment plan. Net asset value equals total Fund assets net of Fund expenses such as operating costs and management fees. Total investment return at net asset value is not annualized for periods less than one year.



Benchmark Disclosures

S&P Target Risk Growth Index
The Standard and Poor's ("S&P") Target Risk Growth Index is a broad-based index that seeks to measure the performance of an asset allocation strategy targeted to a growth-focused risk profile. The index is fully investable, with varying levels of exposure to equities and fixed-income through a family of exchange-traded funds. The index offers increased exposure to equities, while also using some fixed-income exposure to diversify risk. The index returns include the reinvestment of dividends and distributions net of withholding taxes, but do not reflect fees, brokerage commissions, or other expenses. Investors cannot directly invest in an index.




Principal Risks
			All investing involves risks of fluctuating prices and the uncertainties of rates of return and yield inherent in investing. This Fund may be suitable for those with an investment horizon of more than five years. May Allocate Assets to a fund or market that underperforms other asset classes. Foreign Investing does pose special risks including currency fluctuation, economic and political risks not found in investments that are solely domestic. Risks are intensified in Emerging Markets. Risks of the REIT's are similar to those associated with direct ownership of Real Estate, such as changes in real estate values and property taxes, interest rates, cash flow of underlying real estate assets, supply and demand, and the management skill and credit worthiness of the issuer. As Interest Rates rise, bond prices fall, reducing the value of the Fund's share price. High-Yield, Lower-Grade Debt Securities are highly speculative and more volatile. The Fund may select and substitute Underlying Funds and may be subject to potential conflicts of interest based upon the fact that fees paid to Voya Investment Management by some Underlying Funds may be higher than fees paid by other Underlying Funds. Other risks of the Fund include but are not limited to: Credit Risks; Debt Securities Risks; Market Trends Risks; Other Investment Companies' Risks; Price Volatility Risks; and Portfolio Turnover Risks. Investors should consult the Funds' Prospectus and Statements of Additional Information for a more detailed discussion of the Funds' risks.

Prices & Performance



Performance Summary
Daily Prices & Yields



Past performance is no guarantee of future results. The performance quoted represents past performance. Investment return and principal value of an investment will fluctuate, and shares, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Voya Global Equity Portfolio historical performance shown for Class I shares reflects the historical performance of Class S shares for those periods prior to the inception date of Class I (represented by italicized text). Historical performance of Class I shares likely would have been different based on difference in share class expense ratios.
Average annual total returns with sales charge: Returns for Class A sales charge reflect the deduction of the maximum sales charge of: 5.75% for Domestic Equity, Global and International, Real Estate and Asset Allocation Funds; 2.50% for Fixed Income Funds; and 3.00% for Enhanced Index and Principal Protection Funds.
Voya Securitized Credit Fund historical performance shown for Class A and Class I shares reflects the historical performance of Class P shares adjusted to reflect the higher expenses of Class A or Class I, respectively, for periods prior to the inception date of Class A (08/03/2015) and Class I (08/03/2015), and is being shown in italicized text . The Class P, Class A and Class I shares of the Fund would have substantially similar performance because they invest in the same portfolio of securities. However, Class P shares’ performance would be higher than Class A and Class I shares’ performance because of the higher expenses paid by Class A and Class I shares, respectively.
For Voya Target Retirement Fund Series: Historical performance shown for the Voya Target Retirement 2020 – 2055 Funds and the In-Retirement Fund Class A shares reflects the historical performance of Class I shares adjusted to reflect the higher expenses of Class A for periods prior to the inception date of Class A (12/21/2015) and is being shown in italicized text. The Class A and Class I shares of the Fund would have substantially similar performance because they invest in the same portfolio of securities. However, Class I shares’ performance would be higher than Class A shares’ performance because of the higher expenses paid by Class A.
Voya Investment Grade Credit Fund historical performance shown for Class A shares and Class I shares reflects the historical performance of Class SMA shares for periods prior to the inception date of Class A and Class I (represented by italicized text). Historical performance of Class A and Class I shares likely would have been different because of differences in expenses attributable to each share class.
