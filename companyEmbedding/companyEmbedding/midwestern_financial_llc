Linking Our Financial Expertise To Your Future




About our financial advising practice
Midwestern Financial Group (MFG) was founded in 2012 with their office in Iowa City, Iowa. MFG’s objective is to provide financial analysis for individuals, families, and businesses in order to help them make rational and informed decisions about their future.Our process begins with an open conversation with clients as a means of fostering a productive working relationship and learning what goals they want to reach. Once our clients' objectives have been identified we research and provide financial advice tailored specifically to them, whether this is for individuals and families preparing for the future or business owners looking to expand the wealth of their enterprise.To help individuals and families, Midwestern Financial Group provides high-level financial analysis and market research aimed at managing the client’s exposure to financial risks. MFG supports entrepreneurship and serves business owners as the financial arm for other businesses that cannot afford to hire a full-time financial analyst. MFG’s purpose is to facilitate financial decisions that match the short and long-term goals of business owners.An understanding of value creation is a faculty we foster at MFG, believing that successful investing can only come through this awareness. Thus, as investors we recognize growth drivers and translate that analysis into tailored investment strategies that adhere to the needs and objectives of each client.Joseph Jay, founder and CEO of MFG, graduated from the University of Iowa where he earned degrees in Political Science and Finance. After graduation, Joseph began work in the financial sector. He has passed the Series 7 exam, and passed all three levels of the CFA Program on his first attempt. Joseph may be awarded the charter upon completion of the required work experience.













































 About MFG



Midwestern Financial Group (MFG) was originally founded in 2012 and recently restructured to accommodate the merger with Patrick Campbell and his prior firm. MFG’s objective is to provide financial analysis for individuals, families, and businesses in order to help them make rational and informed decisions about their future.Our process begins with an open conversation with clients as a means of fostering a productive working relationship and learning what goals they want to reach. Once our clients' objectives have been identified we research and provide financial advice tailored specifically to them, whether this is for individuals and families preparing for the future or business owners looking to expand the wealth of their enterprise.To help individuals and families, Midwestern Financial Group provides high-level financial analysis and market research aimed at managing the client’s exposure to financial risks. MFG supports entrepreneurship and serves business owners as the financial arm for other businesses that cannot afford to hire a full-time financial analyst. MFG’s purpose is to facilitate financial decisions that match the short and long-term goals of business owners.An understanding of value creation is a faculty we foster at MFG, believing that successful investing can only come through this awareness. Thus, as investors we recognize growth drivers and translate that analysis into tailored investment strategies that adhere to the needs and objectives of each client.About Us
