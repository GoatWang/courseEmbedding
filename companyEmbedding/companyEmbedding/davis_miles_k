"This painterly masterpiece is one of the most important, influential and 
popular albums in jazz. At the time it was made, Kind of Blue was also a 
revolution all its own. Turning his back on standard chord progressions, 
trumpeter Miles Davis used modal scales as a starting point for composition and 
improvisation  breaking new ground with warmth, subtlety and understatement in 
the thick of hard bop." - www.rollingstone.com
