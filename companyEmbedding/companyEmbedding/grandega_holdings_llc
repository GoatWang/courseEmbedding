Added Mike Burroughs, now VP of IS and Digital Marketing, “I believe VRP will benefit greatly from the additional financial and operational resources HPH will provide. We are very excited about the growth potential of our new, combined business.” 
HPH’s direct-to-consumer team now combines some of the very best national talent in the industry across the catalog and digital marketing space with over a century of cumulative experience in direct-to-consumer marketing, hundreds of thousands of active customers, and over 400 unique supplement formulations to serve them. 
This is the second acquisition in the past 10 months for Health Products Holdings as it continues to aggressively strengthen capabilities and expand its branded product portfolio across different areas of the nutritional supplements market, covering a broad portfolio of products across all channels.
