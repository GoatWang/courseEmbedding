      ■ Alberto Weisser was appointed chief executive officer of Bunge in
      January 1999 and was elected chairman of the board in May 2001. He had
      joined Bunge in July 1993 as its chief financial officer and had been
      elected to the board of directors in 1995. During his years with Bunge,
      Weisser helped to expand the conservative, once family-owned agribusiness
      company through numerous key acquisitions, including its largest
      acquisition of the French agribusiness company Cereol in 2003. Though the
      name Bunge is scarcely known to the average American, its raw foods go
      into many well-known and popular brands, including products made by
      General Mills, Frito-Lay, Kellogg Company, and Nestlé.
    

      DUTCH FOUNDER
    

      In 1818 Johann Peter Gottlieb Bunge, a Dutch grain trader, founded Bunge
      in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, as a grain-trading business. The company
      grew to become a leading commodity-trading company within the
      consumer/noncyclical sector of the food-processing industry. The
      company's headquarters was eventually moved south to Rotterdam; in
      1859 it relocated still further south to Antwerp, Belgium. Bunge later
      made a major move to Buenos Aires, Argentina, and still later to Sao
      Paulo, Brazil, in both of which countries it capitalized on the rapidly
      growing grain trade.
    

      Over the next century descendants of the Bunge founder built a thriving
      international business, expanding into North America, Asia, and Australia.
      However, the talented but oldfashioned family management team could not
      compete against the world's emerging multinational corporations.
      Also, the team could not appease the feuding factions of family
      shareholders and could not deal with the changing political climate in
      South America. To save the company, outside management was
      recruited—Alberto Weisser was a part of that influx.
    

      BEFORE BUNGE
    

      Weisser earned a bachelor's degree in business administration from
      the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil and participated in several
      postgraduate programs at the Harvard Business School in Cambridge,
      Massachusetts. He also attended the Management Development Program at
      INSEAD in Cedex, France. Before his relationship with Bunge, Weisser
      worked for 15 years, from 1979 to 1993, in various finance-related
      positions with the German petrochemicals giant BASF in Brazil, Germany,
      the United States, and Mexico.
    

      In 1990, with the global marketplace expanding after physical and
      ideological barriers were broken down at the end of the Cold War, the
      family-owned Bunge changed its general strategies in order to have access
      to more financial capital and to end the bickering that continued between
      family members. Professional management was brought in beginning in 1992,
      and the company prepared itself to become a publicly traded company in
      order to gain access to equity markets. Weisser joined Bunge in July 1993
      as its chief financial officer.
    

      DIRECTING FINANCIAL CHANGE
    

      Weisser immediately began to focus Bunge on agribusiness and food
      production while divesting the company of noncore assets. To emphasize the
      trading of soybeans, grain, and fertilizer, Weisser directed the sale of
      all of the company's consumer food-processing firms, except Bunge
      Alimentos in Brazil, which dealt with soybeans and margarine.
    

      In 1999 Weisser—who had become chairman of the board and chief
      executive officer—moved the company to White Plains, New York, in
      order to be closer to New York City, the center of international finance
      and trade. In August 2001 Weisser listed the now publicly traded Bunge on
      the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BG.
    

      Weisser concentrated on three principles that he felt would best sharpen
      the company's focus within the agribusiness industry. Knowing that
      Bunge needed to grow in order to survive and prosper, he carefully
      acquired companies that matched Bunge's strategic plan; he reduced
      expenses; and he emphasized efficiency. Weisser coordinated ocean
      shipments more concertedly to allow for intermediate pick-up and drop-off
      spots along any particular route, and he implemented the backhauling of
      cargo to its point of origination in order to save costs. Weisser also
      helped to consolidate the company into three main divisions: agribusiness,
      food products, and fertilizers. Integration across the company helped
      Bunge to take advantage of the synergies among these divisions; the
      resulting cohesion made Bunge an efficient, low-cost
      operator—Weisser's original intent.
    

      AGRIBUSINESS
    

      Bunge's agribusiness division was its largest, accounting for about
      78 percent of sales. The division comprised three subdivisions: grain
      origination, soybean production/oilseed processing, and international
      marketing. Weisser helped Bunge to develop processes in which commodities
      such as soybeans and other oilseeds, grown primarily in North and South
      America, were processed as animal feed, food products, and vegetable oil
      in the Americas and in Europe. These operations were about equally divided
      between North America, South America, and Europe, providing a continuous
      supply of raw and processed oilseeds in all locations. Bunge Global
      Markets—the international sales and marketing subdivision within
      agribusiness—sold commodities throughout the world, including in
      the largest growth markets: the European Union, China, and India. It
      operated 21 offices in 18 countries in Asia, Europe, and the Americas in
      order to provide worldwide coverage to all of the major oil consumption
      markets.
    

      FOOD PRODUCTS
    

      The production of shortenings, edible oils, mayonnaise, and baked goods
      made up the majority of operations within Bunge's food-products
      division. Its subdivisions were origination, processing, and global
      logistics. The food-products division used raw materials and processed
      products from the agribusiness division to reduce overall external
      procurement and logistics costs. Weisser developed this ability to the
      point where almost three-quarters of the raw materials used to manufacture
      these products were sourced from within Bunge's network.
    

      With better quality control in place due to the company's ability
      to track foods through the entire production process, Weisser concluded
      that food retailers and food-service providers would be much more likely
      to choose Bunge over its competitors. Weisser believed that such an
      integrated process would also provide a safer and more accessible food
      supply.
    

      FERTILIZER
    

      As of 2004 Bunge was the only vertically integrated fertilizer producer in
      South America and was Brazil's leading manufacturer and seller of
      fertilizer and phosphate-based animal-feed products. Weisser expanded the
      company's ability to extend credit to farmers in the form of
      fertilizer, which was then repaid with crops, in order to guarantee
      supplies, strengthen relationships, and reduce risks. Further efficiencies
      were instituted when the same transport vehicles imported fertilizers to
      inland elevators and exported grains to ships waiting at coastal ports.
      These strategies and the company's positive relationship with
      Brazilian and Argentine farmers helped Bunge maintain a unique and
      dominant position in its South American markets.
    

      In 2004 Brazil was the world's fastest-growing fertilizer market,
      increasing at an average rate of 7 percent during the last half of the
      1990s and into the 2000s. Unforested, arable lands were being rapidly
      cultivated for soybean and corn production. Since Brazil had the
      world's largest reserve of such lands, these two crops were
      projected to account for more than 60 percent of the country's
      fertilizer demand between 2005 and 2010. Under the direction of Weisser,
      Bunge was poised to take advantage of these future demands.
    

      CEREOL ACQUISITION
    

      The July 2002 acquisition of Cereol, the France-based company also running
      operations in North America and Europe, made Bunge the world's
      leading oilseed-processing company, principally processing soybeans,
      canola, rapeseed, and sunflower seed. Cereol was also involved in the
      integrated manufacturing, distribution, and sale of food oils, meals for
      animal nutrition, and food ingredients such as lecithins and proteins. The
      acquisition orchestrated by Weisser increased Bunge's efficiency as
      a result of refined logistics and increased volumes. The deal also
      expanded Bunge's global customers base, enabled the company to
      position itself to maximize its growth rate, increased employee
      opportunities, and resulted in a more stable financial profile due to a
      wider product portfolio. Weisser realized at the time of purchase that the
      Cereol acquisition would help to partially offset the volatile operating
      environment in agribusiness.
    

      SOLAE JOINT VENTURE
    

      In 2003, Weisser directed a joint venture between Bunge and DuPont: The
      Solae Company would leverage each company's respective strengths in
      soy protein isolates and concentrates.
       Anticipating the future demand for soybean-based products, Weisser helped
      develop a biotechnology alliance in order to develop enhanced soybeans.
      This technology-based partnership was expected to turn into one of the
      world's leading developers and marketers of branded, soy-based
      specialty-food ingredients.
    

      THE SOYBEAN AND OILSEED COMPANY
    

      In 2004, under the direction of Weisser, Bunge produced more bottled salad
      and cooking oils than any company in the world. It was also the leading
      soybean producer in the Americas and was either a regional or
      international producer in everything from animal feed and fertilizers to
      pie fillings and cake mixes. Through its North American subsidiary, Bunge
      was a major U.S. food processor. The company operated a variety of
      businesses throughout the world in a number of the most rapidly expanding
      markets, processed one-fifth of the world's soybeans, and
      distributed oilseeds and grains throughout five continents. The
      acquisition of Cereol in 2003 made Bunge the world's largest
      oilseed producer, with net sales of $22.165 billion in 2003 and about
      24,000 employees at over four hundred facilities in 29 countries around
      the world. With the help of Weisser, the company became the world's
      leading bottled vegetable oil seller, corn dry miller, and canola oil
      producer; North America's top supplier of edible oil and premium
      shortenings to the foodservice industry and a leading oilseed processor;
      South America's largest wheat miller and vegetable oil producer,
      largest overall exporter of agricultural products, and a leading
      fertilizer producer; Brazil's top manufacturer and seller of flours
      and mixes; Europe's leading supplier of soybean meal;
      China's leading supplier of soybean products; and India's
      leading exporter of soybean oil.
    

      CAPITALIZING ON WORLD DEMAND
    

      Under Weisser's leadership, Bunge became well positioned to
      capitalize on the world's growing demand for soybeans and other
      oilseed products. In the past, only one company—Archer Daniels
      Midland Company (ADM)—had dominated the grain-processing market;
      Bunge joined ADM in a strong position within the industry. Weisser then
      took a cautious approach in leading Bunge into processing expansion around
      the world.
    

      The company was already operating in India and Southeast Asia and was
      making some inroads into China. These three areas contained more than 50
      percent of the world's population; Weisser acknowledged that they
      would increasingly demand more of Bunge's products. However,
      Weisser knew that mere expansion for the sake of expansion would not be
      beneficial, so he carefully investigated each country or area to ensure
      expansion would make sense and provide the company with the correct
      opportunities.
    

      In China, for instance, Weisser developed a large team that dealt directly
      with customers. Although no processing plants had yet been built there,
      Weisser closely assessed the market, which consisted of about two thousand
      crush factories receiving soybeans from the half billion farmers
      throughout the nation. Weisser expected that opportunities in the market,
      which had a projected annual value of $2 billion, would soon become
      apparent as economic and political factors unfolded. These opportunities
      could come through consolidation, outright purchasing of existing assets,
      or the building of new facilities. In an article with Lyle Niedens,
      Weisser referred to his careful planning of long-term strategies in
      saying, "We have two hundred years of history. We plan to be in
      business another two hundred years, at least" (February 11, 2004).
    

      OUTSIDE FUNCTIONS
    

      Weisser was a member of the board of directors of Ferro Corporation in
      Cleveland, Ohio, a global producer of performance materials for
      manufacturers. He was also a member of the Rabobank North American
      Agribusiness Advisory Board. The advisory board was composed of food and
      agribusiness leaders from academic and research institutions who provided
      guidance on industrial and political developments to Rabobank, a global
      company based in the Netherlands, which provided financial services to
      agribusiness organizations.

Alberto Weisser to Retire as Bunge CEO; Soren Schroder to Succeed
Date Posted: February  7, 2013




		      White Plains, NYBunge Limited (NYSE: BG) announced Feb. 7 that Alberto Weisser will retire as chief executive officer (CEO) effective June 1, 2013.  


The board of directors has appointed Soren Schroder, currently CEO of Bunge North America, to succeed Mr. Weisser as CEO of the company, and expects Mr. Schroder to become a director before June 1.

  The board also appointed Mr. Weisser as executive chairman, serving until December 31, 2013.


"Alberto has guided Bunge through one of the most significant and successful eras in its nearly 200-year history," stated L. Patrick Lupo, deputy chairman and lead independent director, Bunge Limited.


  "Under his leadership, Bunge became a public company and grew from a regional operation to a global player, active in over 40 countries and with leading positions in key products and markets.  

"Most importantly, however, Alberto helped instill the culture and approach that form the foundation of the company, and developed the talented team that is responsible for its success.  

"We thank Alberto for his tremendous contributions to Bunge.  

"We are fortunate to have a successor in Soren who can step into this role and ensure the business continues its strong momentum."


Mr. Weisser joined Bunge in 1993 as chief financial officer. 

 He was appointed CEO in January 1999 and chairman in July 1999.  Bunge listed its shares on the New York Stock Exchange in August 2001. 

 Since its listing, the company's enterprise value has increased over 5.5 times, its stock price has increased by nearly 500% and total shareholder returns have averaged 16.4% per year[1].


"Soren is a proven leader, and has been instrumental to Bunge's growth and success since he joined the company in 2000," stated Mr. Weisser. 


 "He helped build our global agribusiness marketing and trading operation, developed our agribusiness franchise in Europe and the Middle East, and as CEO of Bunge North America since 2010, has managed our complete value chain, including agribusiness, edible oils and milling, in a key region.  


"In addition to an excellent track record as a commercial and operational manager, Soren possesses unparalleled industry expertise, market insight and understanding of our customers' needs.  

"He lives and breathes this business, having spent his entire professional life in the agribusiness and food sector.

In addition to an excellent track record as a commercial and operational manager, Soren possesses unparalleled industry expertise, market insight and understanding of our customers' needs. He lives and breathes this business, having spent his entire professional life in the agribusiness and food sector.
