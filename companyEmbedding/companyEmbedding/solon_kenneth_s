						"...A younger man asked me if I was in line. I said, no I'm waiting for my husband. Then he said, " Wow, lucky man." I'm past 50 and that hasn't happened for a long time. Now that's a Great Haircut!!!!"
					
- Posted by Marlene O. on InsiderPages




						""...I've been going to Kenneth's for about 4 years now and I've been lucky enough to have the same stylist for at least 3 of those years. I LOVE HER! She always is very cheerful and offers me advice about my hair...I go online to schedule my appointments -- even if its in the morning or at midnight. Its such a great convenience too."
					
- Posted by Karen W. on Yelp




						"...I love my stylist Leanne. I had recently had a problem with stress that caused my hair (that was already sort of thin but not quite as bad as you would think) to fall out so badly that you could see my scalp. Not only is she great with my kind of hair but she suggested styles and treatments that would cause my hair to look better under the circumstances. Now that my hair is growing back in and looking fabulous (thanks leanne) I will continue coming back and getting her helpful and wonderful hints..."

Kenneth'sLucky Man Water WaxWhat is it: Water based finishing wax without “the wax”, This moldable, moderate holding pomade gives high sheen. This formula is completely ‘reworkable’ and rinses perfectly clean from the hair, no build up.
Why you use it: To create the very popular shiny, combed-back or to the side, “Elvis” like looks.

Kenneth'sLucky Man Creme ClayWhat is it: a medium-to-high hold styling creme with a matte finish.  This formula gives a pliable hold that works great for medium to thick textures.
Why you love it: it's ‘layerable” and easy to use.  It can be cocktailed with Water Wax to create more sheen or cocktail with Forming Fiber to create more separation and definition. A “must” puck for matte finish days.

Kenneth'sLucky Man Forming FiberWhat is it: high hold, semi-matte styling and finishing wax.  The product is best used on short hair (1-3 inches) due to the resinous nature of the product (you can see and feel it by pinching your fingers together repeatedly and see the resin form a fibrous network of hold as it dries.) Why you use it: For styles that need maximum control, a dab of Forming Fiber can create maximum separation and definition. Great for finer textures that need more support and hold.

Witch Hazel to add extra astringency and ant-inflammatory cleansing. Men’s epidermal skin and scalp is thicker (why men tend to wrinkle less) but oilier and pores/follicles often become clogged with perspiration and oily hormones. This clogging can result in hair loss.

Hair

Women's

$36 - $65




Includes consultation, shampoo, cut and style.  When consulting with you on your haircut we take into consideration your lifestyle, face-shape, your hair as a fabric and your commitment to your style.






Shampoo, Blowdry & Style

$29




This includes a relaxing shampoo and then hair styled to your liking.  Curling iron, flat iron, rollers and any velcros used are included.  Long hair sets and styles may be priced higher, consult with your stylist.






Blowout

from $37




Kenneth's professional blowout styling is a must-do when you want to look and feel your best.  It includes a relaxing shampoo and then hair styled to your liking.






Special Occasion Style

from $59




This involves dressing your hair for a formal occasion or special event.  Since this is a style for a special situation you may wish to pre-schedule a consultation prior to that day.  This service includes setting the hair, pinning and placing the style.  Price may change for more elaborate styles and the addition of ornaments and hair pieces.  It is recommended to come with hair pre-washed and dried.






Special Occ Style w/Master

This service is the same as the Special Occasion Style but the Masters have proven their skills in a test showing knowledge of a variety of styles from weddings and proms to fun 'club' styles.






Men's

$30 - $43

Children's

$27




Children's haircuts (12 years of age or younger) include consultation, shampoo, cut and style.  



All above services include complimentaryconsultation, shampoo and styling.

 







												Color & Highlighting
												











All Over Color

from $63




This involves the analysis, formulation and application of your chosen color based on your hair type, skin tones and desired shade.  This is applied from scalp to ends and is not a foiling process.  (Haircut or styling is not included)






Color Retouch

from $59




A retouch maintains the regrowth from a prior color service focusing on the scalp area.  This is usually done approximately 4 weeks after an initial scalp color is applied.  (Haircut or styling is not included)






Color Express

from $46




Tone, refresh or boost your hair color and add shine as well.  Color Express takes only 5 minutes to give hair a beautiful luster and add subtle color change.  (Haircut or styling is not included)






Color Correction

from $63




The process of color correction can be simple or complicated depending on desired end results.  The goal is to change an unwanted color situation into a desired result.  Process may take more than one visit.  (Haircut or styling is not included)  Please contact our call center for booking assistance.






Foiling

from $91




This service uses foil to isolate pieces of hair to add dimension and interest.  Whether adding a soft shade a level or two lighter, or a dramatic blonde foiling, it can be subtle or dramatic.  Foiling leaves some of the natural hair color untouched for a blend of the chosen shade(s) with your natural color.  Blondes are not the only option!  Consult with your stylist.  (Haircut and styling is not included)






Special Color Techniques

as quoted




Stylists can use a combination of any one or many, of our color applications to create a new look and color just perfect for  you.






Balayage Highlighting

from $91




This is a highlighting technique developed in Europe that gives a look like you have been to the beach, not the bleach.  It can be as subtle or dramatic as you wish and is personalized for everyone.  From thick, chunky pieces to subtle swipes, you will love the expressive way it is painted on without using foils.  (Haircut and styling is not included)



Color Services: consultation included, cut & style are not.









												Permanents, Relaxers & Keratin
