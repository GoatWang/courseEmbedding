Supplement to Spinnaker Plus Prospectus 
Supplement dated December 30, 2005
 to Prospectus dated December 1, 2004, as supplemented

As we previously informed you, Safeco Resources Series Trust (RST) was
merged into Pioneer Variable Contracts Trust (Pioneer VCT) on December 10, 2004.
On that date, the existing assets in the RST Portfolios were merged into the    
designated Portfolios of the Pioneer VCT. On or about December 1, 2004, we      
closed all RST Portfolios to new contributions. The following chart sets out    
the Portfolios of Safeco RST and the corresponding Portfolios of Pioneer VCT    
that they were merged into:

As of the merger date, the Pioneer VCT Class I Portfolios listed above
(as successors to the RST Portfolios) continued to be closed to any new         
investment by you. Effective December 30, 2005, these Pioneer VCT Class I       
Portfolios will now be available for new contributions or transfers. However,   
you will only be able to select the Pioneer VCT Class I Portfolios listed

2004, and remained continuously invested in the successor Pioneer VCT

Supplement to Spinnaker Plus Prospectus         
Supplement dated December 30, 2005          
to Prospectus dated December 1, 2004, as supplemented         

As we previously informed you, Safeco Resources Series Trust (RST) was
merged into Pioneer Variable Contracts Trust (Pioneer VCT) on December 10,
2004. On that date, the existing assets in the RST Portfolios were merged       
into the designated Portfolios of the Pioneer VCT. On or about December 1,
2004, we closed all RST Portfolios to new contributions. The following          
chart sets out the Portfolios of Safeco RST and the corresponding               
Portfolios of Pioneer VCT that they were merged into:                           

                                                        [Enlarge/Download Table]
                                                                                                  

        Safeco RST                                             Pioneer VCT

As of the merger date, the Pioneer VCT Class I Portfolios listed above
(as successors to the RST Portfolios) continued to be closed to any new         
investment by you. Effective December 30, 2005, these Pioneer VCT Class I       
Portfolios will now be available for new contributions or transfers. However,   
you will only be able to select the Pioneer VCT Class I Portfolios listed       
above if you were invested in the predecessor RST Portfolio on November 30,
2004, and remained continuously invested in the successor Pioneer VCT Class     
I Portfolio until December 30, 2005.                                            

When we notified you of the closing and subsequent merger of RST, you 
were informed that if you made additional contributions to your contract,       
we would automatically allocate them to Portfolios we had selected other        
than the Pioneer VCT Portfolios listed above, unless you instructed us          
otherwise. We did not receive such instructions from you and therefore          
your contributions were allocated to the Portfolios we had selected.            
Because we did not receive your affirmative consent to allocate your            
contributions to the Portfolios we selected, WE HAVE NOW DETERMINED TO          
REALLOCATE SUCH CONTRIBUTIONS RECEIVED SUBSEQUENT TO NOVEMBER 30, 2004,         
TO THE PIONEER VCT CLASS I PORTFOLIOS THAT BECAME THE SUCCESSOR TO THE          
RST PORTFOLIO (AS NOTED ABOVE). TO ACCOMPLISH THIS, UNLESS YOU INSTRUCT US      
OTHERWISE, ON FEBRUARY 24, 2006, WE WILL TRANSFER ANY ADDITIONAL                
CONTRIBUTIONS YOU MADE SINCE DECEMBER 1, 2004 THAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN             
ALLOCATED TO THE PIONEER VCT CLASS I PORTFOLIOS THAT BECAME THE SUCCESSORS TO   
THE RST PORTFOLIOS YOU WERE INVESTED IN ON NOVEMBER 30, 2004 TO SUCH PIONEER    
VCT CLASS I PORTFOLIO.                                                          

 It is possible that, as a result of our allocation method in effect for
new contributions, you could have gained or lost money over what you would      
have earned had we not implemented our allocation method. If you gained         
money over what you would have earned, that gain will remain in your contract.  
If there is a loss, we will make up the difference. This will be done by        
comparing what your account value would have been had your subsequent           
contributions since December 1, 2004 been invested in the appropriate           
Pioneer VCT Class I Portfolio as compared to what your account value actually   
is worth on February 24, 2006. If there was a transfer or a withdrawal before   
February 24, 2006, we will make such comparisons using the transfer or          
withdrawal date. For contract owners who withdrew all of their account values   
from their contracts and who lost money as a result of our allocation method,   
we will make up any loss so long as the loss is at least $10 per Portfolio.     
The following is an example of how this will work for a contract owner who      
lost money as a result of our allocation method:                                

Contract Owner A was invested in the Safeco RST Core Equity Portfolio 
on November 30, 2004. On December 10, 2004, Contract Owner A became   
an investor in Pioneer Fund VCT Portfolio -- Class I as a result of   
the merger. On June 1, 2005, Contract Owner A made a new contribution 
to her contract, and because she did not instruct us otherwise, her   
contribution was put into the Pioneer Equity Income VCT Portfolio --  
Class II and not the Pioneer Fund VCT Portfolio -- Class I. To        
determine whether Contract Owner A had a loss or a gain as a result   
of our allocation method, we will determine what the additional       
contribution would be worth as of February 24, 2006. We will use      
 the Accumulation Unit value for the Pioneer Fund VCT Portfolio -- Class
I as of February 24, 2006, and assume the new contribution was made   
into the Pioneer Fund VCT Portfolio -- Class I on June 1, 2005, and   
compare that result with what the additional contribution is actually 
   worth as of February 24, 2006, in the Pioneer Equity Income VCT Portfolio
  -- Class II. If the value is less, we will add the amount of loss to the
account value when we move Contract Owner A's contract value from the 
Pioneer Equity Income VCT Portfolio Class II to the Pioneer Fund      
VCT Portfolio -- Class I. If the value is more, it will remain in     
Contract Owner A's contract.

We will be making the reallocations described above on or about February 24,
2006.If you do not want to have your account value reallocated in this          
fashion, you need to contact us and provide us with instructions. You can       
elect to have your account value as well as any new contributions allocated     
to any of the currentinvestment options, as well as the Pioneer VCT Class       
I Portfolios listed above.However, you will only be able to select the          
Pioneer VCT Class I Portfolios listed above if you were invested in the         
predecessor RST Portfolio on November 30, 2004, and remained continuously       
invested in the successor Pioneer VCT Class I Portfolio until December 30,
2005. If you have any questions, you should contact your Registered

HIGHLIGHTS

The Contracts described in this Prospectus provide for accumulation of Contract 
Values and payment of monthly annuity payments on a fixed and variable basis.   

At the Owner's direction, Purchase Payments for the Contracts are allocated to a
segregated investment account of SAFECO, which account has been designated      
SAFECO Resource Variable Account B, or to the Fixed Account. (See "Definitions -
Fixed Account.") Under certain circumstances, however, Purchase Payments may    
initially be allocated to the SAFECO Resource Money Market Sub-Account of the   
Separate Account (see below). The assets of the Separate Account are the        
property of SAFECO and obligations arising under the Contracts are SAFECO's     
general corporate obligations.                                                  

The Separate Account is divided into Sub-Accounts, with the assets of each      
Sub-Account invested in one Portfolio of the Trust or the Funds. The Trust and  
the Funds are open-end, diversified, management investment companies. There are 
currently five Portfolios available to the Separate Account under the Trust: the
SAFECO Resource Equity, Growth, Northwest, Bond and Money Market Portfolios.    
There are currently three Portfolios available to the Separate Account under the
Insurance Management Series: the Federated Corporate Bond Portfolio, the        
Federated International Stock Portfolio and the Federated Utility Portfolio. The
Lexington Emerging Markets Portfolio is currently the only Portfolio of the     
Emerging Markets Fund available to the Separate Account. The Lexington Natural  
Resources Portfolio is currently the only Portfolio of the Lexington Natural    
Resources Trust available to the Separate Account. There are currently two      
Portfolios available to the Separate Account under the Scudder Fund: the Scudder
Balanced Portfolio and the Scudder International Portfolio. Each Portfolio of   
the Trust and the Funds has different investment objectives. Owners bear the    
investment risk for all amounts allocated to the Separate Account. For more     
information on the Trust and each of the Funds and their respective Portfolios, 
please see "SAFECO Resource Series Trust," "Insurance Management Series,"
"Lexington Emerging Markets Fund, Inc." "Lexington Natural Resources Trust," and
"Scudder Variable Life Investment Fund," and the Prospectuses for the Trust and 
the Funds which accompany and should be read with this Prospectus.              

Within ten (10) days of the date of receipt of the Contract by the Owner, or a  
longer period as may be required by the state of issuance, it may be returned by
delivering or mailing it to SAFECO at its Annuity Service Office or to the agent
through whom it was purchased. When the Contract is received by SAFECO, it will 
be voided as if it had never been in force and SAFECO will refund the Contract  
Value (which may be more or less than the

Purchase Payments) computed at the end of the Valuation Period during which the 
Contract is received by SAFECO. However, in states where required and in the    
case of Contracts purchased pursuant to an Individual Retirement Annuity, SAFECO
will refund the Purchase Payments rather than the Contract Value. Initial       
Purchase Payments are allocated to the appropriate Sub-Account(s) in accordance 
with the election made by the Owner in the Application. SAFECO reserves the     
right, however, to allocate all initial Purchase Payments to the SAFECO Resource
Money Market Sub-Account until the expiration of fifteen (15) days from the date
the first Purchase Payment is received (except for any Purchase Payment to be   
allocated to the Fixed Account as elected by the Owner). If SAFECO chooses to   
automatically allocate Purchase Payments to the SAFECO Resource Money Market    
Sub-Account, SAFECO will refund the greater of Purchase Payments or the Contract
Value. Upon the expiration of the fifteen day period, the Sub-Account Value of  
the SAFECO Resource Money Market Sub-Account will be allocated to the           
appropriate Sub-Account(s) in accordance with the election made by the Owner in 
the Application. Various charges and deductions from Purchase Payments and the  
Separate Account are described below.                                           

A Contingent Deferred Sales Charge (sales load) may be deducted in the event of 
a Withdrawal of all or a portion of the Contract Value. The Contingent Deferred 
Sales Charge is imposed on Withdrawals made in the first eight (8) Contract     
Years and is assessed as a percentage of the amount withdrawn. The maximum      
Contingent Deferred Sales Charge is 8% of the amount withdrawn. An Owner may    
make Withdrawals in any Contract Year of up to 10% of the Contract Value free   
from the Contingent Deferred Sales Charge. There are certain other additional   
instances in which this Charge is not applied. (See "Charges and Deductions -   
Deduction for Contingent Deferred Sales Charge.") SAFECO deducts a Withdrawal   
Charge which is equal to the lesser of $25 or 2% of the amount withdrawn for    
each Withdrawal after the first in any Contract Year. (See "Charges and
Deductions - Deduction for Withdrawal Charge.")                                 

There is a deduction made for the Mortality and Expense Risk Charge computed on 
a daily basis which is equal, on an annual basis, to 1.25% of the average daily 
net asset value of the Separate Account. This Charge compensates SAFECO for     
assuming the mortality and expense risks under the Contracts. (See "Charges and
Deductions - Deduction for Mortality and Expense Risk Charge.")                 

Under certain circumstances, a Transfer Charge may be assessed when an Owner    
transfers Contract Values from one Sub-Account to another Sub-Account or to or  
from the Fixed Account. (See "Charges and Deductions - Deduction for Transfer
Charge.")                                                                       

Premium taxes or other taxes payable to a state or other governmental entity    
will be charged against the Contract Values with respect to Non-Qualified       
Contracts. SAFECO reserves the right to deduct these taxes from Contract Values 
with respect to Qualified Contracts. (See "Charges and Deductions - Deduction
for Premium and Other Taxes.")                                                  

There are deductions from and expenses paid out of the assets of the Trust and  
the Funds. See the accompanying Trust and Funds Prospectuses.                   

There is a ten percent (10%) federal income tax penalty applied to the income   
portion of any premature distribution from Non-Qualified Contracts. However, the
penalty is not imposed on amounts received: (a) after the taxpayer reaches age  
59 1/2; (b) after the death of the Owner; (c) if the taxpayer is totally        
disabled (for this purpose disability is as defined in Section 72(m)(7) of the  
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code")); (d) in a series of     
substantially equal periodic payments made not less frequently than annually for
the life (or life expectancy) of the taxpayer or for the joint lives (or joint  
life expectancies) of the taxpayer and his or her Beneficiary; (e) under an     
immediate annuity; or (f) which are allocable to purchase payments made prior to
August 14, 1982. For federal income tax purposes, withdrawals are deemed to be  
on a last-in, first-out basis. Separate tax withdrawal penalties and            
restrictions apply to Qualified Contracts. (See "Tax Status - Tax Treatment of
Withdrawals - Qualified Contracts.") For a further discussion of the taxation of
the Contracts see "Tax Status."                                                 

Withdrawals of amounts attributable to contributions made pursuant to a salary  
reduction agreement (as defined in Section 403(b)(11) of the Code) are limited  
to circumstances only when the Owner attains age 59 1/2, separates from service,
dies, becomes disabled (within the meaning of Section 72(m)(7) of the Code) or  
in the case of hardship. Withdrawals for hardship are restricted to the portion 
of the Owner's Contract Value which represents

contributions made by the Owner and does not include any investment results. The
limitations on withdrawals became effective on January 1, 1989, and apply only  
to: (1) salary reduction contributions made after December 31, 1988; (2) income 
attributable to such contributions; and (3) income attributable to amounts held 
as of December 31, 1988. The limitations on withdrawals do not affect rollovers 
or transfers between certain Qualified Plans. Tax penalties may also apply. (See
"Tax Status - Tax Treatment of Withdrawals - Qualified Contracts.") Owners      
should consult their own tax counsel or other tax adviser regarding any         
distributions. (See "Tax Status - Tax-Sheltered Annuities - Withdrawal
Limitations.")                                                                  

The Treasury Department has indicated that guidelines may be forthcoming under  
which a variable annuity contract will not be treated as an annuity contract for
tax purposes if the owner of the contract has excessive control over the        
investments underlying the contract. The issuance of such guidelines may require
SAFECO to impose limitations on an Owner's right to control the investment. It  
is not known whether any such guidelines would have a retroactive effect (See   
"Tax Status - Diversification").                                                

Because of certain exemptive and exclusionary provisions, interests in the Fixed
Account are not registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Fixed       
Account is not registered as an investment company under the Investment Company 
Act of 1940, as amended. Accordingly, neither the Fixed Account nor any         
interests therein are subject to the provisions of these Acts, and SAFECO has   
been advised that the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission has not   
reviewed the disclosures in the Prospectus relating to the Fixed Account.       
Disclosures regarding the Fixed Account may, however, be subject to certain     
generally applicable provisions of the federal securities laws relating to the  
accuracy and completeness of statements made in prospectuses.

*    Prior to May 5, 1994 SAFECO paid all other expenses of SAFECO Resource     
   Series Trust. Beginning on May 5, 1994 SAFECO will pay all other expenses
of the SAFECO Resource Portfolios of the Trust until a SAFECO Resource
  Portfolio's assets reach $20 million. Once a SAFECO Resource Portfolio's
assets reach $20 million, the other expenses of the SAFECO Resource   
Portfolio will be paid by such SAFECO Resource Portfolio. The SAFECO  
     Resource Equity Portfolio currently has assets in excess of $20 million. In
1994, other expenses incurred by the SAFECO Resource Equity Portfolio 
  equaled .04%. In 1995, it is anticipated that the SAFECO Resource Growth
Portfolio will also have assets in excess of $20 million. The Other   
 Expenses above and the Examples below of the SAFECO Resource Equity and
  Growth Portfolios reflect expenses expected to be incurred in 1995. They
     are only estimates. Other expenses actually incurred by the SAFECO Resource
Equity and Growth Portfolios in 1995 may vary.

**** SAFECO has entered into a Participation Agreement with the Lexington       
Natural Resources Trust in connection with the Separate Account's

*****SAFECO has entered into a Participation Agreement with the Scudder Fund in 
connection with the Separate Account's investment in the shares of the
Scudder Fund. Other insurance companies (together, with SAFECO,       
 collectively referred to herein as "Participating Insurance Companies")
   have entered into similar Participation Agreements with the Scudder Fund.
  For a period of five years from the date of execution of a Participation
     Agreement with the Scudder Fund, and from year to year thereafter if agreed
to by the Participating Insurance Company and the Scudder Fund, each  
    Participating Insurance Company (including SAFECO) has agreed to reimburse
the Scudder Fund to the extent that annual operating expenses of the  
Scudder Balanced Portfolio of the Scudder Fund exceed 0.75% of such   
 Portfolio's average annual net assets and to the extent that the annual
  operating expenses of the Scudder International Portfolio of the Scudder
Fund exceed 1.50% of such Portfolio's average annual net assets. Under
these arrangements, no reimbursement of expenses of either of these   
 Portfolios was required of SAFECO for the year ended December 31, 1994.

   For the year ended December 31, 1994, Scudder Investor Services, Inc. did
not impose a portion of its administrative fee due with respect to the
   Scudder Balanced Portfolio. If such fee had been imposed, the percentages
    shown for "Other Expenses" and for "Total Fund Annual Expenses" would have
 been .305% and 0.78%, respectively, for the Scudder Balanced Portfolio.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 

The financial statements for the Separate Account and SAFECO are contained in   
the Statement of Additional Information which is available at no charge by      
calling 1-800-426-7649 or writing to the Annuity Service Office address on the  
cover.                                                                          

PERFORMANCE INFORMATION 

In advertisements, the "yield," "effective yield," "total return" and "average  
annual total return" of the Sub- Accounts may be quoted.                        

ALL SUB-ACCOUNTS (OTHER THAN SAFECO RESOURCE MONEY MARKET SUB-ACCOUNT)          
"Yield" is the annualization on a 360-day basis of net income per unit over a   
30-day period divided by the accumulation unit value on the last day of the     
period. Yield figures are calculated by determining the income generated by an  
investment in the Sub-Account over a 30-day period. The income is then          
annualized by assuming that the income generated during the 30-day period       
continues to be generated each month for a 12-month period and is shown as a    
percentage of the investment. Yield figures will not include any applicable     
Contingent Deferred Sales Charge.                                               

"Total return" is the total percentage change in the unit value of an investment
over a stated period of time. "Average annual total return" is the annual       
percentage change in the unit value of an investment over a stated period of    
time. Both total return and average annual total return assume the reinvestment 
of dividend and capital gains distributions.                                    

Standardized total return figures which appear in advertisements or sales       
literature will be calculated for required time periods based on a set initial  
investment amount and include the Contingent Deferred Sales Charge. From time to
time, non-standardized total return figures may accompany the standardized      
figures. Non-standardized total return figures may be calculated in a variety of
ways including but not necessarily limited to different time periods, different 
initial investment amounts, additions of periodic payments, use of time weighted
average annual returns which take into consideration the length of time each    
investment has been on deposit, and with or without the Contingent Deferred     
Sales Charge. Non-standardized figures may cause the performance of the         
Sub-Accounts to appear higher than performance calculated using standard        
parameters.                                                                     

SAFECO RESOURCE MONEY MARKET SUB-ACCOUNT 
"Yield" is the annualization on a 365-day basis of the SAFECO Resource Money    
Market Sub-Account's net income over a 7-day period. Yield figures are          
calculated by determining the income generated by an investment in the Sub-     
Account over a 7-day period. The income is then annualized by assuming that the 
income generated during the 7-day period continues to be generated each week    
for a 52-week period and is shown as a percentage of the investment.            

"Effective yield" is the annualization, on a 365-day basis, of the Sub-Account's
net income over a 7-day period with dividends reinvested. The effective yield   
will be slightly higher than the yield because of the compounding effect of this
assumed reinvestment.                                                           

As explained above, yield figures will not include any applicable Contingent    
Deferred Sales Charge.                                                          

For the SAFECO Resource Money Market Portfolio, total return and average annual 
total return are nonstandardized performance figures which may accompany the    
standardized yield and effective yield. "Total return" is the total percentage  
change in the unit value of an investment over a stated period of time and      
"average annual total return" is the annual percentage change in the unit value 
of an investment over a stated period of time. Nonstandardized total return and 
average annual total return figures for the SAFECO Resource Money Market        
Portfolio may be calculated in a variety of ways, as described above.

SAFECO

SAFECO is a stock life insurance company which was organized under the laws of  
the state of Washington on January 23, 1957. SAFECO writes individual and group 
life, accident and health insurance and annuities. SAFECO is licensed to do     
business in the District of Columbia and all states except New York. SAFECO is a
wholly-owned subsidiary of SAFECO Corporation which is a holding company whose  
subsidiaries are engaged primarily in insurance and financial service           
businesses. The home office of SAFECO is located at 15411 N.E. 51st Street,

THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT

The Board of Directors of SAFECO adopted a resolution to establish a segregated 
asset account pursuant to Washington insurance law on February 6, 1986. This    
segregated asset account has been designated SAFECO Resource Variable Account B.
SAFECO has caused the Separate Account to be registered with the Securities and 
Exchange Commission as a unit investment trust pursuant to the provisions of the
Investment Company Act of 1940. The Separate Account meets the definition of a  
"separate account" under the federal securities laws.                           

The assets of the Separate Account are the property of SAFECO. However, the     
assets of the Separate Account, equal to the reserves and other contract        
liabilities with respect to the Separate Account, are not chargeable with       
liabilities arising out of any other business SAFECO may conduct. Income, gains 
and losses, whether or not realized, are in accordance with the Contracts       
credited to or charged against the Separate Account without regard to other     
income, gains or losses of SAFECO. SAFECO's obligations arising under the       
Contracts are general corporate obligations. The investments of the Separate    
Account will be valued at their fair market value in accordance with the        
procedures approved by the Board of Directors of SAFECO and the Separate Account
committee.                                                                      

The Separate Account is divided into Sub-Accounts, with the assets of each      
Sub-Account invested in one of the Portfolio(s) of the Trust or the Funds.      
Currently there are five SAFECO Resource Portfolios available under the Trust:  
the SAFECO Resource Equity Portfolio, SAFECO Resource Growth Portfolio, SAFECO  
Resource Northwest Portfolio, SAFECO Resource Bond Portfolio and SAFECO Resource
Money Market Portfolio. Currently there are three Portfolios available under the
Insurance Management Series: the Federated Corporate Bond Portfolio, the        
Federated International Stock Portfolio and the Federated Utility Portfolio. The
Lexington Emerging Markets Portfolio is currently the only Portfolio of the     
Emerging Markets Fund available to the Separate Account. The Lexington Natural  
Resources Portfolio is currently the only Portfolio of the Lexington Natural    
Resources Trust available to the Separate Account. There are two Portfolios     
available under the Scudder Fund: the Scudder Balanced Portfolio and Scudder    
International Portfolio. There is no assurance that the investment objective of 
any of the Portfolios will be met. Owners bear the complete investment risk for 
Purchase Payments allocated to a Sub-Account. Contract Values will fluctuate in 
accordance with the investment performance of the Sub-Account(s) to which       
Purchase Payments are allocated, and in accordance with the imposition of the   
fees and charges assessed under the Contracts.

SAFECO RESOURCE BOND SUB-ACCOUNT 

The investment objective of the SAFECO Resource Bond Sub-Account is to seek as  
high a level of current income as is consistent with the relative stability of

associated with them. See the Trust's Prospectus and Statement of Additional

NOR GUARANTEED, BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE SAFECO   
RESOURCE MONEY MARKET PORTFOLIO WILL MAINTAIN A STABLE NET ASSET VALUE OF $1.00 
PER SHARE.

The Federated International Stock Sub-Account invests in the Federated          
International Stock Portfolio. To pursue its investment objective, the Federated
International Stock Portfolio invests in a diversified portfolio of equity      
securities issued by non-U.S. issuers. The Federated International Stock        
Portfolio will invest at least 65% of its total assets, and under normal market 
conditions substantially all of its assets, in equity securities of issuers     
located in at least three different countries outside of the United States. The 
equity securities will be selected primarily for superior growth potential and  
to reduce portfolio volatility. The Federated International Stock Portfolio may 
purchase sponsored or unsponsored American Depository Receipts, Global          
Depository Receipts, and European Depository Receipts; corporate and government 
fixed income securities of issuers outside of the United States; convertible    
securities; and options and financial futures contracts. While the Federated    
International Stock Portfolio primarily invests in dividend-paying equity       
securities of established companies that appear to have growth potential, it may

Markets Portfolio. To pursue its investment objective, the Lexington Emerging

bonds, and money market instruments of foreign and domestic companies, the U.S. 
government, and its agencies. The Lexington Emerging Markets Portfolio, under   
normal conditions, will invest at least 65% of its total assets in emerging     
country and emerging market equity securities in at least three countries       
outside of the U.S. and at all times will invest in a minimum of three countries
outside of the U.S. Investments in emerging country equity securities are not   
subject to a maximum limit, and it is the intention of the Lexington Emerging   
Markets Portfolio's adviser to invest substantially all of the Portfolio's      
assets in such securities. For purposes of its investment objective, the        
Lexington Emerging Markets Portfolio considers emerging country equity          
securities to be any country whose economy and market the World Bank or United  
Nations considers to be emerging or developing, and the Portfolio also may      
invest in equity securities and equivalents, traded in any market, of companies 
that derive 50% or more of their total revenue from either goods or services    
produced in such emerging countries and emerging markets or sales made in such  
countries.                                                                      

LEXINGTON NATURAL RESOURCES SUB-ACCOUNT

companies that own or develop natural resources and other basic commodities, or

The Lexington Natural Resources Sub-Account invests in the Lexington Natural    
Resources Portfolio. To pursue its investment objective, the Lexington Natural  
Resources Portfolio seeks to identify securities of companies that, in its      
management's opinion, are undervalued relative to the value of natural resource 
holdings of such companies in light of current and anticipated economic or      
financial conditions. The Lexington Natural Resources Portfolio will consider a 
company to have substantial natural resource assets when, in its management's   
opinion, the company's holdings of the assets are of such magnitude, when       
compared to the capitalization, revenues or operating profits of the company,   
that changes in the economic value of the assets will affect the market price of
the equity securities of such company, which, generally, is when at least 50% of
the non-current assets, capitalization, gross revenues or operating profits of  
the company in the most recent or current fiscal year are involved in or result 
from, directly or indirectly through subsidiaries, exploring, mining, refining, 
processing, fabricating, dealing in or owning natural resource assets. Up to 25%
of the Lexington Natural Resources Portfolio's total assets may be invested in  
securities principally traded in markets outside the U.S.                       

SCUDDER BALANCED SUB-ACCOUNT 

The investment objective of the Scudder Balanced Sub-Account is to seek a       
balance of growth and income from a diversified portfolio of equity and fixed   
income securities. The Scudder Balanced Sub-Account also seeks long-term        
preservation of capital through a quality-oriented investment approach that is  
designed to reduce risk.                                                        

The Scudder Balanced Sub-Account invests in the Scudder Balanced Portfolio. In  
seeking its objectives of a balance of growth and income, as well as long-term  
preservation of capital, the Scudder Balanced Portfolio invests in a diversified
portfolio of equity and fixed income securities. The Scudder Balanced Portfolio 
invests, under normal circumstances, at least 50%, but no more than 75%, of its 
net assets in common stocks and other equity investments. The Scudder Balanced  
Portfolio's equity investments consist of common stocks, preferred stocks,      
warrants and securities convertible into common stocks, of companies that, in   
the investment adviser's judgment, are of above-average financial quality and   
offer the prospect for above-average growth in earnings, cash flow, or assets   
relative to the overall market as defined by the Standard and Poor's 500        
Composite Stock Price Index. To enhance income and stability, the Scudder       
Balanced Portfolio's remaining assets are allocated to bonds and other fixed    
income securities, including cash reserves. The Scudder Balanced Portfolio will 
normally invest 25% to 50% of its net assets in fixed income securities.        
However, at least 25% of the Scudder Balanced Portfolio's net assets must always
be invested in fixed income securities.

THE FUNDS FROM TIME TO TIME AND MAY BE MADE AVAILABLE TO OWNERS. IN ADDITION,   
CERTAIN EXISTING PORTFOLIOS OF THE FUNDS, WHICH ARE NOT CURRENTLY BEING MADE    
AVAILABLE, MAY BE MADE AVAILABLE TO OWNERS IN THE FUTURE. SOME OF THE PORTFOLIOS
LISTED BELOW MAY NOT BE IMMEDIATELY AVAILABLE IN STATES THAT HAVE NOT YET       
APPROVED THE CORRESPONDING CONTRACT ENDORSEMENT.                                

 VOTING RIGHTS

In accordance with its view of present applicable law, SAFECO will vote the     
shares of the Trust and the Funds held in the Separate Account at special       
meetings of the shareholders in accordance with instructions received from      
persons having the voting interest in the Separate Account. SAFECO will vote    
shares it owns for which it has not received instructions, as well as shares    
attributable to it, in the same proportion as it votes shares for which it has  
received instructions. Neither the Trust nor the Funds hold regular meetings of 
shareholders.                                                                   

The number of shares which a person has a right to vote will be determined as of
a date to be chosen by SAFECO not more than sixty (60) days prior to the meeting
of the Trust or the Funds. Voting instructions will be solicited by written     
communication at least fourteen (14) days prior to such meeting with respect to 
the Trust and at least ten (10) days prior to such meeting with respect to the  
Funds.                                                                          

The Funds are intended to be the funding vehicle for variable annuity contracts 
and variable life insurance policies to be offered by the separate accounts of  
certain life insurance companies which may or may not be affiliated and in      
compliance with certain regulatory requirements. The Funds currently do not     
foresee any disadvantages to the Owners arising from the fact that the interests
of the holders of the variable annuity contracts and the variable life insurance
policies may differ. Nevertheless, the Funds' Directors and Trustees intend to  
monitor events in order to identify any material irreconcilable conflicts which 
may possibly arise and to determine what action, if any, should be taken in     
response thereto.                                                               

SUBSTITUTION OF SECURITIES

If the shares of the Trust or the Funds (or any Portfolio within the Trust or   
the Funds) should no longer be available for investment by the Separate Account 
or, if in the judgment of SAFECO, further investment in such shares should      
become inappropriate in view of the purpose of the Contracts, SAFECO may        
substitute shares of another mutual fund (or Portfolio within the Trust or the  
Funds) for fund shares already purchased or to be purchased in the future by    
Purchase Payments under the Contracts. No substitution of securities may take   
place without prior approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission and under
such requirements as it may impose.                                             

 PURCHASING A CONTRACT

PURCHASE PAYMENTS 

The Contracts are purchased under a single purchase payment plan. The initial   
Purchase Payment is due on the Contract Date. Subsequent Purchase Payments may  
only be made within the first six (6) months after the Contract Date. The       
minimum initial Purchase Payment is $50,000 and the minimum subsequent Purchase 
Payment is $250. Subject to these minimums, the Owner may increase or decrease  
or change the frequency of subsequent Purchase Payments. SAFECO reserves the    
right to reject any Application or Purchase Payment.

ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PAYMENTS 

The allocation of the initial Purchase Payment is elected by the Owner in the   
Application. Unless the Owner elects otherwise, subsequent Purchase Payments are
allocated in the same manner as the initial Purchase Payment. Allocation of the 
Purchase Payments is subject to the terms and conditions imposed by SAFECO.     
Under certain circumstances, Purchase Payments which have been designated by    
prospective purchasers to be allocated to Sub-Accounts other than the SAFECO    
Resource Money Market Sub-Account, may be initially allocated to the SAFECO     
Resource Money Market Sub-Account. (See "Highlights.") For each Sub-Account,    
Purchase Payments are converted into Accumulation Units. The number of          
Accumulation Units in a Sub-Account credited to the Contract is determined by   
dividing each Net Purchase Payment by the value of an Accumulation Unit for that
Sub-Account. Purchase Payments allocated to the Fixed Account are credited in   
dollars.                                                                        

If the Application for a Contract is in good order, SAFECO will apply the       
Purchase Payment to the Separate Account and credit the Contract with           
Accumulation Units and/or to the Fixed Account and credit the Contract with     
dollars within two business days of receipt. If the Application for a Contract  
is not in good order, SAFECO will attempt to get it in good order or SAFECO will
return the Application and the Purchase Payment within five (5) business days.  
SAFECO will not retain a Purchase Payment for more than five (5) business days  
while processing an incomplete Application unless it has been so authorized by  
the purchaser. For subsequent Purchase Payments in good order, SAFECO will apply
the Net Purchase Payment to the Separate Account and credit the Owner's Contract
with Accumulation Units during the next Valuation Period after the Purchase     
Payment was received.                                                           

ACCUMULATION UNIT 

Purchase Payments allocated to the Separate Account and amounts transferred to  
or within the Separate Account are converted into Accumulation Units. This is   
done by dividing each Net Purchase Payment by the value of an Accumulation Unit 
for the Valuation Period during which the Purchase Payment is allocated to the  
Sub-Account or the transfer is made. Accumulation Units for each Sub-Account are
valued separately. The Accumulation Unit value for each Sub-Account was         
arbitrarily set at $10 when the Sub-Account was established. The Accumulation   
Unit value for any later Valuation Period is determined by multiplying the      
Accumulation Unit value for the Sub-Account, as of the immediately preceding    
Valuation Period, by the Net Investment Factor for the current Valuation Period.
The Net Investment Factor for any Sub-Account for any Valuation Period is       
determined by dividing (a) by (b) and subtracting (c) from the result, where:   

(a)  is the net result of:                                            

         (i)  The net asset value per share of the Portfolio, determined as of
the current Valuation Period, plus                

         (ii)  The per share amount of any dividend or capital-gain distribution
           made by the Portfolio if the "ex-dividend" date occurs during
the current Valuation Period, plus or minus       

       (iii)  A per share credit or charge, which is determined by SAFECO, for
             changes in tax reserves resulting from investment operations of
the Sub-Account.                                  

(b)  is the net result of:                                            

        (i)  The net asset value per share of the Portfolio determined as of
       the immediately preceding Valuation Period, plus or minus

      (ii)  The per share credit or charge for any changes in tax reserves
for the immediately preceding Valuation Period.   

(c)  is the percentage factor equal to the Mortality and Expense Risk 
          Charge. Such factor is equal on an annual basis to a percentage of the
average daily net asset value of the Sub-Account.           

-22-

P-->485BPOS27th Page of 94TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 27th

     The Net Investment Factor may be greater or less than one. Therefore, the
Accumulation Unit value may increase or decrease.                   

PRINCIPAL UNDERWRITER 

Currently, SAFECO Securities, Inc. (SSI) acts as the principal underwriter of   
the Contracts. SSI has its business address at SAFECO Plaza, Seattle, Washington
98185. Prior to April 29, 1994, PNMR Securities, Inc. (PNMR), 15411 N.E. 51st   
Street, Redmond, Washington, acted as the principal underwriter of the          
Contracts. SSI and PNMR are wholly-owned subsidiaries of SAFECO Corporation and 
therefore are affiliates of SAFECO. The Contracts are offered on a continuous   
basis.                                                                          

CHARGES AND DEDUCTIONS

Various charges and deductions are made from Purchase Payments, Contract Values,
the Separate Account and the Fixed Account. These charges and deductions are:   

DEDUCTION FOR PREMIUM AND OTHER TAXES 

Any premium taxes or other taxes levied by any governmental entity which SAFECO,
in its sole discretion, determines have resulted from the establishment or      
maintenance of the Contract or any portion of the Contract, or from the         
investment experience of the Separate Account, or from the receipt by SAFECO of 
Purchase Payments or from the commencement of annuity payments will be deducted 
from the Contract Value with respect to Non-Qualified Contracts. SAFECO         
reserves the right to deduct these taxes from Contract Values with respect to   
Qualified Contracts. Premium taxes currently imposed by certain states on the   
type of Contracts offered hereby range from 0% to 4%. Some states assess their  
premium taxes at the time Purchase Payments are made; others assess their       
premium taxes at the time annuity payments commence. Premium taxes are subject  
to change or amendment by state legislatures, administrative interpretations or 
judicial acts. Such premium taxes will depend on, among other things, the       
classification of the Contract by the states, the status of SAFECO within such  
state and the insurance tax laws of such state. These taxes are deducted first  
from the SAFECO Resource Money Market Sub-Account. In the event there are no    
Accumulation Units in the SAFECO Resource Money Market Sub-Account or not enough
in value to pay for these taxes, the balance of deductions necessary is then    
taken from the SAFECO Resource Bond Sub-Account, the Federated Utility          
Sub-Account, the Federated Corporate Bond Sub-Account, the Scudder Balanced     
Sub-Account, the Lexington Natural Resources Sub-Account, the Scudder           
International Sub-Account, the Federated International Stock Sub-Account, the   
Lexington Emerging Markets Sub-Account, the SAFECO Resource Equity Sub-Account, 
the SAFECO Resource Northwest Sub-Account, the SAFECO Resource Growth           
Sub-Account, and finally from the Fixed Account.                                

DEDUCTION FOR MORTALITY AND EXPENSE RISK CHARGE 

SAFECO deducts on each Valuation Date a Mortality and Expense Risk Charge which 
is equal on an annual basis to 1.25% of the average daily net asset value of the
Separate Account. The mortality risks assumed by SAFECO arise from its          
contractual obligation to make annuity payments after the Annuity Date for the  
life of the Owner, to waive Contingent Deferred Sales Charges in the event of   
the death of the Owner and to guarantee the payment of the greater of Purchase  
Payments made or Contract Value upon death of the Owner.                        

If the Mortality and Expense Risk Charge is insufficient to cover the actual    
costs, the loss will be borne by SAFECO. Conversely, if the amount deducted     
proves more than sufficient, the excess will be profit to SAFECO.               
SAFECO expects a profit from this charge.                                       

The Mortality and Expense Risk Charge is guaranteed by SAFECO and cannot be     
increased.

DEDUCTION FOR CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGE 

In the event that an Owner withdraws all or a portion of his or her Contract    
Value, a Contingent Deferred Sales Charge (sales load) is deducted from the     
Withdrawal. This charge reimburses SAFECO for expenses incurred in connection   
with the promotion, sale and distribution of the Contracts. The Contingent      
Deferred Sales Charge is imposed on Withdrawals made in the first eight (8)     
Contract Years. The Contract provides for the deduction of a Contingent Deferred
Sales Charge for withdrawals of some or all of an Owner's Contract Value other  
than those made (i) on Transfers between Sub-Accounts, (ii) on the sum of       
Withdrawals taken in any Contact Year which does not exceed 10% of the Contract 
Value, (iii) on Withdrawals made under a Settlement Option, (iv) on Systematic  
Withdrawals over the life expectancy of the Owner or the joint life expectancy  
of the Owner and Beneficiary under the Systematic Withdrawal Income Plan(TM),   
(v) on Withdrawals made pursuant to the death of the Owner, or (vi) on Transfers
from a Sub-Account to the Fixed Account or on certain Transfers from the Fixed  
Account to a Sub-Account. (See "Withdrawals and Transfers" and "The Programs.") 

The amount of the Contingent Deferred Sales Charge will be based on the         
following:                                                                      

                                                                [Download Table]

                          Contingent Deferred Sales Charge   
Contract Year             as a Percentage of Amount Withdrawn
-------------             -----------------------------------
                                                             
     1                          8% of amount withdrawn       
     2                          7% of amount withdrawn       
     3                          6% of amount withdrawn       
     4                          5% of amount withdrawn       
     5                          4% of amount withdrawn       
     6                          3% of amount withdrawn       
     7                          2% of amount withdrawn       
     8                          1% of amount withdrawn       
     After Contract Year 8      0% of amount withdrawn       

The Contingent Deferred Sales Charge assesses a percentage of the amount        
withdrawn according to the stated schedule. However, total Contingent Deferred  
Sales Charges collected by SAFECO will not exceed 8.5% of the Purchase Payments 
made under a Contract.                                                          

The commissions paid to registered representatives on the sale of Contracts are 
not more than 5.8% of the Purchase Payments. In addition, commissions, overrides
and bonuses may be paid to SSI's registered representatives and/or other        
distributors of the Contracts. A bonus dependent upon persistency of funds under
the Contracts is one type of bonus that may be paid. Noncash compensation may   
include accrual of conference travel credits and prizes. To the extent that the 
Contingent Deferred Sales Charge is insufficient to cover the actual cost of    
distribution, SAFECO may use any of its corporate assets, including potential   
profit which may arise from the Mortality and Expense Risk Premium, to make up  
any difference.                                                                 

REDUCTION OR ELIMINATION OF THE CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGE 

The amount of the Contingent Deferred Sales Charge on the Contracts may be      
reduced or eliminated when sales of the Contracts are made to individuals in a  
manner that results in savings of sales expenses. The entitlement to reduction  
of the Contingent Deferred Sales Charge will be determined by SAFECO after      
examination of all the relevant factors such as:                                

    1.  The total amount of Purchase Payments to be received. Per Contract sales
  expenses are likely to be less on larger Purchase Payments than on
smaller ones.                                                   

2.  Any prior or existing relationship with SAFECO. Per Contract sales  
expenses are likely to be less when there is a prior existing   
        relationship because of the likelihood of implementing the Contract with
fewer sales contacts.                                           

-24-

P-->485BPOS29th Page of 94TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 29th

3.  There may be other circumstances, of which SAFECO is not presently  
aware, which could result in reduced sales expenses.            

If, after consideration of the foregoing factors, SAFECO determines that there  
will be a reduction in sales expenses, SAFECO may provide for a reduction or    
elimination of the Contingent Deferred Sales Charge.                            

The Contingent Deferred Sales Charge may be eliminated when the Contracts are   
issued to an officer, director or employee of SAFECO or any of its affiliates.  
In no event will reductions or elimination of the Contingent Deferred Sales     
Charge be permitted where reductions or elimination will be unfairly            
discriminatory to any person.                                                   

DEDUCTION FOR WITHDRAWAL CHARGE 

SAFECO deducts a Withdrawal Charge which is equal to the lesser of $25 or 2% of 
the amount withdrawn for each Withdrawal (whether it be a partial Withdrawal or 
a complete Withdrawal) after the first in any Contract Year. No Withdrawal      
Charge is deducted where the Owner is participating in the Systematic Withdrawal
Income Plan(TM) or the Periodic Withdrawal Program subject to certain           
limitations (see "The Programs") or is exercising a Settlement Option.          

DEDUCTION FOR TRANSFER CHARGE 

An Owner may make up to twelve (12) Transfers annually without the imposition of
any fee or charge. If more than twelve (12) Transfers have been made in a       
Contract Year, SAFECO reserves the right to assess a Transfer Charge which will 
be equal to the lesser of $10 or 2% of the amount transferred. Specific         
requirements may apply to transfers under the Programs. (See "The Programs.")   

OTHER EXPENSES 

There are other deductions from and expenses paid out of the assets of the Trust
and the Funds which are described in the accompanying Trust and Funds           
Prospectuses. SAFECO may receive compensation from the investment advisers or   
administrators of the Available Funds consistent with the administrative        
services rendered to such entities.                                             

 RIGHTS UNDER THE CONTRACT

OWNER, ANNUITANT AND BENEFICIARY 

The Owner has all rights and may receive all benefits under the Contract. Prior 
to the Annuity Date, the Owner is the person designated in the Application,     
unless changed. On and after the Annuity Date, the Annuitant is the Owner. The  
Annuitant is the person on whose life Annuity payments are based and is the     
person designated in the Application, unless changed.                           

The Owner may designate a Beneficiary in the Application to receive any proceeds
payable due to the death of the Owner. Unless the Owner provides otherwise, the 
death benefit will be paid in equal shares to all surviving primary             
Beneficiaries. If the Owner has not provided otherwise and there are no         
surviving primary Beneficiaries, the death benefit will be paid in equal shares 
to all surviving contingent Beneficiaries. If the Owner has not provided        
otherwise and there are no surviving primary or contingent Beneficiaries, the   
death benefit will be paid to the estate of the Owner.                          

If the Owner has made an irrevocable Beneficiary designation, no change of      
Beneficiary is permitted. If the Owner has not made an irrevocable Beneficiary  
designation, the Owner may file a signed request with SAFECO to change the      
Beneficiary designation. The change of Beneficiary will be effective upon       
recording by SAFECO at its Home Office. SAFECO shall not be liable for any      
payments made or other action taken by SAFECO before the change in Beneficiary  
was recorded by SAFECO at its Home Office. A recorded change of Beneficiary will
revoke any prior Beneficiary designations. SAFECO will pay any death proceeds to
the most recently recorded Beneficiary.                                         

-25-

P-->485BPOS30th Page of 94TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 30th

MISSTATEMENT OF AGE 

SAFECO may require proof of the age of the Annuitant before making any Life     
Annuity payment provided for by the Contract. If the age of the Annuitant has   
been misstated, the amount payable will be the amount that the Contract Value   
would have provided at the correct age. Once Annuity payments have begun, any   
underpayments will be made up in one sum with the next Annuity payment. Any     
overpayment will be deducted from future Annuity payments until the total is    
repaid.                                                                         

EVIDENCE OF SURVIVAL 

If any benefits under the Contracts are contingent upon the Annuitant being     
alive on a given date, SAFECO may require evidence satisfactory to SAFECO that  
such condition continues to be met.                                             

CONTRACT SETTLEMENT 

Unless otherwise designated in writing by SAFECO, all sums payable under the    
Contracts are payable at SAFECO's Home Office. The Contract must be returned to 
SAFECO upon any settlement.                                                     

SUBSTITUTE PAYEE 

If SAFECO determines that any person is incapable of personally receiving and   
giving a valid receipt for any payment due under the Contracts and no claim has 
been made by a duly appointed guardian, SAFECO may make such payment to any     
person or institution that SAFECO determines has assumed the care and support of
such person. Such payment shall completely discharge the liability of SAFECO    
with respect to the amount so paid.                                             

NON-ASSIGNMENT 

To the extent permitted by law, the Contracts and the benefits or payments under
the Contracts are not assignable or otherwise transferable. The Contract may be 
assigned for purposes of an Internal Revenue Code Section 1035 exchange.        

MODIFICATION OF THE CONTRACTS 

The terms and conditions of the Contracts may be amended by written agreement   
between SAFECO and the Owner by written endorsement or amendment. All agreements
made by SAFECO will be signed by the President or one of the Vice Presidents. No
other person has power on behalf of SAFECO to amend or modify the Contract,     
extend any due date, or waive any proof required by the Contract. SAFECO may    
unilaterally amend the provisions of the Contract as required to conform to any 
state or federal law which affects the Contract.                                

TERMINATION OF CONTRACT 

All benefit provisions under the Contract continue in force until the Contract  
Value is completely Withdrawn. Discontinuance of Purchase Payments will not     
result in termination of the Contract.                                          

ANNUITY AND DEATH BENEFIT PROVISIONS

SELECTION AND CHANGE OF SETTLEMENT OPTIONS 

The Owner may select or change the Settlement Option or Annuity Date by written 
notification to SAFECO at its Home Office. In order to be effective, the written
notification must be received by SAFECO prior to any Annuity Date previously    
selected.                                                                       

-26-

P-->485BPOS31st Page of 94TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 31st

PAYMENT OF BENEFITS 

SAFECO will, upon the written direction of the Owner, issue an Annuity or make a
cash distribution to any person who is entitled to such benefits. SAFECO may    
rely on the written direction of the Owner and shall not be liable because of   
any failure to question or challenge such direction regarding the issuance of an
Annuity or payment of a cash distribution.                                      

FREQUENCY AND AMOUNT OF ANNUITY PAYMENTS 

Annuity payments will be paid as monthly installments, except as described      
below. If the net amount available to apply under any Settlement Option is less 
than $5,000, SAFECO shall have the right to pay such amount in a lump sum cash  
distribution. If Annuity payments would be or become less than $250, SAFECO     
shall have the right to change the frequency of payments to such intervals as   
will result in payments of at least $250.                                       

DEATH OF OWNER PRIOR TO ANNUITY DATE 

The Contract provides for a minimum guaranteed death benefit, provided that     
SAFECO receives due proof of death in a satisfactory form and election of a     
Settlement Option prior to six months from the date of the Owner's death. If the
due proof of death or the election of a Settlement Option is received later than
six months after the date of death of the Owner, SAFECO provides a death benefit
that is subject to change based upon investment experience, as discussed below. 

On the Valuation Date following receipt at the Home Office of the due proof of  
death and election of a Settlement Option before the Annuity Date and while the 
Contract was in force, SAFECO generally will pay to the designated Beneficiary a
minimum guaranteed death benefit that is the greater of: (i) the Contract Value 
on the later of the date of receipt of due proof of death or the election of a  
Settlement Option; or (ii) the last determined minimum guaranteed death benefit.

The initial minimum guaranteed death benefit is equal to the initial Net        
Purchase Payment. In those states where approved, the minimum guaranteed death  
benefit is reset at each eighth Contract Anniversary ("Eight Year Contract      
Anniversary") to equal the greater of (i) the then current Contract Value or    
(ii) the current minimum guaranteed death benefit. The greater of the two values
becomes the new minimum guaranteed death benefit. The minimum guaranteed death  
benefit is fixed for the remaining duration of the Contract as of the last Eight
Year Contract Anniversary preceding the Owner's 76th birthday.                  

If the Contract is owned by joint Owners, the minimum guaranteed death benefit, 
or any other applicable death benefit, is payable only on the death of the elder
Owner. Moreover, following the death of the elder Owner, if the joint Owner     
elects to continue the Contract, there is no minimum guaranteed death benefit.  
The death benefit will be the Contract Value, which reflects Net Purchase       
Payments and withdrawals. Contract Value is subject to change as a result of    
investment experience.                                                          

Each form of minimum guaranteed death benefit is adjusted to reflect Net        
Purchase Payments and withdrawals. If an Owner makes withdrawals, the minimum   
guaranteed death benefit is reset to equal the previous minimum guaranteed death
benefit multiplied by the ratio of the Contract Value after the withdrawal to   
the Contract Value before the withdrawal. The recomputed minimum guaranteed     
death benefit will be used in determining the new minimum guaranteed death      
benefit at the next Eight Year Contract Anniversary. This method of adjusting   
the guaranteed minimum death benefit will be applied if the Owner is            
participating in the Systematic Withdrawal Income Plan(TM) at the time of death.
After the Owner's death, the minimum guaranteed death benefit will be reduced   
dollar for dollar by any withdrawals by the Beneficiary. The Beneficiary may    
only make withdrawals at the time of or prior to the election of a Settlement   
Option.                                                                         

If due proof of death or the election of a payment option (a Settlement Option  
or lump sum payment) are made later than six months following the date of the   
Owner's death, the value as of the six month anniversary of the date of death   
will apply. Thus, for example, if notification of death is not received until   
nine (9) months after the date of death, the death benefit under (i) will be    
calculated as follows:                                                          

-27-

Upon notification of death, SAFECO will determine what the Contract Value was on
the six-month anniversary of the date of death. Assuming that Contract Value was
$90,000 on that date and the last determined minimum guaranteed death benefit   
was $100,000, SAFECO will contribute $10,000 to Contract Value as of that date  
and will guarantee the portion of the Contract Value attributable to SAFECO's   
contribution and pay interest thereon at the then prevailing money market rate  
until the date of election of a payment option. SAFECO will then calculate the  
effects of investment experience on the portion of the Contract Value existing  
on the six-month anniversary of the date of death, and hence, the death benefit 
will consist of the combined value of the guaranteed and nonguaranteed portions 
of the Contract Value from that six-month anniversary date to the date of       
election of a payment option. If on the six-month anniversary of the date of    
death the Contract Value exceeds the last determined minimum guaranteed death   
benefit, the entire Contract Value will be subject to market risk from that date
to the date of election of a payment option and no portion of the Contract Value
will be guaranteed. Any withdrawals made by the Beneficiary prior to electing a 
payment option will be deducted from the death benefit. The Beneficiary bears   
the risk and enjoys the rewards of negative or positive investment experience on
any nonguaranteed portion of the Contract Value during the period from the      
six-month anniversary of the date of death and the date of election of a payment
option. Beneficiaries should be encouraged to promptly notify SAFECO of the     
Owner's death.                                                                  

In all cases, SAFECO will pay the Beneficiary a lump sum payment of the death   
benefit if the election of the Settlement Option is not made within sixty (60)  
days of the receipt of due proof of death.                                      

With respect to non-qualified Contracts if the Owner dies on or after the       
Annuity Date and before the entire value of the Contract has been distributed,  
any remaining value must be distributed at least as rapidly as the method of    
distribution in effect at the time of the Owner's death. If the Owner dies      
before the Annuity Date, generally the entire value under the Contract must be  
distributed within five years after the date of the Owner's death or must be    
distributed over the designated Beneficiary's life or over a period not         
extending beyond the Beneficiary's life expectancy, in equal or substantially   
equal payments, with payments beginning within one year of the Owner's death.   

DEATH OF ANNUITANT 

In the event of the Annuitant's death prior to the Annuity Date, the Owner must 
designate a new Annuitant. If no designation is made within thirty (30) days of 
notification to SAFECO of the death of the Annuitant, the Owner will become the 
Annuitant. The election of a Settlement Option must be made by the Beneficiary  
during the sixty (60) day period commencing with the date of SAFECO's receipt of
notice of the Owner's death. If no election is made within the sixty (60) day   
period, then a single lump sum payment will be made to the Beneficiary. In the  
event that the Beneficiary is a surviving spouse, the Contract can be continued.
Upon the death of a co-Owner, the surviving Owner becomes the designated        
Beneficiary. Any other named Beneficiary will be a contingent Beneficiary. If   
the Contract is owned by a non-natural person, the death of the Annuitant will  
be treated as the death of the Owner.                                           

DEATH OF OWNER AFTER ANNUITY DATE 

If the Owner dies on or after a Settlement Option has commenced, payments must  
continue at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution in effect prior
to the Owner's death.                                                           

SETTLEMENT OPTIONS 

An Annuity may be issued in any of the forms described below, or such other     
forms which SAFECO agrees to issue under the Contract. Options (a), (b), and (c)
are irrevocable once they have begun. Option (d) is irrevocable for the first   
eight Contract Years, and then may be changed.                                  

(a)  Variable Life Annuity: Monthly payments are made to the Annuitant
        commencing on the Annuity Date, if he or she is then living, and the
 last payment is that payment due immediately on or before the
     Annuitant's death. No death benefit is payable under this option.

 (b)  Variable Life Annuity with 120 or 240 Monthly Payments Guaranteed:
        Monthly payments are made to the Annuitant commencing on the Annuity
Date. If at the death of the Annuitant the guaranteed number

-28-

P-->485BPOS33rd Page of 94TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 33rd

    of payments has not been received by the Annuitant, payments will be
      made to the Beneficiary for the remainder of the guarantee period. The
 Beneficiary may elect to have the present value of the guaranteed
   Annuity remaining as of the date the notice of death is received by
  SAFECO commuted at the assumed investment rate of 4% and paid in a
single payment.                                                 

  (c) Variable Joint and Survivor Life Annuity: Monthly payments are made to
    the Annuitant commencing on the Annuity Date. After the death of the
        Annuitant, payments will be continued to the co-annuitant for as long as
     he or she lives. The written request for this option must specify the
     percentage value of monthly payments to continue to the co-annuitant.

 (d) Systematic Withdrawal Income Plan(TM): A specified number of whole or
      partial Accumulation Units are liquidated for payment to the Annuitant
     on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis. The number to be liquidated
        during a given year shall be a sufficient number so as to be expected to
     deplete the Contract over the life expectancy of the Annuitant or the
   joint life expectancy of the Annuitant and the Beneficiary, with at
    least 50% of the payments expected to be made during the Annuitant's
     life. Systematic Withdrawal Income Plan is a trademark of SAFECO Life
Insurance Company.                                              

If, as of the Annuity Date, a Settlement Option has not been selected, SAFECO   
will make payments under Option (d) above.                                      

Similar fixed annuity Settlement Options are available with respect to the      
monies held in the Fixed Account.                                               

MORTALITY AND EXPENSE GUARANTEE 

SAFECO guarantees that the dollar amount of each Variable Annuity payment made  
after the first payment will not be affected by variations in mortality         
experience or expenses.                                                         

 WITHDRAWALS AND TRANSFERS

WITHDRAWALS 

SAFECO, upon written request to it by the Owner, will allow the Withdrawal of   
all or a portion of the Contract Value. Withdrawals will result in the          
cancellation of Accumulation Units from each applicable Sub-Account of the      
Separate Account or a reduction in the Fixed Account Value in the ratio that the
Sub-Account Value and/or the Fixed Account Value bears to the total Contract    
Value. The Owner must specify in writing in advance which units are to be       
canceled or values are to be reduced if other than the above-mentioned method of
cancellation is desired. SAFECO will pay the amount of any Withdrawal within    
seven (7) days of receipt of a request, unless the "Suspension of Payments or
Transfers" provision is in effect (see "Suspension of Payments or Transfers"    
below). SAFECO retains the right to defer the payment of Withdrawals from the   
Fixed Account for a period of six (6) months after receiving a Withdrawal       
request. (See also "The Programs.")                                             

The minimum Withdrawal allowed is the lesser of $250 or the Contract Value. If  
any Withdrawal reduces the remaining balance in a Sub-Account or the Fixed      
Account to less than $500 ($1,000 in Maine, South Carolina and Texas), the      
remaining balance will also be withdrawn.                                       

Upon a Withdrawal, the number of Accumulation Units remaining under the Contract
will be reduced by the number of such units equal to the total of the           
Withdrawal, including applicable charges and taxes, including income taxes      
withheld.                                                                       

Certain tax withdrawal penalties and restrictions may apply to withdrawals from 
Contracts. (See "Tax Status.") For Contracts purchased in connection with 403(b)
plans, the Code limits the withdrawal of amounts attributable to contributions  
made pursuant to a salary reduction agreement (as defined in Section 403(b)(11) 
of the Code) to circumstances only when the Owner: (1) attains age 59 1/2; (2)  
separates from service; (3) dies; (4) becomes disabled (within the meaning of   
Section 72(m)(7) of the Code); or (5) in the case of hardship.                  

-29-

P-->485BPOS34th Page of 94TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 34th

However, withdrawals for hardship are restricted to the portion of the Owner's  
Contract Value which represents contributions made by the Owner and does not    
include any investment results. The limitations on withdrawals became effective 
on January 1, 1989 and apply only to salary reduction contributions made after  
December 31, 1988, to income attributable to such contributions and to income   
attributable to amounts held as of December 31, 1988. The limitations on        
withdrawals do not affect rollovers or transfers between certain Qualified      
Plans. Owners should consult their own tax counsel or other tax adviser         
regarding any distributions.                                                    

TRANSFERS 

An Owner may transfer Contract Values among Sub-Accounts up to twelve (12) times
annually without the imposition of any fee or charge. If more than twelve (12)  
Transfers have been made in a Contract Year, SAFECO reserves the right to assess
a Transfer Charge which will be equal to the lesser of $10 or 2% of the amount  
transferred. The minimum Transfer from a Sub-Account must be at least $500,     
except in the case of Automatic Transfers (described below). If the Sub-Account 
from which the Transfer is being made contains less than $500, or is reduced to 
less than $500 after a Transfer, the Owner's entire interest in the Sub-Account 
will be transferred. The minimum Transfer into a Sub-Account must be at least   
$50.                                                                            

Upon a Transfer from a Sub-Account, the number of Accumulation Units remaining  
under that Sub-Account will be reduced by the number of such units equal to the 
total of the requested Transfer, including applicable charges and taxes.        
Transfers will be effected during the Valuation Period next following receipt by
SAFECO of a written transfer request (or by telephone, if authorized) containing
all required information. (See "Transfers by Written Request" and "Transfers by
Telephone," below.)                                                             

Transfers also may be effected under certain of the Programs and certain        
specific limitations on transfers may apply under the Programs.                 

TRANSFERS BY WRITTEN REQUEST 
Contract Values may be transferred by writing SAFECO at the address on the
    cover page of this Prospectus and specifying the Contract number, the amount
   to be transferred, and the Sub-Accounts to be effected. The request must be
    signed by the Owner or a third party to whom the Owner has given appropriate
   authority. SAFECO must have a copy of the document granting such authority.
Transfers will be effected during the Valuation Period next following   
receipt by SAFECO of the written transfer request.                      

TRANSFERS BY TELEPHONE 

If the Owner has previously elected in writing the privilege of making  
transfers by telephone, SAFECO will accept transfer instructions by     
telephone from the Owner or a third party to whom the Owner has given   
    appropriate authority. SAFECO must have a copy of the document granting such
authority. Withdrawals will not be processed by telephone.              

SAFECO will employ reasonable procedures to confirm that instructions   
communicated by telephone are genuine, including tape recording all     
    telephone instructions, requiring some form of personal identification prior
   to acting upon instructions received by telephone and confirming in writing
  all such transactions. If SAFECO fails to take such reasonable procedures,
it may be liable for any losses due to unauthorized or fraudulent       
instructions.                                                           

    SAFECO reserves the right to refuse telephone transfers when it is unable to
 confirm to its satisfaction that a caller is the Owner or a preauthorized
third party. SAFECO is not responsible for the authenticity of telephone
instructions or for acting on the telephone instructions of persons who 
falsely identify themselves as Owners or preauthorized third parties.   

To transfer by telephone, call 1-800-899-5280. Transfer directions must 
specify the Contract number, the amount to be transferred and the       
Sub-Accounts which are to be effected. (See also "The Programs," below.)

SUSPENSION OF PAYMENTS OR TRANSFERS 

SAFECO reserves the right to suspend or postpone payments for a Withdrawal or   
Transfer for any period when:                                                   

  (i)  The New York Stock Exchange is closed (other than customary weekend
and holiday closings);                                      

    (ii)  Trading on the New York Stock Exchange is restricted, as determined by
        the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission;

 (iii)  An emergency exists as a result of which disposal of securities held
      in the Separate Account is not reasonably practicable or it is not
 reasonably practicable to determine the value of the Separate
       Account's net assets, as determined by the rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission; or                  

  (iv)  During any other period when the Securities and Exchange Commission,
   by order, so permits for the protection of Owners provided that
   applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
         Commission will govern as to whether the conditions described in (ii)
and (iii) exist.                                            

OTHER SERVICES

THE PROGRAMS 

SAFECO offers several investment related programs which are available only prior
to the Annuity Date: Dollar Cost Averaging; Automatic Transfers; Appreciation or
Interest Sweeps; Sub-Account Rebalancing; Systematic Investment; and Periodic   
Withdrawal Programs. Certain of the Programs are alternatives with respect to   
any one Sub-Account; other Programs may be combined. Thus, the Dollar Cost      
Averaging Program, the Automatic Transfer Program and the Appreciation or       
Interest Sweep Program are alternatives with respect to the selected            
Sub-Account, and in all cases with respect to the Fixed Account. However, the   
Sub-Account Rebalancing Program may be combined with each of the other Programs,
but it is not available with respect to the Fixed Account. Under each Program,  
the related transfers between and among Sub-Accounts and the Fixed Account are  
not counted as one of the twelve free transfers. However, if an Owner executes  
an unrelated voluntary transfer from the Sub-Account participating in a Program,
other than the Sub-Account Rebalancing Program, the Program will be terminated  
for the remainder of the Contract Year. In addition, if a Program is terminated 
before six Program transfers have occurred, the six Program transfers are       
counted as part of the twelve free transfers. If the balance in a Sub-Account   
would be less than $500 as a result of a transfer pursuant to one of these      
Programs, other than the Appreciation or Interest Sweep and Sub-Account         
Rebalancing Programs, then the entire balance in that Sub-Account will also be  
transferred. Each of the Programs has its own requirements, as discussed below. 
Some of the Programs described herein may not be immediately available in states
that have not yet approved the corresponding Contract endorsements.             

If the Owner has submitted the required telephone authorization form, certain   
changes may be made by telephone. For those programs involving transfers, Owners
may change instructions by telephone with regard to which Sub-Accounts or the   
Fixed Account Contract Value may be transferred. If SAFECO does not employ      
reasonable verification procedures to confirm that instructions communicated by 
telephone are genuine, it may be liable for any losses arising out of any action
on its part or any failure or omission to act as a result of its own negligence,
lack of good faith, or willful misconduct.                                      

DOLLAR COST AVERAGING PROGRAM 

SAFECO offers a Dollar Cost Averaging Program during the Accumulation Period    
whereby an Owner may predesignate a portion of any Sub-Account's Contract Value 
or the Fixed Account's Contract Value to be automatically transferred on a      
monthly or quarterly basis to one or more of the other Sub-Accounts or to the   
Fixed Account. The amount to be transferred may be expressed as a set dollar    
amount or as a percentage of the Contract Value in the selected Sub-Account or  
the Fixed Account. Transfers from the Fixed Account are subject to a maximum of 
1.33% monthly or 4% quarterly of the Contract Value in the Fixed Account at the 
time of the initial                                                             

-31-

P-->485BPOS36th Page of 94TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 36th

transfer. Upon election of the Dollar Cost Averaging Program the limitations on 
transfers from the Fixed Account will be calculated. The resultant limitations  
will apply for the entire duration of participation in this Program. Each Dollar
Cost Averaging transfer is subject to a minimum transfer of fifty dollars ($50).

The Dollar Cost Averaging Program is available for Purchase Payments and for    
Contract Value transferred into any Sub-Account. An Owner may enroll in this    
Program at the time the Contract is issued or anytime thereafter by properly    
completing the Dollar Cost Averaging enrollment form and returning it to SAFECO 
at its Home Office at least ten (10) business days prior to the first business  
day of the month, which is the date that all Program transfers will be made     
("Transfer Date"). This Program must be elected for at least a six (6) month    
period.                                                                         

If the Contract Value in the participating Sub-Account or the Fixed Account does
not equal or exceed the amount designated to be transferred on each Transfer    
Date, Dollar Cost Averaging will cease automatically and the remaining amount   
will be transferred.                                                            

Dollar Cost Averaging will terminate when (i) the designated monthly or         
quarterly amounts of transfers have been completed, (ii) the Owner requests     
termination in writing and such writing is received at the Home Office at least 
ten (10) business days prior to the next Transfer Date in order to cancel the   
transfer scheduled to take effect on such date, (iii) the Owner effects any     
other transfer from the participating Sub-Account or the Fixed Account while the
Dollar Cost Averaging Program is in effect, or (iv) the Contract is surrendered.
In addition, if any transfer or withdrawal has been made from the Fixed Account 
during the Contract Year, the Dollar Cost Averaging Program may not be          
established through the Fixed Account for that Contract Year.                   

An Owner may initiate, reinstate or change the Dollar Cost Averaging terms by   
properly completing a new enrollment form and returning it to the Home Office at
least ten (10) business days prior to the next Transfer Date such transfer is to
be made.                                                                        

When utilizing Dollar Cost Averaging an Owner may be invested in either a       
Sub-Account or the Fixed Account and may be invested in any other Sub-Accounts  
or the Fixed Account at any given time.                                         

AUTOMATIC TRANSFER PROGRAM 

The Automatic Transfer Program is identical to the Dollar Cost Averaging Program
in all respects other than with regard to the limitations on transfers from the 
Fixed Account. The limitations on transfers from the Fixed Account are          
recalculated annually. Transfers from the Fixed Account are limited to 1.5%     
monthly and 4.5% quarterly.                                                     

APPRECIATION OR INTEREST SWEEP PROGRAM 

An Owner may enroll in the Appreciation or Interest Sweep Program through either
or both the SAFECO Resource Money Market Sub-Account or the Fixed Account.      
Enrollment is limited to Owners whose total Contract Value is greater than      
$10,000. Under the Program, if appreciation on Contract Value in the SAFECO     
Resource Money Market Sub-Account or credited interest earned on Contract Value 
in the Fixed Account ("Earnings") is greater than 10%, the Earnings up to 10% of
the Contract Value in the Fixed Account or the SAFECO Resource Money Market     
Sub-Account, respectively, will be transferred to any of the Sub-Accounts, other
than the SAFECO Resource Money Market Sub-Account. Earnings in the SAFECO       
Resource Money Market Sub-Account may not be transferred to the Fixed Account.  
In no event may the total Contract Value transferred from the Fixed Account in  
each Contract Year exceed a total of 10% of the Contract Value for each such    
Contract Year in the Fixed Account computed at the time of the transfer.        
Moreover, the Program may not be instituted for the Fixed Account in any        
Contract Year during which transfers or withdrawals have been made from the     
Fixed Account. Transfers under this Program will be processed monthly or        
quarterly on the Transfer Date.                                                 

SUB-ACCOUNT REBALANCING PROGRAM 

In accordance with the Owner's election of the relative purchase payments       
percentage allocations, SAFECO will automatically rebalance the Contract Value  
of each Sub-Account either quarterly, semi-annually, or annually. SAFECO will   
automatically rebalance the Contract Value in each of the Sub-Accounts to match 
the current purchase                                                            

-32-

P-->485BPOS37th Page of 94TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 37th

payments percentage allocations as of the first Transfer Date during the period 
selected. Enrollment is limited to Owners whose total Contract Value is greater 
than $10,000 at the time the Program is selected. The Program may be terminated 
at any time and the percentages may be altered by written authorization. The    
requested change must be received at the Home Office ten (10) days prior to the 
Transfer Date. If the Owner terminates the Program, a new Program may not be    
instituted until the next Contract Year.                                        

SYSTEMATIC INVESTMENT PROGRAM 

Purchase Payments may be made by monthly draft against the bank account of any  
Owner that has completed and returned to SAFECO a Systematic Investment Program 
application and authorization form. The application and authorization form may  
be obtained from SAFECO or from the sales representative. Each Systematic       
Investment Program Purchase Payment is subject to a minimum of one hundred      
dollars ($100).                                                                 

PERIODIC WITHDRAWAL PROGRAM 

SAFECO will make monthly, quarterly or annual distributions of a predetermined  
dollar amount to an Owner that has enrolled in the Periodic Withdrawal Program. 
The Periodic Withdrawal Program is to be distinguished from the Systematic      
Withdrawal Income Plan(TM). (See "Settlement Options.") Under the Program, all  
distributions will be made directly to the Owner and will be treated for federal
tax purposes as any other withdrawal or distribution of Contract Value. (See    
"Tax Status.") An Owner may specify the amount of each withdrawal, subject to a 
minimum of $250. In each Contract Year, up to 10% of Contract Value may be      
withdrawn without the imposition of any Contingent Deferred Sales Charge. If    
withdrawals pursuant to the Program are greater than 10% of Contract Value in   
any Contract Year, the amount of the withdrawals greater than 10% will be       
subject to the applicable Contingent Deferred Sales Charge. Any ad hoc          
withdrawals an Owner makes during a Contract Year will be aggregated with       
withdrawals pursuant to the Program to determine the applicability of any       
Contingent Deferred Sales Charge. If the frequency of withdrawals under the     
Program is greater than annually, SAFECO will charge an annual fee of $25 to    
compensate it for the added administrative costs.                               

Unless the Owner specifies the Sub-Account or Sub-Accounts or the Fixed Account 
from which withdrawals of Contract Value shall be made or if the amount in a    
specified Sub-Account is less than the predetermined amount, SAFECO will make   
withdrawals under the Program from the Sub-Accounts and the Fixed Account in    
amounts proportionate to the amounts in the Sub-Accounts and the Fixed Account. 
Withdrawals are subject to the applicable minimum Sub-Account balances. All     
withdrawals under the Program will be effected by canceling the number of       
Accumulation Units equal in value to the amount to be distributed to the Owner  
and any applicable Contingent Deferred Sales Charge.                            

The Program may be combined with all other Programs except those entailing      
transfers or withdrawals from the Fixed Account. However, the Owner may         
terminate such other program and may begin participation in the Program on the  
first day of the next Contract Year.                                            

It may not be advisable to participate in the Program and incur a Contingent    
Deferred Sales Charge when making additional Purchase Payments under the        
Contract.                                                                       

TAX STATUS

NOTE: The following description is based upon SAFECO's understanding of current 
federal income tax law applicable to annuities in general. SAFECO cannot predict
the probability that any changes in such laws will be made. Purchasers are      
cautioned to seek competent tax advice regarding the possibility of such        
changes. SAFECO does not guarantee the tax status of the Contracts. Purchasers  
bear the complete risk that the Contracts may not be treated as "annuity        
contracts" under federal income tax laws. It should be further understood that  
the following discussion is not exhaustive and that special rules not described 
in this Prospectus may be applicable in certain situations. Moreover, no attempt
has been made to consider any applicable state or other tax laws.

GENERAL 

Section 72 of the Code governs taxation of annuities in general. An Owner is not
taxed on increases in the value of a Contract until distribution occurs, either 
in the form of a lump sum payment, a withdrawal or as annuity payments under the
Settlement Option elected. For a lump sum payment received as a total surrender 
(total redemption), the recipient is taxed on the portion of the payment that   
exceeds the cost basis of the Contract. For Non-Qualified Contracts, this cost  
basis is generally the Purchase Payments, while for Qualified Contracts there   
may be no cost basis.                                                           

For annuity payments, a portion of each payment in excess of an exclusion amount
is includable in taxable income. The exclusion amount for payments based on a   
fixed annuity is determined by multiplying the payment by the ratio that the    
cost basis of the Contract (adjusted for any period certain or refund feature)  
bears to the expected return under the Contract. The exclusion amount for       
payments based on a variable annuity is determined by dividing the cost basis of
the Contract (adjusted for any period certain or refund guarantee) by the number
of years over which the annuity is expected to be paid. Payments received after 
the investment in the Contract has been recovered (i.e. when the total of the   
excludable amounts equals the investment in the Contract) are fully taxable. The
taxable portion is taxed at ordinary income tax rates. For certain types of     
Qualified Plans there may be no cost basis in the Contract within the meaning of
Section 72 of the Code resulting in the annuity payments being fully includable 
in taxable income. Owners, Annuitants and Beneficiaries under the Contracts     
should seek competent financial advice about the tax consequences of any        
distributions.                                                                  

SAFECO is taxed as a life insurance company under the Code. For federal income  
tax purposes, the Separate Account is not a separate entity from SAFECO and its 
operations form a part of SAFECO.                                               

DIVERSIFICATION 

Section 817(h) of the Code imposes certain diversification standards on the     
underlying assets of variable annuity contracts. The Code provides that a       
variable annuity contract will not be treated as an annuity contract for any    
period (and any subsequent period) for which the investments are not, in        
accordance with regulations prescribed by the United States Treasury Department 
("Treasury Department"), adequately diversified. Disqualification of the        
Contract as an annuity contract would result in imposition of federal income tax
to the Owner with respect to earnings allocable to the Contract prior to the    
receipt of payments under the Contract. The Code contains a safe harbor         
provision which provides that annuity contracts such as the Contracts meet the  
diversification requirements if, as of the end of each quarter, the underlying  
assets meet the diversification standards for a regulated investment company and
no more than fifty-five percent (55%) of the total assets consist of cash, cash 
items, U.S. Government securities and securities of other regulated investment  
companies.                                                                      

On March 2, 1989, the Treasury Department issued Regulations (Treas. Reg.       
1.817-5), which established diversification requirements for the investment     
portfolios underlying variable contracts such as the Contracts. The Regulations 
amplify the diversification requirements for variable contracts set forth in the
Code and provide an alternative to the safe harbor provision described above.   
Under the Regulations, an investment portfolio will be deemed adequately        
diversified if: (1) no more than 55% of the value of the total assets of the    
portfolio is represented by any one investment; (2) no more than 70% of the     
value of the total assets of the portfolio is represented by any two            
investments; (3) no more than 80% of the value of the total assets of the       
portfolio is represented by any three investments; and (4) no more than 90% of  
the value of the total assets of the portfolio is represented by any four       
investments.                                                                    

The Code provides that, for purposes of determining whether or not the          
diversification standards imposed on the underlying assets of variable contracts
by Section 817(h) of the Code have been met, "each United States government     
agency or instrumentality shall be treated as a separate issuer."               

SAFECO intends that all Portfolios of the Trust and the Funds underlying the    
Contracts will be managed in such a manner as to comply with these              
diversification requirements.                                                   

-34-

P-->485BPOS39th Page of 94TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 39th

The Treasury Department has indicated that the diversification Regulations do   
not provide guidance regarding the circumstances in which Owner control of the  
investments of the Separate Account will cause the Owner to be treated as the   
owner of the assets of the Separate Account, thereby resulting in the loss of   
favorable tax treatment for the Contract. At this time it cannot be determined  
whether additional guidance will be provided and what standards may be contained
in such guidance.                                                               

The amount of Owner control which may be exercised under the Contract is        
different in some respects from the situations addressed in published rulings   
issued by the Internal Revenue Service in which it was held that the policy     
owner was not the owner of the assets of separate account. It is unknown whether
these differences, such as the Owner's ability to transfer among investment     
choices or the number and type of investment choices available, would cause the 
Owner to be considered as the owner of the assets of the Separate Account       
resulting in the imposition of federal income tax to the Owner with respect to  
earnings allocable to the Contract prior to receipt of payments under the       
Contract.                                                                       

In the event any forthcoming guidance or ruling is considered to set forth a new
position, such guidance or ruling will generally be applied only prospectively. 
However, if such ruling or guidance was not considered to set forth a new       
position, it may be applied retroactively resulting in the Owner being          
retroactively determined to be the owner of the assets of the Separate Account. 

Due to the uncertainty in this area, SAFECO reserves the right to modify the    
Contract in an attempt to maintain favorable tax treatment.                     

MULTIPLE CONTRACTS 

The Code provides that multiple non-qualified annuity contracts which are issued
within a calendar year to the same contract owner by one company or its         
affiliates are treated as one annuity contract for purposes of determining the  
tax consequences of any distribution. Such treatment may result in adverse tax  
consequences including more rapid taxation of the distributed amounts from such 
combination of contracts. Owners should consult a tax adviser prior to          
purchasing more than one non-qualified annuity contract in any calendar year.   

TAX TREATMENT OF ASSIGNMENTS 

An assignment or pledge of a Contract may be a taxable event. Owners should     
therefore consult competent tax advisers should they wish to assign or pledge   
their Contracts.                                                                

INCOME TAX WITHHOLDING 

All distributions or any portion(s) thereof which are includable in the gross   
income of the Owner are subject to Federal income tax withholding. Generally,   
amounts are withheld from periodic payments at the same rate as wages and at the
rate of 10% from non-periodic payments. However, the Owner, in most cases, may  
elect not to have taxes withheld or to have withholding done at a different     
rate.                                                                           

Effective January 1, 1993, certain distributions from retirement plans qualified
under Section 401 or Section 403(b) of the Code, which are not directly rolled  
over to another eligible retirement plan or individual retirement account or    
individual retirement annuity, are subject to a mandatory 20% withholding for   
Federal income tax. The 20% withholding requirement does not apply to: a)       
distributions for the life or life expectancy of the participant or joint and   
last survivor expectancy of the participant and a designated beneficiary; or b) 
distributions for a specified period of 10 years or more; or c) distributions   
which are required minimum distributions. Participants should consult their own 
tax counsel or other tax advisor regarding withholding.

TAX TREATMENT OF WITHDRAWALS - NON-QUALIFIED CONTRACTS 

Section 72 of the Code governs treatment of distributions from annuity          
contracts. It provides that if the Contract Value exceeds the aggregate purchase
payments made, any amount withdrawn will be treated as coming first from the    
earnings and then, only after the income portion is exhausted, as coming from   
the principal. Withdrawn earnings are includable in gross income. It further    
provides that a ten percent (10%) penalty will apply to the income portion of   
any premature distribution. However, the penalty is not imposed on amounts      
received: (a) after the taxpayer reaches age 59 1/2; (b) after the death of the 
Owner; (c) if the taxpayer is totally disabled (for this purpose disability is  
as defined in Section 72(m)(7) of the Code); (d) in a series of substantially   
equal periodic payments made not less frequently than annually for the life (or 
life expectancy) of the taxpayer or for the joint lives (or joint life          
expectancies) of the taxpayer and his or her Beneficiary; (e) under an immediate
annuity; or (f) which are allocable to purchase payments made prior to August   
14, 1982.                                                                       

The above information does not apply to Qualified Contracts. However, separate  
tax withdrawal penalties and restrictions may apply to such Qualified Contracts.
(See "Tax Treatment of Withdrawals - Qualified Contracts" below.)               

QUALIFIED PLANS 

The Contracts offered by this Prospectus are designed to be suitable for use    
under various types of Qualified Plans. Taxation of participants in each        
Qualified Plan varies with the type of plan and terms and conditions of each    
specific plan. Owners, Annuitants and Beneficiaries are cautioned that benefits 
under a Qualified Plan may be subject to the terms and conditions of the plan   
regardless of the terms and conditions of the Contracts issued pursuant to the  
plan. Following are general descriptions of the types of Qualified Plans with   
which the Contracts may be used. Such descriptions are not exhaustive and are   
for general informational purposes only. The tax rules regarding Qualified Plans
are very complex and will have differing applications depending on individual   
facts and circumstances. Each purchaser should obtain competent tax advice prior
to purchasing a Contract issued under a Qualified Plan.                         

Contracts issued pursuant to Qualified Plans include special provisions         
restricting Contract provisions that may otherwise be available as described in 
this Prospectus. Generally, Contracts issued pursuant to Qualified Plans are not
transferable except upon surrender or annuitization. Various penalty and excise 
taxes may apply to contributions or distributions made in violation of          
applicable limitations. Furthermore, certain withdrawal penalties and           
restrictions may apply to surrenders from Qualified Contracts. (See "Tax
Treatment of Withdrawals - Qualified Contracts", below.)                        

On July 6, 1983, the Supreme Court decided in Arizona Governing Committee v.    
Norris that optional annuity benefits provided under an employer's deferred     
compensation plan could not, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,   
vary between men and women. The Contracts sold by SAFECO in connection with     
Qualified Plans will utilize annuity tables which do not differentiate on the   
basis of sex. Such annuity tables will also be available for use in connection  
with certain non-qualified deferred compensation plans.                         

a. Tax-Sheltered Annuities                                                      

  Section 403(b) of the Code permits the purchase of "tax-sheltered annuities"
by public schools and certain charitable, educational and scientific      
organizations described in Section 501(c)(3) of the Code. These qualifying
employers may make contributions to the Contracts for the benefit of their
 employees. Such contributions are not includable in the gross income of the
 employees until the employees receive distributions from the Contracts. The
amount of contributions to the tax-sheltered annuity is limited to certain
maximums imposed by the Code. Furthermore, the Code sets forth additional 
restrictions governing such items as transferability, distributions,      
nondiscrimination and withdrawals. (See "Tax Treatment of Withdrawals -
Qualified Contracts" below.) Any employee should obtain competent tax advice
as to the tax treatment and suitability of such an investment.            

-36-

b. Individual Retirement Annuities                                              

 Section 408(b) of the Code permits eligible individuals to contribute to an
individual retirement program known as an "Individual Retirement Annuity" 
  ("IRA"). Under applicable limitations, certain amounts may be contributed to
an IRA which will be deductible from the individual's gross income. These 
IRAs are subject to limitations on eligibility, contributions,            
transferability and distributions. (See "Tax Treatment of Withdrawals -
Qualified Contracts" below.) Under certain conditions, distributions from 
 other IRAs and other Qualified Plans may be rolled over or transferred on a
tax-deferred basis into an IRA. Sales of Contracts for use with IRAs are  
subject to special requirements imposed by the Code, including the        
requirement that certain informational disclosure be given to persons     
desiring to establish an IRA. Purchasers of Contracts to be qualified as  
  Individual Retirement Annuities should obtain competent tax advice as to the
tax treatment and suitability of such an investment.                      

TAX TREATMENT OF WITHDRAWALS - QUALIFIED CONTRACTS 

Section 72(t) of the Code imposes a 10% penalty tax on the taxable portion of   
any distribution from qualified retirement plans, including Contracts issued and
qualified under Code Sections 403(b) (Tax-Sheltered Annuities) and 408(b)       
(Individual Retirement Annuities). To the extent amounts are not includable in  
gross income because they have been rolled over to an IRA or to another eligible
Qualified Plan, no tax penalty will be imposed. The tax penalty will not apply  
to the following distributions: (a) if distribution is made on or after the date
on which the Owner or Annuitant (as applicable) reaches age 59 1/2; (b)         
distributions following the death or disability of the Owner or Annuitant (as   
applicable) (for this purpose disability is as defined in Section 72(m)(7) of   
the Code); (c) after separation from service, distributions that are part of    
substantially equal periodic payments made not less frequently than annually for
the life (or life expectancy) of the Owner or Annuitant (as applicable) or the  
joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of such Owner or Annuitant (as         
applicable) and his or her designated Beneficiary; (d) distributions to an Owner
or Annuitant (as applicable) who has separated from service after he has        
attained age 55; (e) distributions made to the Owner or Annuitant (as           
applicable) to the extent such distributions do not exceed the amount allowable 
as a deduction under Code Section 213 to the Owner or Annuitant (as applicable) 
for amounts paid during the taxable year for medical care; and (f) distributions
made to an alternate payee pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order. The
exceptions stated in (d), (e) and (f) above do not apply in the case of an      
Individual Retirement Annuity. The exception stated in (c) above applies to an  
Individual Retirement Annuity without the requirement that there be a separation
from service.                                                                   

Generally, distributions from a Qualified Plan must commence no later than April
1 of the calendar year, following the year in which the employee attains age 70 
1/2. Required distributions must be over a period not exceeding the life        
expectancy of the individual or the joint lives or life expectancies of the     
individual and his or her designated beneficiary. If the required maximum       
distributions are not made, a 50% penalty tax is imposed as to the amount not   
distributed. In addition, distributions in excess of $150,000 per year in the   
case of periodic distributions and in excess of $750,000 in the case of lump sum
distributions may be subject to an additional 15% excise tax unless an exemption
applies.                                                                        

TAX-SHELTERED ANNUITIES - WITHDRAWAL LIMITATIONS 

The Code limits the withdrawal of amounts attributable to contributions made    
pursuant to a salary reduction agreement (as defined in Section 403(b)(11) of   
the Code) to circumstances only when the Owner: (1) attains age 59 1/2; (2)     
separates from service; (3) dies; (4) becomes disabled (within the meaning of   
Section 72(m)(7) of the Code); or (5) in the case of hardship. However,         
withdrawals for hardship are restricted to the portion of the Owner's Contract  
Value which represents contributions made by the Owner and does not include any 
investment results. The limitations on withdrawals became effective on January  
1, 1989 and apply only to salary reduction contributions made after December 31,
1988, to income attributable to such contributions and to income attributable to
amounts held as of December 31, 1988. The limitations on withdrawals do not     
affect rollovers or transfers between certain Qualified Plans. Owners should    
consult their own tax counsel or other tax adviser regarding any distributions.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS 

There are no legal proceedings to which the Separate Account, SSI or PNMR is a  
party. On January 9, 1995 a class action seeking actual and punitive damages was
brought by an owner of a qualified pension annuity contract. DeVoy v. SAFECO    
Life Insurance Company, Case No. 684407 pending in the Superior Court of        
California, County of San Diego. With respect to such contracts plaintiffs      
challenge both the representations as to interest rates and the calculation of  
interest. The Company is defending against the action. SAFECO is also engaged in
various kinds of litigation which, in the opinion of SAFECO, is not of material 
importance in relation to the total capital and surplus of SAFECO.

STATEMENT OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION 

SAFECO LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY 
GENERAL INFORMATION 

SAFECO 
SAFECO Life Insurance Company (SAFECO) is a wholly-owned subsidiary of SAFECO   
Corporation which is a holding company whose subsidiaries are engaged primarily 
in insurance and financial services businesses.                                 

During the establishment of the Separate Account, SAFECO contributed capital to 
the Separate Account which was immediately invested in the SAFECO Resource      
Series Trust (Trust). At December 31, 1994, SAFECO's contribution represented   
41.7% and 58.5% of the value of the SAFECO Resource Bond and SAFECO Resource    
Money Market Sub-Accounts, respectively. SAFECO has no present intention of     
withdrawing these amounts from the respective Sub-Accounts.                     

SAFEKEEPING OF THE ASSETS OF THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT 

SAFECO holds the assets of the Separate Account. The assets are kept segregated 
and held separate and apart from the general account assets of SAFECO. SAFECO   
maintains records of all Separate Account purchases and redemptions of the      
shares of each Portfolio of SAFECO Resource Series Trust (Trust), Insurance     
Management Series, Lexington Emerging Markets Fund, Inc., the Lexington Natural 
Resources Trust, and Scudder Variable Life Investment Fund.                     

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS
Ernst & Young LLP, 999 Third Avenue, Suite 3500, Seattle, Washington 98104, is  
the independent auditor of the financial statements of SAFECO and the Separate  
Account.                                                                        

 DISTRIBUTOR

ANNUITY PROVISIONS 

GENERAL 

The Settlement Options and related provisions are described in the Prospectus.  

ANNUITY UNIT 

The value of an Annuity Unit for each Sub-Account was arbitrarily set at $10    
when each Sub-Account was established. The value of the Annuity Unit for any    
subsequent Valuation Period is determined by multiplying the value of the       
Annuity Unit for the immediately preceding Valuation Period by the Net          
Investment Factor for the Valuation Period for which the value is being         
calculated, and dividing the result by the Assumed Investment Factor for such   
Valuation Period.                                                               

ASSUMED INVESTMENT FACTOR 

The Assumed Investment Factor for a one day Valuation Period is 1.00010746. This
factor neutralizes the assumed investment return of 4% in the Variable Annuity  
purchase rate table in the Contract.                                            

VARIABLE ANNUITY PAYMENT CALCULATION 

A Variable Annuity is an Annuity with payments which are not predetermined as to
dollar amount. Payments will vary in accordance with the net investment results 
of the Separate Account. The dollar amount of the first monthly Variable Annuity
payment under Settlement Options (a), (b) or (c), will be determined by applying
the Contract Value (after deduction for premium taxes, if applicable), as of the
15th day of the preceding month, to the Variable Annuity purchase rate table in 
the Contract. The number of Annuity Units to be credited to the Annuitant will  
be determined by dividing the first monthly payment by the Annuity Unit value   
calculated as of the 15th day of the preceding month. This number of Annuity    
Units remains fixed during the Annuity payment period. The dollar amount of each
Variable Annuity payment after the first shall be determined by multiplying the 
number of Annuity Units credited to the Annuitant by the Annuity Unit value as  
of the 15th day of the preceding month.                                         

ADDITIONAL PERFORMANCE INFORMATION

SAFECO RESOURCE BOND SUB-ACCOUNT 

YIELD 

The yield for the SAFECO Resource Bond Sub-Account of the Separate Account for  
the 30-day period ended December 31, 1994 is 5.60%.                             

Yield is computed using the following formula:                                  

6                       
Yield = 2 [ (a - b + 1)  - 1]

cd                                        

 Where: a=   net investment income earned during the period by the portfolio
     company attributable to shares owned by the Sub-Account

   b=   expenses accrued for the period (net of reimbursements and
          including a proportional amount of the annual administration
         charge deducted from Participants' accounts during a 30-day
period)                                           

          c=   the average daily number of accumulation units outstanding during
the period                                        

         d=   the maximum offering price per accumulation unit on the last day
of the period

STANDARDIZED TOTAL RETURN FIGURES 

The "standardized" total return and average annual total return figures quoted  
below are calculated for required time periods based on a set initial investment
amount, include the deduction of an annual Administration Charge assessed, if   
any, to each Participant's Accumulation Account, include any applicable         
Contingent Deferred Sales Charge and assume the reinvestment of dividend and    
capital gains distributions. The amount of the Contingent Deferred Sales Charge 
ranges from 8% to 1% of withdrawal depending on the Certificate Year in which   
the withdrawal occurs.

NON-STANDARDIZED TOTAL RETURN FIGURES 

Following are several examples of "non-standardized" total return and average   
annual total return figures which can be calculated in a variety of ways        
including non-standard time periods, different initial investment amounts,      
additions of periodic payments, use of time-weighted average annual total       
returns, deducting or not deducting the Administration Charge and deducting or  
not deducting the Contingent Deferred Sales Charge. The net change in unit value
is the percentage change from the ending unit value to the beginning unit value 
and is not affected by specific investment amounts.

The formulas used to calculate "standardized" total return and average annual   
total return are set forth below. For "non-standardized" total return and       
average annual total return, the "CDSC" component is removed to calculate       
figures which do not contain the Contingent Deferred Sales Charge, the "AF" is  
removed to calculate figures which do not contain the Administration Charge, the
"P" component will vary depending on the initial investment amount and the "N"  
component will vary depending on the time period selected. Time-weighted average
annual total return figures take into account the length of time an investment  
has been on deposit. Non-standardized figures may cause the performance of the  
Sub-Accounts to appear higher.                                                  

Total return is computed using the following formula:                           

n

Where:      P  =    a hypothetical investment of $1,000               

T  =    total return                          

n  =    number of years                       

       ERV  =    ending redeemable value of a hypothetical $1000
                       payment made at the beginning of the 1, 5, or 10 year
                        periods at the end of the 1, 5, or 10 year periods (or
fractional portion thereof).

SAFECO RESOURCE MONEY MARKET SUB-ACCOUNT 

YIELD AND EFFECTIVE YIELD 

The yield and effective yield for the SAFECO Resource Money Market Sub-Account  
of the Separate Account for the 7-day period ended December 31, 1994, were 3.85%
and 3.92%, respectively.                                                        

Yield is computed using the following formula:                                  

Yield = [(X - Y) - Z - AF]  = Base Period Return x 365/7              
----------------                                    
Y                                     

                         365/7
Effective Yield = [ (Base Period Return + 1)      ]  - 1              

Where:      X = value of one Accumulation Unit at the end of a 7-day  
period.                               

                Y = value of one Accumulation Unit at the beginning of a 7-day
period.                                                                         

      Z = capital changes during the 7-day period, if any.

        AF = proportional amount of annual Administration Charge
                    deducted from Participant's account during a 7-day period.

The computation of yield and effective yield described in this section does not 
include any Contingent Deferred Sales Charge that may be applicable if all or a 
portion of the Accumulation Account is withdrawn within the first eight         
Certificate Years. The amount of the Contingent Deferred Sales Charge ranges    
from 8% to 1% depending upon the Certificate Year in which the withdrawal       
occurs. See "Deduction for Contingent Deferred Sales Charge" in the Prospectus  
for more information.                                                           

NONSTANDARDIZED TOTAL RETURN                                                    

Following are several examples of "non-standardized" total return and average   
annual total return figures for the SAFECO Resource Money Market Portfolio which
can be calculated in a variety of ways including non-standard time periods,     
different initial investment amounts, additions of periodic payments, use of    
time-weighted average annual total returns and deducting or not deducting the   
Administration Charge and deducting or not deducting the Contingent Deferred    
Sales Charge. The net change in unit value is the percentage change from the    
ending unit value to the beginning unit value and is not affected by investment 
amount.

For "non-standardized" total return and average annual total return, the "CDSC" 
component is removed to calculate figures which do not contain the Contingent   
Deferred Sales Charge, the "AF" is removed to calculate figures which do not    
contain the Administration Charge, the "P" component will vary depending on the 
initial investment amount and the "N" component will vary depending on the time 
period selected. Time-weighted average annual total return figures take into    
consideration the length of time each investment has been on deposit.           

Total return is computed using the following formula:                           

[  (AU - AF) x AUV] - (CDSC x P) - P    
       -----------------------------------     x 100
T =                  P                            

Average annual total return is computed using the following formula:            

A = ((the Nth root of { [ (AU - AF) x AUV ] - (CDSC x P) } /P) - 1) x 100 

Where:    T    =    total return                            

A    =    average annual total return   

N    =    number of years               

               AU   =    number of Accumulation Units purchased at the
   beginning of the period

            AF   =    number of Accumulation Units redeemed from
                              Participant's account to pay annual Administration
Charge              

                   AUV  =    Accumulation Unit value at the end of the period.

                CDSC =    Contingent Deferred Sales Charge, which may be
                              applicable if all or a portion of the Accumulation
                       Account is withdrawn within the first eight
                           Certificate Years. The amount of the Contingent
                      Deferred Sales Charge ranges from 8% to 1%
                            depending upon the Certificate Year in which the
withdrawal occurs.

 REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

To the Board of Directors of SAFECO Life Insurance Company and                  
Participants of SAFECO Resource Variable Account B:                             

We have audited the accompanying statement of assets and liabilities of SAFECO  
Resource Variable Account B (comprising, respectively, the Equity, Growth,      
Northwest, Bond, Money Market, International, and Balanced Sub-Accounts), as of 
December 31, 1994. For the Equity, Bond, and Money Market Sub-Accounts, we have 
audited the statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 1994, the   
statement of changes in net assets for each of the two years in the period then 
ended, and the accumulation unit data for each of the five years in the period  
then ended. For the Growth, Northwest, International and Balanced Sub-Accounts, 
we have audited the statement of operations, the statement of changes in net    
assets and the accumulation unit data for the year ended December 31, 1994 and  
for the period from the commencement of operations (January 7, 1993 for the     
Growth and Northwest Sub-Accounts and March 12, 1993 for the Balanced and       
International Sub-Accounts) to December 31, 1993. These financial statements and
accumulation unit data are the responsibility of the SAFECO Resource Variable   
Account B's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these    
financial statements and accumulation unit data based on our audits.            

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing          
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements and accumulation    
unit data are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a  
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial    
statements. Our procedures included confirmation of securities owned as of      
December 31, 1994, by correspondence with SAFECO Resource Series Trust and      
Scudder Variable Life Investment Fund. An audit also includes assessing the     
accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well
as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our 
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.                              

In our opinion, the financial statements and accumulation unit data referred to 
above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of each  
of the respective Sub-Accounts constituting SAFECO Resource Variable Account B  
at December 31, 1994, the results of their operations, the changes in their net 
assets, and the accumulation unit data for the periods referred to above, in    
conformity with generally accepted accounting principles.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                                   
1.  ORGANIZATION                                                                

   SAFECO Resource Variable Account B (Variable Account B) is registered under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, as a segregated unit    
    investment account of SAFECO Life Insurance Company (SAFECO), a wholly-owned
subsidiary of SAFECO Corporation.                                       

    Variable Account B is divided into sub-accounts which are invested in shares
   of a designated portfolio of either SAFECO Resource Series Trust or Scudder
Variable Life Investment Fund.                                          

The five portfolios of SAFECO Resource Series Trust are available to    
 unitholders -- the Equity, Growth, Northwest (NW), Bond, and Money Market
   (MMKT) portfolios. Two portfolios of Scudder Variable Life Investment Funds
  are also available to unitholders - the International (INT'L) and Balanced
(BAL) portfolios.                                                       

The assets of Variable Account B are the property of SAFECO and are not 
commingled with liabilities arising out of any other business of SAFECO.

2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                             

  SECURITY VALUATION -- Investments in mutual fund securities are carried in
 the statement of assets and liabilities at net asset value as reported by
    the Fund. Realized gains or losses on securities transactions are determined
  using the First-In First-Out (FIFO) cost method. Security transactions are
recorded on the trade date.                                             

DISTRIBUTIONS -- The net investment income and realized capital gains of
   Variable Account B are not distributed, but are retained and reinvested for
the benefit of accumulation unit owners.                                

  FEDERAL INCOME TAX -- Operations of Variable Account B are included in the
federal income tax return of SAFECO, which is taxed as a "life insurance
  company" under the Internal Revenue Code. Under current federal income tax
law, no income taxes are payable with respect to operations of Variable 
Account B.                                                              

UNIT VALUE CALCULATION -- For financial reporting purposes, amounts have
  been rounded to the nearest thousand dollars, except for per unit amounts,
which may result in minor rounding differences. Per unit amounts are    
calculated based on precise amounts.                                    

3.  EXPENSES                                                                    

A mortality and expense risk charge is deducted by SAFECO from Variable 
  Account B on a daily basis which is equal, on an annual basis, to 1.25% of
    the average daily net asset value of Variable Account B. The mortality risks
assumed by SAFECO arise from its contractual obligation to make annuity 
    payments after the annuity date for the life of the participant and to waive
  withdrawal charges in the event of the death of a participant. The expense
   risk assumed by SAFECO is that the costs of administering the contracts and
  Variable Account B will exceed the amount received from the administration
 charge. The mortality and expense risk charge is guaranteed by SAFECO and
cannot be increased.                                                    

 The following expenses may be deducted from a contractholder's account by
SAFECO and not directly from Variable Account B. As a fee for expenses  
associated with the administration of the contract owner's account, an  
    annual charge of $30 may be deducted by SAFECO from the accumulated value of
 each contract on the date the initial purchase payment is invested and on
  each certificate anniversary. SAFECO has the right to increase this fee to
$35. In the event that a participant withdraws all or a portion of the  
 participant's accumulation account, i kontingent deferred sales kharge is
  imposed on withdrawals of purchase payments in the first eight certificate
  years. Any premium tax levied by a state or government entity with respect
to the Variable Account B contract will be charged against the contract.
    Fees and charges may vary by product. See the Prospectus "Expense Table" for
further information.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT AUDITORS 

Board of Directors                                                              
SAFECO Life Insurance Company                                                   

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of SAFECO Life      
Insurance Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the    
related statements of consolidated income, changes in stockholder's equity, and 
cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 1994.   
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management.  
Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based 
on our audits.                                                                  

We conducted our audits in accordance with generally accepted auditing          
standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to        
obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of  
material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence   
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit    
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant          
estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial       
statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis   
for our opinion.                                                                

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in   
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of SAFECO Life       
Insurance Company and subsidiaries at December 31, 1994 and 1993, and the       
consolidated results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the   
three years in the period ended December 31, 1994, in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles.                                                 

As described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, SAFECO Life    
Insurance Company and subsidiaries adopted certain new accounting standards in  
1994 and 1993 as required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.

SAFECO LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                      
1.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                  

BASIS OF REPORTING.  The consolidated financial statements have been    
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and
   include the accounts of SAFECO Life Insurance Company (the Company) and its
   wholly-owned subsidiaries, SAFECO National Life Insurance Company and First
SAFECO National Life Insurance Company of New York.  The Company is a   
wholly-owned subsidiary of SAFECO Corporation.                          

All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in the   
consolidated financial statements.  Certain reclassifications have been 
made in the 1993 and 1992 financial statements to conform to current    
classifications.                                                        

 ACCOUNTING FOR PREMIUMS.  Life and health insurance premiums are reported
  as income when collected for traditional individual life policies and when
earned for group and individual health policies.  Funds received under  
pension deposit contracts, annuities and universal life policies are    
   recorded as liabilities rather than premium income when received.  Revenues
 for universal life products consist of front-end loads, mortality charges
and expense charges assessed against individual policyholder account    
balances.  These loads and charges are recognized as income when earned.

INVESTMENTS.  The Company adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board  
(FASB) Statement 115, "Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and   
Equity Securities," on January 1, 1994, applying the provisions of the  
Statement to Investments held as of, or acquired after that date.  See  
discussion of new accounting standards on page 9.                       

Fixed maturity investments (bonds and redeemable preferred stocks) which
the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are 
   classified as held-to-maturity and carried at amortized cost in the balance
sheet.  Fixed maturities classified as available-for-sale are carried at
   market value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses recorded directly
   to stockholder's equity, net of applicable income taxes and deferred policy
   acquisition costs valuation allowance.  The Company has no fixed maturities
classified as trading.                                                  

 All marketable equity securities are classified as available-for-sale and
carried at market value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses    
  recorded directly to stockholder's equity, net of applicable income taxes.

When the collectibility of income on certain investments is considered  
doubtful, they are placed on non-accrual status and thereafter interest 
  income is recognized only when payment is received.  Investments that have
  declined in market value below cost and for which the decline is judged to
be other than temporary are written down to fair value.  Writedowns are 
  made directly on an individual security basis and are included in realized
investment losses in the Statement of Consolidated Income.              

The cost of security investments sold is determined by the "identified  
cost" method.                                                           

Mortgage loans are carried at outstanding principal balances, less an   
allowance for loan losses.                                              

 REAL ESTATE AND DEPRECIATION.  Income-producing real estate is classified
 as an investment.  The Company provides straight-line depreciation on its
buildings based upon their estimated useful lives.                      

   Investment real estate that has declined in market value below cost and for
 which the decline is judged to be other than temporary is written down to
estimated realizable value.  The writedowns are included in realized    
investment losses in the Statement of Consolidated Income.

SAFECO LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                      

Note 1 (continued)                                                              

DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS.  Acquisition costs, consisting of    
commissions and certain other underwriting expenses, which vary with and
are primarily related to the production of new business, are deferred.  

 Acquisition costs for annuities and universal life policies are amortized
over the lives of the policies in proportion to the present value of    
estimated future gross profits.  To the extent actual experience differs
from assumptions, and to the extent estimates of future gross profits   
require revision, the unamortized balance of deferred policy acquisition
   costs is adjusted accordingly.  There were no significant revisions made in
1994, 1993 or 1992.                                                     

Acquisition costs for traditional individual life insurance policies are
amortized over the premium payment period of the related policies using 
assumptions consistent with those used in computing policy benefit      
liabilities.                                                            

   FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS.  Liabilities for universal life insurance policies,
   deferred annuity and pension deposit contracts are equal to the accumulated
account value of such policies or contracts as of the valuation date.   
  Liabilities for structured settlement annuities are based on interest rate
   assumptions using market rates at issue, graded downward over 40 years to a
range of 5-1/2% to 8-3/4%.                                              

Liabilities for future policy benefits under traditional individual life
insurance policies have been computed on the level premium method using 
   interest, mortality and persistency assumptions based on Company experience
   modified to provide for adverse deviation.  Interest assumptions range from
8-1/2% graded to 3-1/4%.                                                

 POLICY AND CONTRACT CLAIMS.  The liability for policy and contract claims
is established on the basis of reported losses ("case basis" method).   
Provision is also made for claims incurred but not reported, based on   
  historical experience.  The estimates for claims incurred but not reported
are continually reviewed and any necessary adjustments are reflected in 
current operations.                                                     

SEPARATE ACCOUNTS. The Company administers segregated asset accounts for
pension and other clients.  The assets of these Separate Accounts, which
   consist of common stocks, are the property of the Company.  The liabilities
of these Separate Accounts represent reserves established to meet       
withdrawal and future benefit payment provisions of contracts with these
 pension and other clients.  The assets of the Separate Accounts, equal to
 the reserves and other contract liabilities of the Separate Accounts, are
not chargeable with liabilities arising out of any other business the   
   Company may conduct.  Investment risks associated with market value changes
   are borne by the clients.  Deposits, withdrawals, net investment income and
realized and unrealized capital gains and losses on the assets of the   
   Separate Account are not reflected in the Statement of Consolidated Income.
Management fees and other charges assessed against the contracts are    
included in other revenue.                                              

   FEDERAL INCOME TAXES.  The Company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated
  federal income tax return with SAFECO Corporation.  Tax payments (credits)
are made to or received from SAFECO Corporation on a separate tax return
filing basis.  The Company provides for federal income taxes based on   
 financial reporting income and deferred federal income taxes on temporary
differences between financial reporting and taxable income.

SAFECO LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                      

Note 1 (continued)                                                              

NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS.  The Company adopted Financial Accounting     
Standards Board (FASB) Statements 106, "Employers' Accounting for       
Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," and 109, "Accounting for  
Income Taxes," in the first quarter of 1993.  See the Statement of      
  Consolidated Income for the effect on income of adoption of Statements 106
   and 109.  For additional disclosure relating to Statements 106 and 109, see
Note 8 and Note 9, respectively.                                        

The Company adopted FASB Statement 112, "Employers' Accounting for      
Postemployment Benefits," effective January 1, 1994.  Adoption had no   
effect on net income.                                                   

The Company adopted FASB Statement 113, "Accounting and Reporting for   
Reinsurance of Short-Duration and Long-Duration Contracts," in the first
quarter of 1993.  Adoption had no effect on net income.  See Note 5 for 
disclosures relating to reinsurance.                                    

   In May of 1993, the FASB issued Statement 114, "Accounting by Creditors for
 Impairment of a Loan," which provides guidance on valuing impaired loans.
   The FASB also issued Statement 118, "Accounting by Creditors for Impairment
  of a Loan - Income Recognition and Disclosures," in October of 1994, which
amends Statement 114.  Both Statements are effective for 1995.  Based on
current analysis, the impact on the Company's net income and financial  
 condition of adopting these Statements is not expected to be significant.

In May of 1993, the FASB issued Statement 115, "Accounting for Certain  
 Investments in Debt and Equity Securities," which expands the use of fair
value accounting for debt and equity securities.  As of January 1, 1994,
 the Company adopted the provisions of this Statement for investments held
 as of, or acquired after that date.  Statement 115 requires that debt and
equity securities be classified as trading, available-for-sale, or      
held-to-maturity.  Fixed maturity securities that the Company has the   
positive intent and ability to hold to maturity (as narrowly defined by 
Statement 115) are classified as held-to-maturity and are reported at   
   amortized cost.  Fixed maturity securities classified as available-for-sale
are carried at market value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses
 recorded directly to stockholder's equity, net of applicable income taxes
   and deferred policy acquisition costs valuation allowance.  Under Statement
115, trading securities are carried at market value with immediate      
 recognition in income of changes in market value.  Since the Company does
not have any securities held for trading, the adoption of this Statement
had no effect on net income.  All marketable equity securities are      
classified as available-for-sale and continue to be carried at market   
value, with changes in unrealized gains and losses recorded directly to 
stockholder's equity, net of applicable income taxes.  As required by   
 Statement 115, no restatement of prior period amounts has been made.  See
   Note 2 for details of the effect on stockholder's equity of the adoption of
Statement 115.                                                          

The FASB issued Statement 119, "Disclosure about Derivative Financial   
 Instruments and Fair Value of Financial Instruments," in October of 1994.
Statement 119 requires the presentation of certain disclosures about    
derivative financial instruments and is effective for 1994.  The Company
has made the additional required disclosures for 1994 in Note 4.

Note 2 (continued)                                                              

As discussed in Note 1, the Company adopted the provisions of FASB    
Statement 115 as of January 1, 1994.  The net effect on stockholder's 
    equity of the adoption of Statement 115 was an increase of $279,957,000 as
of January 1, 1994.  The net increase was comprised of the following  
amounts:  aggregate market value in excess of amortized cost of fixed 
    maturities classified as available-for-sale of $458,471,000, less deferred
  policy acquisition costs valuation allowance of $27,768,000 and deferred
income taxes at 35% of $150,746,000.                                  

  The aggregate market value of marketable equity securities was in excess
  of cost by $10,333,000 at December 31, 1993.  This amount included gross
 unrealized gains of $10,354,000 and gross unrealized losses of $21,000.

The amortized cost and estimated market value of fixed maturities at  
    December 31, 1994, by contractual maturity, are presented below.  Expected
maturities may differ from contractual maturities because certain     
borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without
call or prepayment penalties.

At December 31, 1994 and 1993, the Company held below investment grade
fixed maturities of $174 million and $152 million at amortized cost,  
respectively.  The respective market values of these investments were 
  approximately $156 million and $152 million.  These holdings amounted to
    2.0% of the Company's investments in fixed maturities at December 31, 1994
and 1993.                                                             

  The carrying value of investments in fixed maturities and mortgage loans
that did not produce income during the year ended December 31, 1994 is

Note 2 (continued)                                                              

   Certain bonds amounting to $4,161,000 and $4,066,000 at December 31, 1994
and 1993, respectively, were on deposit with various regulatory       
authorities to meet requirements of insurance and financial codes.    

 At December 31, 1994 and 1993, mortgage loans constituted approximately
5.9% and 5.7% of total assets, respectively, and are secured by first 
 mortgage liens on income-producing commercial real estate, primarily in
  the retail, industrial and office building sectors.  The majority of the
properties are located in the western United States, with 43.7% of the
    total in California.  Individual loans generally do not exceed $5 million.
 For each of these years, less than 2% of the loans were non-performing.

3.   COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES                                              
The Company is obligated under a real estate lease with an affiliate, 
 General America Corporation, which expires in 2010.  The minimum annual
   rental commitments under this obligation are $2,211,000.  At December 31,
1994, unfunded mortgage loan commitments approximated $9,360,000.  The
Company had no other material commitments at December 31, 1994.       

    In January 1995, a class action seeking actual and punitive damages, DeVoy
    v. SAFECO Life Insurance Company, Case No. 684407 in the Superior Court of
California, County of San Diego, was brought against the Company by an
owner of a qualified pension annuity contract.  With respect to such  
  contracts, the plaintiffs have challenged both the representations as to
   interest rates and the calculation of interest.  The Company is defending
against the action.

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES.  Fair value amounts have been determined using   
available market information and appropriate valuation methodologies.   
 However, considerable judgment is required in developing the estimates of
   fair value.  Accordingly, these estimates are not necessarily indicative of
   the amount that could be realized in a current market exchange.  The use of
different market assumptions and/or estimating methodologies may have a 
material effect on the estimated fair value amounts.                    

Carrying value is a reasonable estimate of fair value for cash, policy  
 loans, short-term investments, accounts receivable and other liabilities.

Fair value amounts for investments in fixed maturities and marketable   
equity securities are the same as market value.  Market value generally 
  represents quoted market prices for securities traded in the public market
   place or analytically determined values for securities not publicly traded.

The fair values of mortgage loans have been estimated by discounting the
   projected cash flows using the current rate at which loans would be made to
borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same maturities.      

   The fair value of investment contracts with defined maturities is estimated
 by discounting projected cash flows using rates that would be offered for
similar contracts with the same remaining maturities.  For investment   
contracts with no defined maturity, fair value is estimated to be the   
  present surrender value.  These investment contracts are included in Funds
Held Under Deposit Contracts.                                           

Other insurance-related financial instruments are exempt from fair value
disclosure requirements.                                                

Estimated fair values of financial instruments at December 31 are as    
follows:

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.  The Company's investments in         
mortgage-backed securities of $2.2 billion are primarily residential    
collateralized mortgage obligations and pass-throughs ("CMOs") .  CMOs, 
while technically defined as derivative instruments, are exempt from FAS
   119 disclosure requirements.  The Company's investment in CMOs comprised of
 the riskier, highly-volatile type (e.g., interest only, inverse floaters,
etc.) has been intentionally limited to only a small amount (i.e., less 
than 1% of total CMOs at December 31, 1994).                            

The Company's involvement in other investment-type derivatives is also, 
intentionally, of a very limited nature.  Such derivatives include      
 currency-linked bonds and fixed-rate loan commitments.  Individually, and
   in the aggregate, these derivatives are not material and thus no additional
disclosures are warranted.

5.  POLICY AND CONTRACT LIABILITIES                                             

 REINSURANCE.  The Company protects itself from excessive losses by ceding
 reinsurance to other companies, using automatic and facultative treaties.
Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the Company from its obligations to
policyholders.  A continuing liability exists in the event a reinsurance

POLICY AND CONTRACT CLAIMS.  Loss reserves and health claims, which are 
generally incurred and paid in full within a one-year period, amount to 
less than 1% of total policy and contract liabilities.  Therefore, no   
additional disclosures are warranted.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                      
6.  STATUTORY BASIS INFORMATION                                                 
The Company and its subsidiaries are required to file annual statements 
with state regulatory authorities prepared on an accounting basis as    
  prescribed or permitted by such authorities (statutory basis).  Prescribed
   statutory accounting practices include state laws, regulations, and general
  administrative rules, as well as a variety of publications of the National
Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).  Permitted statutory     
accounting practices encompass all accounting practices that are not    
prescribed.                                                             

Statutory net income differs from income reported in accordance with    
generally accepted accounting principles primarily because policy       
acquisition costs are expensed when incurred, reserves are based on     
different assumptions and income tax expense reflects only taxes paid or
currently payable.                                                      

  Statutory net income and stockholder's equity, by company, are as follows:

                                                                    [Download Table]

The Company has received written approval from the Washington State     
 Insurance Department to treat certain loans (all made at market rates) to
  related SAFECO Corporation subsidiaries as admitted assets.  The allowance
of such loans has not materially enhanced surplus at December 31, 1994. 

7.  DIVIDEND RESTRICTIONS                                                       

Insurance companies are restricted by certain states as to the amount of
   dividends they may pay within a given calendar year to their parent without
  regulatory consent.  That restriction is the greater of statutory net gain
   from operations for the previous year or 10% of policyholder surplus at the
 close of the previous year, subject to a maximum limit equal to statutory
  earned surplus.  The amount of retained earnings available for the payment
of dividends to SAFECO Corporation without prior regulatory approval was
$51,033,000 at December 31, 1994.

8.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS                                                      

SAFECO Corporation and subsidiary companies (the Companies) administer  
defined contribution, defined benefit and profit sharing bonus plans    
covering substantially all employees.  The defined contribution plans   
 include profit sharing retirement plans and a savings plan.  Benefits are
  earned under the defined benefit plan for each year of service after 1988,
   based on the employee's compensation level plus a stipulated rate of return
on the benefit balance.  It is SAFECO Corporation's policy to fund the  
   defined benefit plan on a current basis to the full extent deductible under
   federal income tax regulations.  The cost of these plans to the Company was
$6,329,000, $7,962,000 and $6,519,000 for the years ended December 31,
1994, 1993 and 1992, respectively.                                      

 The Companies also provide certain healthcare and life insurance benefits
   ("other postretirement benefits") for retired employees.  Substantially all
 employees may become eligible for these benefits if they reach retirement
  age while working for the Companies.  The cost of these benefits is shared
with the retiree.                                                       

Effective January 1, 1993, the Company adopted FASB Statement 106,      
"Employers' Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions."
Under Statement 106, the Company now accrues for other postretirement   
benefits during the years that employees provide services.  Prior to    
   adoption of Statement 106, other postretirement benefits were accounted for
on a pay-as-you-go (cash) basis.  The transition obligation (i.e., the  
 accumulated postretirement benefit obligation) of $3,777,000 was recorded
 as a cumulative effect adjustment in the first quarter of 1993 which, net
of tax, resulted in a reduction of net income of $2,493,000.            

Components of the net periodic other postretirement benefit cost are as 
follows:

   Under the cash basis of accounting for these other postretirement benefits,
the expense for the year ended December 31, 1992 was $109,000.

   Other postretirement benefit cost is determined using actuarial assumptions
at the beginning of the year.  The funded status is determined using    
assumptions at the end of the year.  The discount rate used was 8-1/2%, 
  7-1/2% and 8% at December 31, 1994, December 31, 1993 and January 1, 1993,
respectively.  The accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at     
  December 31, 1994 was determined using a healthcare cost trend rate of 12%
for 1995, declining by 1% per year to 6% and remaining at that level    
 thereafter.  The ultimate trend rate of 6% represents a 1% reduction from
the 7% rate used for the prior year's valuation.  A one percentage point
increase in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate for each year would  
increase the accumulated other postretirement benefit obligation as of  
December 31, 1994 by $341,000 and the annual net periodic other         
postretirement benefit cost for the year then ended by $71,000.

9.  INCOME TAXES                                                                

As of January 1, 1993, the Company adopted the liability method of      
   accounting for income taxes pursuant to FASB Statement 109, "Accounting for
   Income Taxes."  This accounting change was implemented through a cumulative
effect adjustment which reduced the net deferred tax liability (and     
increased net income in the first quarter of 1993) by $9,092,000.  Prior
year financial statements and related disclosures which follow the      
guidelines provided in APB 11 were not restated.  Under the liability   
method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the 
 differences between their financial reporting and their tax bases and are
measured using the enacted tax rates.                                   

   Differences between income tax computed by applying the U.S. federal income
tax rate of 35% in 1994 and 1993 and 34% in 1992 to income before income
taxes and the provision for federal income taxes are as follows:

Note 9 (continued)                                                              

   The deferred tax benefit of $10,154,000 for 1994 represents the decrease in
the net deferred tax liability of $81,799,000 excluding a decrease of   
$71,645,000 related to unrealized depreciation of investment securities.

  The deferred federal income tax benefit of $26,135,000 for 1993 represents
  a decrease in the net deferred federal income tax liability of $25,704,000
excluding an increase of $431,000 related to unrealized appreciation of 
marketable equity securities.  The tax related to the increase in       
 appreciation of marketable equity securities approximated $543,000 during
1993.  Of that amount, $112,000, which related to the 1% increase in the
  federal income tax rate, was charged directly to income with the remainder
charged directly to stockholder's equity.                               

Deferred federal income taxes for 1992 were provided on the difference  
between the Company's taxable income and income for financial reporting 
   purposes according to the guidelines provided in APB 11.  The components of
the deferred federal income tax benefit using these guidelines are as   
follows:

ITEM 27.  NUMBER OF CONTRACT OWNERS 

As of September 30, 1995, there were 1,119 Contract Owners and 9,013            
Certificate-Holders of the Registrant.                                          

ITEM 28.  INDEMNIFICATION 

Under its Bylaws, SAFECO, to the full extent permitted by the Washington        
Business Corporation Act, shall indemnify any person who was or is a party to   
any proceeding (whether brought by or in the right of SAFECO or otherwise) by   
reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director of SAFECO, or, while a   
director of SAFECO, is or was serving at the request of SAFECO as a director,   
officer, partner, trustee, employee, or agent of another foreign or domestic    
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, other enterprise, or employee   
benefit plan, against judgments, penalties, fines, settlements and reasonable   
expenses actually incurred by him or her in connection with such proceeding.    

SAFECO shall extend such indemnification as is provided to directors above to   
any person, not a director of SAFECO, who is or was an officer of SAFECO or is  
or was serving at the request of SAFECO as a director, officer, partner,        
trustee, or agent of another foreign or domestic corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, other enterprise, or employee benefit plan. In addition, the    
Board of Directors of SAFECO may, by resolution, extend such further            
indemnification to an officer or such other person as may to it seem fair and   
reasonable in view of all relevant circumstances.                               

Insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the Securities Act of  
1933 may be permitted to directors, officers and controlling persons of SAFECO  
pursuant to such provisions of the bylaws or statutes or otherwise, SAFECO has  
been advised that in the opinion of the Securities and Exchange Commission, such
indemnification is against public policy as expressed in said Act and is,       
therefore, unenforceable. In the event that a claim for indemnification against 
such liabilities (other than the payment by SAFECO of expenses incurred or paid 
by a director, officer or controlling person of SAFECO in the successful defense
of any such action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director, officer or
controlling person in connection with the Contracts issued by the Separate      
Account, SAFECO will, unless in the opinion of its counsel the matter has been  
settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction 
the question whether such indemnification by it is against public policy as     
expressed in said Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such    
issue.                                                                          

ITEM 29.  PRINCIPAL UNDERWRITERS 

   a. SAFECO Securities, Inc., the principal underwriter for the Contracts, also
      acts as the principal underwriter for SAFECO's Individual Flexible Premium
  Variable Life Insurance Policies and Group Variable Annuity Contracts.

c. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 1994, PNMR Securities, Inc.,

Fixed Indexed Annuities





Fixed Indexed Annuities (FIAs) are designed for conservative consumers who want the opportunity for a potentially higher return, without the downside risk.
WHY a FIA?

More growth potential: Interest earned is typically based on changes in the value of one or more market indexes, and money grows tax-deferred.
No downside market risk: Your purchase payment and any previously credited interest are protected from market losses by an interest rate "floor" of 0%.
Access to funds: You have options for withdrawing part or all of your contract value without surrender charges or penalties.1
