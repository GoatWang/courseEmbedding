Amanda L Blauser's Experience
Title: Vp/controller
               Company: Farmers National Bank
Job Details
               Farmers National Bank was founded in July 1900 in Emlenton, Pennsylvania by a group of local businessmen who believed that neighboring banks were neglecting the commercial interests and needs of neighboring merchants and farmers. These founders would be proud to know that our Bank has achieved remarkable success and growth by remaining true to the founding principles of providing superior service to our customers and supporting the communities that we serve. Today we provide a wide array of sound financial products and services to consumers who live and work in the nine counties where we operate in western Pennsylvania. Over the past 116-plus years, our communities have experienced growth, opportunities and challenges. Through it all, the Bank has grown and met these opportunities and challenges along with you, our customers and other constituents. We have remained vital to community development by offering competitive products and services for individuals and businesses that are helpful and meaningful to their success. By understanding communities, we have been able to make timely decisions for housing, job creation, small business development, community support and other local economic needs. We pursue the most prudent banking practices - we gather deposits and provide loans in the communities we serve. We continually give volunteer time and funding to local non-profit and charitable organizations and causes. The Bank was founded with the principle philosophy of providing safe, secure and stable banking services while supporting its communities and providing value to its owners. It strikes me that the Bank's founders would be proud of what we have accomplished to date and would look brightly towards the future as we do. As a community bank, The Farmers National Bank of Emlenton's directors, officers and associates take great pride in serving our many loyal customers. We hope you enjoy the website and encourage you to explore the site and visit one of our seventeen community banking offices. On behalf of everyone here at the Bank, thank you for your patronage and continued support of our proud institution.
