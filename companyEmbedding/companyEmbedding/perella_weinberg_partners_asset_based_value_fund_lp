The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

Our Principles
We are devoted to providing unmatched advisory and asset management services to clients based on high quality independent, financial expertise. Our Business Principles are our values and articulate the Firm’s culture and how we engage with clients. Our entire culture is predicated on trust and experience. Our professionals share an uncompromised dedication to excellence and integrity worldwide.

Business Principles

Clients are everything to us. When we engage with an advisory or investing client, we agree not only to represent them, but to fight for them if the circumstances require it.
We are an entrepreneurial and nimble Firm, unencumbered by bureaucracy and politics. We should use this advantage in every way possible, both internally and externally.
Transparency is vital to our identity, our culture and our success. Complex problems are a prominent feature of our industry and are best solved by early warning, open discussion and a sharing of ideas.
We embrace diversity, not merely because it’s right, but because it creates the most interesting, vibrant and commercial environment.
“I trust you” is the highest compliment we can receive from an advisory client, an investor or a colleague. We should aspire to be the most trusted Firm in our industry.
It takes a special kind of person to enjoy and prosper in our Firm. Our people succeed through their wits, their experience, their relationships and their creativity; without the benefit of armies of people or a huge balance sheet.
While our business model hinges on having experienced senior people with exceptional reputations, our more junior people are the lifeblood of the Firm. We cannot be successful without fully developing the next generation to take the place of the current partners.
Our partnership extends beyond our partners. Every person in the Firm should be devoted, first and foremost, to the Firm’s reputation and well-being. Self-centered or “silo” behavior is antithetical to who we are.
At our Firm, personal ambition and teamwork go hand in hand. Let’s always venerate individual creativity and drive, mindful that each of us, and therefore the Firm, performs most effectively when we operate in a collegial manner.
Every day, we have an obligation to protect, uphold and enhance our reputation.

How Well Are the European Banking Regulations Working? Evidence from Recent Events in Spain and Italy 

In an April 2016 PWP Global Macro Insights paper on Eurozone banks, Dr. Maria Vassalou and Dr. Thomas Cooley discussed the vulnerabilities of the European Banks and the overhauled Eurozone Banking System whose Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) went into full effect in January 2016. At that time, the regulatory framework was incomplete and untested. A year and a half later, it remains incomplete, but no longer untested, warranting a close look at the evidence that has emerged.

From Insight, Opportunity
Sophisticated investors turn to Perella Weinberg Partners for distinct alternative investment solutions.







PWP is a leading global institutional asset manager with an unwavering focus on investors’ needs.
We derive an “investment edge” through harnessing the brightest investment minds around the globe. Across investment strategies, we achieve our objectives of producing attractive risk-adjusted returns in a variety of market environments because of our experience, expertise, and disciplined investment approach. Our investors benefit from this edge across public and private instruments, spanning equity, credit, and real asset investments, both through our direct alternatives and our outsourced CIO capabilities. Today PWP oversees approximately $13.1 billion in assets under management.





Agility / Your Outsourced Investment Solution
Overview
PWP created the Agility platform to provide your organization an Outsourced Investment Team with comprehensive capabilities that can offer customized programs to meet your individual investment requirements. Our team of professionals has decades of experience and executes a proven and disciplined due diligence process to identify and invest with top managers across asset classes.
Value Proposition
Today, the investment landscape is global and more complex than ever. At many institutions, investment management is often under-resourced, and attracting and retaining specialized in-house investment talent is both difficult and expensive. To be an effective fiduciary now requires an institutional approach involving investment, risk management, legal, compliance, and operational expertise. With Agility, PWP can serve as an extension of your staff or volunteer board and offer customized investment programs designed to complement the remainder of your portfolio.
Approach
The Agility platform’s success is ultimately built upon a close, strategic partnership between you and the Agility Investment Team. With a long-term horizon, we construct diversified portfolios by investing across geographies, asset classes, managers, and positions. We use a detailed, proprietary methodology as well as internal and external tools to measure and manage risk in your portfolio. Combined with the support of experienced legal, compliance, risk management, trading and operational teams, we create a customized investment program to complement and enhance your portfolio.

Asset Based Opportunities
Investment Philosophy
This strategy emphasizes capital preservation and cash flow generation from assets purchased at attractive current cash yields and equity-like upside optionality.
Strategy Overview
Our Asset Based Opportunities strategy seeks to uncover mispriced asset based investment opportunities through fundamental analysis and in-depth understanding of asset valuation.
Current market dislocation, including illiquidity, repricing of assets, deleveraging, and regulatory changes, create compelling asset based investment opportunities.
Assets targeted for investment are real assets, including rail cars, aircrafts, vessels, working interests in oil and gas, and commercial real estate and financial assets, including auto loans, credit card loans, franchise loans and equipment lending, small business loans, and other consumer assets.




Diversified Equities
Investment Philosophy
This strategy represents a combination of tactical long/short equity investing and event-driven equity investing within the context of a diversified, low-net portfolio of mid and large cap equities.
Strategy Overview
In the short to medium term the fundamental drivers of stocks can often be diluted or even overridden by other influencers of stock prices such as technicals, macro/thematic factors and behavioral sentiment. As a result, PWP has developed an iterative ‘multiple-lens’ approach that takes into account all of these considerations in developing portfolio construction and managing risk.
To achieve its objective, the strategy invests in both select long and short equity opportunities and event-driven opportunities with a hard catalyst. The strategy leverages significant knowledge synergies between the two strategies and maintains a flexible investment mandate across such strategies in order to take advantage of opportunities presented by the market.

Global Macro
Investment Philosophy
This strategy is highly liquid, investing in equity indices, currencies, sovereign debt, credit, and commodities with a strong focus on risk management in an effort to limit the frequency and severity of drawdowns.
Strategy Overview
The investment strategy is based on fundamental macro-economic research to establish predictive relationships between macro-economic factors and asset returns. These principles are implemented in a rigorous, systematic investment framework. The goal of the strategy is to estimate the dynamics of risk premia across all liquid assets globally in order to identify opportunities to deploy risk to maximize reward. The investment approach incorporates analysis of the current economic environment as well as prediction of the evolution of the business cycle across multiple regions.

TPH Energy Equities Opportunities
Investment Philosophy
This long-only diversified equity strategy focuses on concentrated positions in publicly traded energy equities predominately in North America.
Strategy Overview
The strategy was first deployed in early 2015 to take advantage of one of the most severe corrections in the energy markets since the 1980s. It is a fundamentally-driven, concentrated, long-only equity strategy focused on the “best energy ideas” of the Portfolio Manager. The strategy invests in a concentrated portfolio of public equities focused primarily on the upstream and oilfield service subsectors.



Portfolio Manager

TPH MLP
Investment Philosophy
This is a diversified long-only strategy focused on midstream energy equities and Master Limited Partnerships.
Strategy Overview
The TPH MLP strategy seeks to generate long-term returns in the form of capital appreciation and income.  The strategy predominately invests in North American opportunities with minimal exposure in developed energy economies outside of the U.S.
The strategy’s unique process and coverage of the entire energy infrastructure spectrum, leads to differentiated stock selection with minimal overlap with leading peer funds.  The strategy leverages TPH’s deep technical energy expertise (e.g., engineers, geologists, and energy professionals) that encompasses the full energy value chain.



Portfolio Manager
Diego Kuschnir

    Meet Diego  







TPH Energy Infrastructure
Investment Philosophy
This long/short equity strategy is focused exclusively on energy infrastructure subsectors, such as pipelines, utilities, storage, transmission and water, among others.
Strategy Overview
This strategy is in a small universe of hedged, liquid strategies that invests in the energy infrastructure space. The strategy employs an actively managed portfolio with alpha longs and shorts and proactive hedging to isolate desired exposures and reduce broader energy sector, market, and macro risks.
The strategy seeks to exploit opportunities in the North American energy sector, with a focus on the energy infrastructure spectrum (i.e., midstream/MLP, pipelines, electric and gas utilities, water, transmission, commodity storage, gathering and processing), through investments in liquid, publicly traded securities.
The strategy leverages TPH’s deep technical energy expertise (e.g., engineers, geologists and energy industry professionals) that encompasses the full energy value chain from wellhead to burner tip.



Portfolio Manager
Diego Kuschnir

    Meet Diego  







TPH Private Energy Opportunities
Investment Philosophy
This strategy is a merchant-banking style private equity strategy that makes primarily minority stake, non-control investments in companies across the energy industry.
Strategy Overview
This strategy invests in opportunities that provide capital solutions to companies with attractive risk / return profiles during the current energy correction.  Seeded by one of the largest pension funds in the US, the strategy taps into the proprietary deal flow generated across the TPH platform (Advisory, Capital Markets. and Asset Management) to source attractive investment opportunities. The strategy has three targeted investment scenarios in which it seeks to deploy capital: trough-cycle investment opportunities, development opportunities, and structured opportunities.  The strategy’s opportunistic mandate provides a tactical allocation to energy private equity during the most difficult energy environment since the 1980s.



Investment Committee: Dan Pickering, Chansoo Joung, Bobby Tudor







TPH Midstream Opportunities
Investment Philosophy
This long-only equity strategy focuses on concentrated positions in publicly traded midstream equities, energy infrastructure equities, and Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs).
Strategy Overview
This is a tactical strategy intended to take advantage of the current energy correction.  The strategy is focused on holding limited, concentrated positions predominately in North American midstream equities, energy infrastructure equities, and Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs).

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

Fund Investment Objectives











                                        The investment objective of the Fund is to seek to achieve strong risk-adjusted returns with low volatility and low correlation to the equity and fixed income capital markets. The Fund seeks to achieve this objective by investing in assets that are priced below their intrinsic value due to:  market conditions, asset-specific cyclicality,  proprietary sourcing, and/or owner distress. Identifying such assets involves a combination of:  an assessment of opportunities based on the Investment Team's macro views of a variety of industry sectors and asset classes, sourcing via the Firm's long-standing and broad network of relationships, leveraging the Investment Team's investment experience and access to industry participants to properly value assets, and an exhaustive due diligence process to validate pricing and investment assumptions inherent in each transaction. The Fund compares the risk/return profile of each investment opportunity to other potential investments available across a wide range of asset classes to further maintain its price discipline. The Fund seeks to have a low volatility by making investments that incorporate a margin of safety through a combination of price discipline, asset liquidity, hedging, third party equity and other negotiated structural enhancements. Additionally, many of the assets are likely to have high current income and may have a secondary market (or one may develop) which provides additional loss protection.  The Fund seeks to further protect the portfolio against loss through diversification by transaction and asset class and, in certain situations, transactions that  involve multiple obligors or individual assets.
