 60-day risk-free guarantee

There's no risk with Sage 50c. If for any reason you're not satisfied within 60 days, we'll refund your money.1
Buy Now









If within 60 days of purchase, you are not 100% convinced that Sage 50 is the best accounting program for your business, we will refund your money (less any rebate you have received from the purchase). For first-time customers only.
Minimum one-year commitment required. Valid credit card and Internet access required to activate and maintain support and services.  To ensure continuous service, your Sage Business Care plan is an automatically renewing plan, and you will be charged up to a week prior to your renewal date. The subscription plan is an annual subscription with a lease to the software license; therefore, you can only use the software while you are on the plan. You may terminate your plan with at least ten days’ notice prior to your renewal date and not be charged for the renewal; however, if you terminate your subscription plan or if your subscription payment is not received, you will have read-only access to your data, and full program functionality will not be restored until you have brought your account current. The subscription plan requires that you be on the most current version of the software to continue your subscription.
Sage Drive is only available to customers on the latest release of Sage 50c Accounting and requires a computer with Internet Explorer 10, Firefox, or Chrome and a high-speed Internet connection. Sage 50 data may be accessed from more than one device at a time by one individual each, however only one has full access while the others have read only access, and there are limits as to the amount of data that can be accessed.

How Integrated ERP and CRM Can Benefit Your Business





Does your company have an effective enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution to keep up with constantly changing business trends, but it lags in responding quickly to customer needs? Or are you using a customer relationship management (CRM) application that addresses your customer needs quickly and efficiently, but your back-end office is still functioning on a dated solution?
If you answered “yes” to either of these questions, yours is like many companies that are reluctant to change, either because you want to keep costs low or you are comfortable using your current ERP or CRM solution. Watch this webcast to learn how by integrating modern ERP and CRM solutions you can gain real measurable results in a shorter timeframe.

Sage 300 ERP Customer Ratings and Reviews




 (5 out of 5 stars) 3/12/2015

New user to 300 ERP
We just switched January 1st from Sage 50 to Sage 300 ERP. The transition went smoothly with the size of our company and the number of key strokes. I look forward as we work with our partner, Information Innovators as we expand the usability of the product. We made the transition and were current in 60 days.
—Don G.











 (5 out of 5 stars) 3/12/2015

99% awesome - 1% to improve
We converted to Sage last January 2014 from an IBM based product!  Although any software conversion is work, this one went as smoothly as humanly possible and our business partners - Keystone Business Solutions were awesome! We love the flexibility to view things before printing, paperless office to save trees, ease of working between various modules due to the similarities between modules.
One small thing in payroll that has to be an oversight is related to benefit deductions. There is no way to put a beginning or ending date in a benefit. This makes it difficult at open enrollment for insurance as we are a weekly pay company, so I have one week to remove or add or make any changes to benefits for 350 people.
—CPAsinger











 (5 out of 5 stars) 3/10/2015
Great Experience

Sage has helped our team be more productive and give my company the reports, tools to gain more business.
—Elizabeth

We really like sage 300. It really helps during our analysis to be able to change what is visible on the G/L.
—Hadley

Sage 300

This is my first experience with Sage. I was on SAP before. I have found that it is very user friendly. It was easy to learn to use.
—Diana











 (4 out of 5 stars) 3/10/2015
Sage is working great for our needs, I just need to learn how to use more of it!
We really need to focus on learning how to use Sage to better fit our needs. I know we haven't even scraped the surface of what it can do for us. The support at Sage has been really helpful and I can't wait to learn more.
—Dana W.











 (4 out of 5 stars) 3/10/2015
Senior accountant
Sage 300 is good for documents controlling, vendors information and G/L reports. Need more implementation on job costing and reports by jobs.
—Ana L.











 (5 out of 5 stars) 2/6/2015
love it and my orchid
Thanks to Sage 300 ERP and our orchid software my team is more efficient and effective in our weekly processes and our periodic reporting. We have a fabulous macro that brings our weekly production and payment data seamlessly from our IBM Cognos system painlessly to Sage. We love the ao offset functionality. It again allows us to quickly and efficiently do our a/r and a/p offset process.  And finally the orchid add-on makes our EFT payment processing process absolutely painless.
Anne-Marie B.











 (4 out of 5 stars) 2/5/2015
Segment codes are invaluable
As a charity operating essentially 300 distinct departments, Sage 300 gives us the flexibility to provide the data our employees need.
Ken











 (4 out of 5 stars) 2/5/2015
I am learning it very easily
Sage is great for beginners. It has been around so long so it is very trustworthy. It is always keeping up with its competition.
Arielle B.











 (4 out of 5 stars) 2/5/2015
Works Great for most of our business needs
We are a distributor with light manufacturing and retail.  Sage 300 fits most of our needs out of the box.

`A text that successfully bridges the gap between academic theorizing and practitioner applicability because it uses multiple real-world examples/mini-cases of management techniques to illustrate the well-researched academic theoretical foundations of the book' - Creativity and Innovation Management

`A complete and useful treatment of the domain of product and service decisions. This book is unique in its treatment, dealing with product and service portfolio evaluation, new product/service development and product/service elimination in an integrated manner.  Enlivened by many mini-cases, the book provides a soup-to-nuts approach that will prove very attractive for students and be a valuable reference for managers as well. Highly recommended' - Gary L Lilien, Distinguished Research Professor of Management Science, Penn State University

`Product and Services Management (PSM) is a welcome, up to date summary of the key issues facing firms in developing and refreshing their portfolios. The examples and cases bring the academic arguments clearly into focus and demonstrate the crucial role of PSM in leading the overall strategy of the firm' -
Professor Graham Hooley, Senior Pro-Vice-Chancellor, Aston University, Birmingham

`Managers responsible for and students interested in product portfolio decisions previously had to consult several sources for obtaining up-to-date information; books on new product development, articles on service development, readers on product management, and frameworks for product evaluation and termination. With the book Product and Services Management the reader obtains four-in-one. Avlonitis and Papastathopoulou reveal in a compelling and comprehensive manner why product decisions are the cornerstone of modern marketing and business, and illustrate the theory with numerous mini-cases from Europe and elsewhere. A must read for everyone with a passion for products' - Dr Erik Jan Hultink, Professor of New Product Marketing, Delft University of Technology

This book provides a holistic approach to the study of product and services management. It looks at the key milestones within a product's or service life cycle and considers in detail three crucial areas within product management, namely product/service portfolio evaluation, new product/service development and product/service elimination.

Based on research conducted in Europe and North America, this book includes revealing cases studies that will help students make important connections between theory and practice.

The pedagogical features provided in each chapter include chapter introduction, summary, questions and a further reading section. Additional material for instructors include PowerPoint slides and indicative answers to each chapter's questions.

This book is written for undergraduate and postgraduate students of business administration who are pursuing courses in marketing, product portfolio management, new product development and product policy. 


 
Product as an Economic Variable
 
Types of Product Decisions
 
Product Life Cycle and Marketing Strategy
 
Evaluation of Product/Service Portfolio
 
New Product/Service Development and Portfolio Models
 
Pre-Development Activities of New Products and Services
 
Development, Testing and Launching New Products and Services
 
Successful Adoption and Diffusion of New Products and Services
 
Identification and Revitalization of Weak Products and Services
 
Evaluation of Weak Products/Services and Elimination Strategies
 
Organizational Arrangements for Developing, Managing and Eliminating Products and Services

 





This is a well written and structured book. However, it is more suitable for innovation and management students, rather than marketing students. This book can be improved by linking theory to practice using specific case studies in each chapter.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
