	CAUTIONARY NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS





	 








	 


	This report contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the "Securities Act") and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, (the "Exchange Act"). These forward-looking statements are generally located in the material set forth under the heading "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" but may be found in other locations as well. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from the results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. You should not unduly rely on these statements.



	 



	We identify forward-looking statements by use of terms such as "may," "will," "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "hope," "plan," "believe," "predict," "envision," "intend," "will," "continue," "potential," "should," "confident," "could" and similar words and expressions, although some forward-looking statements may be expressed differently. You should be aware that our actual results could differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements.



	 



	Forward-looking statements are based on information available at the time the statements are made and involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our results, levels of activity, performance or achievements to be materially different from the information expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements in this report. These factors include, among others:



	 








	 





	·





	our ability to execute on our growth strategies;






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	our ability to find manufacturing partners on favorable terms;






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	declines in general economic conditions in the markets where we may compete;






	 




	 




	 






	 





	·





	our anticipated needs for working capital; and






	 


	Where we express an expectation or belief as to future events or results, such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis.


	 



	Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report or the date of any document incorporated by reference in this report. Except to the extent required by applicable law or regulation, we do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events.

	Sichuan Leaders Petrochemical Company







	Notes to Financial Statements






	For the Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 and 2015





	(Unaudited)



	 




	NOTE 1.




	NATURE OF




	BUSINESS






	 




	Organization




	 



	Sichuan Leaders Petrochemical Company ("we," "us," "our" or the "Company"), formally known as Quality Wallbeds, Inc., was incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida on June 29, 2000. From our inception through May 2013, we provided quality space saving custom home furniture and closet organizing systems to the general public. We offered our services to people and companies needing assistance in the organization of their living/work space. In May 2013, our Board of Directors (the "Board") determined that to continue to protect and increase shareholder value, it would be to the advantage, welfare and best interests of our shareholders to consider alternative corporate strategies to generate new business revenue for the Company. The Board proposed that we pursue opportunities in Asia to acquire companies in the wholesale and resale of products in the automotive oil industry. To facilitate this action, the Board voted to dispose of all of our assets related to the retail operation of the wall bed products. This action was approved on May 21, 2013 by shareholders representing 87% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock.



	 




	NOTE 2. GOING CONCERN






	 



	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. The Company had no ongoing business or other source of income and incurred a net loss of ($33,508) for the six month period ended June 30, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about the ability of the Company to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.



	 



	The Company is currently evaluating acquisitions and other business opportunities. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and, or, obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. No assurance can be given that the Company will be successful in these efforts.



	 




	NOTE 3. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES






	 




	Basis of Presentation




	 



	The accompanying unaudited financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ("GAAP") for interim financial information and in accordance with the instructions to Form 10-Q and Article 8 of Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by GAAP for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all adjustments, consisting of normal recurring accruals, considered necessary for a fair presentation have been included. In the opinion of management there have been no changes to the Company's significant accounting policies, referred to in the audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes thereto, included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015, filed March 1, 2016. All Amounts referenced in these Financial Statements and this Report are in US Dollars unless otherwise stated.



	 



	In the opinion of management, all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair statement of (a) the result of operations for the six month period ended June 30, 2016 and 2015; (b) the financial position at June 30, 2016; and (c) cash flows for the six month period ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, have been made. Management believes that these estimates are reasonable and have been discussed with the Board of Directors; however, actual results could differ from those estimates.


	Operating results for the six month period ended June 30, 2016 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for the year ended December 31, 2016.



	 




	Reclassification




	 



	During the six month period ended June 30, 2015 the Company reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform to current period presentation.

	Use of Estimates




	 



	The preparation of financial statements in conformity with US GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company regularly evaluates estimates and assumptions related to the recoverability of deferred income tax asset valuation allowances. The Company bases its estimates and assumptions on current facts, historical experience and various other factors that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the accrual of costs and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. The actual results experienced by the Company may differ materially and adversely from the Company's estimates. To the extent there are material differences between the estimates and the actual results, future results of operations will be affected.



	 




	Cash and Cash Equivalents




	 



	The majority of cash is maintained with a major financial institution in the United States. Generally, these deposits may be redeemed on demand and, therefore, bear minimal risk. The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of six months or less to be cash equivalents. As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015 the Company's deposits with this bank did not exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits. All cash stated in US$ unless otherwise stated. 



	 




	Fair Value of Financial Instruments




	 



	FASB ASC 820-10 "Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures" defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. This ASC also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between (1) market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources (observable inputs) and (2) an entity's own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances (unobservable inputs). The fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels, which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3).



	 



	The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below:



	 








	Level 1



	Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical, unrestricted assets or liabilities.







	 








	Level 2



	Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly, including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar assets and liabilities in markets that are not active; inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability (e.g., interest rates); and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable data by correlation or other means.







	 








	Level 3



	Inputs that are both significant to the fair value measurement and unobservable.







	 



	Currently there are no assets that are required to be fair valued.



	 



	The Company's financial instruments consist principally of cash, prepaid expenses and accounts payable. The recorded values of all these financial instruments approximate their current fair values because of the short term nature of these financial instruments.

	Impairment of Long-Lived Assets




	 



	FASB ASC 360 requires that long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles held and used by an entity be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. We assess the potential impairment of long-lived assets, principally property and equipment, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We determine if there is impairment by comparing undiscounted future cash flows from the related long-lived assets with their respective carrying values. In determining future cash flows, significant estimates are made by us with respect to future operating results of the restaurant over its remaining lease term. If assets are determined to be impaired, the impairment charge is measured by calculating the amount by which the asset carrying amount exceeds its fair value. This process of assessing fair values requires the use of estimates and assumptions, which are subject to a high degree of judgment. If these assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets. The Company owned no long-lived assets as of June 30, 2016 or December 31, 2015.



	 




	Income Taxes




	 



	We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.



	 



	We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.



	 




	Revenue Recognition




	 



	The Company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned. The Company considers revenue realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) the product has been shipped or the services have been rendered to the customer, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable, and (iv) collectability is reasonably assured.



	 




	Stock-Based Compensation




	 



	The Company accounts for stock-based instruments issued to employees in accordance with ASC Topic 718. ASC Topic 718 requires companies to recognize in the statement of operations the grant-date fair value of stock options and other equity based compensation issued to employees. The value of the portion of an award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as an expense over the requisite service periods using the straight-line attribution method.The Company accounts for non-employee share-based awards in accordance with the measurement and recognition provisions ASC Topic 505-50. The Company estimates the fair value of stock options at the grant date by using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.


	No stock based compensation was issued or outstanding during the six month period ended June 30, 2016 or 2015.





	 




	Net Earnings (Loss) Per Share




	 



	The Company computes net income (loss) per share in accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share. ASC 260 requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share ("EPS") on the face of the income statement. Basic EPS is computed by dividing net income (loss) available to common shareholders (numerator) by the weighted average number of shares outstanding (denominator) during the period. Diluted EPS gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method and convertible preferred stock using the if-converted method. In computing diluted EPS, the average stock price for the period is used in determining the number of shares assumed to be purchased from the exercise of stock options or warrants. Diluted EPS excludes all dilutive potential shares if their effect is anti-dilutive. No potentially dilutive debt or equity instruments were issued and outstanding during the six month periods ended June 30, 2016 and 2015.



	 




	Recent Accounting Pronouncements




	 



	We have reviewed all the recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting pronouncements and we do not believe any of these pronouncements will have a material impact on the Company financial statements.

	As of June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the Company has net operating losses from operations. The carry forwards expire through the year 2029. The Company's net operating loss carry forward may be subject to annual limitations, which could reduce or defer the utilization of the losses as a result of an ownership change as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. A valuation allowance has been applied due to the uncertainty of realization.



	 



	The Company's tax expense differs from the "expected" tax expense for Federal income tax purposes (computed by applying the United States Federal tax rate of 34% and State tax rate of 3.3% to income before taxes), as follows:

	The tax effects of the temporary differences between reportable financial statement income and taxable income are recognized as deferred tax assets and liabilities.



	 



	In assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment.



	 



	A valuation allowance has been applied due to the uncertainty of realization.



	 



	As of June 30, 2016 and June 30, 2015, the Company has net operating losses from operations. The carry forwards expire through the year 2023. The Company's net operating loss carry forward may be subject to annual limitations, which could reduce or defer the utilization of the losses as a result of an ownership change as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. A valuation allowance has been applied due to the uncertainty of realization.

	ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS





	 



	The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions. See "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements." Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors discussed elsewhere in this report.



	 




	Overview




	 





	Sichuan Leaders Petrochemical Company ("we," "us," "our" or the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Florida on June 29, 2000 under the name Quality Wallbeds, Inc. In December 2012, we changed our name in anticipation of new business opportunities. From our inception through May 2013, we provided quality space saving custom home furniture and closet organizing systems to the general public. We discontinued our wall bed operations on May 21, 2013.



	 



	We are exploring various opportunities, including the petrochemical field, to determine our best strategic business direction. Since the change in the business model, current management has seen a direct impact on our revenues. Future cash flows, if any, are impossible to predict at this time. We may raise cash from sources other than our operations. Our only other source for cash at this time is investments by others in the Company or our sole director and executive officer, Andy Z. Fan. Any change in our strategic business direction may take years to complete and future cash flows, if any, are impossible to predict at this time.

	Revenue from Operations






	 



	For the six month period ended June 30, 2016 and


	June 30, 2015


	, total revenue was $0 as we have not commenced revenue generating operations following the discontinuance of our Florida wall bed operation in May 2013.



	 




	General and Administrative Expenses



	– Related Party



	 



	For the six month period ended June 30, 2016 and


	June 30, 2015, related party operating expenses were $11,979 and $28,014, respectively. The decrease in expenses between the two periods is directly related to the reduction of management fees paid to the Service Provider. Due to the nominal work load needed by the Service Provider the contract was renewed on January 1, 2016, and both parties agreed the management fee would be reduced to $1,996 per month as compared to $6,350 per month during the six month period ended June 30, 2015.



	 




	General and Administrative Expenses






	 



	For the six month period ended June 30, 2016 and


	June 30, 2015, general and administrative expenses were $16,647 and $13,315, respectively, which consist of those expenses related to the current operations of the Company. The increase in expenses between the two periods related to an increase in our costs to file our periodic reports via EDGAR, and our increase in auditor fees.



	 




	Net Income (Loss)






	 



	As a result of the factors described above, there was a net loss of ($33,508) and ($44,655) for the six month period ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

	For the three month period ended June 30, 2016 and


	June 30, 2015, related party operating expenses were $5,989 and $8,964, respectively. The decrease in expenses between the two periods is directly related to the reduction of management fees paid to the Service Provider.

	As a result of the factors described above, there was a net loss of ($12,017) and ($16,284) for the three month period ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.



	 




	Liquidity and Capital Resources




	 




	General.






	 



	At June 30, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $43,513. We have historically met our cash needs through cash flows from operating activities. However, since the discontinuation of our Florida wall bed operation the


	controlling shareholders have pledged to continue their support to fund the continuing operations, as necessary


	. Our cash requirements are generally for general and administrative activities. We have raised capital through officer loans during the current previous fiscal year. We believe that our cash balance is not sufficient to finance our cash requirements for expected operational activities, capital improvements and therefore we will require additional funding through officer loans.



	 



	In the event we are unable to generate sufficient funds to continue our business efforts or if we are pursued by a larger company for a business combination, we will analyze all strategies to continue the Company and maintain or increase shareholder value. Under these circumstances, we would consider a merger, acquisition, joint venture, strategic alliance, a roll-up, or other business combination for the purposes of continuing the business and maintaining or increasing shareholder value. Management believes its responsibility to maintain shareholder value is of paramount importance, which means we should consider the aforementioned alternatives in the event funding is not available on favorable terms to us when needed.



	 




	Operating activities




	 



	Our continuing operating activities used cash of ($24,868) and of ($49,152) for the six month period ended June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively.



	 




	Investing Activities




	 



	We neither generated nor used funds in continuing investing activities during the six month period ended month period ended June 30, 2016 or 2015.



	 




	Financing activities




	 



	Cash provided in our financing activities was $0 for the six month period ended June 30, 2016, compared to cash provided of $110,000 during the comparable period in 2015. During the six month period ended June 30, 2015, the majority shareholder loaned the company $110,000.

	Going Concern




	 



	The accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We had no ongoing business or other source of income and incurred a net loss of ($33,508) for the six month period ended June 30, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.



	 



	We are currently evaluating acquisitions and other business opportunities. The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon us generating profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due. No assurance can be given that we will be successful in these efforts.



	 




	Income Taxes




	 


	We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.


	 


	We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.


	 




	Inflation






	 



	Inflation does not materially affect our business or the results of our operations.



	 




	Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements




	 



	We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.



	 




	Critical Accounting Policies




	 


	We prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States ("GAAP"). GAAP represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements. The preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Our actual results could differ from those estimates. We use historical data to assist in the forecast of our future results. Deviations from our projections are addressed when our financials are reviewed on a monthly basis. This allows us to be proactive in our approach to managing our business. It also allows us to rely on proven data rather than having to make assumptions regarding our estimates.

	ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK





	 



	We are a "smaller reporting company" as defined by Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K, and as such are not required to provide the information contained in this item pursuant to Item 305 of Regulation S-K.




	 







	ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES







	 





	Disclosure Controls and Procedures.





	 



	The management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Company's internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the Company's Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company's financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.



	 



	  With respect to the period ending June 30, 2016, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.



	 



	  Based upon our evaluation regarding the period ending June 30, 2016, the Company's management, including its Principal Executive Officer, has concluded that its disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to the Company's limited internal resources and lack of ability to have multiple levels of transaction review. Material weaknesses noted are lack of an audit committee, lack of a majority of outside directors on the board of directors, resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures; and management is dominated by two individuals, without adequate compensating controls. However, management believes the financial statements and other information presented herewith are materially correct.



	 



	  The Company's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives. However, the Company's management, including its Principal Executive Officer, does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all error and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefit of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.

	a.



	All significant deficiencies and material weakness in the design or operation of internal control over financial reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the registrant's ability to record, process, summarize and report financial information; and

The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and
related notes included elsewhere in this annual report. This discussion contains
forward-looking statements that involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions.
See "Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements." Our actual results
could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements
as a result of certain factors discussed elsewhere in this annual report.



Overview



We were incorporated in the State of Florida on June 29, 2000 under the name
Quality Wallbeds, Inc. In December 2012, we changed our name in anticipation of
new business opportunities in the distribution of petrochemical products in the
automotive industry. From our inception through May 2013, we provided custom
home furniture and closet organizing systems. We discontinued our wall bed
operations in May, 2013. Since then we have focused our efforts on exploring
various business opportunities to determine the best strategic business
direction. Although we have not abandoned the business model for the
distribution of petrochemical products in the automotive industry, we are also
pursuing mergers and acquisitions of non-petrochemical companies in Asia and the
United States. Since the change in the business model, current management has
seen a direct impact on our revenues. Future cash flows, if any, are impossible
to predict at this time. We may raise cash from sources other than our
operations. Our only other source for cash at this time is loans from our
Chairman, Andy Fan. Any change in our strategic business direction may take
years to complete and future cash flows, if any, are impossible to predict at
this time.

Results of Operations




The following table provides a comparison of a summary of our results for the
fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.



                                       Fiscal Years Ended December 31,

Revenue from Operations



For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, there was no revenue.
General and Administrative Expenses
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, general and administrative
expenses of $27,852 consist of those expenses related to the payment of our
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") and Exchange Act reporting filing
expenses, including associated accounting fees and any potential business
ventures.
General and Administrative Expenses - Related Party
During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, operating expenses of $23,957
consist of those expenses related to the management fees paid to the Service
Provider.




Net Income (Loss)




As a result of the factors described above, we show a net loss of ($18,955,230)
for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 as compared to ($69,228) for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. Management believes the loss from
operations is consistent with the change in direction.
Liquidity and Capital Resources



General



At December 31, 2016, we had cash and cash equivalents of $21,316. We have met
our cash needs through cash flows from officer loans throughout the current
fiscal year. Our cash requirements are generally for general and administrative
activities. We believe that our cash balance is not sufficient to finance our
cash requirements for expected operational activities, capital improvements and
therefore we will require additional funding.
In the event we are unable to generate sufficient funds to continue our business
efforts or if we are pursued by a larger company for a business combination, we
will analyze all strategies to continue the Company and maintain or increase
shareholder value. Under these circumstances, we would consider a merger,
acquisition, joint venture, strategic alliance, a roll-up, or other business
combination for the purposes of continuing the business and maintaining or
increasing shareholder value. Management believes its responsibility to maintain
shareholder value is of paramount importance, which means we should consider the
aforementioned alternatives in the event funding is not available on favorable
terms to us when needed.




          8

  Table of Contents




Operating activities



Our continuing operating activities used cash of ($47,065) and ($64,711) for the
fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.



Investing Activities



We neither generated nor used funds in continuing investing activities during
the fiscal years ended December 31, 2016 or 2015.



Financing activities



Net cash from our financing activities was $0 for the fiscal year ended December
31, 2016, compared to $110,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2015.
As of December 31, 2016, our current assets exceed our liabilities.



Going Concern



The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going
concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. We had no ongoing business or
other source of income and incurred a net loss of ($18,955,230) for the fiscal
year ended December 31, 2016. These factors raise substantial doubt about our
ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time.
We are currently evaluating acquisitions and other business opportunities. The
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon us generating
profitable operations in the future and/or obtaining the necessary financing to
meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business
operations when they come due. No assurance can be given that we will be
successful in these efforts.



Income Taxes



We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method, which requires
the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future
tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements.
Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on
temporary differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets
and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the
differences are expected to reverse. The effect of a change in tax rates on
deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that
includes the enactment date.
We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will
more likely than not be realized. In making such determination, we consider all
available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing
taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, tax planning
strategies and recent financial operations. In the event we were to determine
that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in
excess of their net recorded amount, we would make an adjustment to the
valuation allowance, which would reduce the provision for income taxes.



Inflation



Inflation does not materially affect our business or the results of our
operations.




          9

  Table of Contents




Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements
We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements.



Critical Accounting Policies



We prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles of the United States ("GAAP"). GAAP represents a
comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements. The
preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. Our actual results could differ from those estimates. We use
historical data to assist in the forecast of our future results. Deviations from
our projections are addressed when our financials are reviewed on a monthly
basis. This allows us to be proactive in our approach to managing our business.
It also allows us to rely on proven data rather than having to make assumptions
regarding our estimates.
Management does not believe that our actual results are related to any
sensitivity in estimates made by management. The year-end consistency of our
results has shown that our prior year's historical data is the best projector of
our future results.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
We have reviewed all the recently issued, but not yet effective, accounting
pronouncements and we do not believe any of these pronouncements will have a
material impact on our financial statements.© Edgar Online, source Glimpses

Upon registration with the U.S. Securities Exchange Commission, 3,374,980 of 
our outstanding shares of common stock will be eligible for sale under the 
Securities Act.  We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of the common 
stock offered through this prospectus. We will however incur all costs 
associated with this registration statement and prospectus. There is no 
minimum amount of shares that must be sold during this offering.


To compete effectively in our industry, a company must understand and then 
respond to the specific needs of the client. Many of our competitors have 
greater financial resources than we have, enabling them to finance 
acquisition and development opportunities or develop and support their own 
operations. In addition, many of these companies can offer additional product 
offerings not provided by us. Many also have greater name recognition. Our 
competitors may have the luxury of sacrificing profitability in order to 
capture a greater portion of the market. Consequently, we may encounter 
significant competition in our efforts to achieve our growth objectives. Our 
competitors have methods of operation that have been proven over time to be 
successful. 

Since we are in a recessionary period our large competitors have chosen to 
advertise low prices in an effort to gain sales. Our former President Lloyd 
Burkley chose not to compete on a price basis and continued an advertising 
campaign based on quality.  Our incoming President, Catherine A. Bradaick, 
has extensive experience in advertising and the company has chosen to compete 
by offering quality products and time sensitive installations as the main 
selling points of our services.  It is too early to be able to analyze the 
results of this new advertising approach.


Company Description
Since incorporation on June 29, 2000, Quality WallBeds, Inc. has engaged in 
the operation of a furniture retail store specializing in the design, 
construction and installation of wall beds, closets and shelving. 

Quality WallBeds, Inc. will continue to rely on its experience to try to be


 
competitive in the marketing of its specialty wall bed systems, closets and 
shelves. We believe that because we use personnel experienced as space-saving 
specialists for the home and business we may have a competitive advantage. 
Our company will continue to use personnel with experience in the design and 
installation of our product to try to maintain what we believe is a strong 
competitive edge.  Due to recession that began in 2008 we have seen a 
fluctuation in the number of clients utilizing our space saving options. We 
believe we can increase our market share due to the quality of our organizing 
systems; however, there is no guarantee we will be able to do so. By analyzing 
the advertising of other competitive companies, we know that a low price 
advertising campaign for us will not be successful because competition has 
brought the pricing of our type of products to essentially the same price. 
We believe that by concentrating our efforts on the quality of our products 
while providing for cost effectiveness we can grow and expand our business 
however there is no guarantee that we will be successful at achieving growth 
and expansion. Our St. Petersburg store is our sole location and our efforts 
at expansion are focused solely on gaining additional market share for this 
location through a concentrated advertising effort. 

While our key personnel have over twelve (12) years’ experience in this 
business, we do not believe that we have a competitive advantage as a result 
of this experience. Our competitors have personnel with more experience that 
may place us at a disadvantage with larger projects. Due to the number of 
competitors that have entered our target market, experience has become less 
of a competitive advantage.  Being in a market segment with a high number of 
competitors makes any investment in our Company a high risk. 

We do compete with many national wall bed businesses such as Murphy’s Bed 
Outlet; Closets by Design; Bedder Bed; and Comfort Zone Wall Beds. These 
firms have experienced personnel, years in business, capitalization, and a 
reputation that make it difficult for us to compete with.  As a result of 
such competition, we will concentrate our efforts on trying to more fully 
develop the personal relationship approach to our business to try to 
differentiate our company while utilizing high quality 3D design software.

--------

We were incorporated in Florida on June 29, 2000. Our principal address is 
2820 16th Street North, St. Petersburg, Florida, 33704.  Our phone number is 
(727) 535-1917. Our website is  www.qualitywallbeds.com.
