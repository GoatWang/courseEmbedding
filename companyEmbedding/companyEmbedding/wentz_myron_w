Education[edit]
Wentz holds a BSc degree in biology from North Central College in Naperville, Illinois, an MSc degree in microbiology from the University of North Dakota, and a PhD degree in microbiology and immunology from the University of Utah.[1]
Professional history[edit]
In 1974, Wentz launched Gull Laboratories as a one-man operation and developed a test for diagnosing Epstein-Barr virus infection. The company was later sold to Fresenius, a German medical products company, in 1994, although Dr. Wentz continued as Chairman until 1998.[2] Wentz sold his controlling interests in Gull Laboratories in 1992 and founded USANA Health Sciences in the same year.
Wentz also founded the Sanoviv Medical Institute in 1998, an alternative and holistic medicine center located near Rosarito, Mexico. Wentz served as President of Sanoviv from 1999-2010.[3] The current president is Seth Miller, USANA’s former Director of International Business Development.[4][5]
Wentz and his family are the sole owners of Gull Holdings, Ltd., an Isle of Man company,[6] which in turn, is controlled by an entity registered in Liechtenstein, both well known tax haven countries.[7] Through Gull Holdings, Wentz owns 51% of USANA.[8]
Shareholder lawsuit[edit]
On April 4, 2007, Wentz was named as a defendant in a class-action lawsuit brought against USANA by company shareholders. The suit alleged that USANA presented materially false and misleading information about the company’s financial situation and business practices. Included in the allegations were that USANA's business model was unsustainable and amounted to a pyramid scheme. The suit cited several allegations from a report released by Barry Minkow and the Fraud Discovery Institute.[9]
Citizenship[edit]
Wentz has been criticized for having renounced his American citizenship in the mid-nineties, and for now claiming citizenship in Saint Kitts and Nevis, reportedly due to tax purposes as the country is known for being a tax haven. Former USANA CFO, Gilbert Fuller, responded to this criticism by stating that Wentz's decision to renounce his US citizenship had nothing to do with the company.[10] Wentz and his companion, Prudence Conley, now live in Rosarito, Mexico.
Awards[edit]
In 2007, Dr. Wentz was awarded the Albert Einstein Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Life Sciences by Global Capital Associates, an obscure American investment firm.[11] This award should not be confused with many others named after the famous physicist, mainly the more prestigious and well-known Albert Einstein World Award of Science given by the World Cultural Council and Albert Einstein Award in theoretical physics.
Wentz donated $10 million to his alma mater, North Central College,[12] which helped to fund construction of the Wentz Concert Hall, a $30 million performing arts facility named after Wentz. In June 2011, the College awarded Wentz an honorary doctor of science degree for lifetime achievement in the sciences.[13]

Meet The Founder



   
Dr. Myron Wentz, internationally recognized microbiologist, immunologist, and pioneer in the development of human cell culture technology and infectious disease diagnoses, holds a bachelor's degree in biology from North Central College in Naperville, Illinois, a master's degree in microbiology from the University of North Dakota, and a Ph.D. in microbiology and immunology from the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. 
Dr. Wentz launched Gull Laboratories as a one-man operation in 1974. By June of 1977, several of his viral diagnostic assays were FDA-approved and ready for marketing to hospitals and clinical laboratories. He developed the first commercially available test for diagnosing infection with the Epstein-Barr virus. Dr. Wentz sold his controlling interests in Gull Laboratories in 1992 and founded USANA Health Sciences, a state-of-the-art manufacturer of nutritional supplements, foods, and personal-care products. 
  
In addition to Gull Laboratories and USANA Health Sciences, Dr. Wentz created Sanoviv Medical Institute, a holistic medical facility with full hospital accreditation located in Baja California. In recent years Dr. Wentz has turned his attention to charitable and humanitarian concerns, founding the Wentz Medical Centre and Laboratory in Uganda and the Wentz Medical Centre in Cambodia to serve children in those countries orphaned by diseases such as malaria and HIV.

Dr. Wentz















Dr. WentzScientist
Dr. Myron Wentz is an internationally recognized pioneer in the use of human cell culture technology for the diagnosis of infectious disease. He received a Ph.D. in microbiology with a specialty in immunology from the University of Utah, an M.S. degree in microbiology from the University of North Dakota and a B.S. degree in biology from North Central College. From 1969 to 1973, Wentz served as director of microbiology for Methodist Medical Center, Proctor Community Hospital and Pekin Memorial Hospital, all in Peoria, Illinois.
In the early 1970s, Wentz founded Salt Lake City-based Gull Laboratories and spent 20 years developing, manufacturing and marketing medical diagnostic test kits designed to detect infections and certain autoimmune disorders. The most successful of Gull's products was the first commercially available test for the diagnosis of infection with the Epstein-Barr virus. Wentz served as president and chairman of Gull from 1974 to 1992 and continued on as chairman and director of research until 1998.
While Gull played a critical role in the world health arena, Wentz believed that disease prevention was as important as disease detection. He and other scientists were discovering the value of antioxidants in countering the negative effect of free radicals in the human body. Free radicals are believed to be the cause of many degenerative diseases, and spawn from a variety of factors including pollution, high-fat diets, lack of exercise, and smoking. Wentz became convinced that the single most effective thing people could do to prevent degenerative disease was to receive proper nutrition. Wentz' insights into nutrition came from the most basic level of all: the individual human cell.
In order to develop the best assays for Gull, Wentz had to develop the best viral antigens, which required growing healthy, functioning cells. Creating a refined nutritional system to keep laboratory cells healthy led Wentz to a firm conviction: The principles of good nutrition are universal. If one could provide the human body with comprehensive nutrition, one could sustain long-term health.
Armed with these insights, Wentz founded USANA Health Sciences in 1992. The name "USANA" is derived from Greek and Latin and means “true health.” A state-of-the-art manufacturer of nutritional supplements, USANA soon became a respected leader in the industry, with a full line of nutritional products designed to provide a complete and balanced spectrum of beneficial nutrients.
In 1998, Wentz took his vision of health a step further when he founded Sanoviv Medical Institute, a luxurious health and wellness center located in Baja California. Sanoviv is a fully accredited, cutting-edge medical facility that blends state-of-the-art medicine with a holistic approach to healing.
Wentz was presented in June 2007 with the Albert Einstein Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Life Sciences. He accepted the award from Global Capital Associates in Jerusalem at a conference of political, business and scientific leaders.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/21/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

You should conduct research and perform a thorough investigation as to the characteristics of any securities you intend to purchase.  Before investing, you should read the prospectus, offering circular, indenture, or similar document carefully for a full description of the product, including its features and risks, to determine whether it is an appropriate investment for your investment objectives, risk tolerance, financial situation and other individual factors, and be sure to re-evaluate those factors on a periodic basis.Performance data shown represents past performance, which is no guarantee of future results. Current performance may be higher or lower than the performance data quoted.  Yield and return will vary, therefore, you may have a gain or loss when you sell your shares.Stock markets are volatile and can decline significantly in response to adverse issuer, political, regulatory, market, or economic developments.  Growth stocks can be more volatile than other types of stocks.  Value stocks can continue to be undervalued by the market for long periods of time.  Foreign securities are subject to interest-rate, currency-exchange-rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets.  Illiquidity is an inherent risk associated with investing in real estate and REITs.  There is no guarantee the issuer of a REIT will maintain the secondary market for its shares and redemptions may be at a price which is more or less than the original price paid.  Closed-end funds can trade at a discount to their NAV.  Shareholders of Master Limited Partnerships may be treated as partners for tax purposes.  Partnerships issue a Schedule K-1 (Form 1065) rather than a Form 1099 form for tax purposes. It lists the partner's share of income, deductions, credits, etc.  Speak with your tax advisor to determine how this may affect you.  A royalty trust is a type of corporation, mostly in the United States or Canada, usually involved in oil and gas production or mining.  Royalty trusts may have special tax treatment, so you should consult a tax advisor on the potential tax consequences of investing in them.News, commentary and events are from third-party sources unaffiliated with Fidelity.

					About
				

					Dr. Myron Wentz is an internationally recognized microbiologist, immunologist, and pioneer in the development of human cell culture technology and infectious disease diagnoses. Dr. Wentz founded Gull Laboratories in 1974 and developed the first commercially available diagnostic test for the Epstein-Barr virus. In June 2007, he was honored with the Albert Einstein Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Life Sciences.
				

					Early Life
				

					Myron Wentz was drawn to both science and music from an early age, and he was an accomplished trumpet player. He even considered pursuing music professionally.
				

					At the age of 17, Myron Wentz lost his father to heart disease, and throughout his life many of his family members suffered from degenerative diseases. These traumatic events, combined with his passion for the life sciences, helped shape his purpose in life—to improve the health and well-being of people all over the world.
				

					Education
				

					Dr. Wentz holds a bachelor's degree in biology from North Central College in Naperville, Illinois, a master's degree in microbiology from the University of North Dakota, and a PhD in microbiology and immunology from the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.
				

					Philanthropy
				

					Because of his vision for a healthier and better world, Dr. Wentz is a devoted humanitarian and philanthropist. He is the inspiration for the USANA True Health Foundation, a charity with a mission to help those in need and those affected by crisis and natural disasters. He founded the Wentz Medical Center and Laboratory in Uganda and the Wentz Medical Center in Cambodia, which serve children orphaned by diseases such as malaria and HIV. With the generous donations of many USANA Associates, a facility bearing Dr. Wentz’ name was also established in Malawi. In 2006, Dr. Wentz was a recipient of the Children’s Champion Award, presented by the Children’s Hunger Fund.
				

					Dr. Wentz has also donated generously to his alma mater, North Central College.

Education[edit]
Wentz holds a BSc degree in biology from North Central College in Naperville, Illinois, an MSc degree in microbiology from the University of North Dakota, and a PhD degree in microbiology and immunology from the University of Utah.[1]
Professional history[edit]
In 1974, Wentz launched Gull Laboratories as a one-man operation and developed a test for diagnosing Epstein-Barr virus infection. The company was later sold to Fresenius, a German medical products company, in 1994, although Dr. Wentz continued as Chairman until 1998.[2] Wentz sold his controlling interests in Gull Laboratories in 1992 and founded USANA Health Sciences in the same year.
Wentz also founded the Sanoviv Medical Institute in 1998, an alternative and holistic medicine center located near Rosarito, Mexico. Wentz served as President of Sanoviv from 1999-2010.[3] The current president is Seth Miller, USANA’s former Director of International Business Development.[4][5]
Wentz and his family are the sole owners of Gull Holdings, Ltd., an Isle of Man company,[6] which in turn, is controlled by an entity registered in Liechtenstein, both well known tax haven countries.[7] Through Gull Holdings, Wentz owns 51% of USANA.[8]
Shareholder lawsuit[edit]
On April 4, 2007, Wentz was named as a defendant in a class-action lawsuit brought against USANA by company shareholders. The suit alleged that USANA presented materially false and misleading information about the company’s financial situation and business practices. Included in the allegations were that USANA's business model was unsustainable and amounted to a pyramid scheme. The suit cited several allegations from a report released by Barry Minkow and the Fraud Discovery Institute.[9]
Citizenship[edit]
Wentz has been criticized for having renounced his American citizenship in the mid-nineties, and for now claiming citizenship in Saint Kitts and Nevis, reportedly due to tax purposes as the country is known for being a tax haven. Former USANA CFO, Gilbert Fuller, responded to this criticism by stating that Wentz's decision to renounce his US citizenship had nothing to do with the company.[10] Wentz and his companion, Prudence Conley, now live in Rosarito, Mexico.
Awards[edit]
In 2007, Dr. Wentz was awarded the Albert Einstein Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Life Sciences by Global Capital Associates, an obscure American investment firm.[11] This award should not be confused with many others named after the famous physicist, mainly the more prestigious and well-known Albert Einstein World Award of Science given by the World Cultural Council and Albert Einstein Award in theoretical physics.
Wentz donated $10 million to his alma mater, North Central College,[12] which helped to fund construction of the Wentz Concert Hall, a $30 million performing arts facility named after Wentz. In June 2011, the College awarded Wentz an honorary doctor of science degree for lifetime achievement in the sciences.[13]

Included in the allegations were that USANA's business model was unsustainable and amounted to a pyramid scheme. The suit cited several allegations from a report released by Barry Minkow and the Fraud Discovery Institute.[9]
Citizenship[edit]
Wentz has been criticized for having renounced his American citizenship in the mid-nineties, and for now claiming citizenship in Saint Kitts and Nevis, reportedly due to tax purposes as the country is known for being a tax haven. Former USANA CFO, Gilbert Fuller, responded to this criticism by stating that Wentz's decision to renounce his US citizenship had nothing to do with the company.[10] Wentz and his companion, Prudence Conley, now live in Rosarito, Mexico.
Awards[edit]
In 2007, Dr. Wentz was awarded the Albert Einstein Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Life Sciences by Global Capital Associates, an obscure American investment firm.[11] This award should not be confused with many others named after the famous physicist, mainly the more prestigious and well-known Albert Einstein World Award of Science given by the World Cultural Council and Albert Einstein Award in theoretical physics.
Wentz donated $10 million to his alma mater, North Central College,[12] which helped to fund construction of the Wentz Concert Hall, a $30 million performing arts facility named after Wentz. In June 2011, the College awarded Wentz an honorary doctor of science degree for lifetime achievement in the sciences.[13]

Education[edit]
Wentz holds a BSc degree in biology from North Central College in Naperville, Illinois, an MSc degree in microbiology from the University of North Dakota, and a PhD degree in microbiology and immunology from the University of Utah.[1]
Professional history[edit]
In 1974, Wentz launched Gull Laboratories as a one-man operation and developed a test for diagnosing Epstein-Barr virus infection. The company was later sold to Fresenius, a German medical products company, in 1994, although Dr. Wentz continued as Chairman until 1998.[2] Wentz sold his controlling interests in Gull Laboratories in 1992 and founded USANA Health Sciences in the same year.
Wentz also founded the Sanoviv Medical Institute in 1998, an alternative and holistic medicine center located near Rosarito, Mexico. Wentz served as President of Sanoviv from 1999-2010.[3] The current president is Seth Miller, USANA’s former Director of International Business Development.[4][5]
Wentz and his family are the sole owners of Gull Holdings, Ltd., an Isle of Man company,[6] which in turn, is controlled by an entity registered in Liechtenstein, both well known tax haven countries.[7] Through Gull Holdings, Wentz owns 51% of USANA.[8]
Shareholder lawsuit[edit]
On April 4, 2007, Wentz was named as a defendant in a class-action lawsuit brought against USANA by company shareholders. The suit alleged that USANA presented materially false and misleading information about the company’s financial situation and business practices. Included in the allegations were that USANA's business model was unsustainable and amounted to a pyramid scheme. The suit cited several allegations from a report released by Barry Minkow and the Fraud Discovery Institute.[9]
Citizenship[edit]
Wentz has been criticized for having renounced his American citizenship in the mid-nineties, and for now claiming citizenship in Saint Kitts and Nevis, reportedly due to tax purposes as the country is known for being a tax haven. Former USANA CFO, Gilbert Fuller, responded to this criticism by stating that Wentz's decision to renounce his US citizenship had nothing to do with the company.[10] Wentz and his companion, Prudence Conley, now live in Rosarito, Mexico.
Awards[edit]
In 2007, Dr. Wentz was awarded the Albert Einstein Award for Outstanding Achievement in the Life Sciences by Global Capital Associates, an obscure American investment firm.[11] This award should not be confused with many others named after the famous physicist, mainly the more prestigious and well-known Albert Einstein World Award of Science given by the World Cultural Council and Albert Einstein Award in theoretical physics.
Wentz donated $10 million to his alma mater, North Central College,[12] which helped to fund construction of the Wentz Concert Hall, a $30 million performing arts facility named after Wentz. In June 2011, the College awarded Wentz an honorary doctor of science degree for lifetime achievement in the sciences.[13]

  Industrialist  of  human potential, Darren Hardy is the visionary force behind  SUCCESS  magazine as its publisher and editorial director. As a leader  in the  personal development industry, Darren gets the unique privilege  of  sitting down with the leading experts on human performance  and  achievement, as well as many of today’s top CEOs,  revolutionary  entrepreneurs, superstar athletes, entertainers, and  Olympic champions,  to learn the unique secrets to their extraordinary  success. Darren, who  had been featured on FOX, CBS, MSNBC, CNBC, and  ABC, is also an  accomplished entrepreneur, author, keynote speaker,  private equity  investor, corporate advisor, and peak performance  mentor.


John C. Maxwell is an internationally recognized leadership expert, speaker, coach, and author who has sold more than 20 million books. Dr. Maxwell is the founder of EQUIP and The John Maxwell Company, organizations that have trained more than five million leaders worldwide. Every year he speaks to Fortune 500 companies, international government leaders, and organizations as diverse as the United States Military Academy at West Point, the National Football League, and the United Nations. A New York Times, Wall Street Journal, and Business Week best-selling author, Maxwell has written three books that have each sold more than one million copies: The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership, Developing the Leader Within You, and The 21 Indispensable Qualities of a Leader.


  For more than a decade, Dr. Libby Weaver has been working with individual patients to help them maintain a healthy weight and learn about health from a holistic perspective. After completing her Ph.D. examining biochemical and nutritional factors in children with autism, Dr. Weaver became one of Australia’s leading nutrition specialists and weight loss experts. Australia and New Zealand’s national TV and radio programs have regularly called upon her to share her expertise and her passion for health with expansive and attentive audiences. Her new book, Accidentally Overweight: Solve Your Weight Loss Puzzle, discusses the factors that are essential for burning body fat. Dr. Weaver teaches readers from various backgrounds and body types how to overcome their weight-loss challenges by looking at every factor that affects fat storage—which is more than just energy intake versus energy expenditure. Her holistic approach offers answers for people who have been struggling to lose weight, but haven’t seen results.


  Known as the “Gen Y Guy,” Jason Ryan Dorsey is a best-selling author and an award-winning entrepreneur. He has been featured as a generation expert on 60 Minutes, The Today Show, and The View, as well as in print in The Wall Street Journal and Fortune Magazine, and has given more than 2,000 keynote speeches to riveted audiences around the world. His dynamic speeches provide insight on understanding and communicating to the four distinct generations: Matures, Baby Boomers, Gen X, and Gen Y. Dorsey’s best-selling books cover a wide range of topics, from the benefits of hiring Gen Y employees to simple methods for improving schools. Though he is young enough to be a proud member of “Gen Y,” Dorsey’s extensive experience and research have made him an expert in generational differences and strengths. Countless managers and leaders have taken his lessons and used them to integrate all four generations into efficient workplaces that draw on the talents of every team member.


He has inspired, challenged and entertained audiences around the world. From the boardrooms of multi-national corporations to the locker rooms of world-class athletes to the meeting rooms of conventioneers, Dr. Denis Waitley, renowned author and inspirational speaker, is devoted to informing and enlightening people. For 45 years Dr. Waitley has challenged individuals to make a difference in their lives, the lives of their loved ones, and in society as a whole. He’s written 15 nonfiction books, including several international best sellers: Seeds of Greatness, Being the Best, The Winner’s Edge, The Joy of Working, and Empires of the Mind. He’s recorded hundreds of audio programs and given countless lectures helping millions of individuals succeed personally and professionally. As a former member of USANA’s Board of Directors and Chairman of its Athletic Advisory Council, Dr. Waitley has seen up close the value of USANA and its role in helping maintain health and achieve success.

Dr. Oz, the two-time Daytime Emmy Award-winning host of the Daytime Emmy Award-winning The Dr. Oz Show, is vice-chair and professor of surgery at Columbia University. He also directs the Cardiovascular Institute and Complementary Medicine Program at New York Presbyterian Hospital. His research interests include heart replacement surgery, minimally invasive cardiac surgery, complementary medicine, and health care policy. He has authored more than 400 original publications, book chapters, and medical books, has received several patents, and performs more than 100 heart surgeries each year. Previously, Dr. Oz was a featured health expert on The Oprah Winfrey Show for more than five seasons and spanning 55 episodes. He has also served as chief medical consultant to Discovery Communications, where his Transplant! series won both a Freddie and a Silver Telly award. In addition to numerous appearances on Good Morning America, he has also appeared on the Today Show, Larry King Live, The View, guest-hosted The Charlie Rose Show, and appeared on all the evening news broadcasts. He also served as medical director of Denzel Washington’s John Q and participated in several other feature films.


Probably the most definitive face of cable news, not only in the United States but around the globe, Emmy Award winner Larry King reshaped the landscape of broadcast journalism when his talk show, Larry King Live, debuted in June of 1985 on CNN. With a revolutionary mixture of cutting-edge political discussions and insightful celebrity-directed Q&As, King’s talk show caught the attention of millions of viewers. As one of the most recognizable broadcasters in the world, King has conducted thousands of interviews with a number of celebrities and politicians, including Marlon Brando, George Clooney, Bill Gates, Barak Obama, Michael Jordan, Yasser Arafat, Tony Blair, Richard Nixon, and Ross Perot.

Christiane Northrup, MD, is a visionary pioneer and the world’s leading authority in the field of women’s health and wellness. Dr. Northrup is the author of two New York Times best-selling books: Women’s Bodies, Women’s Wisdom and The Wisdom of Menopause. In 2005, Mother-Daughter Wisdom, her third book, was voted Amazon.com’s #1 book of the year in both parenting and mind-body health, and was nominated for a Quill Award. In her latest books, The Secret Pleasures of Menopause and The Secret Pleasures of Menopause Playbook, Dr. Northrup outlines the crucial link between health and pleasure. Recognizing the unity of body, mind, and spirit, Dr. Northrup helps empower women to tune into their innate inner wisdom to transform their health and truly flourish. Dr. Northrup has been featured on The Oprah Winfrey Show, the Today Show, NBC Nightly News, The View, the Rachael Ray Show, Good Morning America, ABC’s 20/20, and The Dr. Oz Show.

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
