History[edit]
In 1931, Fiduciary Trust Company of New York opened for business on the 30th floor at One Wall Street in New York City.  Fiduciary Trust was founded as a multifamily office to better serve the needs of wealthy individuals and families amidst the financial crisis of the time.  Pierre Jay, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve of New York, and Elihu Root, Jr., a noted lawyer and son of the Secretary of State, served among the firm's first directors.[5]
By the 1960s, the firm had broadened its reach and as a result opened its first international office in London in 1961 to concentrate on the research and analysis of non-U.S. companies. This made Fiduciary Trust one of the first firms to embrace global investing.[6]
The firm continued to evolve and in 1981 opened a Los Angeles office to reach the Western and Southwestern U.S. markets, giving them offices in New York, London, Geneva and now Los Angeles.[7]  As a reflection of the firm’s global presence, the company changed its name in 1987 from Fiduciary Trust Company of New York to Fiduciary Trust Company International.[8] Starting in the 1990s, the firm saw a period of significant growth.  The firm opened an investment management office in Washington, D.C. and was granted a Cayman trust company charter in 1990, and then in 1992 formed Fiduciary Trust Company International of the South, a subsidiary created by acquiring the Miami-based Trust Company of the South. This gave the firm trust powers in Florida.[9]  By 1998, the firm had also formed Fiduciary Trust International of Delaware.[10]
In 2001, Fiduciary Trust was acquired by San Mateo, California-based Franklin Resources, Inc., which broadened each firm's product and service offerings.[11]  Together, Franklin and Fiduciary Trust met the investment management and service needs of financial advisors, private clients and institutions worldwide.[12]  With the merger, Fiduciary Trust continued to grow its presence on the west coast with the opening of a San Mateo office.[13]
Fiduciary Trust International of the South continued to grow its presence in South Florida with the opening of an office in Boca Raton in 2013.[14]   Two years later, in 2015, Fiduciary Trust Company International of the South relocated its Miami headquarters to 2 Alhambra Plaza in Coral Gables. The move further strengthened the firm’s presence in the South Florida community and allowed the firm to accommodate the evolving needs of clients.[15]  Then, in 2016, Fiduciary Trust moved its New York headquarters to 280 Park Avenue.[16]
