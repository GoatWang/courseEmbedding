What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.

About Us
P-Solve is an investment consultant, fiduciary asset manager and actuarial consultant for institutional investors.
Our team members come from a variety of backgrounds, including actuaries, investment consultants, fund managers and investment bankers. This variety enables the team to see issues from the viewpoint of plan sponsors, investors and the markets.
P-Solve began as a consultant, and it remains a consultant. We won’t try to sell you products. Our purpose is to help your organization to reach its financial goals.
At the same time, we are a team that generates a steady stream of new ideas, holds its views with a high degree of conviction and enjoys putting forward its opinions. When acting as a fiduciary asset manager, we are happy to take direct responsibility for investment decisions.
Performance matters. We believe that asset allocation is crucial to achieving long-term investment objectives. We can either provide our clients with recommendations, which we will do at a pace that suits them, or act as a fiduciary manager, where we implement our recommendations.
Likewise, understanding the regulatory environment and issues like plan design are critical to managing liabilities. Managing risks between asset and liability performance is the crucial skill of a fiduciary manager.
Our business serves pension plans, insurance entities and other institutional investors in the US and UK. 
P-Solve was founded in 2001 and is the institutional investment and actuarial consulting division of the River & Mercantile Group, PLC.

Our History

 
 
 
 




P-Solve was formed as the institutional investment advisory division of the Punter Southall Group (PSG), a UK-based actuarial consulting firm, in 2001. Also in 2001, PSG made its first overseas investment, buying an investment and an actuarial consulting firm in the US. In the UK, P-Solve grew rapidly due to our focus on providing actionable advice and because of our focus on explicitly managing assets to liabilities. We were the first investment consultant to provide our clients with the ability to efficiently use modern hedging tools and were the first in the UK to offer fully delegated investment services, now known as fiduciary management. Each of these steps was taken to address the needs of clients and we continue to build our business to meet such needs as they arise.
In 2009, P-Solve took control of PSG’s US business. The US business was re-launched as a provider of fully integrated investment and actuarial advice to retirement plan sponsors and insurance companies. In 2011, P-Solve purchased Meridian, a UK-based advisor to insurance companies. In 2012, P-Solve merged its US business with Cassidy Retirement Group, an actuarial and investment advisor to retirement plan sponsors. In 2014, P-Solve merged with River and Mercantile Asset Management LLP to form River and Mercantile Group PLC and completed a successful listing on the London Stock Exchange.
P-Solve remains committed to providing the high level of service, innovative investment thinking and focus on risk management that has propelled our growth to-date.

Penbridge Advisors
Providing advice at each step of the Pension Risk Transfer transaction process
P-Solve and Penbridge Advisors have established a strategic alliance to provide corporate sponsors of U.S. defined benefit pension plans with essential pension risk transfer (PRT) advisory services. P-Solve is now part of Penbridge Advisors’ collaborative advisor offering that was designed to provide highly coordinated advice at each step of the PRT transaction process.
Penbridge and P-Solve formed their alliance relationship to support the information, management and governance needs of plan sponsors whose ultimate objective is termination. The two firms work closely together to provide the market with advice on PRT as well as the tools to efficiently implement a PRT-focused investment strategy.

 



Penbridge Advisors primarily helps plan sponsors evaluate the cost-effectiveness of annuity buyouts relative to other pension de-risking strategies. Its services include PRT pricing and underwriting assessments, executive and board education, ongoing monitoring of buy-out pricing and the evaluation and comparison of various insurance products and other de-risking alternatives such as lump sums and liability-driven investing solutions.
P-Solve works with plan sponsors to develop and implement an investment and risk management plan to help them achieve their pension de-risking and termination goals. Investing to close a funding gap and, ultimately, to manage risk near and at termination requires specialized investment skills combined with deep actuarial knowledge, both of which P-Solve possesses.
About Penbridge Advisors
Penbridge Advisors provides pension plans with information and advisory services on the U.S. pension risk transfer (PRT) market and products. Penbridge provides free access to the industry’s only PRT database, currently used by more than 300 plan sponsors and advisory firms. Penbridge’s advisory services include plan termination pricing and underwriting assessments and customized buy-out price monitoring services to help plan sponsors decide on PRT strategy and timing. Penbridge also delivers PRT education workshops to corporate boards, C-level executives and pension plan committees. In addition to working with plan sponsors directly, Penbridge partners with select advisory firms to provide coordinated PRT services. Penbridge also supports investment consultants and asset managers in integrating buy-out pricing into their liability-driven investment mandates.

“Our strategic alliance with P-Solve expands Penbridge Advisors’ pension risk transfer collaborative advisor offering to include fiduciary asset management services.” -Steve Keating, Co-Founder and Principal of Penbridge Advisors

What business type is right for you?
When you're starting a new business, you want to determine the business structure that's right for you. What's the difference between a limited liability company (LLC) and a corporation (Inc.)? And how is a C corporation different from an S corporation? Use these charts to help decide what business type is best for your needs.








LLC vs. Corporation






Limited Liability Company (LLC)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my LLCCorporation (Inc)Shields personal assets from business liabilityRequires separation of business and personal financesundefinedAllowable in all 50 states and the District of ColumbiaundefinedHighly flexible management structureundefinedFlexible tax reporting optionsundefinedPreferred by outside investorsundefinedPreferred for IPOundefinedRecognized outside of the United StatesStart my Corporation







What is an S corporation?
After you create a corporation or LLC, you also have the opportunity to decide how you'd like your business to be taxed.Single owner LLCs can be taxed either as a sole proprietorship or a corporation.  LLCs with more than one owner can be taxed either as a partnership or a corporation.  Income from LLCs treated as sole proprietorships or partnerships is reported directly on the owner’s individual tax returns.New corporations, as well as LLCs considering corporate taxation can choose between filing taxes as a C corporation ("C corp") or an S corporation ("S corp"). An S corp is considered a "pass-through entity," which means the business itself isn't taxed. Instead, income is reported on the owners' personal tax returns. Businesses taxed as C corporations are not pass through entities.  Income is taxed at the corporate level, and, if dividends are distributed, at the individual level as well.We can help you understand your options so you choose what's best for your business. Talk to one of our network of attorneys today.








C-corp or S-corp 






Here's a comparison of some key characteristics of businesses that choose to be treated as C corps and S corps.C DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensS DesignationOwners pay personal income tax on profitsBusiness must pay corporate income taxundefinedAll business income/loss is passed through to owners each year.undefinedNo more than 100 shareholdersundefinedShareholders must be U.S. citizens or resident aliensYou don't have to decide about S corp status right away. You have 75 days after the formation of your business to file with the IRS. If you're still not sure what to do, you may want to consult with one of our attorneys or tax specialists.





Step-by-Step Guide on Starting Your Business













Easy as 1-2-3




1. Select the business structure that's right for you and fill out a simple questionnaire.





2. We'll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state.





3. You'll receive your completed paperwork by mail.








Ask away. We have answers.



Common questions

Can I start a business without creating a corporation or LLC?
You don't need a corporation or LLC to go into business. Many business owners are in partnerships or are sole proprietors. But both a corporation and LLC canshield you from liability and may offer tax advantages.


What are the main differences between an LLC and a sole proprietorship?
You don't need to file any paperwork with your state to create a sole proprietorship (though you may still need business permits and licenses to operate lawfully). But an LLC protects you from personal liability  - a sole proprietorship doesn't.Also, LLCs provide more flexibility as you grow your business.


What are the main differences between an LLC and an S corporation?
An LLC has more flexibility and fewer corporate formalities than an S corporation. S corporations are required to have annual meetings of shareholders and directors, while meetings of LLC member and/or managers are not required..  Also,  LLCs can provide for a flexible management structure by members or managers, while corporations require management by a Board of Directors.Learn more.


Do I need a name or DBA for my business?
You only need a DBA ("doing business as") if you are operating a sole proprietorship or partnership and you want to use a fictitious name for the business. You don't need a DBA for an LLC or a corporation unless you are using a name other than your LLC or corporate name while doing business.Learn more.


Do I need any other licenses or permits to start my business? 
Some cities, counties, and states require businesses to obtain licenses and permits to operate lawfully. We can help you figure out what you need. Learn More.

Compare Business Structures – LLC vs. Corporation, S Corporation and C Corporation 

		 You’ve decided to start a business, but you’re not sure where to begin. You don’t know if you should form an LLC or corporation, and need guidance to help you choose the right business structure. Each business structure has its advantages and disadvantages that are important to understand because choosing the wrong business entity could result in legal and tax implications down the road. The information above will allow you to compare LLC vs. corporation, and learn the difference between an S corporation and C corporation. LLCs and corporations both offer personal liability protection, but the most significant difference between LLC and corporation is that corporations are preferred by outside investors. When comparing LLC vs S corp, there are a few important differences to be aware of which are outlined above. Once you determine which business structure you need, you can start a business with LegalZoom in just three easy steps. The process begins by filling out a simple questionnaire. We’ll assemble your documents and file them directly with your state, and you’ll receive your completed paperwork by mail. If you need help deciding which business structure is right for you, a LegalZoom legal plan attorney can explain how each business entity works and help you decide.
