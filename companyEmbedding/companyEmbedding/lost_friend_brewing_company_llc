You may also contact Trademarkia to make a request for the removal of your personally identifiable information or trademark data.

Grilled Pimento Chasse with Applewood Bacon is a fantastic sandwhich.   commentsCheers or Pour Out 00     Flag It    Zack Kaspar   03/29/16   Wood fire pizza, weekly shows, friendly service, truly a great place to be drinking at on a Friday afternoon. I can't imagine how much more popular this place would be with outdoor seating.   commentsCheers or Pour Out 00     Flag It    Michael Armstrong   03/24/16   My favorite spot in Boone. I recommend this place to everyone I can if they're in the area. Love the seasonal winter beers - and the pizza is amazing.   commentsCheers or Pour Out 00     Flag It    matt miller   03/08/16   This place has some great thin sliced pizza.  Great ingredients! Great beer selection as well! Out-of-towners   commentsCheers or Pour Out 00     Flag It    Gregory Breitenbeck   01/25/16   Nice atmosphere however as we walked up to the front of the restaurant my wife pointed out to me a sign on the window stating that no firearms were allowed even if a patron possessed a legal permit to carry.   Now normally I don't give my business to only-criminals-are-allowed-to-carry-guns-here establishments but I had a hungry wife in tow, so I took my Glock out to my Wrangler and returned with an empty holster and feeling somewhat less dressed. 
The upside of this encroachment on my right to defend innocent life was the opportunity to try out the restaurant's KRAUTHAMMER CREEK German Kolsh, which was excellent and particularly appropriate since my dinner choice was the equally tasty bratwurst platter.
We'll probably return because we both enjoyed the ambience but rest assured I'll be wearing a stealthily holster (and forego the beer)!   commentsCheers or Pour Out 00     Flag It    David Paine   01/18/16   I generally have a five star experience at Lost Province.  I have yet to find something I didn't like.  The sandwiches are excellent, hearty, and delicious.  The pizzas are among the top two or three contenders in town--although, the gluten-free crust is small and overpriced.  Wonderful beer offerings with frequent seasonal changes and steady standbys.  The ambience with the stone fireplace, light-colored woods, views of the brewing area from the loft is convivial and easy-going.  It's family-friendly as well, with my toddlers enjoying the kid's pizzas ($5 for a pizza, side, and drink) immensely.   commentsCheers or Pour Out 00    Beers by Lost Province Brewing Company, LlcBeer NameStyleABVReviewsRating  Click Here to Add Your Beer .........

 Testimonials

"Sari -
Thank you so much for finding my friend Jo.  I called her and we talked for over an hour.  We plan on talking a lot in the future.  She said she'd thought about me for years, just didn't know where to start looking.  She was shocked to hear how I found her.
Thanks so very much!
Linda M."
