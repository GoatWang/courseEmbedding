State Automobile Mutual Insurance Co.


                  Frustrated by insurance rates that were unreasonably high and claims settlements that were routinely handled with disregard, Robert Pein was determined to create a new kind of insurance company dedicated to serving the needs of the community – not the needs of the insurance executives.In 1921, State Automobile Mutual Insurance Company was founded. With three employees and a rented room in the downtown Columbus, Ohio, Pein set forth to tackle the inequities in the insurance industry. From the very beginning, State Auto advocated the independent agency system as the best approach to serving the needs of its policyholders. To this day, as hometown neighbors, local independent agents continue to provide efficient, professional and more personalized service than that of their competitors. Just like Robert Pein had always dreamed.Today, the State Auto Insurance Companies employ approximately 2,400 associates and market products and services through independent insurance agencies, which include retail agencies and wholesale brokers. The corporate headquarters is in Columbus, Ohio, where State Auto was founded in 1921.

State Automobile Mutual Insurance Co.

                    Frustrated by insurance rates that were unreasonably high and claims settlements that were routinely handled with disregard, Robert Pein was determined to create a new kind of insurance company dedicated to serving the needs of the community – not the needs of the insurance executives.In 1921, State Automobile Mutual Insurance Company was founded. With three employees and a rented room in the downtown Columbus, Ohio, Pein set forth to tackle the inequities in the insurance industry. From the very beginning, State Auto advocated the independent agency system as the best approach to serving the needs of its policyholders. To this day, as hometown neighbors, local independent agents continue to provide efficient, professional and more personalized service than that of their competitors. Just like Robert Pein had always dreamed.Today, the State Auto Insurance Companies employ approximately 2,400 associates and market products and services through independent insurance agencies, which include retail agencies and wholesale brokers. The corporate headquarters is in Columbus, Ohio, where State Auto was founded in 1921. Regional headquarters are located in Nashville, Tenn., Indianapolis, Ind., Columbus, Ohio, Austin, Texas and Baltimore, Md.The State Auto Group consists of State Automobile Mutual, State Auto Property & Casualty, State Auto Ohio, State Auto Wisconsin, Milbank, Meridian Security, Meridian Citizens Mutual and Patrons Mutual.State Auto Mutual also writes specialty insurance and workers’ compensation products through its Rockhill insurance subsidiaries. The Rockhill insurance subsidiaries, write business on a non-admitted basis in 49 states and the District of Columbia, and are licensed on an admitted basis in 42 states and the District of Columbia.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/22/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.
