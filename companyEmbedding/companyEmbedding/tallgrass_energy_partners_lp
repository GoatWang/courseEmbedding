Rockies Express Pipeline (REX)

            Rockies Express Pipeline (REX) is one of the United States’ largest pipelines and is transforming into the nation’s northernmost bi-directional natural gas header system. With 42- and 36-inch diameter lines, REX taps major supply basins in the Rocky Mountain and Appalachian regions and serves energy markets across a vast segment of North America. The completion of the REX Zone 3 Capacity Enhancement project that went in service in January 2017 marked the culmination of a series of projects to convert Zone 3 to bi-directional flow and enabled the pipeline to flow up to 4.4 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas in Zone 3. West-to-east long-haul capacity on REX is 1.8 billion cubic feet per day. REX is a joint venture of Tallgrass Energy Partners (50 percent membership interest), Tallgrass Development, LP (25 percent membership interest) and Phillips 66 (25 percent membership interest). A wholly owned subsidiary of TEP operates the pipeline.  
            REX, which became fully operational in 2009, stretches about 1,700 miles from northwestern Colorado and Wyoming to eastern Ohio and, through numerous interstate pipeline interconnects, provides shippers optionality to many major demand centers and large end-users.
To answer the call for more takeaway capacity from the Marcellus and Utica shale plays in the Appalachian basin, in 2014 REX put into service its Seneca Lateral, making REX Zone 3 bi-directional. In 2015, REX completed its Zone 3 East-to-West project, expanding the Zone 3 bi-directional capability from Monroe County Ohio to Moultrie, Ill. This expansion tripled REX’s Zone 3 east-to-west capacity, giving producers a much-needed outlet for getting their gas to Midwest consumer markets such as Chicago and Detroit, as well as to the Southeast and Gulf Coast areas.
With the completion of the Zone 3 Capacity Enhancement project, REX Zone 3 has the capacity to move 2.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas a day from east-to-west and 1.8 billion cubic feet a day from west-to-east. For local distribution companies, industrial customers, power plants, and third-party pipelines, the bi-directional flow and enhancements mean access to abundant natural gas sources in both the Rockies and Appalachian basins. As the country’s northernmost bi-directional header system, REX will play a crucial role in transforming the nation’s natural gas infrastructure, providing access to emerging U.S. markets as well as access to current high-demand centers, power demand, LNG markets and Mexico.

Tallgrass Midstream (TMID)

            
           
           Tallgrass Midstream (TMID) gathers, processes and treats natural gas for flow into interstate pipelines and on to a diverse customer base that includes residential, commercial and industrial users. Strategically situated in Wyoming’s Powder River and Wind River basins, TMID creates value for customers by taking gas from the wellhead and processing it to interstate pipeline specifications. This allows producers to deliver their product, both natural gas and recovered natural gas liquids (NGLs), to sell in other markets.
            

            
            TMID assets include natural gas processing plants in Casper and Douglas, a natural gas treating facility at West Frenchie Draw, and the Douglas natural gas gathering system. The Douglas gathering system encompasses about 1,500 miles of gathering lines across four Wyoming counties and is the primary gathering system for TMID’s Douglas processing plant.
        

        The Casper and Douglas plants have a combined processing capacity of approximately 190 million cubic feet per day. The Casper plant also has a fractionator with a capacity of 3,500 barrels per day. The West Frenchie Draw treating facility has a capacity of 50 million cubic feet per day. The natural gas treated and processed at these facilities primarily comes from the Wind River Basin and Powder River Basin.
         

        TMID can transport recovered NGLs to either Oneok’s Bakken Pipeline which connects to the Overland Pass Pipeline for designation at Conway, Kan., or to Phillips 66’s Powder River pipeline for designation to Borger, Tex., for fractionation, storage and resale.
        

        Additionally, TMID owns and operates an NGL pipeline with an approximate capacity of about 19,500 barrels per day that transports NGLs from a processing plant in Northeast Colorado to an interconnect with Overland Pass Pipeline.

MidstreamUnited States Tallgrass Energy Partners Announces Series Of Projects

LEAWOOD, Kan.—Tallgrass Energy Partners LP (NYSE: TEP) on July 26 announced strategic acquisitions by its terminals and water services businesses and several significant commercial deals that expand and strengthen its Pony Express crude oil pipeline position in the regions it serves.
Since the company’s first-quarter 2017 earnings call on May 2, Tallgrass Energy has now announced or completed acquisitions and growth projects of approximately $350 million.
“Today’s announcements clearly demonstrate TEP’s expansive footprint and ability to grow through strategic and accretive acquisitions as well as through organic commercial development,” said David G. Dehaemers Jr., Tallgrass Energy president and CEO. “These acquisitions and growth projects enable us to help our customers grow their businesses.”
Tallgrass Terminals LLC recently acquired an additional 49% interest in the Deeprock Development crude oil terminal at Cushing, Okla., increasing its total membership interest to 69%, for a purchase price of approximately $70 million. Deeprock is a 2.3-million-barrel crude oil storage facility in which Kinder Morgan Inc. (11%) and Deeprock Energy Resources (20%) remain joint venture partners.
Deeprock will continue to be operated by Deeprock Energy. By increasing its ownership to 69%, Tallgrass Terminals assumes significant strategic and commercial control over Deeprock. In conjunction with the acquisition, Tallgrass Pony Express Pipeline LLC signed an amended lease agreement with Deeprock, reducing its recurring lease charges by an estimated $5 million per year, beginning on July 1, 2017.
Tallgrass believes the acquisition will allow it to more effectively pursue the development and growth of its potential crude oil terminal project located on 550 acres in South Cushing, by utilizing some of the existing infrastructure of Deeprock to offer many different services between the two terminals.
Tallgrass subsidiary BNN Water Solutions LLC recently acquired a 63% interest in an entity that owns freshwater facilities in Weld County, Colo., for $7 million, with a commitment to invest up to an additional approximately $10.5 million in the system over the next few months. We believe these facilities will allow BNN to better serve existing and potential new producer customers in the region.
Pony Express recently held a binding open season to secure committed shipper contracts for crude oil transportation of a new common stream on the proposed extension of Pony Express from Tallgrass Terminals’s Buckingham receipt point to a new origin near Platteville, Colo. Pony Express received new short-haul and long-haul binding transportation commitments totaling approximately 30,000 barrels per day (bbl/d) from multiple counterparties to support the construction of the Platteville Extension.
In conjunction with Pony Express's development of the Platteville Extension, Tallgrass Terminals will upgrade the Buckingham terminal and build a new terminal in Platteville. The approximately 55-mile extension of Pony Express is expected to begin operations in second-quarter 2018. Tallgrass Terminals is also moving forward with the development of the new Grasslands Terminal in Platteville, which is expected to be complete in fourth-quarter 2018, and will enable Pony Express to batch multiple common streams out of Platteville. Once the Grasslands Terminal is complete, the Platteville Extension is expected to have a capacity of approximately 80,000 bbl/d. The Platteville Extension and Grasslands Terminal, when complete, will provide Pony Express’s shippers and refinery markets with the interconnectivity to source the abundant pipeline-gathered barrels available in the most active drilling region of the DJ basin.
Pony Express signed an agreement with CHS Inc. to connect the 100,000 bbl/d CHS McPherson, Kan., refinery to Pony Express’s mainline. Pony Express has agreed to build connection facilities designed to supply the refinery with multiple common streams of crude oil. Completion of the facilities is expected by the end of the year.
In addition to the CHS connection, construction is progressing on the Holly Frontier El Dorado refinery connection facilities, with completion expected in fourth-quarter 2017.
Upon completion of the two new refinery connections, shippers on Pony Express will be able to deliver more than 300,000 bbl/d to three significant refineries directly connected to Pony Express, inclusive of the refinery in Ponca City, Okla. that is already connected to Pony Express.
Tallgrass Terminals has a signed, 10-year take-or-pay agreement from a new customer to support the construction of a new terminal in the Central Kansas Uplift. Pony Express, in turn, will establish a new supply connection at the new Kansas terminal and another new common stream of crude oil on its mainline. Tallgrass Terminals will build terminaling facilities designed to receive Kansas crude oil production with delivery capabilities in excess of 20,000 bbl/d into the Pony Express mainline. Completion of the facilities is expected in first-quarter 2018.
Upon completion of these projects, Pony Express will have six different supply sources and five different streams of crude oil capable of being batched on the system.
Pony Express and Tallgrass Terminals expect to invest approximately $145 million in total capital for the construction of the Platteville Extension, Grasslands Terminal, upgrades to the Buckingham Terminal, the CHS and Holly Frontier El Dorado refinery connections and the new Kansas terminal and Pony Express receipt point.
“We believe all of this work further positions Pony Express as the most diverse and capable crude oil transportation and logistics system in the regions in which it operates,” said Matt Sheehy, Tallgrass Energy chief commercial officer. “Diversity of supply and delivery points, multiple batch shipment capability, readily available expansion capacity and an attractive tariff rate solidify Pony Express as a critical part of the country’s crude oil midstream infrastructure that will be utilized for decades to come.”
In addition to the approximately $350 million in acquisitions and growth projects announced or completed since May 2, 2017, Tallgrass is evaluating and developing an additional $200 million in potential projects and acquisitions that could be announced later this year.
