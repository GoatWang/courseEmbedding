GRI Lifetime Warranty 
GRI's standard switches are made in the USA and come with a lifetime warranty against faulty workmanship, material and factory defects. 
Our replacement policy is "Two For One" prior to installation. After installation, if the switch fails due to material defect or factory workmanship, we will issue a $10 credit when the switch is returned to the factory with the case intact for examination and determination of cause. 
Replacement or the $10.00 credit does not cover failure due to physical abuse or contact freezing resulting from application of high voltage, lightning, transient surges or capacitor discharge through the contact.
We are proud of our products and are happy to answer any questions you may have. Contact Us



Custom Manufacturing and Imprinting Are Available 
GRI offers custom manufacturing for situations where a standard product does not meet your needs. Switches with resistors and/or diodes built in and stand alone resistor packs, extra length leads, etc. can all be built to your specifications. 
Private logos can be foil and heat stamped on products in white, gold, red, blue or green. 
Please contact us online or call us at (800) 445-5218.
