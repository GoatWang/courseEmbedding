Origins and history[edit]
GovX was founded in 2011 by Marc Van Buskirk, Shannon Van Buskirk and Anthony Farwell. Two of GovX’s founders were involved in the development and operation of US Standard Issue, a single brand, direct-to-military, tactical e-commerce Web site offering Oakley tactical products. Its founding CEO, Marc Van Buskirk, was largely responsible for developing Oakley’s military-direct sales channel and US Standard Issue. Oakley acquired the USSI web site from Van Buskirk and soon after, Van Buskirk founded GovX.[3]

Community outreach[edit]
GovX is partnered with the National Association For Uniformed Services, Air Force Association, and Marine Corps Association and Foundation, offering members of each exclusive pricing. GovX also allocates a portion of proceeds from purchases made by its members to benefit military associations and foundations to support the families of both the armed forces and law enforcement. Participating military and law enforcement associations receive a portion of the proceeds from their members’ purchases.[4]
Medal of Honor: Warfighter Military Edition[edit]
In 2012, GovX partnered with Electronic Arts and Danger Close Games to develop an exclusive "Military only" edition of their upcoming title Medal of Honor: Warfighter. The Medal of Honor: Warfighter Military Edition will bundle the limited edition of the shooter with additional in-game content, and will only be available for active, reserve and former US military personnel and US government employees exclusively on GovX.com[5]
The Military Edition includes all the perks of the game's civilian-ready Limited Edition, as well as "exclusive in-game unlocks." One particular unlock is a camouflage pattern named "Project HONOR," which is tied to a real-world promotion arranged by EA to raise money for the families of fallen Special Operations soldiers.[6] This version of the game will only be sold through GovX, an online retailer for verified military, law enforcement or government employees.[7]

Origins and history[edit]
GovX was founded in 2011 by Marc Van Buskirk, Shannon Van Buskirk and Anthony Farwell. Two of GovX’s founders were involved in the development and operation of US Standard Issue, a single brand, direct-to-military, tactical e-commerce Web site offering Oakley tactical products. Its founding CEO, Marc Van Buskirk, was largely responsible for developing Oakley’s military-direct sales channel and US Standard Issue. Oakley acquired the USSI web site from Van Buskirk and soon after, Van Buskirk founded GovX.[3]

Community outreach[edit]
GovX is partnered with the National Association For Uniformed Services, Air Force Association, and Marine Corps Association and Foundation, offering members of each exclusive pricing. GovX also allocates a portion of proceeds from purchases made by its members to benefit military associations and foundations to support the families of both the armed forces and law enforcement. Participating military and law enforcement associations receive a portion of the proceeds from their members’ purchases.[4]
Medal of Honor: Warfighter Military Edition[edit]
In 2012, GovX partnered with Electronic Arts and Danger Close Games to develop an exclusive "Military only" edition of their upcoming title Medal of Honor: Warfighter. The Medal of Honor: Warfighter Military Edition will bundle the limited edition of the shooter with additional in-game content, and will only be available for active, reserve and former US military personnel and US government employees exclusively on GovX.com[5]
The Military Edition includes all the perks of the game's civilian-ready Limited Edition, as well as "exclusive in-game unlocks." One particular unlock is a camouflage pattern named "Project HONOR," which is tied to a real-world promotion arranged by EA to raise money for the families of fallen Special Operations soldiers.[6] This version of the game will only be sold through GovX, an online retailer for verified military, law enforcement or government employees.[7]

About GovX
Patriots like you deserve the best deals and savings. That’s why we built GovX exclusively for the men and women who’ve served our country.
Every day we work to create the ultimate members-only experience for current and former uniformed professionals, with savings up to 65% on gear, apparel, technology, event tickets, travel and more.
At GovX, we go beyond outstanding deals: every month, our members pick a noble cause to receive a portion of each purchase made on the site. We call it our Mission Giveback.
When the country called, you were there. When a life needed saving, you arrived. When a tough job needed doing, you did it. This is our way of saying thanks!












You guys are doing great! Thank you for what you do and for keeping this resource open to all Military.

More questions?



How do I register?

GovX is a members-only site that not just anyone can sign up for. We need you to show us you're eligible to be a member! Our fast and secure online registration process will walk you through it step by step. Most members can get verified on the spot using their work email or a department issued ID (like a DD214). For active duty and veteran military, we can even look you up directly in the DOD database. Don't worry, we don't save any sensitive info. Any photos or files sent to us are instantly deleted the moment your account is approved. The whole process can be completed online.




Why can't I see prices?

Because you're not a member yet! (Or, you're just not logged in. If you're already a member, log in here.) We've worked with all our brands and arranged for prices so good, we can't actually share them with the rest of the internet. Once you're fully logged in, you can see all the prices.




What's the catch?

We get this question a lot. There really isn't any catch. Just great savings for people like you who've served our country and communities. Becoming a member is safe, easy and free, and we think you'll like what we're all about. But if you want to learn more, just call our team at 888-468-5511 during normal business hours. Heck, we'll even let you talk to our CEO.








Members are saving on gear & more




























							ryan d. - GovX Member
						
What a great pack. 
I recently bought this pack for a long hiking trip and I have to say it's built amazingly well. I loaded it with 48 pounds of gear and strapped it on and there is no doubt I will be comfortable for this hike. Although large this bag easily packs a week's worth of essentials and allows you to carry it in comfort. Also the integrated hydration system accommodation carries a two liter bladder perfectly. I highly recommend this pack.  































							Mark C. - GovX Member
						
Owning the power of the sun...Priceless.
Very satisfying feeling hooking up my cell phone (Droid Ultra) to this unit and calculating the percentage gained in about 10 min. of testing would have a dead phone charged to 100% between 2-3 hours.  Charging options (included car charger adapter) and portability (includes two Goal Zero mini carabiners) gives a strong sense of security and confidence in its capabilities.

One negative, though I refuse to drop a star over, is that one attachment loop failed upon my initial attempt to secure it...































							Alex B. - GovX Member
						
Nice watch
It actually turn out to be more than I expected, nicely made.































							Dale B. - GovX Member
						

Everything you need in one package 































							Michael G. - GovX Member
						
Peace of mind!
Love the Yeti 1250, meets needs especially for disabled wife, able to run oxygen compressor, bed and light, most important medical equipment when no power. Have on charger now, as of yet no complaints, size right for our needs.































							Trey V. - GovX Member
						
Best Polarized Glass on the market!
Best Polarized Glass EVER! Hands down no competition! For fishing especially!!































							Matthew G. - GovX Member
						
real results no matter what
Whether you've been out of the game for a while or still climbing mountains for sport, this trainer will push you lungs to perform.































							Marcus S. - GovX Member
						
boom
By far the best sounding bluetooth speaker I've ever heard. Also the battery life on this is insane. I don't know the actual run time at full volume because it's never died, even while charging my phone for 12hrs. Beats out JBL, Bose, and Beats.































							Kevin B. - GovX Member
						
Big sound little package!
Great for almost any size room. Perfect for the backyard. Better that any BlueTooth speaker this size, the sound is incredible!
I have left it out side, under my pergola, for over a year now. It has seen some weather... I am not at all saying that it is water proof. I had forgotten that it was outside when it had rained, the top was completely full of water for about 12 hours! I unplugged it, pored the water off, brought it inside and dried it with a towel. I thought the worst! Plugged it back...































							Keith C. - GovX Member
						
Great for Jeeping!
Able to mount my phone right on the windshield of my Jeep Wrangler and use the GPS and trail mapping on my iPhone. I also have the Fre case, which keeps rain and dust from hurting my phone. I also use it to mount on my beer fridge in the garage (next to my work bench) so that is allows me to view YouTube how-to videos while I'm working. Slick set-up for sure. 































							Stephanie P. - GovX Member
						
Will purchase again
They are beautiful and fit well. I will be purchasing another pair 































							Jon Y. - GovX Member
						
Great coat
I bought the silver and it fits perfect and is really comfortable to wear. Hard to believe this shiny fabric is cotton, but really comfortable.

I wear a 42r in sports coats and the L fits perfect, even the arm length.































							Pandora V. - GovX Member
						
Kaenon Georgia Tobacco/Denim
These glasses are amazing! Not only are they beautiful but so comfortable.
Quality product, great value and prompt delivery- can't ask for more!































							Michael U. - GovX Member
						
Build to be beaten
I've had these a few weeks now, it took a day or so to break them in but once that is done these shoes take a hell of a beating. Wash them off and they still look new.































							David M. - GovX Member
						
Wondrous
Very casual and comfortable. Like wearing slippers with a business look































							Jesse J. - GovX Member
						
A great wallet
Heavy duty wallet with plenty of room for everything one would want to carry in a wallet.  Looks great and easy to carry.  I would definitely recommend this wallet.
































							Troy H. - GovX Member
						
Awesome Glasses
I absolutely love these glasses. I own 2 pair,  and bought a pair for my wife &  2 sons as well. 

I've owned a pair for about a year for work and recently purchased a 2nd pair so that I don't have to worry about carrying them back and forth from home to the office. 

These glasses have saved me from the horrible headaches I used to get after staring at a computer screen all day at work. I no longer suffer from eye fatigue either.  These are worth every penny that they cost! 

Additionall...































							Dean S. - GovX Member
						
Excellent/Versatile 
Excellent combination of light weight material to keep cool and comfortable yet durable enough to provide longevity in a rough environment.... work or play! 































							Adam E. - GovX Member
						
Classic
Lighter and better built than the other aviators out there. Accept no substitutes. 































							John M. - GovX Member
						
Perfect for a quick meal at the park.
My brother and I hit a metro park about once a month for a day hike. We use the stove and grill combo to whip up some brats and beans after we hike or walk around the lake. Never need to bring fuel as there are plenty of sticks around to use.

The company is headquartered near La Jolla, California, in the San Diego Metropolitan area.

Origins and history[edit]
GovX was founded in 2011 by Marc Van Buskirk, Shannon Van Buskirk and Anthony Farwell. Two of GovX’s founders were involved in the development and operation of US Standard Issue, a single brand, direct-to-military, tactical e-commerce Web site offering Oakley tactical products. Its founding CEO, Marc Van Buskirk, was largely responsible for developing Oakley’s military-direct sales channel and US Standard Issue. Oakley acquired the USSI web site from Van Buskirk and soon after, Van Buskirk founded GovX.[3]

Community outreach[edit]
GovX is partnered with the National Association For Uniformed Services, Air Force Association, and Marine Corps Association and Foundation, offering members of each exclusive pricing. GovX also allocates a portion of proceeds from purchases made by its members to benefit military associations and foundations to support the families of both the armed forces and law enforcement. Participating military and law enforcement associations receive a portion of the proceeds from their members’ purchases.[4]
Medal of Honor: Warfighter Military Edition[edit]
In 2012, GovX partnered with Electronic Arts and Danger Close Games to develop an exclusive "Military only" edition of their upcoming title Medal of Honor: Warfighter. The Medal of Honor: Warfighter Military Edition will bundle the limited edition of the shooter with additional in-game content, and will only be available for active, reserve and former US military personnel and US government employees exclusively on GovX.com[5]
The Military Edition includes all the perks of the game's civilian-ready Limited Edition, as well as "exclusive in-game unlocks." One particular unlock is a camouflage pattern named "Project HONOR," which is tied to a real-world promotion arranged by EA to raise money for the families of fallen Special Operations soldiers.[6] This version of the game will only be sold through GovX, an online retailer for verified military, law enforcement or government employees.[7]
