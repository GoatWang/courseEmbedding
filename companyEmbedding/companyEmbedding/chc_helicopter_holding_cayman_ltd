Offshore Expertise That Runs Wide & Deep
Decades of over-water flying in extremely demanding conditions have honed unmatched knowledge, skill—and leadership—in offshore transportation for companies that discover and produce oil and natural gas. Each year, our people carry more than one million passengers to and from the ships and platforms that make up their offshore workplaces.
Today, deepwater and ultra-deepwater reserves represent the vast majority of the world's new oil and gas discoveries, overwhelmingly in places where we have well-established capabilities: off the coasts of Australia, Brazil, Norway, the United Kingdom and several nations in Africa.
As our customers continue to go further to explore and produce oil and gas, CHC's world-class, advanced fleet, innovative technology and global reach make us uniquely able to understand and safely meet their needs.

            United States Bankruptcy Court, Northern District of Texas (http://www.txnb.uscourts.gov)
        



General Information: 


On May 5, 2016, each of the 43 Debtors filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the "Bankruptcy Code"). The cases (collectively, the “Bankruptcy Cases”) are being jointly administered under Case No. 16-31854 before the Honorable Judge Barbara J. Houser in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas (the "Bankruptcy Court").            
Pursuant to the Bankruptcy Code (specifically including, but not limited to, 11 U.S.C. § 362), a debtor is afforded certain protection against its creditors; the Bankruptcy Code prohibits creditors from taking certain actions related to debts that may have been owing prior to the commencement of the Bankruptcy Cases. If you believe that you might be a creditor of the Debtor(s) based upon debts arising prior to May 5, 2016 and you are considering taking action based upon your status as a creditor, you may wish to seek legal advice. The staff of the Clerk of the Bankruptcy Court and the staff of Kurtzman Carson Consultants LLC are not permitted to give legal advice.For additional information, please contact the CHC Group toll-free information line at (866) 967-0261 or, if calling from outside the United States or Canada, at (310) 751-2661.Location to File Proof(s) of ClaimCHC Group Claims Processing Centerc/o KCC2335 Alaska AvenueEl Segundo, CA 90245
