Finicity Corporation Key Developments

Wells Fargo & Company and Finicity Join Forces
Apr 14 17
Wells Fargo & Company and Finicity have signed an agreement that provides an application programming interface (API)-based method for sharing Wells Fargo customer information with the financial apps and services that Finicity supports. Finicity is the first data aggregation provider to enter into a data exchange agreement with Wells Fargo, enabling third-party applications to access Wells Fargo customer data. This agreement benefits the broader financial application developer community by allowing the apps and services that rely on Finicity's APIs to access Wells Fargo customer-permissioned data once the proper authorizations are obtained. Another key component of this data exchange is security. A direct-access relationship eliminates the need for the user to provide credentials through third-party apps. Instead, this is replaced with direct authorization through Wells Fargo and subsequent authentication through tokenized access. Finicity will access Wells Fargo's data exchange API on Wells Fargo's Gateway Channel developer portal, which was launched in September of 2016. Wells Fargo Gateway offers APIs that allow commercial and corporate banking customers to integrate Wells Fargo products, services and information into their own digital environments.

You tend to find yourself getting into very interesting and fun conversations with people. The days tend to go by pretty fast. The Mvelopes app is fantastic - everybody should use that. They are somewhat fair with the people who want to get out of their contract early on, but after about 3-4 months, you can forget about it, because chances are you're probably stuck for the entire 30 month agreement.Love the ping pong table, pop-corn machine, and soda machine... Love the chilled attendance & break policy (as long as you are a top performer).ConsAt the end of the day, it's very difficult to feel like you actually did something positive for the people you have sold. These people are already perilously struggling financially to the most extreme degree you can imagine. I am a good enough salesperson to convince someone over the phone in 30 minutes, regardless of their situation, that I have the best method to get their family out of debt & buy a home in the near future, and today is their lucky day!!! Then convince them to hand over their CC and sign a 30 month contract for $59.99/mo. However, the sad truth is that for the majority of these people, you are actually making their already bad situation even worse.Expect a lot of your sales to cancel. Also, If you always give every person you sale your personal contact information (business phone / e-mail), expect most inquiries to be filled with hesitation to proceed / unsatisfactory results / buyers remorse... People will be begging to cancel and get a refund because the cost is not worth the benefit. And they will give you some creative / outlandish reasons of why they absolutely can not continue. I do not know the exact % of people who succeed, and find this program changed their life for the better, but if I had to guess I would say it's a benefit to less than 10% & a burden to about 90%. (With the 10% not yet being so financially screwed that they actually still have the extra funds in their budget to afford this type of program). Karma!!! If I could give my previous customers my best advice now, I would tell them to take the $1,799.70 they are about to spend on this program, and pay off all of their credit cards, title loans, and payday loans. If those are all paid off, put it towards paying down that auto loan, or anything that is outstanding on your credit report!I also HATE that some agents are allowed to get away with a sales pitch that is "technically compliant" but is geared towards a promise of "work with us for 30 months and we'll help you stop paying a land-lord like you have your whole life, and get into a home of your own!". Many agents even go as far as to pull up the potential client's zip code and have conversations about homes in their area to divert their focus from what this program is truly all about.Advice to ManagementEither cut the mentoring program price in half so it's affordable to $29.99/mo, or have an option for people to pay month-to-month instead of having them sign a 30 month contract which they can't get out of when they hit rock bottom and really need to. (Why else have them sign such a long term contract unless a good percentage of customers experience buyers remorse, and end up rolling the dice to fight the company to attempt to come up with a sad enough excuse to cancel that long term contract?)You have a great product with your Mvelopes app!!! Put more marketing thought, manpower, money, and time into that vs selling families dreams that they can't afford the coaching for! Create a package focusing on selling the Mvelopes app and include 5 free coaching sessions for $100! Just don't drag already hurting families through the mud for 30 months. I understand the coaching makes you a lot more money, but as a sales agent, after about a year of enrolling people into the 30 month program at $59.99/mo, **I could not look myself in the mirror and tell myself that I am helping people improve their lives, but rather the opposite!**Crack down on the agents who sell the dream of "This program will help you become a home owner." While this may technically be true if they have the financial ability to take the program serious, and making the assumption they can afford an extra $60/mo long term, I feel the sales pitch should be geared towards what the program actually is: #1) Having an app to keep track of a clients money & #2) Having them meet with a "coach" who will give them advice on how to move forward and hold them accountable.Share on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on WhatsAppShare via EmailCopy LinkLink Copied!Flag as InappropriateFlag as InappropriateHelpful (1) Finicity Response Feb 28, 2017 This type of feedback has been very helpful and led us to change both our lead sources in recent months and our newly introduced subscription coaching plans. Month-to-month coaching gives customersthe flexibility to fit it into their lives either on a monthly, quarterly or annual basis. I’m glad you learned just what a budget and a financial plan can mean in people's lives.
