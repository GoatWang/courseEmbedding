	Great rates and rewards on car insurance from The Hartford.
Switch your car insurance to the AARP® Auto Insurance Program from The Hartford1 and save. Enjoy great rates that recognize your experience and the extra benefits you deserve as an AARP member. You may even be eligible for additional savings. To learn more about the added automobile insurance savings and benefits for which you are eligible, get a quote. It’s easy!
 

Lifetime Renewability
Once you have an auto insurance policy with The Hartford, your coverage will be renewed for as long as you’re able to drive. Just meet a few simple requirements such as maintaining a valid driver's license and paying your premiums.†
 



12-Month Rate Protection
You can relax knowing your low auto insurance premium is locked-in for a full year. This sets us apart from other insurers who may change rates every six months or even sooner.
 

RecoverCare – Assistance After an Accident
The Hartford is here for you if you're injured in an automobile accident. This coverage provides reimbursement for essential home services you cannot perform yourself, such as house cleaning, lawn maintenance, and even dog walking. This coverage applies when injuries are not already covered by Medicare or health insurance.§
 

New Car Replacement Coverage
If you total your new car within the first 15 months or 15,000 miles after you buy it (whichever comes first), we’ll pay to replace it with a new vehicle of the same make, model and equipment – with no deduction for depreciation.§§
 

Lifetime Car Repair Assurance
Use one of the 1,600+ authorized repair shops in our approved network, and we’ll stand behind the workmanship of covered repairs for as long as you own or lease your vehicle. With this great coverage, you won’t have to go through the hassle of finding a trusted repair service after an accident.
 

24/7 Claims Hotline
Accidents can happen any time of day or night and you deserve an automobile insurance company that can respond immediately no matter what time you call. You can reach our claims reporting service 24/7, and we’ll walk you through the car insurance claims process. Our 6-Point Claim Commitment is your assurance of getting prompt, caring service from the start of your claim to the end.
 

Enjoy even more car insurance protection.


ADVANTAGE PLUS Program‡
In addition to the features and benefits mentioned above, the Advantage PLUS package includes:
 

First Accident Forgiveness 
Everyone makes mistakes once in a while. Once you qualify, if you’re involved in an accident, that first accident will be forgiven and your premium won’t increase as a result. To qualify, all drivers on the policy must have a clean driving record for five consecutive years.
 

Disappearing Deductible
We believe in rewarding great drivers. With our disappearing deductible, your collision deductible on your car insurance policy will go down each year – all the way to $0 – as long as you maintain a clean driving record.‡
 

One Deductible
If you file a claim for a loss involving two of your vehicles that are covered by a car insurance policy with The Hartford, you'll pay only one deductible – whichever is higher – for the covered losses to the vehicles. This benefit also applies if your car and home are involved in the same covered loss and you carry homeowners insurance with The Hartford. You'll pay only the highest deductible.‡
 

Waiver of Deductible for a Not-At-Fault Accident
In most cases, if you are not at fault in an accident, The Hartford will waive your deductible.
 

$100 Deductible Reduction
Typically, even if you’re not at fault, you may have to pay out of pocket for repair costs that fall below the deductible amount of your car insurance policy. With The Hartford, you can have your car repaired at any shop you choose. However, when you elect to use a Hartford-authorized shop for vehicle repair, we’ll reduce your collision deductible by $100. Not available in all states.
 
 
† If you are age 50 or older, once you're insured through this Program for at least 60 days, you cannot be refused renewal as long as applicable premiums are paid when due. Also, you and other customary drivers of your vehicles must retain valid licenses, remain physically and mentally capable of operating an automobile, have no convictions for driving while intoxicated and must not have obtained your policy through material misrepresentation. Benefit currently not available in HI, MI, NH and NC.
 

§ Availability of RecoverCare benefit and benefit levels vary by state. The Hartford RecoverCare Advantage® is a registered mark of The Hartford.
 
§§ Limitations apply.
 
‡ Some benefits, including First Accident Forgiveness and the Disappearing Deductible, are only available with the Advantage Plus package. A policy without these benefits is also available. [Call for details.] To qualify for the Accident Forgiveness benefit in most states, all drivers on the policy must have a clean driving record (no accidents or violations) for five consecutive years. First Accident Forgiveness is not available to CA policyholders. To qualify for the Disappearing Collision Deductible benefit in most states, all drivers on the policy must have a clean driving record for three consecutive years. NY drivers are not eligible for the complete disappearance of the deductible, although it will be reduced to a minimum of $100. The Advantage Plus package option, the Disappearing Deductible benefit and the Accident Forgiveness benefit are not available in all states.

	Tailor your car insurance at a rate you can afford.

With the AARP® Auto Insurance Program from The Hartford, you don’t have to sacrifice to save. You can tailor your car insurance coverage to suit your needs at a rate you can afford.
 
A cracked windshield. A dented fender. Injuries that require medical care. Accidents can be costly. Feel confident behind the wheel knowing you have the car insurance coverage you need. Here’s how our coverages help protect you:
 

Collision Coverage
Helps pay for damage done to your car in the event of a collision – whether it’s with another vehicle or an object. For example, if you back into a tree and damage your car, this coverage could help pay the repair fees.
 
Learn About Collision
 

Non-Collision Damage
Also known as “comprehensive,” this car insurance coverage helps pay for “non-collision” damage to your car resulting from things like natural disasters, theft and vandalism. For example, if you park your car under a tree during a snowstorm and heavy snow takes down a branch and breaks your windshield, non-collision damage insurance could help pay the cost to repair the damage to your car.

 
Learn About Non-Collision
 


Car Insurance Medical Payments
Helps cover medical care, recovery, rehab, and remedial care for you and your family after an auto accident.

 
Learn About Medical Payments
 


Auto Policy Bodily Injury Liability
This coverage can protect you against financial loss and helps pay the legal costs in the event you cause an auto accident injuring another person. For example, if you accidentally run a red light, or spin out in the snow and end up injuring another person, this coverage could help cover the costs of those injuries.

 
Learn About Bodily Injury
 


Property Damage Liability
Pays for damage your vehicle causes to other people's property (e.g. fences, mailboxes, other vehicles). For example, if your car slides out in the rain and you take out a neighbor’s mailbox or damage their landscaping, this insurance could help pay for the damages.

 
Learn About Property Damage
 


Uninsured-Underinsured Motorist Bodily Injury
Pays bodily injury and death expenses for you and your passengers if you're hit by an uninsured or underinsured driver.

 
Learn About Uninsured Bodily Injury
 


Uninsured-Underinsured Motorist Property Damage
Helps pay for damage to your vehicle if your vehicle is struck by an uninsured driver, a hit-and-run driver, or an insured driver whose property damage liability limit is too low to cover the losses, this coverage helps pay for the damage.

 
Learn About Uninsured Property Damage
 


Personal Injury Protection a.k.a. “No-Fault Insurance”
Pays for losses tied only to injuries – regardless of who caused the accident. This can be especially helpful after an accident that involves multiple cars. Not available in all states.

 
Learn About No-Fault Insurance
 


Glass Coverage
Full glass coverage pays the amount of a covered glass loss with no deductible. For example, let’s say your car gets broken into overnight and a window is smashed. The estimate to repair it comes in at $600. If you have comprehensive automobile insurance but not auto glass coverage, you will have to pay your deductible before insurance begins to cover the cost to repair the windshield.
 
If you have full glass coverage, the expense of repairing the window is covered in full with no out-of-pocket costs to you. This coverage is optional on your auto insurance policy and can be purchased for an additional premium. Not available in all states.

 
Learn About Glass
 


Towing Coverage
This coverage helps pay towing and labor charges associated with getting your vehicle running again in the event of a break down. For example, if your car battery dies on the interstate, this coverage could help pay for the costs of having your vehicle jumped started.

 
Learn About Towing
 


Rental Car Expense
Transportation Expense coverage helps to pay for a rental car in the event of a covered comprehensive or collision loss. For example, you slide off a wet road crashing into a tree, this coverage could help pay for the charges to rent a replacement vehicle while yours is in the shop for repairs.

 
Learn About Rental Expense
 


Personal Umbrella Insurance
Umbrella coverage goes beyond accidents and damages and helps when a covered loss exceeds the liability coverage limits of your home or auto policies. For example, if you are sued and the legal costs exceed the limits of your primary coverage, umbrella coverage can help cover the excess costs.
 
Learn About Umbrella

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

History[edit]




1875 postcard calendar for the Hartford Accident Insurance Co.


The Hartford was founded in 1810 in Hartford, Connecticut. A group of local merchants gathered in a Hartford inn and, with working capital of $15,000, founded the Hartford Fire Insurance Company. The company survived some of the greatest peacetime tragedies in American history. After a huge fire destroyed New York's financial district in 1835, The Hartford's president, Eliphalet Terry, used his personal wealth to cover all of the company's damage claims. Other catastrophic events included the Chicago fire of 1871 and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire.
The company logo shows a male deer, which in full maturity was referred to by the medieval hunting term hart. The etymology of 'Hartford' is the ford where harts cross (deer crossing). The Seal of the City of Hartford[4] likewise features a mature male deer.
Acquisitions, divestitures and related changes[edit]

1913: Formed the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company to provide a wide variety of insurance coverage, including accident, automobile-liability, personal-damage, business-interruption and more.
1959: Expanded into the life-insurance business by acquiring The Columbian National Life Insurance Company in Boston, Massachusetts.
1970: The Hartford was acquired by ITT Corporation for $1.4 billion,[5] at the time the largest corporate takeover in American history. The combined company was renamed ITT-Hartford Group, Inc.
1995: ITT decided to streamline its operations and release some of its subsidiaries, and The Hartford became an independent entity once again, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "HIG."
1997: Changed name from ITT-Hartford Group, Inc. to the Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., and also issued an IPO for its Hartford Life business under the ticker symbol “HLI.”
2000: Reacquired all the shares of Hartford Life (HLI was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in 2006).

History[edit]




1875 postcard calendar for the Hartford Accident Insurance Co.


The Hartford was founded in 1810 in Hartford, Connecticut. A group of local merchants gathered in a Hartford inn and, with working capital of $15,000, founded the Hartford Fire Insurance Company. The company survived some of the greatest peacetime tragedies in American history. After a huge fire destroyed New York's financial district in 1835, The Hartford's president, Eliphalet Terry, used his personal wealth to cover all of the company's damage claims. Other catastrophic events included the Chicago fire of 1871 and the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire.
The company logo shows a male deer, which in full maturity was referred to by the medieval hunting term hart. The etymology of 'Hartford' is the ford where harts cross (deer crossing). The Seal of the City of Hartford[4] likewise features a mature male deer.
Acquisitions, divestitures and related changes[edit]

1913: Formed the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Company to provide a wide variety of insurance coverage, including accident, automobile-liability, personal-damage, business-interruption and more.
1959: Expanded into the life-insurance business by acquiring The Columbian National Life Insurance Company in Boston, Massachusetts.
1970: The Hartford was acquired by ITT Corporation for $1.4 billion,[5] at the time the largest corporate takeover in American history. The combined company was renamed ITT-Hartford Group, Inc.
1995: ITT decided to streamline its operations and release some of its subsidiaries, and The Hartford became an independent entity once again, trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol "HIG."
1997: Changed name from ITT-Hartford Group, Inc. to the Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc., and also issued an IPO for its Hartford Life business under the ticker symbol “HLI.”
2000: Reacquired all the shares of Hartford Life (HLI was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in 2006).
2004: Purchased the Group Benefits Division of CNA Financial. The division was based in Chicago, Illinois.[citation needed]
March 2012: Announced it would focus on property and casualty insurance, group benefits and mutual funds, and would sell its wealth management businesses.[6]
2013: Sold its life insurance business to Prudential, retirement plans to MassMutual, and a broker-dealer to AIG.[7]
2014: Sold its Japan annuities business to Orix Life Insurance Corp.[8]

HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE CO - 10-K - 20020328 - RESULTS_OF_OPERATIONS






	CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS




	Hartford Life Insurance Company provides investment and retirement products
	such as variable and fixed annuities, mutual funds and retirement plan
	services; individual and corporate owned life insurance; and, group benefit
	products such as group life and group disability insurance that is directly written by the Company and is substantially ceded to its parent, Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company (HLA).



	The Company derives its revenues principally from: (a) fee income, including
	asset management fees on separate account and mortality
	and expense fees, as well as cost of insurance charges; (b) fully insured
	premiums; (c) certain other fees; and (d) net investment income on general
	account assets. Asset management fees and mortality and expense fees are
	primarily generated from separate account assets, which are deposited with the
	Company through the sale of variable annuity and variable life products and
	mutual funds. Cost of insurance charges are assessed on the net amount at risk
	for investment-oriented life insurance products. Premium revenues are derived
	primarily from the sale of group life and group disability insurance products.



	The Companys expenses essentially consist of interest credited to
	policyholders on general account liabilities, insurance benefits provided,
	dividends to policyholders, costs of selling and servicing the various products
	offered by the Company, and other general business expenses.



	The Companys profitability depends largely on the amount of assets under
	management, the level of fully insured premiums, the adequacy of product
	pricing and underwriting discipline, claims management and operating
	efficiencies, and its ability to earn target spreads between earned investment
	rates on general account assets and credited rates to customers. The level of
	assets under management is generally impacted by equity market performance,
	persistency of the in-force block of business, sales and other deposits, as
	well as any acquired blocks of business.

	Table of Contents





	Hartford Life Insurance Company has the following reportable segments:
	Investment Products, Individual Life and Corporate Owned Life Insurance (COLI).
	The Company reports in Other corporate items not directly allocable to any
	of its segments, as well as certain group benefits, including group life and
	group disability insurance that is directly written by the Company and is
	substantially ceded to its parent, HLA. For information regarding the
	Companys segments, see Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.



	On April 2, 2001, The Hartford acquired the United States individual life
	insurance, annuity and mutual fund businesses of Fortis. (For further
	discussion, see Acquisitions in the Capital Resources and Liquidity section
	and Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.) This
	transaction was accounted for as a purchase and, as such, the revenues and
	expenses generated by this business from April 2, 2001 forward are included in
	the Companys consolidated results of operations.




	2001 Compared to 2000



	


	Revenues increased $208, or 6%, primarily related to
	the growth across each of the Companys primary operating segments,
	particularly the Individual Life segment, where revenues increased $229, or
	42%. The revenue growth in the Individual Life segment was primarily due to
	higher earned fee income and net investment income resulting from the business
	acquired from Fortis. Revenues related to the Companys Individual Annuity
	business were down $55 or 4%, primarily due to lower fee income as a result of
	the lower equity markets in 2001. Additionally, COLI revenues were below prior
	year due to a decrease in variable COLI sales and the declining block of
	leveraged COLI business.



	Total expenses increased $43, or 1%, primarily associated with the growth in
	revenues discussed above. Net income increased $159, or 33%, led by the
	Individual Life where net income increased $36, or 51% primarily as the result
	of the business acquired from Fortis. In addition, the 2001 results include a
	$130 federal income tax benefit primarily related to separate account
	investment activity and a $9 charge associated with the impact of the
	September 11 terrorist attack. Additionally, 2000 results include a benefit
	of $32 also related to favorable tax items. Excluding these tax items and the
	impact of the September 11 terrorist attack, net income increased $70, or 15%,
	for the year ended December 31, 2001, as each of the Companys operating
	segments experienced growth from a year ago.




	2000 Compared to 1999



	


	Revenues increased slightly, primarily related to the
	growth in the Investment Products segment, due to higher fee income in the
	individual annuity operation as related average account values in 2000 were
	higher than 1999. Partially offsetting the growth in revenues was a decrease
	in COLI revenues primarily related to the declining block of leveraged COLI
	business.



	Expenses decreased $79, or 3%, as increases in the Investment Products segment
	were more than offset by declines in the Companys other operating segments,
	particularly the COLI segment where expenses decreased consistent with
	revenues. Net income increased $126, or 35%, led by the Investment Products
	segment where net income increased $54, or 18%. Hartford Life Insurance
	Company also recorded a benefit related to the settlement of certain federal
	tax matters of $24 in 2000. This benefit, along with an $8 benefit related to state income
	taxes, resulted in $32 of tax benefits for the year ended December 31, 2000.
	Additionally, net realized capital losses, after-tax, increased $55 due to
	portfolio rebalancing. Excluding the tax items and net realized capital
	losses, earnings increased $149, or 41%.




	Outlook




	Management believes that it has developed and implemented strategies to
	maintain and enhance its position as a market leader within the financial
	services industry and to continue the Companys growth in assets. Hartford
	Life Insurance Company is well positioned to assist individuals in meeting
	their financial goals as they increasingly save and plan for retirement,
	protect themselves and their families against disability or death and prepare
	their estates for an efficient transfer of wealth between generations.
	Hartford Life Insurance Companys strong market position in its primary
	businesses, which align with these growing markets, will provide opportunities
	to increase sales of the Companys products and services.



	Certain proposed legislative initiatives, which could impact Hartford Life
	Insurance Company are discussed in the Regulatory Matters and Contingencies
	section.

	The Investment Products segment focuses on the savings and retirement needs of
	the growing number of individuals who are preparing for retirement or have
	already retired through the sale of individual variable and fixed annuities,
	mutual funds, retirement plan services and other investment products. The
	Company is both a leading writer of individual variable annuities and a top
	seller of individual variable annuities through banks in the United States.




	2001 Compared to 2000



	


	Revenues in the Investment Products segment increased
	$46, or 2%, driven primarily by other investment products. Revenues from other
	investment products increased $101, or 16%, principally due to growth in net
	investment income. Net investment income in other investment products increased $110, or 20%, due mostly to
	growth in the institutional business, where account values were $9.1 billion at
	December 31, 2001, an increase of $1.4 billion, or 18%, from a year ago. The
	increase in revenues from other investment products was partially offset by
	individual annuity revenues, which decreased $55 or 4%. Fee income and net
	investment income from the individual annuity business acquired from Fortis
	helped to partially offset lower revenues in the individual annuity operation,
	which was primarily associated with decreased account values resulting from the
	lower equity markets as compared to the prior year.



	Total expenses increased $25, or 1%, driven by higher interest credited and
	insurance operating expenses related to other investment products consistent
	with the revenue growth described above. Interest credited related to other
	investment products increased $78, or 18%. Also, individual annuity benefits
	and claims expenses increased $37, or 15%, principally due to the business
	acquired from Fortis and higher death benefits resulting from the lower equity
	markets in 2001. Individual annuitys insurance operating costs increased $13,
	or 5% also due to the business acquired from Fortis. Partially offsetting the
	increase in benefits, claims, and insurance operating costs was a decrease in
	amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs of $64, or 13% resulting from
	the lower gross profits associated with the individual annuity business. In
	addition, income tax expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2001 was
	$111, a $39 or 26% decrease due to lower pretax operating income and the
	ongoing tax impact related to separate account investment activity.



	Net income increased $21, or 6%. These increases were driven by the growth in
	revenues in other investment products described above, the favorable impact of
	Fortis and the lower effective tax rate related to the individual annuity
	business.




	2000 Compared to 1999



	


	Revenues increased $184, or 10%, primarily due to
	higher fee income in the individual annuity operations. Fee income generated
	by individual annuities increased $175, or 16%, while related average account
	values grew $8.2 billion, or 10%, to $88.1 billion. The growth in average
	account values was due, in part, to strong sales of $10.7 billion in 2000, and
	the significant equity market performance in 1999, partially offset by
	surrenders. Although average individual annuity account values in 2000 were
	higher than 1999, account values at December 31, 2000 declined $1.7 billion, or
	2%, as compared to December 31, 1999, as strong sales were not sufficient to
	offset surrenders and the impact of the retreating equity markets.



	Due to the continued growth in this segment, expenses increased $130, or 8%.
	This increase was driven by amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs
	and operating costs, which grew $66, or 16%, and $39, or 14%, respectively,
	primarily related to growth in the individual annuity operation.



	Net income increased $54, or 18%, primarily due to the growth in revenues
	discussed above. Additionally, the Investment Products segment continued to
	maintain its profit margins related to its primary businesses, thus
	contributing to the segments earnings growth. In particular, its individual
	annuity operations operating expenses as a percentage of average individual
	annuity account values remained consistent with the prior year at 21 basis
	points.





	Outlook





	The market for retirement products continues to expand as individuals
	increasingly save and plan for retirement. Demographic trends suggest that as
	the baby boom generation matures, a significant portion of the United States
	population will allocate a greater



	12








	Table of Contents





	percentage of their disposable income to
	saving for their retirement years due to uncertainty surrounding the Social
	Security system and increases in average life expectancy. As this market
	grows, particularly for variable annuities, new companies
	are continually entering the market, aggressively seeking distribution
	channels and pursuing market share. This trend is not expected to subside,
	particularly in light of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the Financial
	Services Modernization Act), which permits affiliations among banks,
	insurance companies and securities firms.



	Management believes that it has developed and implemented strategies to
	maintain and enhance its position as a market leader in the financial services
	industry. For example, Hartford Life Insurance Company is introducing a tax
	advantaged college savings product (529 plan) in early 2002 called SMART 529.
	SMART 529 is a state-sponsored education savings program established by the
	State of West Virginia, which offers an easy way for both the residents of West
	Virginia and out-of-state participants to invest for a college education.
	SMART 529 will allow investors to choose from a wide variety of investment
	portfolios to match their risk preference to help investors accumulate savings
	for college. The SMART 529 product complements the Companys existing offering
	of investment products (mutual funds, variable annuities, 401 (k), 457 and 403
	(b) plans). It also leverages the Companys capabilities in distribution,
	service and fund performance. The Company believes this is a significant
	market opportunity and the benefits of investing in 529 plans will be well
	received by many Americans saving for college.

	The Individual Life segment sells a variety of life insurance products,
	including variable life, universal life, interest sensitive whole life and
	term life insurance primarily to the high end estate and business planning
	markets. Additionally, the Fortis transaction, through the addition of a
	retail broker dealer, which has been renamed Woodbury Financial Services, Inc.
	has allowed the Individual Life segment to increase its reach in the emerging
	affluent market.




	2001 Compared to 2000



	


	Revenues in the Individual Life segment increased $229,
	or 42%, primarily due to the business acquired from Fortis. Fee income,
	including cost of insurance charges, increased $161, or 41%, driven principally
	by growth in the variable life business. In addition, net investment income
	on general account business (universal life, interest sensitive whole life and
	term life) increased $62, or 44%, consistent with the growth in related account
	values.



	Benefits, claims and expenses increased $177, or 41%, due principally to the
	growth in revenues described above. Although death benefits were higher in
	2001 than the prior year as a result of the increase in life insurance in
	force, year-to-date mortality experience (expressed as death claims as a
	percentage of net amount at risk) for 2001 was within pricing assumptions.



	Net income increased $36, or 51% primarily due to the revenue growth described
	above. Individual Life incurred an after-tax loss of $3 related to the
	September 11 terrorist attack. Excluding this loss, operating income
	increased $39, or 56%, primarily due to the growth factors described above.




	2000 Compared to 1999



	


	Revenues decreased $29, or 5%, and expenses decreased
	$31, or 6%, primarily due to HLAs December 1, 1999 recapture of an in force
	block of individual life insurance previously ceded to the Company. (For a
	discussion of the recapture, see Note 12 of the Consolidated Financial
	Statements.)



	Excluding the recapture described above, revenues increased $58, or 12%. This
	increase in revenues is attributed to higher fee income associated with the
	growing block of variable life insurance. Fee income increased $58, or 17%, as
	variable life account values increased $352, or 14%, and variable life
	insurance in force increased $9.6 billion, or 40%.



	Excluding the recapture described above, expenses increased $53, or 13%. The
	increase in expenses were primarily due to a $22, or 11%, increase in benefits,
	claims and claim adjustment expenses and a $13, or 11%, increase in
	amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs mostly associated with the
	growth in this segments variable business. Additionally, insurance costs and
	other increased $15, or 19%, directly associated with the growth in this
	segment as previously described. Excluding the recapture described above, net
	income increased $5, or 8%, primarily due to higher fee income as mortality
	experience was consistent with prior year.




	Outlook




	Management believes that the Companys strong market position will provide
	opportunities for growth in this segment as individuals increasingly focus on
	estate planning. The Hartfords acquisition of the United States individual
	life insurance business of Fortis has increased its scale while broadening its
	distribution capabilities as described above.

	Hartford Life Insurance Company is a leader in the COLI market, which includes
	life insurance policies purchased by a company on the lives of its employees,
	with the company or a trust sponsored by the company named as beneficiary under
	the policy. Until the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of
	1996 (HIPA Act of 1996), the Company sold two principal types of COLI
	business, leveraged and variable products. Leveraged COLI is a fixed premium
	life insurance policy owned by a company or a trust sponsored by a company.
	The HIPA Act of 1996 phased out the deductibility of interest on policy loans
	under leveraged COLI through the end of 1998, virtually eliminating all future
	sales of this product. Variable COLI continues to be a product used by
	employers to fund non-qualified benefits or other postemployment benefit
	liabilities.




	2001 Compared to 2000



	


	COLI revenues decreased $48, or 6%, mostly due to lower
	fee income and net investment income. Fee income and other decreased $34, or
	8%, due to a decline in variable COLI sales and deposits which were
	approximately $1.5 billion in 2001 as compared to $2.9 billion in 2000. In
	addition, net investment income decreased $14, or 4% due primarily to lower
	interest rates, and the decline in leveraged COLI account values.



	Benefits, claims and expenses decreased $47, or 7%, directly related to the
	decrease in revenue discussed above.



	Net income increased $1 or 3% primarily due to the overall growth in variable
	COLI business and earnings associated with the leveraged COLI business
	recaptured in 1998. COLI incurred an after-tax charge of $2 related to the
	September 11 terrorist attack; excluding this charge, net income increased $3,
	or 9%.




	2000 Compared to 1999



	


	Revenues in the COLI segment decreased $65, or 8%, due
	to a decline in net investment income of $65, or 15%. This decline was
	principally due to the leveraged COLI block of business, as related account
	values decreased $751, or 13%, as a result of the continued downsizing caused
	by the HIPA Act of 1996.



	Expenses decreased $72, or 9%, primarily due to the factor described above.
	Net income increased $7, or 25%, principally due to the variable COLI business
	where related account values increased $3.6 billion, or 29%, as well as
	earnings associated with a block of leveraged COLI business recaptured in 1998.




	Outlook




	The focus of this segment is variable COLI, which continues to be a product
	generally used by employers to fund non-qualified benefits or other
	postemployment benefit liabilities. The leveraged COLI product has been an
	important contributor to Hartford Life Insurance Companys profitability in
	recent years and will continue to contribute to the profitability of Hartford
	Life Insurance Company in the future, although the level of profit from
	leveraged COLI is expected to decline. COLI is subject to a changing
	legislative and regulatory environment that could have a material adverse
	effect on its business.




	DEFERRED ACQUISITION COSTS (DAC) AND RESERVES




	Management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
	reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
	statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
	reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The most
	significant estimates include those used in determining deferred policy
	acquisition costs and the liability for future policyholder benefits and other
	policyholder funds. Although some variability is inherent in these estimates,
	management believes the amounts provided are adequate.




	Deferred Acquisition Costs




	Policy acquisition costs, which include commissions and certain other expenses
	that vary with and are primarily associated with acquiring business, are
	deferred and amortized over the estimated lives of the contracts, usually 20
	years.



	Deferred policy acquisition costs related to investment contracts and universal
	life type contracts are deferred and amortized using the retrospective deposit
	method. Under the retrospective deposit method, acquisition costs are
	amortized in proportion to the present



	14








	Table of Contents





	value of expected gross profits from
	investment, mortality and expense margins and surrender charges. Actual gross
	profits can vary
	from managements estimates, resulting in increases or decreases in the rate of
	amortization. Management periodically reviews these estimates and evaluates
	the recoverability of the deferred acquisition cost asset. When appropriate,
	management revises its assumptions on the estimated gross profits of these
	contracts and the cumulative amortization for the books of business are
	re-estimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge or credit to income. The
	average rate of assumed future investment yield used in estimating expected
	gross profits related to variable annuity and variable life business was 9.0%
	at December 31, 2001 and for all other products including fixed annuities and
	other universal life type contracts the average assumed investment yield ranged
	from 5.0-8.5%.



	Deferred policy acquisition costs related to traditional policies are amortized
	over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the
	ratio of the present value of annual expected premium income to the present
	value of total expected premium income. Adjustments are made each year to
	recognize actual experience as compared to assumed experience for the current
	period.



	To date, our experience has generally been consistent or favorable to the
	assumptions used in determining DAC amortization. However, if we were to
	experience a material adverse deviation in certain critical assumptions,
	including surrender rates, mortality experience, or investment performance,
	there could be a negative affect to the Companys reported earnings and
	shareholders equity.




	Reserves




	In accordance with applicable insurance regulations under which Hartford Life
	Insurance Company operates, life insurance subsidiaries of the Company
	establish and carry as liabilities actuarially determined reserves which are
	calculated to meet their future obligations. Reserves for life insurance and
	disability contracts are based on actuarially recognized methods using
	prescribed morbidity and mortality tables in general use in the United States,
	which are modified to reflect the Companys actual experience when appropriate.
	These reserves are computed at amounts that, with additions from estimated
	premiums to be received and with interest on such reserves compounded annually
	at certain assumed rates, are expected to be sufficient to meet the Companys
	policy obligations at their maturities or in the event of an insureds death.
	Reserves also include unearned premiums, premium deposits, claims incurred but
	not reported and claims reported but not yet paid. Reserves for assumed
	reinsurance are computed in a manner that is comparable to direct insurance
	reserves.



	The liability for policy benefits for universal life-type contracts and
	interest-sensitive whole life policies is equal to the balance that accrues to
	the benefit of policyholders, including credited interest, amounts that have
	been assessed to compensate the Company for services to be performed over
	future periods, and any amounts previously assessed against policyholders that
	are refundable on termination of the contract. For investment contracts,
	policyholder liabilities are equal to the accumulated policy account values,
	which consist of an accumulation of deposit payments plus credited interest,
	less withdrawals and amounts assessed through the end of the period. For the
	Companys group disability policies, the level of reserves is based on a
	variety of factors including particular diagnoses, termination rates and
	benefit levels.



	The persistency of the Companys annuity and other interest-sensitive life
	insurance reserves is enhanced by policy restrictions on the withdrawal of
	funds. Withdrawals in excess of allowable penalty-free amounts are assessed a
	surrender charge during a penalty period, which is usually at least seven
	years. Such surrender charge is initially a percentage of either the
	accumulation value or considerations received, which varies by product, and
	generally decreases gradually during the penalty period. Surrender charges are
	set at levels to protect the Company from loss on early terminations and to
	reduce the likelihood of policyholders terminating their policies during
	periods of increasing interest rates, thereby lengthening the effective
	duration of policy liabilities and improving the Companys ability to maintain
	profitability on such policies.




	INVESTMENTS




	Hartford Life Insurance Companys investments are managed by its investment
	strategy group which consists of a risk management unit and a portfolio
	management unit and reports directly to senior management of the Company. The
	risk management unit is responsible for monitoring and managing the Companys
	asset/liability profile and establishing investment objectives and guidelines.
	The portfolio management unit is responsible for determining, within
	specified risk tolerances and investment guidelines, the appropriate asset
	allocation, duration, and convexity characteristics of the Companys general
	account and guaranteed separate account investment portfolios. The Hartford
	Investment Management Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Hartford
	Financial Services Group, Inc., executes the investment plan of the investment
	strategy group including the identification and purchase of securities that
	fulfill the objectives of the strategy group.



	The primary investment objective of the Companys general account is to
	maximize after-tax returns consistent with acceptable risk parameters
	(including the management of the interest rate sensitivity of invested assets
	relative to that of policyholder obligations) as discussed in the Capital
	Markets Risk Management section under Market Risk  Interest Rate Risk.

	Table of Contents





	The Companys general account consists of a diversified portfolio of
	investments. Although all the assets of the general account support the
	Companys general account liabilities, the Companys investment strategy group
	has developed separate investment portfolios for specific classes of product
	liabilities within the general account. The strategy group works closely with
	the business lines to develop specific investment guidelines, including
	duration targets, asset allocation and convexity constraints, asset/liability
	mismatch tolerances and return objectives for each product line in order to
	achieve each product lines individual risk and return objectives.



	Invested assets in the Companys general account totaled $23.6 billion as of
	December 31, 2001 and were comprised of $19.1 billion of fixed maturities, $3.3
	billion of policy loans, equity securities of $64 and other investments of $1.1
	billion. As of December 31, 2000, general account invested assets totaled
	$18.7 billion and were comprised of $14.3 billion of fixed maturities, $3.6
	billion of policy loans, equity securities of $48 and other investments of
	$784. The decrease in policy loans was primarily due to the decline in
	leveraged COLI business (as discussed in the COLI section). Policy loans are
	secured by the cash value of the underlying life policy and do not mature in a
	conventional sense, but expire in conjunction with the related policy
	liabilities. The increase in other investments primarily reflects an increase
	in limited partnership investments.



	The following table sets forth by type the fixed maturity securities held in
	the Companys general account as of December 31, 2001 and 2000.

	During 2001, corporate and ABS fixed maturity investments increased due to the
	Fortis acquisition.



	As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, approximately 22% and 25%, respectively,
	of the Companys fixed maturity portfolio was invested in private placement
	securities (including 13% and 15% of Rule 144A offerings as of December 31,
	2001 and 2000, respectively). Private placement securities are generally less
	liquid than public securities. However, private placements generally have
	covenants designed to compensate for liquidity risk. Most of the private
	placement securities in the operations portfolio are rated by nationally
	recognized rating agencies. (For further discussion of the Companys
	investment credit policies, see the Capital Markets Risk Management section

	2001 Compared to 2000



	


	Net investment income, excluding policy loan income,
	increased $170, or 17%. The increase was primarily due to income earned on
	the previously discussed increase in fixed maturity investments, partially
	offset by lower yields on fixed maturities in the third and fourth quarters of
	2001. Yields on overall average invested assets were flat.



	Net realized capital losses increased $6 compared to 2000. Included in 2001
	net realized capital losses were write-downs for other than temporary
	impairments on fixed maturities of $93, including a $37 loss related to
	securities issued by Enron Corporation. Also



	16








	Table of Contents





	included in net realized capital
	losses is a $10 loss recognized on the sale of the Companys interest in an
	Argentine insurance joint
	venture, in addition to losses associated with the credit deterioration of
	certain investments in which the Company has an indirect economic interest.
	These losses were partially offset by gains from the sale of fixed maturities.




	2000 Compared to 1999 

	Net investment income, excluding policy loan income,
	increased $53, or 5%. The increase was primarily due to higher yields earned
	on the investment cash flow from operations and reinvestment of proceeds from
	sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities in a higher interest rate
	environment. Policy loan income decreased $86, or 22%, due to the decrease
	in leveraged COLI business. Yield on average invested assets increased to
	7.1%, as a result of an increase in the policy loan weighted average interest
	rate to 8.5% in 2000 from 7.5% in 1999. Net realized capital losses increased
	$81 compared to 1999 primarily as a result of portfolio rebalancing in a
	higher interest rate environment.




	Separate Account Products




	Separate account products are those for which a separate investment and
	liability account is maintained on behalf of the policyholder. Separate
	accounts reflect two categories of risk assumption: non-guaranteed separate
	accounts totaling $104.2 billion and $104.1 billion as of December 31, 2001 and
	2000, respectively, wherein the policyholder assumes substantially all the
	investment risk and reward, and guaranteed separate accounts totaling $10.1
	billion and $9.6 billion as of December 31, 2001 and 2000, respectively,
	wherein Hartford Life Insurance Company contractually guarantees either a
	minimum return or account value to the policyholder. The primary investment
	objective of the Companys guaranteed separate account is to maximize after-tax
	returns consistent with acceptable risk parameters (including the management of
	the interest rate sensitivity of invested assets relative to that of
	policyholder obligations) as discussed in the Capital Market Risk Management
	section under Market Risk  Interest Rate Risk.



	Investment objectives for non-guaranteed separate accounts vary by fund type,
	as outlined in the applicable fund prospectus or separate account plan of
	operations. Non-guaranteed separate account products include variable
	annuities, variable life insurance contracts and variable COLI. Guaranteed
	separate account products primarily consist of modified guaranteed individual
	annuities and modified guaranteed life insurance and generally include market
	value adjustment features and surrender charges to mitigate the risk of
	disintermediation.




	CAPITAL MARKETS RISK MANAGEMENT




	Hartford Life Insurance Company is exposed to two primary sources of investment
	risk and asset/liability management risk: credit risk, relating to the
	uncertainty associated with an obligors continued ability to make timely
	payment of principal and/or interest, and market risk, relating to the market
	price and/or cash flow variability associated with changes in interest rates,
	security prices, market indices, yield curves or currency exchange rates. The
	Company does not hold any financial instruments purchased for trading purposes.
	The following discussion identifies the Companys policies and procedures for
	managing these risks and monitoring the results of the Companys risk
	management activities.




	Credit Risk




	Hartford Life Insurance Company has established investment credit policies that
	focus on the credit quality of obligors and counterparties, limit credit
	concentrations, encourage diversification and require frequent creditworthiness
	reviews. Investment activity, including setting of policy and defining
	acceptable risk levels, is subject to regular review and approval by senior
	management.



	The Company invests primarily in securities which are rated investment grade
	and has established exposure limits, diversification standards and review
	procedures for all credit risks including borrower, issuer and counterparty.
	Creditworthiness of specific obligors is determined by an internal credit
	evaluation supplemented by consideration of external determinants of
	creditworthiness, typically ratings assigned by nationally recognized ratings
	agencies. Obligor, asset sector and industry concentrations are subject to
	established limits and monitored on a regular interval.



	The Companys derivatives counterparty exposure policy establishes market-based
	credit limits, favors long-term financial stability and creditworthiness, and
	typically requires credit enhancement/credit risk reducing agreements. Credit
	risk is measured as the amount owed to the Company based on current market
	conditions and potential payment obligations between the Company and its
	counterparties. Credit exposures are generally quantified weekly and netted,
	and collateral is pledged to and held by, or on behalf of, the Company to the
	extent the current value of derivatives exceeds exposure policy thresholds.



	Hartford Life Insurance Company is not exposed to any significant credit
	concentration risk of a single issuer.



	The following table identifies fixed maturity securities, including guaranteed
	separate accounts, for the Companys operations by credit quality. The ratings
	referenced in the tables are based on the ratings of nationally recognized
	rating organizations or, if not rated, assigned based on the Companys internal
	analysis of such securities.

	As of December 31, 2001 and 2000, over 96% and 97%, respectively, of the fixed
	maturity portfolio was invested in securities rated investment grade (BBB and
	above). During 2001, the percentage of BBB rated fixed maturity investments
	increased due to the Fortis acquisition and the continued active management of
	the general account portfolios.

	The Company also maintains credit policies regarding the financial stability
	and credit standing of its major derivatives counterparties and typically
	requires credit enhancement provisions to further reduce its credit risk.
	Credit risk for derivative contracts are limited to the amounts calculated to
	be due to the Company on such contracts based on current market conditions and
	potential payment obligations between the Company and its counterparties.
	Credit exposures are generally quantified weekly and netted. Collateral is
	pledged to and held by, or on behalf of, the Company to the extent the current
	value of derivatives exceeds exposure policy thresholds.

This prospectus describes information you should know before you purchase Series
VI of Putnam Hartford Capital Manager variable annuity. Please read it          
carefully.                                                                      

Putnam Hartford Capital Manager variable annuity is a contract between you and  
Hartford Life Insurance Company where you agree to make at least one Premium    
Payment to us and we agree to make a series of Annuity Payouts at a later date. 
This Contract is a flexible premium, tax-deferred, variable annuity offered to  
both individuals and groups. It is:                                             

X  Flexible, because you may add Premium Payments at any time.                  

X  Tax-deferred, which means you don't pay taxes until you take money out or    
until we start to make Annuity Payouts.                                   

X  Variable, because the value of your Contract will fluctuate with the         
performance of the underlying Funds.                                      

At the time you purchase your Contract, you allocate your Premium Payment to    
"Sub-Accounts". These are subdivisions of our Separate Account, an account that 
keeps your Contract assets separate from our company assets. The Sub-Accounts   
then purchase shares of mutual funds set up exclusively for variable annuity or 
variable life insurance products. These are not the same mutual funds that you  
buy through your stockbroker or through a retail mutual fund. They may have     
similar investment strategies and the same portfolio managers as retail mutual  
funds. This Contract offers you Funds with investment strategies ranging from   
conservative to aggressive and you may pick those Funds that meet your          
investment goals and risk tolerance. The Sub-Accounts and the Funds are listed  
below:

These terms are capitalized when used throughout this prospectus. Please refer  
to these defined terms if you have any questions as you read your prospectus.   

ACCOUNT: Any of the Sub-Accounts or Fixed Accumulation Feature.                 

ACCUMULATION UNITS: If you allocate your Premium Payment to any of the          
Sub-Accounts, we will convert those payments into Accumulation Units in the     
selected Sub-Accounts. Accumulation Units are valued at the end of each         
Valuation Day and are used to calculate the value of your Contract prior to     
Annuitization.

ANNIVERSARY VALUE: The value equal to the Contract Value as of a Contract

(1) Each Premium Payment has its own Contingent Deferred Sales Charge schedule. 
  The Contingent Deferred Sales Charge is not assessed on partial Surrenders
which do not exceed the Annual Withdrawal Amount.                       

(2) Length of time from each Premium Payment.                                   

(3) An annual $30 charge deducted on a Contract Anniversary or upon Surrender if
the Contract Value at either of those times is less than $50,000. It is 
   deducted proportionately from the Accounts in which you are invested at the
time of the charge.                                                     

The purpose of the Fee Table and Examples is to assist you in understanding     
various costs and expenses that you will pay directly or indirectly. The Fee    
Table and Examples reflect expenses of the Separate Account and underlying      
Funds. We will deduct any Premium Taxes that apply. The Examples assume that any
fee waivers or expense reimbursements for the underlying Funds will continue for
the period shown in the Examples.                                               

The Examples should not be considered a representation of past or future        
expenses and actual expenses may be greater or less than those shown. In the    
following Example table, Hartford assumes a Contract Value of $40,000 to        
illustrate the charges that would be deducted. Our average Contact Value is     
$80,000, but we use a smaller Contract Value so that we can show you the highest
possible deductions. These Examples assume that the Annual Maintenance Fee will 
always be deducted if the Contract is Surrendered. If your Contract Value is    
$50,000 or more, Hartford waives the Annual Maintenance Fee, so these Examples  
show charges that are higher than you would have to pay. We change the Annual   
Maintenance Fee for a $40,000 Contract Value into a percentage to more easily   
calculate the charges. The percentage we use is 0.075%.

HIGHLIGHTS                                                                      
HOW DO I PURCHASE THIS CONTRACT?                                                

You must complete our application or order request and submit it to us for      
approval with your first Premium Payment. Your first Premium Payment must be at 
least $1,000 and subsequent Premium Payments must be at least $500, unless you  
take advantage of our InvestEase-Registered Trademark- Program or are part of   
certain retirement plans.                                                       

-  For a limited time, usually within ten days after you receive your Contract, 
you may cancel your Contract without paying a Contingent Deferred Sales   
Charge. You may bear the investment risk for your Premium Payment prior to
our receipt of your request for cancellation.                             

WHAT TYPE OF SALES CHARGE WILL I PAY?                                           

You don't pay a sales charge when you purchase your Contract. We may charge you 
a Contingent Deferred Sales Charge when you partially or fully Surrender your   
Contract. The Contingent Deferred Sales Charge will depend on the amount you    
choose to Surrender and the length of time the Premium Payment you made has been
in your Contract.                                                               

The percentage used to calculate the Contingent Deferred Sales Charge is equal  
to:

X  The Annual Withdrawal Amount                                                 

X  Premium Payments or earnings that have been in your Contract for more than   
seven years                                                               

X  Distributions made due to death                                              

X  Most payments we made to you as part of your Contract Payout                 

IS THERE AN ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FEE?                                             

We deduct this $30.00 fee each year on your Contract Anniversary or when you    
fully Surrender your Contract, if, on either of those dates, the value of your  
Contract is less than $50,000.                                                  

WHAT CHARGES WILL I PAY ON AN ANNUAL BASIS?                                     

In addition to the Annual Maintenance Fee, you pay the following charges each   
year:                                                                           

- MORTALITY AND EXPENSE RISK CHARGE -- This charge is for insurance. It is      
subtracted daily and is equal to an annual charge of 1.25% of your Contract 
Value invested in the Funds.                                                

- ADMINISTRATIVE CHARGE -- This charge is for administration. It is subtracted  
daily and is equal to an annual charge of 0.15% of your Contract Value      
invested in the Funds.                                                      

- ANNUAL FUND OPERATING EXPENSES -- These are charges for the Funds. See the    
Annual Fund Operating Expenses table for more complete information and the  
Funds' prospectuses accompanying this prospectus.                           

- OPTIONAL DEATH BENEFIT CHARGE -- If you elect the Optional Death Benefit, we  
will subtract an additional charge on a daily basis until we begin to make  
Annuity Payouts that is equal to an annual charge of 0.15% of your Contract 
Value invested in the Funds.                                                

- EARNINGS PROTECTION BENEFIT CHARGE -- If you elect the Earnings Protection    
  Benefit, we will subtract an additional charge on a daily basis until we begin
to make Annuity Payouts that is equal to an annual charge of 0.20% of your  
Contract Value invested in the Funds.                                       

CAN I TAKE OUT ANY OF MY MONEY?                                                 

You may Surrender all or part of the amounts you have invested at any time      
before we start making Annuity Payouts. Once Annuity Payouts begin, you may take
full or partial Surrenders under the Payments for a Period Certain, Life Annuity
with Payments for a Period Certain or the Joint and Last Survivor Life Annuity  
with Payments for a Period Certain Annuity Options, but only if you selected the
variable dollar amount Annuity Payouts.                                         

-  You may have to pay income tax on the money you take out and, if you         
Surrender before you are age 59 1/2, you may have to pay an income tax    
penalty.                                                                  

-  You may have to pay a Contingent Deferred Sales Charge on the money you      
Surrender.                                                                

WILL HARTFORD PAY A DEATH BENEFIT?                                              

There is a Death Benefit if the Contract Owner, joint owner or the Annuitant die
before we begin to make Annuity Payouts. The Death Benefit will be calculated as
of the date we receive a certified death certificate or other legal document    
acceptable to us. The Death Benefit amount will remain invested in the Sub-     
Accounts according to your last instructions and will fluctuate with the        
performance of the underlying Funds.                                            

If death occurs before the Annuity Commencement Date, the Death Benefit is the  
greatest of:                                                                    

- The total Premium Payments you have made to us minus the dollar amount of any 
partial Surrenders, or

- The Contract Value of your Contract, or                                       

- Your Maximum Anniversary Value, which is described below.                     

The Maximum Anniversary Value is based on a series of calculations on Contract  
Anniversaries of Contract Values, Premium Payments and partial Surrenders. We   
will calculate an Anniversary Value for each Contract Anniversary prior to the  
deceased's 81st birthday or date of death, whichever is earlier. The Anniversary
Value is equal to the Contract Value as of a Contract Anniversary, increased by 
the dollar amount of any Premium Payments made since that anniversary and       
reduced by the dollar amount of any partial Surrenders since that anniversary.  
The Maximum Anniversary Value is equal to the greatest Anniversary Value        
attained from this series of calculations.                                      

OPTIONAL DEATH BENEFIT -- If you elect the Optional Death Benefit at an         
additional charge, the Death Benefit will be the greatest of:                   

-  The total Premium Payments you have made to us minus the dollar amount of any
partial Surrenders;                                                       

-  The Contract Value of your Contract;                                         

-  Your Maximum Anniversary Value; or                                           

-  Your Interest Accumulation Value on the date your Optional Death Benefit is  
added to your Contract.                                                   

The Optional Death Benefit may not be available if the Contract Owner or        
Annuitant is age 76 or older. For Contracts issued in Washington or New York,   
the Optional Death Benefit is not available. Once you elect the Optional Death  
Benefit, you cannot cancel it.                                                  

EARNINGS PROTECTION BENEFIT -- You may also elect the Earnings Protection       
Benefit at an additional charge. The Earnings Protection Benefit may not        
currently be available in your state and is not available in Washington or New  
York. The Earnings Protection Benefit will not be available if you or your      
Annuitant is age 76 or older on the date the Earnings Protection Benefit is     
added to your Contract. Once you elect the Earnings Protection Benefit, you     
cannot cancel it.                                                               

If you and your Annuitant are age 69 or under on the date the Earnings          
Protection Benefit is added to your Contract, the death benefit calculation is  
the greatest of:                                                                

- The total Premium Payments you have made to us minus the dollar amount of any 
partial Surrenders, or                                                      

- The Maximum Anniversary Value, or                                             

- Your Contract Value on the date we receive a death certificate or other legal 
document acceptable to us plus 40% of the Contract gain since the date the  
Earnings Protection Benefit was added to your Contract.                     

If you or your Annuitant are age 70 through 75 on the date the Earnings         
Protection Benefit is added to your Contract, the percentage of Contract gain   
added to your Contract Value is reduced to 25%.                                 

Your Contract gain is limited to or "capped" at a maximum of 200% of Contract   
Value on the date the Earnings Protection Benefit was added to your Contract    
plus Premium Payments not previously withdrawn made after the Earnings          
Protection Benefit was added to your Contract, excluding any Premium Payments   
made in the 12 months before the date of death. We subtract any adjustments for 
partial Surrenders.                                                             

WHAT ANNUITY PAYOUT OPTIONS ARE AVAILABLE?                                      

When it comes time for us to make payouts, you may choose one of the following  
Annuity Payout Options: Life Annuity, Life Annuity with Cash Refund, Life       
Annuity with Payments for a Period Certain, Joint and Last Survivor Life        
Annuity, Joint and Last Survivor Life Annuity with Payments for a Period Certain
and Payments for a Period Certain. We may make other Annuity Payout Options     
available at any time.                                                          

You must begin to take payments before the Annuitant's 90th birthday or the end 
of the 10th Contract Year, whichever comes later, unless you elect a later date 
to begin receiving payments subject to the laws and regulations then in effect  
and our approval. If you do not tell us what Annuity Payout Option you want     
before that time, we will make Automatic Annuity Payouts under the Life Annuity 
with Payments for a Period Certain Payout Option with a ten-year period certain 
payment option. Automatic Annuity Payouts will be fixed dollar amount Annuity   
Payouts or variable dollar amount Annuity Payouts, depending on the investment  
allocation of your Account in effect on the Annuity Commencement Date.

These ratings apply to Hartford's ability to meet its obligations under the     
Contract. The ratings do not apply to the Separate Account or the underlying    
Funds.                                                                          

THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT 

The Separate Account is where we set aside and invest the assets of some of our 
annuity contracts, including this Contract. The Separate Account was established
on June 22, 1987 and is registered as a unit investment trust under the         
Investment Company Act of 1940. This registration does not involve supervision  
by the SEC of the management or the investment practices of the Separate Account
or Hartford. The Separate Account meets the definition of "Separate Account"    
under federal securities law. This Separate Account holds only assets for       
variable annuity contracts. The Separate Account:                               

- Holds assets for your benefit and the benefit of other Contract Owners, and   
the persons entitled to the payouts described in the Contract.              

- Is not subject to the liabilities arising out of any other business Hartford  
may conduct.                                                                

- Is not affected by the rate of return of Hartford's General Account or by the 
investment performance of any of Hartford's other Separate Accounts.        

- May be subject to liabilities from a Sub-Account of the Separate Account that 
holds assets of other variable annuity contracts offered by the Separate    
Account, which are not described in this prospectus.                        

- Is credited with income and gains, and takes losses, whether or not realized, 
from the assets it holds.                                                   

We do not guarantee the investment results of the Separate Account. There is no 
assurance that the value of your Contract will equal the total of the payments  
you make to us.                                                                 

THE FUNDS 

The Sub-Accounts purchase shares of Putnam Variable Trust, an open-end series   
investment company with multiple portfolios ("Funds"). Putnam Investment        
Management, LLC. ("Putnam Management") serves as the investment manager for the 
Funds. Putnam Management is ultimately controlled by Marsh & McLennan Companies,
Inc., a publicly owned holding company whose principal businesses are           
international insurance brokerage and employee benefit consulting.              

We do not guarantee the investment results of any of the underlying Funds. Since
each underlying Fund has different investment objectives, each is subject to    
different risks. These risks and the Funds' expenses are more fully described in
the accompanying Funds' prospectus, and the Funds' Statement of Additional      
Information which may be ordered from us. The Funds' prospectus should be read  
in conjunction with this Prospectus before investing.                           

The Funds may not be available in all states.                                   

The investment goals of each of the Funds are as follows:                       

PUTNAM VT AMERICAN GOVERNMENT INCOME FUND -- Seeks high current income with     
preservation of capital as its secondary objective.                             

PUTNAM VT ASIA PACIFIC GROWTH FUND -- Seeks capital appreciation.               

PUTNAM VT CAPITAL APPRECIATION FUND -- Seeks capital appreciation.              

PUTNAM VT DIVERSIFIED INCOME FUND -- Seeks as high a level of current income as 
Putnam Management believes is consistent with preservation of capital by        
investing, under normal market conditions, 15% to 65% of the Fund's net assets  
in three sectors: U.S. government and other investment-grade, high yield        
(lower-rated bonds of U.S. corporations) and international (bonds of foreign    
governments and corporations). The Fund invests in higher-yielding, lower-rated 
securities commonly referred to as "junk bonds." See the special considerations 
for, and risks associated with, investments in these securities described in the
Fund prospectus.                                                                

PUTNAM VT THE GEORGE PUTNAM FUND OF BOSTON -- Seeks to provide a balanced       
investment composed of a well-diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds which   
produce both capital growth and current income.                                 

PUTNAM VT GLOBAL ASSET ALLOCATION FUND -- Seeks a high level of long-term total

PUTNAM VT HEALTH SCIENCES FUND -- Seeks capital appreciation.                   

PUTNAM VT HIGH YIELD FUND -- Seeks high current income. Capital growth is a     
secondary goal when consistent with achieving high current income. The Fund     
invests in higher-yielding, lower-rated securities commonly referred to as "junk
bonds." See the special considerations for, and risks associated with,          
investments in these securities described in the Fund prospectus.               

PUTNAM VT INCOME FUND -- Seeks high current income consistent with what Putnam  
Management believes to be prudent risk.

PUTNAM VT INTERNATIONAL NEW OPPORTUNITIES FUND -- Seeks long-term capital

PUTNAM VT VOYAGER FUND II -- Seeks long-term growth of capital.                 

The Funds are generally managed in styles similar to other open-end investment  
companies which are managed by Putnam Management and whose shares are generally 
offered to the public. These other Putnam funds may, however, employ different  
investment practices and may invest in securities different from those in which 
their counterpart Funds invest, and consequently will not have identical        
portfolios or experience identical investment results.                          

Subject to the general oversight of the Trustees of Putnam Variable Trust,      
Putnam Management manages the Funds' portfolios in accordance with their stated 
investment objectives and policies, makes investment decisions for the Funds,   
places orders to purchase and sell securities on behalf of the Funds, and       
administers the affairs of the Funds. For its services, the Funds pay Putnam    
Management a quarterly fee. See the accompanying Funds prospectus for a more    
complete description of Putnam Management and the respective fees of the Funds. 

MIXED AND SHARED FUNDING -- Shares of the Funds may be sold to our other        
separate accounts and our insurance company affiliates or other unaffiliated    
insurance companies to serve as the underlying investment for both variable     
annuity contracts and variable life insurance policies, a practice known as     
"mixed and shared funding." As a result, there is a possibility that a material 
conflict may arise between the interests of Contract Owners, and of owners of   
other contracts whose contract values are allocated to one or more of these     
other separate accounts investing in any one of the Funds. In the event of any  
such material conflicts, we will consider what action may be appropriate,       
including removing the Fund from the Separate Account or replacing the Fund with
another underlying fund. There are certain risks associated with mixed and      
shared funding, as disclosed in the Funds' prospectus.                          

VOTING RIGHTS -- We are the legal owners of all Fund shares held in the Separate
Account and we have the right to vote at the Fund's shareholder meetings. To the
extent required by federal securities laws or regulations, we will:             

- Notify you of any Fund shareholders' meeting if the shares held for your      
Contract may be voted.                                                      

- Send proxy materials and a form of instructions that you can use to tell us   
how to vote the Fund shares held for your Contract.                         

- Arrange for the handling and tallying of proxies received from Contract       
Owners.                                                                     

- Vote all Fund shares attributable to your Contract according to instructions  
received from you, and                                                      

- Vote all Fund shares for which no voting instructions are received in the same
proportion as shares for which instructions have been received.             

If any federal securities laws or regulations, or their present interpretation, 
change to permit us to vote Fund shares on our own, we may decide to do so. You 
may attend any Shareholder Meeting at which shares held for your Contract may be
voted. After we begin to make Annuity Payouts to you, the number of votes you   
have will decrease.                                                             

SUBSTITUTIONS, ADDITIONS, OR DELETIONS OF FUNDS -- We reserve the right, subject
to any applicable law, to make certain changes to the Funds offered under your  
contract. We may, in our sole discretion, establish new Funds. New Funds will be
made available to existing Contract Owners as we determine appropriate. We may  
also close one or more Funds to additional Payments or transfers from existing  
Sub-Accounts.                                                                   

We reserve the right to eliminate the shares of any of the Funds for any reason 
and to substitute shares of another registered investment company for the shares
of any Fund already purchased or to be purchased in the future by the Separate  
Account. To the extent required by the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940
Act"), substitutions of shares attributable to your interest in a Fund will not 
be made until we have the approval of the Commission and we have notified you of
the change.                                                                     

In the event of any substitution or change, we may, by appropriate endorsement, 
make any changes in the Contract necessary or appropriate to reflect the        
substitution or change. If we decide

that it is in the best interest of the Contract Owners, the Separate Account may
be operated as a management company under the 1940 Act or any other form        
permitted by law, may be de-registered under the 1940 Act in the event such     
registration is no longer required, or may be combined with one or more other   
Separate Accounts.                                                              

ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES -- Hartford has entered into agreements with the        
investment advisers or distributors of many of the Funds. Under the terms of    
these agreements, Hartford provides administrative services and the Funds pay a 
fee to Hartford that is usually based on an annual percentage of the average    
daily net assets of the Funds. These agreements may be different for each Fund  
or each Fund family.                                                            

PERFORMANCE RELATED INFORMATION 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Separate Account may advertise certain performance-related information      
concerning the Sub-Accounts. Performance information about a Sub-Account is     
based on the Sub-Account's past performance only and is no indication of future 
performance.                                                                    

When a Sub-Account advertises its standardized total return, it will usually be 
calculated since the date of the Sub-Account's inception for one year, five     
years, and ten years or some other relevant periods if the Sub-Account has not  
been in existence for at least ten years. Total return is measured by comparing 
the value of an investment in the Sub-Account at the beginning of the relevant  
period to the value of the investment at the end of the period.                 

The Separate Account may also advertise non-standard total returns that pre-date
the inception date of the Separate Account. These non-standardized total returns
are calculated by assuming that the Sub-Accounts have been in existence for the 
same periods as the underlying Funds and by taking deductions for charges equal 
to those currently assessed against the Sub-Accounts. These non-standardized    
returns must be accompanied by standardized total returns.                      

If applicable, the Sub-Accounts may advertise yield in addition to total return.
The yield will be computed in the following manner: The net investment income   
per unit earned during a recent one month period is divided by the unit value on
the last day of the period. This figure includes the recurring charges at the   
Separate Account level including the Annual Maintenance Fee.                    

A money market Sub-Account may advertise yield and effective yield. The yield of
a Sub-Account is based upon the income earned by the Sub-Account over a         
seven-day period and then annualized, i.e. the income earned in the period is   
assumed to be earned every seven days over a 52-week period and stated as a     
percentage of the investment. Effective yield is calculated similarly but when  
annualized, the income earned by the investment is assumed to be reinvested in  
Sub-Account units and thus compounded in the course of a 52-week period. Yield  
and effective yield include the recurring charges at the Separate Account level 
including the Annual Maintenance Fee.                                           

We may provide information on various topics to Contract Owners and prospective 
Contract Owners in advertising, sales literature or other materials. These      
topics may include the relationship between sectors of the economy and the      
economy as a whole and its effect on various securities markets, investment     
strategies and techniques (such as systematic investing, Dollar Cost Averaging  
and asset allocation), the advantages and disadvantages of investing in         
tax-deferred and taxable instruments, customer profiles and hypothetical        
purchase scenarios, financial management and tax and retirement planning, and   
other investment alternatives, including comparisons between the Contract and   
the characteristics of and market for such alternatives.                        

FIXED ACCUMULATION FEATURE                                                      
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

IMPORTANT INFORMATION YOU SHOULD KNOW: THIS PORTION OF THE PROSPECTUS RELATING  
TO THE FIXED ACCUMULATION FEATURE IS NOT REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 
1933 ("1933 ACT") AND THE FIXED ACCUMULATION FEATURE IS NOT REGISTERED AS AN    
INVESTMENT COMPANY UNDER THE 1940 ACT. THE FIXED ACCUMULATION FEATURE OR ANY OF 
ITS INTERESTS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE PROVISIONS OR RESTRICTIONS OF THE 1933 ACT 
OR THE 1940 ACT, AND THE STAFF OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION HAS NOT
REVIEWED THE DISCLOSURE REGARDING THE FIXED ACCUMULATION FEATURE. THE FOLLOWING 
DISCLOSURE ABOUT THE FIXED ACCUMULATION FEATURE MAY BE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN       
GENERALLY APPLICABLE PROVISIONS OF THE FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWS REGARDING THE    
ACCURACY AND COMPLETENESS OF DISCLOSURE.                                        

Premium Payments and Contract Values allocated to the Fixed Accumulation Feature
become a part of our General Account assets. We invest the assets of the General
Account according to the laws governing the investments of insurance company    
General Accounts.                                                               

Currently, we guarantee that we will credit interest at a rate of not less than 
3% per year, compounded annually, to amounts you allocate to the Fixed          
Accumulation Feature. We reserve the right to change the rate subject only to   
applicable state insurance law. We may credit interest at a rate in excess of 3%
per year. We will periodically publish the Fixed Accumulation Feature interest  
rates currently in effect. There is no specific formula for determining interest
rates. Some of the factors that we may consider in determining whether to credit
excess interest are; general economic trends, rates of return currently         
available and

anticipated on our investments, regulatory and tax requirements and competitive 
factors. We will account for any deductions, Surrenders or transfers from the   
Fixed Accumulation Feature on a "first-in first-out" basis. For Contracts issued
in the state of New York, the Fixed Accumulation Feature interest rates may vary
from other states.                                                              

IMPORTANT: ANY INTEREST CREDITED TO AMOUNTS YOU ALLOCATE TO THE FIXED           
ACCUMULATION FEATURE IN EXCESS OF 3% PER YEAR WILL BE DETERMINED AT OUR SOLE    
DISCRETION. YOU ASSUME THE RISK THAT INTEREST CREDITED TO THE FIXED ACCUMULATION
FEATURE MAY NOT EXCEED THE MINIMUM GUARANTEE OF 3% FOR ANY GIVEN YEAR.          

From time to time, we may credit increased interest rates under certain programs
established in our sole discretion.                                             

DOLLAR COST AVERAGING PLUS ("DCA") PROGRAMS -- As of June 15, 2001, you may     
enroll in one or more special pre-authorized transfer programs known as our DCA 
Plus Programs (the "Programs"). Under these Programs, Contract Owners who enroll
may allocate a minimum of $5,000 of their Premium Payment into a Program (we may
allow a lower minimum Premium Payment for qualified plan transfers or rollovers,
including IRAs) and pre-authorize transfers to any of the Sub-Accounts under    
either a 6-Month Transfer Program or 12-Month Transfer Program. The 6-Month     
Transfer Program and the 12-Month Transfer Program will generally have different
credited interest rates. Under the 6-month Transfer Program, the interest rate  
can accrue up to 6 months and all Premium Payments and accrued interest must be 
transferred from the Program to the selected Sub-Accounts in 3 to 6 months.     
Under the 12-Month Transfer Program, the interest rate can accrue up to 12      
months and all Premium Payments and accrued interest must be transferred to the 
selected Sub-Accounts in 7 to 12 months. This will be accomplished by monthly   
transfers for the period selected and with the final transfer of the entire     
amount remaining in the Program.                                                

Any subsequent Program payments we receive during an active Program transfer    
period which are received during the same interest rate period will be credited 
to the current Program. Any subsequent Program payments we receive during an    
active Program transfer period which are received during a different interest   
rate period will be used to start a new Program. That Program will be credited  
with the interest rate in effect on the date we start the new Program. Unless   
you send us different instructions, the new Program will be the same length of  
time as your current Program and will allocate the subsequent Program payments  
to the same Funds.                                                              

We determine, in our sole discretion, the interest rates credited to the        
Program. These interest rates may vary depending on the Contract you purchased. 
Please consult your Registered Representative to determine the interest rate for
your Program.                                                                   

Hartford reserves the right to limit the total number of DCA Programs to 5      
Programs open at any one time.                                                  

The pre-authorized transfers will begin within 15 days of receipt of the Program
payment provided we receive complete enrollment instructions. If we do not      
receive complete Program enrollment instructions within 15 days of receipt of   
the initial Program payment, the Program will be voided and the entire balance  
in the Program will be transferred to the Accounts designated by you. If you do 
not designate an Account, you will receive the Fixed Accumulation Feature's     
current effective interest rate.                                                

You may elect to terminate the pre-authorized transfers by calling or writing us
of your intent to cancel enrollment in the Program. Upon cancellation, you will 
no longer receive the Program interest rate and unless we receive instructions  
to the contrary, the amounts remaining in the Program may accrue at the interest
rate currently in effect for the Fixed Accumulation Feature.                    

We reserve the right to discontinue, modify or amend the Program or any other   
interest rate program we establish. Any change to the Program will not affect   
Contract Owners currently enrolled in the Program.                              

From May 1, 2001 to June 15, 2001, you may enroll in only one Program. Any      
subsequent payments we receive within the Program period selected will be       
allocated to the Sub-Accounts over the remainder of that current Program        
transfer period.

PURCHASES AND CONTRACT VALUE                                                    
WHAT TYPES OF CONTRACTS ARE AVAILABLE?                                          

The Contract is an individual or group tax-deferred variable annuity contract.  
It is designed for retirement planning purposes and may be purchased by any     
individual, group or trust, including:                                          

- Any trustee or custodian for a retirement plan qualified under Sections 401(a)
or 403(a) of the Code;                                                      

- Annuity purchase plans adopted by public school systems and certain tax-exempt
organizations according to Section 403(b) of the Code;                      

- Individual Retirement Annuities adopted according to Section 408 of the Code; 

- Employee pension plans established for employees by a state, a political      
subdivision of a state, or an agency of either a state or a political       
subdivision of a state; and                                                 

- Certain eligible deferred compensation plans as defined in Section 457 of the

The examples above represent Qualified Contracts, as defined by the Code. In    
addition, individuals and trusts can also purchase Contracts that are not part  
of a tax qualified retirement plan. These are known as Non-Qualified Contracts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are purchasing the Contract for use in an IRA or other qualified         
retirement plan, you should consider other features of the Contract besides tax 
deferral, since any investment vehicle used within an IRA or other qualified    
plan receives tax deferred treatment under the Code.                            

If you are considering purchasing optional benefits such as the Earnings        
Protection Benefit and your Contract is an IRA, you should read "Appendix I --
Information Regarding Tax-Qualified Retirement Plans," under the section "4.    
Individual Retirement Annuities ("IRAs") Under Section 408" under the           
sub-section "Information About Death Benefits and IRAs."
HOW DO I PURCHASE A CONTRACT?                                                   

You may purchase a Contract by completing and submitting an application or an   
order request along with an initial Premium Payment. For most Contracts, the    
minimum Premium Payment is $1,000. For additional Premium Payments, the minimum 
Premium Payment is $500. Under certain situations, we may allow smaller Premium 
Payments, for example, if you enroll in our InvestEase-Registered Trademark-    
Program or are part of certain tax qualified retirement plans. Prior approval is
required for Premium Payments of $1,000,000 or more.                            

You and your Annuitant must not be older than age 85 on the date that your      
Contract is issued. You must be of legal age in the state where the Contract is 
being purchased or a guardian must act on your behalf.                          

For Contracts issued in Oregon, premium payments will only be accepted prior to 
the third Contract Anniversary. For Contracts issued in Massachusetts,          
subsequent premium payments will only be accepted until the Annuitant's 63rd    
birthday or the third Contract Anniversary, whichever is later.                 

HOW ARE PREMIUM PAYMENTS APPLIED TO MY CONTRACT?                                

Your initial Premium Payment will be invested within two Valuation Days of our  
receipt of a properly completed application or an order request and the Premium 
Payment. If we receive your subsequent Premium Payment before the close of the  
New York Stock Exchange, it will be invested on the same Valuation Day. If we   
receive your Premium Payment after the close of the New York Stock Exchange, it 
will be invested on the next Valuation Day. If we receive your subsequent       
Premium Payment on a Non-Valuation Day, the amount will be invested on the next 
Valuation Day. Unless we receive new instructions, we will invest the Premium   
Payment based on your last allocation instructions. We will send you a          
confirmation when we invest your Premium Payment.                               

If the request or other information accompanying the Premium Payment is         
incomplete when received, we will hold the money in a non-interest bearing      
account for up to five Valuation Days while we try to obtain complete           
information. If we cannot obtain the information within five Valuation Days, we 
will either return the Premium Payment and explain why the Premium Payment could
not be processed or keep the Premium Payment if you authorize us to keep it     
until you provide the necessary information.                                    

CAN I CANCEL MY CONTRACT AFTER I PURCHASE IT?                                   

We want you to be satisfied with the Contract you have purchased. We urge you to
closely examine its provisions. If for any reason you are not satisfied with    
your Contract, simply return it within ten days after you receive it with a     
written request for cancellation that indicates your tax-withholding            
instructions. In some states, you may be allowed more time to cancel your       
Contract. We will not deduct any Contingent Deferred Sales Charges during this  
time. We may require additional information, including a signature guarantee,   
before we can cancel your Contract.                                             

You bear the investment risk from the time the Contract is issued until we      
receive your complete cancellation request.                                     

The amount we pay you upon cancellation depends on the requirements of the state
where you purchased your Contract, the method of purchase, the type of Contract 
you purchased and your age.                                                     

HOW IS THE VALUE OF MY CONTRACT CALCULATED BEFORE THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE?

The Contract Value is the sum of all Accounts. There are two things that affect 
your Sub-Account value: (1) the number of Accumulation Units and (2) the        
Accumulation Unit Value. The Sub-Account value is determined by multiplying the 
number of Accumulation Units by the Accumulation Unit Value. Therefore, on any  
Valuation Day your Contract Value reflects the investment performance of the    
Sub-Accounts and will fluctuate with the performance of the underlying Funds.   

When Premium Payments are credited to your Sub-Accounts, they are converted into
Accumulation Units by dividing the amount of your Premium Payments, minus any   
Premium Taxes, by the Accumulation Unit Value for that day. The more Premium    
Payments you put into your Contract, the more Accumulation Units you will own.  
You decrease the number of Accumulation Units you have by requesting Surrenders,
transferring money out of an Account, settling a Death Benefit claim or by      
annuitizing your Contract.                                                      

To determine the current Accumulation Unit Value, we take the prior Valuation   
Day's Accumulation Unit Value and multiply it by the Net Investment Factor for  
the current Valuation Day.                                                      

The Net Investment Factor is used to measure the investment performance of a    
Sub-Account from one Valuation Day to the next. The Net Investment Factor for   
each Sub-Account equals:                                                        

- The net asset value per share of each Fund held in the Sub-Account at the end 
of the current Valuation Day divided by                                     

- The net asset value per share of each Fund held in the Sub-Account at the end 
of the prior Valuation Day; minus                                           

- The daily mortality and expense risk charge and any other applicable charges  
adjusted for the number of days in the period.

We will send you a statement in each calendar quarter, which tells you how many 
Accumulation Units you have, their value and your total Contract Value.         

CAN I TRANSFER FROM ONE SUB-ACCOUNT TO ANOTHER?                                 

TRANSFERS BETWEEN SUB-ACCOUNTS -- You may transfer from one Sub-Account to      
another before and after the Annuity Commencement Date at no extra charge. Your 
transfer request will be processed on the day that it is received as long as it 
is received on a Valuation Day before the close of the New York Stock Exchange. 
Otherwise, your request will be processed on the following Valuation Day. We    
will send you a confirmation when we process your transfer. You are responsible 
for verifying transfer confirmations and promptly advising us of any errors     
within 30 days of receiving the confirmation.                                   

SUB-ACCOUNT TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS -- We reserve the right to limit the number of
transfers to 12 per Contract Year, with no transfers occurring on consecutive   
Valuation Days. We also have the right to restrict transfers if we believe that 
the transfers could have an adverse effect on other Contract Owners. In all     
states except New York, Florida, Maryland, or Oregon we may:                    

- Require a minimum time period between each transfer,                          

- Limit the dollar amount that may be transferred on any one Valuation Day, and 

- Not accept transfer requests from an agent acting under a power of attorney   
for more than one Contract Owner.                                           

We also have a restriction in place that involves individuals who act under a   
power of attorney for multiple Contract Owners. If the value of the Contract    
Owners' Accounts add up to more than $2 million, we will not accept transfer    
instructions from the power of attorney unless the power of attorney has entered
into a Third Party Transfer Services Agreement with us.                         

Some states may have different restrictions.                                    

FIXED ACCUMULATION FEATURE TRANSFERS -- During each Contract Year, you may make 
transfers out of the Fixed Accumulation Feature to Sub-Accounts. All transfer   
allocations must be in whole numbers (e.g., 1%). You may transfer either:       

- 30% of your total amount in the Fixed Accumulation Feature, or                

- An amount equal to the largest previous transfer.                             

These transfer limits do not include transfers done through Dollar Cost         
Averaging or the DCA Plus Program.                                              

If your interest rate renews at a rate at least 1% lower than your prior        
interest rate, you may transfer an amount equal to up to 100% of the amount to  
be invested at the renewal rate. You must make this transfer request within 60  
days of being notified of the renewal rate.                                     

FIXED ACCUMULATION FEATURE TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS -- We reserve the right to     
defer transfers from the Fixed Accumulation Feature for up to 6 months from the 
date of your request. After any transfer, you must wait 6 months before moving  
Sub-Account Values back to the Fixed Accumulation Feature.                      

TELEPHONE AND INTERNET TRANSFERS -- In most states, you can make transfers:     

- By calling us at 1-800-521-0538                                               

- Electronically, if available, by the Internet through our website at          
www.putnaminv.com                                                           

Transfer instructions received by telephone on any Valuation Day before the     
close of the New York Stock Exchange will be carried out that day. Otherwise,   
the instructions will be carried out at the close of the New York Stock Exchange
on the next Valuation Day.                                                      

Transfer instructions you send electronically are considered to be received by  
Hartford at the time and date stated on the electronic acknowledgement Hartford 
returns to you. If the time and date indicated on the acknowledgement is before 
the close of the New York Stock Exchange on a Valuation Day, the instructions   
will be carried out that day. Otherwise, the instructions will be carried out at
the close of the New York Stock Exchange the next Valuation Day. If you do not  
receive an electronic acknowledgement, you should telephone us as soon as       
possible.                                                                       

We will send you a confirmation when we process your transfer. You are          
responsible for verifying transfer confirmations and promptly advising us of any
errors within 30 days of receiving the confirmation.                            

Telephone or Internet transfer requests may currently only be cancelled by      
calling us before the close of the New York Stock Exchange.                     

Hartford, our agents or our affiliates are not responsible for losses resulting 
from telephone or electronic requests that we believe are genuine. We will use  
reasonable procedures to confirm that instructions received by telephone or     
through our website are genuine, including a requirement that contract owners   
provide certain identification information, including a personal identification 
number. We record all telephone transfer instructions. We reserve the right to  
suspend, modify, or terminate telephone or electronic transfer privileges at any
time.                                                                           

POWER OF ATTORNEY -- You may authorize another person to make transfers on your 
behalf by submitting a completed power of attorney form. Once we have the       
completed form on file, we will accept transfer instructions, subject to our    
transfer restrictions, from your designated third party until we receive new    
instructions in writing from you. You will not be able to make transfers or     
other changes to your Contract if you have authorized someone else to act under 
a power of attorney.                                                            

CHARGES AND FEES                                                                

The following charges and fees are associated with the Contract:                

THE CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGE                                            

The Contingent Deferred Sales Charge covers some of the expenses relating to the
sale and distribution of the Contract, including commissions paid to registered 
representatives and the

cost of preparing sales literature and other promotional activities.            

We may assess a Contingent Deferred Sales Charge when you request a full or     
partial Surrender. The Contingent Deferred Sales Charge is based on the amount  
you choose to Surrender and how long your Premium Payments have been in the     
Contract. Each Premium Payment has its own Contingent Deferred Sales Charge     
schedule. Premium Payments are Surrendered in the order in which they were      
received. The longer you leave your Premium Payments in the Contract, the lower 
the Contingent Deferred Sales Charge will be when you Surrender. The amount     
assessed a Contingent Deferred Sales Charge will not exceed your total Premium  
Payments.                                                                       

The percentage used to calculate the Contingent Deferred Sales Charge is equal  
to:

For example, you made an initial Premium Payment of $10,000 five years ago and  
an additional Premium Payment of $20,000 one year ago. If you request a partial 
withdrawal of $15,000 and you have not taken your Annual Withdrawal Amount for  
the year, we will deduct a Contingent Deferred Sales Charge as follows:         

- Hartford will Surrender the Annual Withdrawal Amount which is equal to 15% of 
your total Premium Payments or $4,500 without charging a Contingent Deferred
Sales Charge.                                                               

- We will then Surrender the Premium Payments that have been in the Contract the
longest.                                                                    

- That means we would Surrender the entire $10,000 initial Premium Payment and  
deduct a Contingent Deferred Sales Charge of 4% on that amount, or $400.    

- The remaining $500 will come from the additional Premium Payment made one year
ago and we will deduct a Contingent Deferred Sales Charge of 7% of the $500,
or $35.                                                                     

- Your Contingent Deferred Sales Charge is $435.                                

If you have any questions about these charges, please contact your financial    
adviser or Hartford.                                                            

THE FOLLOWING SURRENDERS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO A CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGE: 

- ANNUAL WITHDRAWAL AMOUNT -- During the first seven years from each Premium    
  Payment, you may, each Contract Year, take partial Surrenders up to 15% of the
  total Premium Payments. If you do not take 15% one year, you may not take more
than 15% the next year. These amounts are different for group unallocated   
Contracts and Contracts issued to a Charitable Remainder Trust.             

UNDER THE FOLLOWING SITUATIONS, THE CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGE IS WAIVED: 

- Upon eligible confinement as described in the Waiver of Sales Charge Rider. We
will waive any Contingent Deferred Sales Charge applicable to a partial or  
full Surrender if you, the joint owner or the Annuitant, is confined for at 
  least 180 calendar days to a: (a) facility recognized as a general hospital by
the proper authority of the state in which it is located; or (b) facility   
 recognized as a general hospital by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation
of Hospitals; or (c) facility certified as a hospital or long-term care     
  facility; or (d) nursing home licensed by the state in which it is located and
offers the services of a registered nurse 24 hours a day. If you, the joint 
  owner or the Annuitant is confined when you purchase the Contract, this waiver
is not available. For it to apply, you must: (a) have owned the Contract    
continuously since it was issued, (b) provide written proof of confinement  
satisfactory to us, and (c) request the Surrender within 91 calendar days of
the last day of confinement. This waiver may not be available in all states.
Please contact your Registered Representative or us to determine if it is   
available for you.                                                          

- For Required Minimum Distributions. This allows Annuitants who are age 70 1/2 
or older, with a Contract held under an Individual Retirement Account or    
  403(b) plan, to Surrender an amount equal to the Required Minimum Distribution
 for the Contract without a Contingent Deferred Sales Charge. All requests for
Required Minimum Distributions must be in writing.                          

THE FOLLOWING SITUATIONS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO A CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGE: 

- Upon death of the Annuitant or Contract Owner. No Contingent Deferred Sales   
Charge will be deducted if the Annuitant or Contract Owner dies, unless the 
Contract Owner is not a natural person (e.g. a trust).                      

- Upon Annuitization. The Contingent Deferred Sales Charge is not deducted when 
 you annuitize the Contract. We will charge a Contingent Deferred Sales Charge
if the Contract is Surrendered during the Contingent Deferred Sales Charge  
period under an Annuity Payout Option which allows Surrenders.              

- Upon cancellation during the Right to Cancel Period.                          

SURRENDER ORDER -- During the first seven Contract Years all Surrenders in      
excess of the Annual Withdrawal Amount will be taken first from Premium         
Payments, then from earnings. Surrenders from Premium Payments in excess of the 
Annual Withdrawal Amount will be subject to a Contingent Deferred Sales Charge.

                                                 HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the Seventh Contract Year, all Surrenders in excess of the Annual         
Withdrawal Amount will be taken first from earnings, then from Premium Payments 
held in your Contract for more than seven years and then from Premium Payments  
invested for less than seven years. Only Premium Payments invested for less than
seven years are subject to a Contingent Deferred Sales Charge.                  

MORTALITY AND EXPENSE RISK CHARGE                                               

For assuming mortality and expense risks under the Contract, we deduct a daily  
charge at an annual rate of 1.25% of Sub-Account Value. The mortality and       
expense risk charge is broken into charges for mortality risks and for an       
expense risk:                                                                   

- MORTALITY RISK -- There are two types of mortality risks that we assume, those
 made while your Premium Payments are accumulating and those made once Annuity
Payouts have begun.                                                         

During the period your Premium Payments are accumulating, we are required to    
cover any difference between the Death Benefit paid and the Surrender Value.    
These differences may occur during periods of declining value or in periods     
where the Contingent Deferred Sales Charges would have been applicable. The risk
that we bear during this period is that actual mortality rates, in aggregate,   
may exceed expected mortality rates.                                            

Once Annuity Payouts have begun, we may be required to make Annuity Payouts as  
long as the Annuitant is living, regardless of how long the Annuitant lives. The
risk that we bear during this period is that the actual mortality rates, in     
aggregate, may be lower than the expected mortality rates.                      

- EXPENSE RISK -- We also bear an expense risk that the Contingent Deferred     
Sales Charges and the Annual Maintenance Fee collected before the Annuity   
Commencement Date may not be enough to cover the actual cost of selling,    
distributing and administering the Contract.                                

Although variable Annuity Payouts will fluctuate with the performance of the    
underlying Fund selected, your Annuity Payouts will not be affected by (a) the  
actual mortality experience of our Annuitants, or (b) our actual expenses if    
they are greater than the deductions stated in the Contract. Because we cannot  
be certain how long our Annuitants will live, we charge this percentage fee     
based on the mortality tables currently in use. The mortality and expense risk  
charge enables us to keep our commitments and to pay you as planned.            

ADMINISTRATIVE CHARGE                                                           

For administration, we apply a daily charge at the rate of .15% per year against
all Contract Values held in the Separate Account during both the accumulation   
and annuity phases of the Contract. There is not necessarily a relationship     
between the amount of administrative charge imposed on a given Contract and the 
amount of expenses that may be attributable to that Contract; expenses may be   
more or less than the charge.                                                   

You should refer to the Fund's prospectus for a description of deductions and   
expenses paid out of the assets of the Funds.                                   

ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FEE                                                          

The Annual Maintenance Fee is a flat fee that is deducted from your Contract    
Value to reimburse us for expenses relating to the administrative maintenance of
the Contract and the Accounts. The annual $30 charge is deducted on a Contract  
Anniversary or when the Contract is fully Surrendered if the Contract Value at  
either of those times is less than $50,000. The charge is deducted              
proportionately from each Account in which you are invested.                    

WHEN IS THE ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FEE WAIVED?                                      

We will waive the Annual Maintenance Fee if your Contract Value is $50,000 or   
more on your Contract Anniversary or when you fully Surrender your Contract. In 
addition, we will waive one Annual Maintenance Fee for Contract Owners who own  
more than one Contract with a combined Contract Value between $50,000 and       
$100,000. If you have multiple Contracts with a combined Contract Value of      
$100,000 or greater, we will waive the Annual Maintenance Fee on all Contracts. 
However, we reserve the right to limit the number of waivers to a total of six  
Contracts. We also reserve the right to waive the Annual Maintenance Fee under  
certain other conditions.                                                       

PREMIUM TAXES                                                                   

We deduct Premium Taxes, if required, by a state or other government agency.    
Some states collect the taxes when Premium Payments are made; others collect at 
Annuitization. Since we pay Premium Taxes when they are required by applicable  
law, we may deduct them from your Contract when we pay the taxes, upon          
Surrender, or on the Annuity Commencement Date. The Premium Tax rate varies by  
state or municipality. Currently, the maximum rate charged by any state is 3.5% 
and 4% in Puerto Rico.                                                          

CHARGES AGAINST THE FUNDS                                                       

The Separate Account purchases shares of the Funds at net asset value. The net  
asset value of the Fund reflects investment advisory fees and administrative    
expenses already deducted from the assets of the Funds. These charges are       
described in the Funds' prospectuses accompanying this prospectus.              

OPTIONAL DEATH BENEFIT CHARGE                                                   

If you elect the Optional Death Benefit, we will subtract an additional charge  
on a daily basis until we begin to make Annuity Payouts that is equal to an     
annual charge of 0.15% of your Contract Value invested in the Funds.            

EARNINGS PROTECTION BENEFIT CHARGE                                              

If you elect the Earnings Protection Benefit, we will subtract an additional    
charge on a daily basis until we begin to make Annuity Payouts that is equal to 
an annual charge of 0.20% of your Contract Value invested in the Funds.         

WE MAY OFFER, IN OUR DISCRETION, REDUCED FEES AND CHARGES INCLUDING, BUT NOT    
LIMITED TO CONTINGENT DEFERRED SALES CHARGES, THE MORTALITY AND EXPENSE RISK    
CHARGE, AND THE ANNUAL MAINTENANCE FEE, FOR CERTAIN CONTRACTS (INCLUDING        
EMPLOYER SPONSORED SAVINGS PLANS) WHICH MAY RESULT IN

DECREASED COSTS AND EXPENSES. REDUCTIONS IN THESE FEES AND CHARGES WILL NOT BE  
UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATORY AGAINST ANY CONTRACT OWNER.                             

DEATH BENEFIT 
WHAT IS THE DEATH BENEFIT AND HOW IS IT CALCULATED?                             

The Death Benefit is the amount we will pay upon the death of the Contract Owner
or the Annuitant. The Death Benefit is calculated when we receive a certified   
death certificate or other legal document acceptable to us.                     

The calculated Death Benefit will remain invested in the same Accounts,         
according to the Contract Owner's last instructions until we receive complete   
written settlement instructions from the Beneficiary. Therefore, the Death      
Benefit amount will fluctuate with the performance of the underlying Funds. When
there is more than one Beneficiary, we will calculate the Accumulation Units for
each Sub-Account and the dollar amount for the Fixed Accumulation Feature for   
each Beneficiary's portion of the proceeds.                                     

If death occurs before the Annuity Commencement Date, the Death Benefit is the  
greatest of:                                                                    

- The total Premium Payments you have made to us minus the dollar amount of any 
partial Surrenders; or                                                      

- The Contract Value of your Contract; or                                       

- The Maximum Anniversary Value, which is described below.                      

The Maximum Anniversary Value is based on a series of calculations on Contract  
Anniversaries of Contract Values, Premium Payments and partial Surrenders. We   
will calculate an Anniversary Value for each Contract Anniversary prior to the  
deceased's 81st birthday or date of death, whichever is earlier. The Anniversary
Value is equal to the Contract Value as of a Contract Anniversary, increased by 
the dollar amount of any Premium Payments made since that anniversary and       
reduced by the dollar amount of any partial Surrenders since that anniversary.  
The Maximum Anniversary Value is equal to the greatest Anniversary Value        
attained from this series of calculations.                                      

You may also elect the Optional Death Benefit for an additional charge. The     
Optional Death Benefit adds the Interest Accumulation Value to the Death Benefit
calculation.                                                                    

The Interest Accumulation Value will be:                                        

- Your Contract Value on the date we add the Optional Death Benefit to your     
Contract;                                                                   

- Plus any Premium Payments made after the Optional Death Benefit is added;     

- Minus any partial Surrenders after the Optional Death Benefit is added;       

- Compounded daily at an annual interest rate of 5%.                            

If you have taken any partial Surrenders, the Interest Accumulation Value will  
be adjusted to reduce the Optional Death Benefit proportionally for any partial 
Surrenders.                                                                     

On or after the deceased's 81st birthday or date of death, the Interest         
Accumulation Value will not continue to compound, but will be adjusted to add   
any Premium Payments or subtract any partial Surrenders.                        

The Optional Death Benefit is limited to a maximum of 200% of any Premium       
Payments made less proportional adjustments for any partial Surrenders. For     
examples on how the Optional Death Benefit is calculated see "Appendix II".     

The Optional Death Benefit may not be available if the Contract Owner or        
Annuitant is age 76 or older. The Optional Death Benefit is not available in    
Washington or New York. Once you elect the Optional Death Benefit, you cannot   
cancel it.                                                                      

You may also elect the Earnings Protection Benefit at an additional charge. The 
Earnings Protection Benefit may not currently be available in your state and is 
not available in Washington or New York. You cannot elect the Earnings          
Protection Benefit if you or your Annuitant is age 76 or older. Once you elect  
the Earnings Protection Benefit, you cannot cancel it. If you elect the Earnings
Protection Benefit in Pennsylvania, you may cancel it within 10 days after you  
receive it.                                                                     

If you and your Annuitant are age 69 or under on the date the Earnings          
Protection Benefit is added to your Contract, the Earnings Protection Benefit is
the greatest of:                                                                

- The total Premium Payments you have made to us minus the dollar amount of any 
partial Surrenders; or                                                      

- The Maximum Anniversary Value; or                                             

- Your Contract Value on the date we receive a death certificate or other legal 
document acceptable to us, plus 40% of the Contract gain since the date the 
Earnings Protection Benefit was added to your Contract.                     

We determine any Contract gain by comparing your Contract Value on the date you 
added the Earnings Protection Benefit to your Contract to your Contract Value on
the date we calculate the Death Benefit. We deduct any Premium Payments and add 
adjustments for any partial Surrenders made during that time.                   

We make an adjustment for partial Surrenders if the amount of a Surrender is    
greater than the Contract gain in the Contract immediately prior to the         
Surrender.                                                                      

Your Contract gain is limited to or "capped" at a maximum of 200% of Contract   
Value on the date the Earnings Protection Benefit was added to your Contract    
plus Premium Payments not previously withdrawn made after the Earnings          
Protection Benefit was added to your Contract, excluding any Premium Payments   
made in the 12 months before the date of death. We subtract any adjustments for 
partial Surrenders.                                                             

Hartford takes 40% of either the Contract gain or the capped amount and adds it 
back to your Contract Value to complete the Death Benefit calculation. If you or
your Annuitant are age 70 through 75, we add 25% of the Contract gain or capped 
amount back to Contract Value to complete the Death Benefit calculation. The    
percentage used for the Death Benefit calculation is

determined by the oldest age of you and your Annuitant at the time the Earnings 
Protection Benefit is added to your Contract.                                   

FOR EXAMPLE: Assuming that:                                                     

The Contract Value on the date we received proof of death plus 40% of the       
Contract gain was the greatest of the three death benefit calculations,         

- You elected the Earnings Protection Benefit when you purchased your Contract, 

- You made a single Premium Payment of $100,000,                                

- You took no partial Surrenders,                                               

- The Contract Value on the date we receive proof of death was $400,000.        

Hartford would calculate the Contract gain as follows:                          

- Contract Value on the date we receive proof of death equals $400,000,         

- Minus the Contract Value on the date the Earnings Protection Benefit was added
to your Contract or $100,000 = $300,000.                                    

To determine if the cap applies:                                                

- Hartford calculates the Contract Value on the date the Earnings Protection    
Benefit was added to your Contract ($100,000),                              

- Plus Premium Payments made since that date ($0),                              

- Minus Premium Payments made in the 12 months prior to death ($0),             

Which equals $100,000. The cap is 200% of $100,000, which is $200,000.          

In this situation the cap applies, so Hartford takes 40% of $200,000 or $80,000 
and adds that to the Contract Value on the date we receive proof of death and   
the total Death Benefit with the Earnings Protection Benefit is $480,000.       

Before you purchase the Earnings Protection Benefit, you should also consider   
the following:                                                                  

- If your Contract has no gain when Hartford calculates the Death Benefit,      
Hartford will not pay an Earnings Protection Benefit.                       

- Partial Surrenders can reduce or eliminate your Contract gain. So if you plan 
to make partial Surrenders, there may be no Earnings Protection Benefit.    

- If you transfer ownership of your Contract to someone other than your spouse  
  who would have been ineligible for the Earnings Protection Benefit when it was
added to your Contract, the Earnings Protection Benefit charge will continue
to be deducted even though no Earnings Protection Benefit will be payable.  

For more information on how these optional benefits may affect your taxes,      
please see the section entitled, "Federal Tax Considerations," under sub-section
entitled "Taxation of Annuities -- General Provisions Affecting Purchasers Other
Than Qualified Retirement Plans."
HOW IS THE DEATH BENEFIT PAID?                                                  

The Death Benefit may be taken in one lump sum or under any of the Annuity      
Payout Options then being offered by us. On the date we receive complete        
instructions from the Beneficiary, we will compute the Death Benefit amount to  
be paid out or applied to a selected Annuity Payout Option. When there is more  
than one Beneficiary, we will calculate the Death Benefit amount for each       
Beneficiary's portion of the proceeds and then pay it out or apply it to a      
selected Annuity Payout Option according to each Beneficiary's instructions. If 
we receive the complete instructions on a Non-Valuation Day, computations will  
take place on the next Valuation Day.                                           

The Beneficiary may elect under the Annuity Proceeds Settlement Option "Death   
Benefit Remaining with the Company" to leave proceeds from the Death Benefit    
with us for up to five years from the date of death if death occurred before the
Annuity Commencement Date. Once we receive a certified death certificate or     
other legal documents acceptable to us, the Beneficiary can: (a) make           
Sub-Account transfers and (b) take Surrenders without paying Contingent Deferred
Sales Charges.                                                                  

REQUIRED DISTRIBUTIONS -- If the Contract Owner dies before the Annuity         
Commencement Date, the Death Benefit must be distributed within five years after
death. The Beneficiary can choose any Annuity Payout Option that results in     
complete Annuity Payout within five years.                                      

If the Contract Owner dies on or after the Annuity Commencement Date under an   
Annuity Payout Option with a Death Benefit, any remaining value must be         
distributed at least as rapidly as under the payment method being used as of the
Contract Owner's death.                                                         

If the Contract Owner is not an individual (e.g. a trust), then the original    
Annuitant will be treated as the Contract Owner in the situations described     
above and any change in the original Annuitant will be treated as the death of  
the Contract Owner.                                                             

WHAT SHOULD THE BENEFICIARY CONSIDER?                                           

ALTERNATIVES TO THE REQUIRED DISTRIBUTIONS -- The selection of an Annuity Payout
Option and the timing of the selection will have an impact on the tax treatment 
of the Death Benefit. To receive favorable tax treatment, the Annuity Payout    
Option selected: (a) cannot extend beyond the Beneficiary's life or life        
expectancy, and (b) must begin within one year of the date of death.            

If these conditions are not met, the Death Benefit will be treated as a lump sum
payment for tax purposes. This sum will be taxable in the year in which it is   
considered received.                                                            

SPOUSAL CONTRACT CONTINUATION -- If a Beneficiary is the Contract Owner's       
spouse, that portion of the Contract for which the

HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY                                                 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
spouse is considered the Beneficiary will continue with the spouse as Contract  
Owner, unless the spouse elects to receive the Death Benefit as a lump sum      
payment or as an annuity payment option. If the Contract continues with the     
spouse as Contract Owner, we will adjust the Contract Value to the amount that  
we would have paid as the Death Benefit payment, had the spouse elected to      
receive the Death Benefit as a lump sum payment. Spousal Contract continuation  
will only apply one time for each Contract.                                     

If your spouse continues any portion of the Contract as Contract Owner and      
elects the Earnings Protection Benefit, Hartford will use the date the Contract 
is continued with your spouse as Contract Owner as the date the Earnings        
Protection Benefit was added to the Contract. The percentage used for the       
Earnings Protection Benefit will be determined by the oldest age of any         
remaining joint owner or Annuitant at the time the Contract is continued.       

WHO WILL RECEIVE THE DEATH BENEFIT?                                             
The distribution of the Death Benefit is based on whether death is before, on or
after the Annuity Commencement Date.

THESE ARE THE MOST COMMON DEATH BENEFIT SCENARIOS, HOWEVER, THERE ARE OTHERS.   
SOME OF THE ANNUITY PAYOUT OPTIONS MAY NOT RESULT IN A DEATH BENEFIT PAYOUT. IF 
YOU HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THESE AND ANY OTHER SCENARIOS, PLEASE CONTACT YOUR     
REGISTERED REPRESENTATIVE OR US.                                                
SURRENDERS                                                                      
WHAT KINDS OF SURRENDERS ARE AVAILABLE?                                         

FULL SURRENDERS BEFORE THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE -- When you Surrender your 
Contract before the Annuity Commencement Date, the Surrender Value of the       
Contract will be made in a lump sum payment. The Surrender Value is the Contract
Value minus any applicable Premium Taxes, Contingent Deferred Sales Charges and 
the Annual Maintenance Fee. The Surrender Value may be more or less than the    
amount of the Premium Payments made to a Contract.                              

PARTIAL SURRENDERS BEFORE THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE -- You may request a    
partial Surrender of Contract Values at any time before the Annuity Commencement
Date. There are two restrictions:                                               

- The partial Surrender amount must be at least equal to $100, our current      
minimum for partial Surrenders, and                                         

- The Contract must have a minimum Contract Value of $500 after the Surrender.  
The minimum Contract Value in New York must be $1000 after the Surrender. We
reserve the right to close your Contract and pay the full Surrender Value if
the Contract Value is under the minimum after the Surrender. If

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
your Contract was issued in Texas, a remaining value of $500 is not required
to continue the Contract if Premium Payments were made in the last two      
Contract Years.                                                             

FULL SURRENDERS AFTER THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE -- You may Surrender your   
Contract on or after the Annuity Commencement Date only if you selected variable
dollar amount Annuity Payouts under the Payments For a Period Certain Annuity   
Payout Option. Under this option, we pay you the Commuted Value of your Contract
minus any applicable Contingent Deferred Sales Charges. The Commuted Value is   
determined on the day we receive your written request for Surrender.            

PARTIAL SURRENDERS AFTER THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE -- Partial Surrenders are
permitted after the Annuity Commencement Date if you select the Life Annuity    
With Payments for a Period Certain, Joint and Last Survivor Life Annuity With   
Payments for a Period Certain or the Payment for a Period Certain Annuity Payout
Options. You may take partial Surrenders of amounts equal to the Commuted Value 
of the payments that we would have made during the "Period Certain" or the      
number of years you select under the Annuity Payout Option that we guarantee to 
make Annuity Payouts.                                                           

To qualify for partial Surrenders under these Annuity Payout Options you must   
elect a variable dollar amount Annuity Payout and you must make the Surrender   
request during the Period Certain.                                              

Hartford will deduct any applicable Contingent Deferred Sales Charges.          

If you elect to take the entire Commuted Value of the Annuity Payouts we would  
have made during the Period Certain, Hartford will not make any Annuity Payouts 
during the remaining Period Certain. If you elect to take only some of the      
Commuted Value of the Annuity Payouts we would have made during the Period      
Certain, Hartford will reduce the remaining Annuity Payouts during the remaining
Period Certain. Annuity Payouts that are to be made after the Period Certain is 
over will not change                                                            

Please check with your qualified tax adviser because there could be adverse tax 
consequences for partial Surrenders after the Annuity Commencement Date.        

HOW DO I REQUEST A SURRENDER?                                                   

Requests for full Surrenders must be in writing. Requests for partial Surrenders
can be made in writing or by telephone. We will send your money within seven    
days of receiving complete instructions. However, we may postpone payment of    
Surrenders whenever: (a) the New York Stock Exchange is closed, (b) trading on  
the New York Stock Exchange is restricted by the SEC, (c) the SEC permits and   
orders postponement or (d) the SEC determines that an emergency exists to       
restrict valuation.                                                             

WRITTEN REQUESTS -- To request a full or partial Surrender, complete a Surrender
Form or send us a letter, signed by you, stating:                               

- the dollar amount that you want to receive, either before or after we withhold
taxes and deduct for any applicable charges,                                

- your tax withholding amount or percentage, if any, and                        

- your mailing address.                                                         

If there are joint Contract Owners, both must authorize all Surrenders. For a   
partial Surrender, specify the Accounts that you want your Surrender to come    
from, otherwise, the Surrender will be taken in proportion to the value in each 
Account.                                                                        

TELEPHONE REQUESTS -- To request a partial Surrender by telephone, we must have 
received your completed Telephone Redemption Program Enrollment Form. If there  
are joint Contract Owners, both must sign this form. By signing the form, you   
authorize us to accept telephone instructions for partial Surrenders from either
Contract Owner. Telephone authorization will remain in effect until we receive a
written cancellation notice from you or your joint Contract Owner, we           
discontinue the program, or you are no longer the owner of the Contract. There  
are some restrictions on telephone surrenders, please call us with any          
questions.                                                                      

We may record telephone calls and use other procedures to verify information and
confirm that instructions are genuine. We will not be liable for losses or      
expenses arising from telephone instructions reasonably believed to be genuine. 
WE MAY MODIFY THE REQUIREMENTS FOR TELEPHONE REDEMPTIONS AT ANY TIME.           

Telephone Surrender instructions received before the close of the New York Stock
Exchange will be processed on that Valuation Day. Otherwise, your request will  
be processed on the next Valuation Day.                                         

COMPLETING A POWER OF ATTORNEY FORM FOR ANOTHER PERSON TO ACT ON YOUR BEHALF MAY
PREVENT YOU FROM MAKING SURRENDERS VIA TELEPHONE.                               
WHAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ABOUT TAXES?                                          

There are certain tax consequences associated with Surrenders:                  

PRIOR TO AGE 59 1/2 -- If you make a Surrender prior to age 59 1/2, there may be
adverse tax consequences including a 10% federal income tax penalty on the      
taxable portion of the Surrender payment. Surrendering before age 59 1/2 may    
also affect the continuing tax-qualified status of some Contracts.              

WE DO NOT MONITOR SURRENDER REQUESTS. TO DETERMINE WHETHER A SURRENDER IS       
PERMISSIBLE, WITH OR WITHOUT FEDERAL INCOME TAX PENALTY, PLEASE CONSULT YOUR    
PERSONAL TAX ADVISER.                                                           

MORE THAN ONE CONTRACT ISSUED IN THE SAME CALENDAR YEAR -- If you own more than 
one contract issued by us or our affiliates in the same calendar year, then     
these contracts may be treated as one contract for the purpose of determining   
the taxation of distributions prior to the Annuity Commencement Date. Please    
consult your tax adviser for additional information.                            

INTERNAL REVENUE CODE SECTION 403(b) ANNUITIES -- As of December 31, 1988, all

THIS SECTION DESCRIBES WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE BEGIN TO MAKE REGULAR ANNUITY       
PAYOUTS FROM YOUR CONTRACT. YOU, AS THE CONTRACT OWNER, SHOULD ANSWER FIVE      
QUESTIONS:                                                                      

- When do you want Annuity Payouts to begin?                                    

- Which Annuity Payout Option do you want to use?                               

- How often do you want the Payee to receive Annuity Payouts?                   

- What is the Assumed Investment Return?                                        

- Do you want Annuity Payouts to be fixed dollar amount or variable dollar      
amount?                                                                     

Please check with your financial adviser to select the Annuity Payout Option    
that best meets your income needs.                                              

1. WHEN DO YOU WANT ANNUITY PAYOUTS TO BEGIN?                                   

You select an Annuity Commencement Date when you purchase your Contract or at   
any time before you begin receiving Annuity Payouts. You may change the Annuity 
Commencement Date by notifying us within thirty days prior to the date. The     
Annuity Commencement Date cannot be deferred beyond the Annuitant's 90th        
birthday or the end of the 10th Contract Year, whichever is later unless you    
elect a later date to begin receiving payments subject to the laws and          
regulations then in effect and our approval. If you purchase your Contract in   
New York, you must begin Annuity Payouts before your Annuitant's 91st birthday. 
If this Contract is issued to the trustee of a Charitable Remainder Trust, the  
Annuity Commencement Date may be deferred to the Annuitant's 100th birthday.    

The Annuity Calculation Date is when the amount of your Annuity Payout is       
determined. This occurs within five Valuation Days before your selected Annuity 
Commencement Date.                                                              

All Annuity Payouts, regardless of frequency, will occur on the same day of the 
month as the Annuity Commencement Date. After the initial payout, if an Annuity 
Payout date falls on a Non-Valuation Day, the Annuity Payout is computed on the 
prior Valuation Day. If the Annuity Payout date does not occur in a given month 
due to a leap year or months with only 28 days (i.e. the 31st), the Annuity     
Payout will be computed on the last Valuation Day of the month.                 

2. WHICH ANNUITY PAYOUT OPTION DO YOU WANT TO USE?                              

Your Contract contains the Annuity Payout Options described below. The Annuity  
Proceeds Settlement Option is an option that can be elected by the Beneficiary  
and is described in the "Death Benefit" section. We may at times offer other    
Annuity Payout Options. Once we begin to make Annuity Payouts, the Annuity      
Payout Option cannot be changed.                                                

LIFE ANNUITY                                                                    

We make Annuity Payouts as long as the Annuitant is living. When the Annuitant  
dies, we stop making Annuity Payouts. A Payee would receive only one Annuity    
Payout if the Annuitant dies after the first payout, two Annuity Payouts if the 
Annuitant dies after the second payout, and so forth.                           

LIFE ANNUITY WITH A CASH REFUND                                                 

We will make Annuity Payouts as long as the Annuitant is living. When the       
Annuitant dies, if the Annuity Payouts already made are less than the Contract  
Value minus any Premium Tax, the remaining value will be paid to the            
Beneficiary. The remaining value is equal to the Contract Value minus any       
Premium Tax minus the Annuity Payouts already made. This option is only         
available for Annuity Payouts using the 5% Assumed Investment Return or fixed   
dollar amount Annuity Payouts.                                                  

LIFE ANNUITY WITH PAYMENTS FOR A PERIOD CERTAIN                                 

We will make Annuity Payouts as long as the Annuitant is living, but we at least
guarantee to make Annuity Payouts for a time period you select, between 5 years 
and 100 years minus the Annuitant's age. If the Annuitant dies before the       
guaranteed number of years have passed, then the Beneficiary may elect to       
continue Annuity Payouts for the remainder of the guaranteed number of years or 
receive the Commuted Value in one sum.                                          

JOINT AND LAST SURVIVOR LIFE ANNUITY                                            

We will make Annuity Payouts as long as the Annuitant and Joint Annuitant are   
living. When one Annuitant dies, we continue to make Annuity Payouts to the     
other Annuitant until that second Annuitant dies. When choosing this option, you
must decide what will happen to the Annuity Payouts after the first Annuitant   
dies. You must select Annuity Payouts that:                                     

- Remain the same at 100%, or                                                   

- Decrease to 66.67%, or                                                        

- Decrease to 50%.                                                              

For variable Annuity Payouts, these percentages represent Annuity Units; for    
fixed Annuity Payouts, they represent actual dollar amounts. The percentage will
also impact the Annuity Payout amount we pay while both Annuitants are living.  
If you

pick a lower percentage, your original Annuity Payouts will be higher while both
Annuitants are alive.                                                           

JOINT AND LAST SURVIVOR LIFE ANNUITY WITH PAYMENTS FOR A PERIOD CERTAIN         

We will make Annuity Payouts as long as either the Annuitant or Joint Annuitant 
are living, but we at least guarantee to make Annuity Payouts for a time period 
you select, between 5 years and 100 years minus your younger Annuitant's age. If
the Annuitant and the Joint Annuitant both die before the guaranteed number of  
years have passed, then the Beneficiary may continue Annuity Payouts for the    
remainder of the guaranteed number of years or receive the Commuted Value in one
sum.                                                                            

When choosing this option, you must decide what will happen to the Annuity      
Payouts after the first Annuitant dies. You must select Annuity Payouts that:   

- Remain the same at 100%, or                                                   

- Decrease to 66.67%, or                                                        

- Decrease to 50%.                                                              

For variable dollar amount Annuity Payouts, these percentages represent Annuity 
Units. For fixed dollar amount Annuity Payouts, these percentages represent     
actual dollar amounts. The percentage will also impact the Annuity Payout amount
we pay while both Annuitants are living. If you pick a lower percentage, your   
original Annuity Payouts will be higher while both Annuitants are alive.        

PAYMENTS FOR A PERIOD CERTAIN                                                   

We agree to make payments for a specified time. The minimum period that you can 
select is 10 years during the first two Contract Years and 5 years after the    
second Contract Anniversary. The maximum period that you can select is 100 years
minus your Annuitant's age. If, at the death of the Annuitant, Annuity Payouts  
have been made for less than the time period selected, then the Beneficiary may 
elect to continue the remaining Annuity Payouts or receive the Commuted Value in
one sum.                                                                        

For Contracts issued in the State of Oregon, the minimum period that you can    
select under the Payments for a Period Certain Annuity Payout Option is as      
follows: For fixed annuity payouts, the minimum period that you can select is 10
years during the first two Contract Years and 5 years after the second Contract 
Anniversary. For variable annuity payouts, the minimum period that you can      
select is 5 years on or after the tenth Contract Anniversary.                   

IMPORTANT INFORMATION:                                                          
- YOU CANNOT SURRENDER YOUR CONTRACT ONCE ANNUITY PAYOUTS BEGIN, UNLESS YOU HAVE
SELECTED LIFE ANNUITY WITH PAYMENTS FOR A PERIOD CERTAIN, JOINT AND LAST    
SURVIVOR LIFE ANNUITY WITH PAYMENTS FOR A PERIOD CERTAIN, OR PAYMENTS FOR A 
PERIOD CERTAIN VARIABLE DOLLAR AMOUNT ANNUITY PAYOUT OPTION. A CONTINGENT   
DEFERRED SALES CHARGE MAY BE DEDUCTED.                                      

- For Qualified Contracts, if you elect an Annuity Payout Option with a Period  
 Certain, the guaranteed number of years must be less than the life expectancy
of the Annuitant at the time the Annuity Payouts begin. We compute life     
expectancy using the IRS mortality tables.                                  

- AUTOMATIC ANNUITY PAYOUTS -- If you do not elect an Annuity Payout Option,    
Annuity Payouts will automatically begin on the Annuity Commencement Date   
under the Life Annuity with Payments for a Period Certain Annuity Payout    
  Option with a ten-year period certain. Automatic Annuity Payouts will be fixed
dollar amount Annuity Payouts, variable dollar amount Annuity Payouts, or a 
combination of fixed or variable dollar amount Annuity Payouts, depending on
the investment allocation of your Account in effect on the Annuity          
Commencement Date.                                                          

3. HOW OFTEN DO YOU WANT THE PAYEE TO RECEIVE ANNUITY PAYOUTS?                  

In addition to selecting an Annuity Commencement Date and an Annuity Payout     
Option, you must also decide how often you want the Payee to receive Annuity    
Payouts. You may choose to receive Annuity Payouts:                             

- monthly,                                                                      

- quarterly,                                                                    

- semi-annually, or                                                             

- annually.                                                                     

Once you select a frequency, it cannot be changed. If you do not make a         
selection, the Payee will receive monthly Annuity Payouts. You must select a    
frequency that results in an Annuity Payout of at least $50. If the amount falls
below $50, we have the right to change the frequency to bring the Annuity Payout
up to at least $50. For Contracts issued in New York, the minimum monthly       
Annuity Payout is $20.                                                          

4. WHAT IS THE ASSUMED INVESTMENT RETURN?                                       

The Assumed Investment Return ("AIR") is the investment return you select before
we start to make Annuity Payouts. It is a critical assumption for calculating   
variable dollar amount Annuity Payouts. The first Annuity Payout will be based  
upon the AIR. The remaining Annuity Payouts will fluctuate based on the         
performance of the underlying Funds.                                            

Subject to the approval of your State, you can select one of three AIRs: 3%, 5% 
or 6%. The greater the AIR, the greater the initial Annuity Payout. A higher AIR
may result in smaller potential growth in the Annuity Payouts. On the other     
hand, a lower AIR results in a lower initial Annuity Payout, but future Annuity 
Payouts have the potential to be greater.                                       

For example, if the Sub-Accounts earned exactly the same as the AIR, then the   
second monthly Annuity Payout Option is the same as the first. If the           
Sub-Accounts earned more than the AIR, then the second monthly Annuity Payout   
Option is higher than the first. If the Sub-Accounts earned less than the AIR,  
then the second monthly Annuity Payout Option is lower than the first.

                                                                              27
HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY                                                 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Level variable dollar Annuity Payouts would be produced if the investment       
returns remained constant and equal to the AIR. In fact, Annuity Payouts will   
vary up or down as the investment rate varies up or down from the AIR.          

5. DO YOU WANT ANNUITY PAYOUTS TO BE FIXED-DOLLAR AMOUNT OR VARIABLE-DOLLAR     
AMOUNT?                                                                   

You may choose an Annuity Payout Option with fixed dollar amounts or variable   
dollar amounts, depending on your income needs.                                 

FIXED DOLLAR AMOUNT ANNUITY PAYOUTS -- Once a fixed dollar amount Annuity Payout
begins, you cannot change your selection to receive variable dollar amount      
Annuity Payout. You will receive equal fixed dollar amount Annuity Payouts      
throughout the Annuity Payout period. Fixed-dollar amount Annuity Payout amounts
are determined by multiplying the Contract Value, minus any applicable Premium  
Taxes, by an annuity rate. The annuity rate is set by us and is not less than   
the rate specified in the Fixed Payment Annuity tables in your Contract.        

VARIABLE DOLLAR AMOUNT ANNUITY PAYOUTS -- A variable dollar amount Annuity      
Payout is based on the investment performance of the Sub-Accounts. The variable 
dollar amount Annuity Payouts may fluctuate with the performance of the         
underlying Funds. To begin making variable dollar amount Annuity Payouts, we    
convert the first Annuity Payout amount to a set number of Annuity Units and    
then price those units to determine the Annuity Payout amount. The number of    
Annuity Units that determines the Annuity Payout amount remains fixed unless you
transfer units between Sub-Accounts.                                            

The dollar amount of the first variable Annuity Payout depends on:              

- the Annuity Payout Option chosen,                                             

- the Annuitant's attained age and gender (if applicable),                      

- the applicable annuity purchase rates based on the 1983a Individual Annuity   
Mortality table, and                                                        

- the Assumed Investment Return.                                                

The total amount of the first variable dollar amount Annuity Payout is          
determined by dividing the Contract Value minus any applicable Premium Taxes, by
$1,000 and multiplying the result by the payment factor defined in the Contract 
for the selected Annuity Payout Option.                                         

The dollar amount of each subsequent variable dollar amount Annuity Payout is   
equal to the total of Annuity Units for each Sub-Account multiplied by Annuity  
Unit Value of each Sub-Account.                                                 

The Annuity Unit Value of each Sub-Account for any Valuation Period is equal to 
the Accumulation Unit Value Net Investment Factor for the current Valuation     
Period multiplied by the Annuity Unit factor, multiplied by the Annuity Unit    
Value for the preceding Valuation Period.                                       

TRANSFER OF ANNUITY UNITS -- After the Annuity Calculation Date, you may        
transfer dollar amounts of Annuity Units from one Sub-Account to another. On the
day you make a transfer, the dollar amounts are equal for both Sub-Accounts and 
the number of Annuity Units will be different. We will transfer the dollar      
amount of your Annuity Units the day we receive your written request if received
before the close of the New York Stock Exchange. Otherwise, the transfer will be
made on the next Valuation Day.                                                 

OTHER PROGRAMS AVAILABLE                                                        
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INVESTEASE-Registered Trademark- PROGRAM -- InvestEase is an electronic transfer
program that allows you to have money automatically transferred from your       
checking or savings account, and invested in your Contract. It is available for 
Premium Payments made after your initial Premium Payment. The minimum amount for
each transfer is $50. You can elect to have transfers occur either monthly or   
quarterly, and they can be made into any Account available in your Contract.    

AUTOMATIC INCOME PROGRAM -- The Automatic Income Program allows you to Surrender
up to 15% of your total Premium Payments each Contract Year without a Contingent
Deferred Sales Charge. You can Surrender from the Accounts you select           
systematically on a monthly, quarterly, semiannual, or annual basis. The        
Automatic Income Program may change based on your instructions after your       
seventh Contract Year.                                                          

AUTOMATIC REBALANCING PROGRAM -- Automatic Rebalancing is a program that allows 
you to choose an allocation for your Sub-Accounts to help you reach your        
investment goals. The Contract offers model allocations with pre-selected       
Sub-Accounts and percentages that have been established for each type of        
investor -- ranging from conservative to aggressive. Over time, Sub-Account     
performance may cause your Contract's allocation percentages to change, but     
under the Automatic Rebalancing Program, your Sub-Account allocations are       
rebalanced to the percentages in the current model you have chosen. You can     
transfer freely between allocation models up to twelve times per year. You can  
also allocate a portion of your investment to Sub-Accounts that may not be part 
of the model. You can only participate in one asset allocation model at a time. 

DOLLAR COST AVERAGING PROGRAMS -- We currently offer two different types of     
Dollar Cost Averaging Programs in addition to the DCA Plus Program. If you      
enroll, you may select either the Fixed Amount DCA Program or the               
Earnings/Interest DCA Program. The Fixed Amount DCA Program allows you to       
regularly transfer an amount you select from the Fixed Accumulation Feature or  
any Fund into a different Fund. The Earnings/Interest DCA Program allows you to

ASSIGNMENT                                                                      

A Non-Qualified Contract may be assigned. We must be properly notified in       
writing of an assignment. Any Annuity Payouts or Surrenders requested or        
scheduled before we record an assignment will be made according to the

validity of an assignment. Assigning a Non-Qualified Contract may require the   
payment of income taxes and certain penalty taxes. Please consult a qualified   
tax adviser before assigning your Contract.                                     

A Qualified Contract may not be transferred or otherwise assigned, unless       
allowed by applicable law.

applicable federal or state law. No modification will effect the method by which
Contract Values are determined.                                                 

HOW CONTRACTS ARE SOLD -- Hartford Securities Distribution Company, Inc. ("HSD")
serves as Principal Underwriter for the securities issued with respect to the   
Separate Account. HSD is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission 
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as a Broker-Dealer and is a member of 
the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. HSD is an affiliate of     
ours. Both HSD and Hartford are ultimately controlled by The Hartford Financial 
Services Group, Inc. The principal business address of HSD is the same as ours. 
The securities will be sold by individuals who represent us as insurance agents 
and who are registered representatives of Broker-Dealers that have entered into 
distribution agreements with HSD.                                               

Commissions will be paid by Hartford and will not be more than 7% of Premium    
Payments. From time to time, Hartford may pay or permit other promotional       
incentives, in cash or credit or other compensation.                            

Broker-dealers or financial institutions are compensated according to a schedule
set forth by HSD and any applicable rules or regulations for variable insurance 
compensation. Compensation is generally based on Premium Payments made by       
policyholders or Contract Owners. This compensation is usually paid from the    
sales charges described in this prospectus.                                     

In addition, a broker-dealer or financial institution may also receive          
additional compensation for, among other things, training, marketing or other   
services provided. HSD, its affiliates or Hartford may also make compensation   
arrangements with certain broker-dealers or financial institutions based on     
total sales by the broker-dealer or financial institution of insurance products.
These payments, which may be different for different broker-dealers or financial
institutions, will be made by HSD, its affiliates or Hartford out of their own  
assets and will not affect the amounts paid by the policyholders or Contract    
Owners to purchase, hold or Surrender variable insurance products.              

The Contract may be sold directly to certain individuals under certain          
circumstances that do not involve payment of any sales compensation to a        
registered representative. In such case, Hartford will credit the Contract with 
an additional 5.0% of the Premium Payment. This additional percentage of Premium
Payment in no way affects present or future charges, rights, benefits or current
values of other Contract Owners. The following class of individuals are eligible
for this feature: (1) current or retired officers, directors, trustees and      
employees (and their families) of the ultimate parent and affiliates of         
Hartford; and (2) employees and registered representatives (and their families) 
of registered broker-dealers (or their financial institutions) that have a sales
agreement with Hartford and its principal underwriter to sell the Contracts.    

LEGAL MATTERS                                                                   

There are no material legal proceedings pending to which the Separate Account is
a party.

FEDERAL TAX CONSIDERATIONS 

What are some of the federal tax consequences which affect these Contracts?     

A. GENERAL                                                                      

Since federal tax law is complex, the tax consequences of purchasing this       
Contract will vary depending on your situation. You may need tax or legal advice
to help you determine whether purchasing this Contract is right for you.        

Our general discussion of the tax treatment of this contract is based on our    
understanding of federal income tax laws as they are currently interpreted. A   
detailed description of all federal income tax consequences regarding the       
purchase of this contract cannot be made in the prospectus. We also do not      
discuss state, municipal or other tax laws that may apply to this contract. For 
detailed information, you should consult with a qualified tax adviser familiar  
with your situation.                                                            

B. TAXATION OF HARTFORD AND THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT                                

The Separate Account is taxed as part of Hartford which is taxed as a life      
insurance company in accordance with the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as      
amended (the "Code"). Accordingly, the Separate Account will not be taxed as a  
"regulated investment company" under subchapter M of Chapter 1 of the Code.     
Investment income and any realized capital gains on the assets of the Separate  
Account are reinvested and are taken into account in determining the value of   
the Accumulation and Annuity Units (See "Value of Accumulation Units"). As a    
result, such investment income and realized capital gains are automatically     
applied to increase reserves under the Contract.                                

No taxes are due on interest, dividends and short-term or long-term capital     
gains earned by the Separate Account with respect to Qualified or Non-Qualified 
Contracts.                                                                      

C. TAXATION OF ANNUITIES -- GENERAL PROVISIONS AFFECTING PURCHASERS OTHER THAN  
QUALIFIED RETIREMENT PLANS                                                      

Section 72 of the Code governs the taxation of annuities in general.            

1. NON-NATURAL PERSONS, CORPORATIONS, ETC.                                  

Code Section 72 contains provisions for contract owners which are not natural   
persons. Non-natural persons include corporations, trusts, limited liability    
companies, partnerships and other types of legal entities. The tax rules for    
contracts owned by non-natural persons are different from the rules for         
contracts owned by individuals. For example, the annual net increase in the     
value of the contract is currently includible in the gross income of a          
non-natural person, unless the non-natural person holds the contract as an agent
for a natural person. There are additional exceptions from current inclusion    
for:                                                                            

- certain annuities held by structured settlement companies,                    

- certain annuities held by an employer with respect to a terminated qualified  
retirement plan and                                                         

- certain immediate annuities.                                                  

A non-natural person which is a tax-exempt entity for federal tax purposes will 
not be subject to income tax as a result of this provision.                     

If the contract owner is a non-natural person, the primary annuitant is treated 
as the contract owner in applying mandatory distribution rules. These rules     
require that certain distributions be made upon the death of the contract owner.
A change in the primary annuitant is also treated as the death of the contract  
owner.                                                                          

2. OTHER CONTRACT OWNERS (NATURAL PERSONS).                                 

A Contract Owner is not taxed on increases in the value of the Contract until an
amount is received or deemed received, e.g., in the form of a lump sum payment  
(full or partial value of a Contract) or as Annuity payments under the          
settlement option elected.                                                      

The provisions of Section 72 of the Code concerning distributions are summarized
briefly below. Also summarized are special rules affecting distributions from   
Contracts obtained in a tax-free exchange for other annuity contracts or life   
insurance contracts which were purchased prior to August 14, 1982.              

a. DISTRIBUTIONS PRIOR TO THE ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE.                

i. Total premium payments less amounts received which were not includible in
     gross income equal the "investment in the contract" under Section 72 of the
Code.                                                                 

ii. To the extent that the value of the Contract (ignoring any surrender      
charges except on a full surrender) exceeds the "investment in the    
contract," such excess constitutes the "income on the contract."      

iii. Any amount received or deemed received prior to the Annuity Commencement 
  Date (e.g., upon a partial surrender) is deemed to come first from any
     such "income on the contract" and then from "investment in the contract,"
     and for these purposes such "income on the contract" shall be computed by
      reference to any aggregation rule in subparagraph 2.c. below. As a result,
  any such amount received or deemed received (1) shall be includible in
gross income to the extent that such amount does not exceed any such
     "income on the contract," and (2) shall not be includible in gross income
to the extent that such amount does exceed any such "income on the  
    contract." If at the time that any amount is received or deemed received
      there is no "income on the contract" (e.g., because the gross value of the
Contract does not exceed the "investment in the contract" and no    
   aggregation rule applies), then such amount received or deemed received
will not be includible in gross                                     

P-->49730th "Page" of 108TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 30th
30

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

income, and will simply reduce the "investment in the contract."    

 iv. The receipt of any amount as a loan under the Contract or the assignment or
   pledge of any portion of the value of the Contract shall be treated as an
amount received for purposes of this subparagraph a. and the next     
subparagraph b.                                                       

v. In general, the transfer of the Contract, without full and adequate        
 consideration, will be treated as an amount received for purposes of this
subparagraph a. and the next subparagraph b. This transfer rule does not
    apply, however, to certain transfers of property between spouses or incident
to divorce.                                                             

vi. In general, any amount actually received under the Contract as a Death    
Benefit, including any Optional Death Benefit or Earnings Protection  
Benefit, will be treated as an amount received for purposes of this   
     subparagraph a. and the next subparagraph b. As a result, Hartford believes
   that for federal tax purposes the Optional Death Benefit and the Earnings
    Protection Benefit should be treated as an integral part of the Contract's
benefits (e.g., as investment protection benefit) and that any charges
under the contract for the Optional Death Benefit or the Earnings     
Protection Benefit should not be treated as an amount received by the 
     Contract Owner for purposes of this subparagraph a. However, it is possible
that the IRS could take a contrary position that some or all of these 
   charges for the Optional Death Benefit or the Earnings Protection Benefit
    should be treated for federal tax purposes as an amount received under the
  Contract (e.g., as an amount distributed from the Contract to pay for an
additional benefit that should be treated as a benefit that is being  
provided by a separate contract for tax purposes, i.e., by a separate 
     contract that is not part of the annuity Contract for tax purposes). If the
 IRS takes such a contrary position, however, then any Beneficiary of an
     Optional Death Benefit or an Earnings Protection Benefit may be entitled to
    claim that some part of such Death Benefit is excludable from gross income
   for federal tax purposes (e.g., as a death benefit that should be treated
   for tax purposes as if it were being provided by a separate contract that
qualifies as a life insurance contract for tax purposes).             

b. DISTRIBUTIONS AFTER ANNUITY COMMENCEMENT DATE.                       

Annuity payments made periodically after the Annuity Commencement Date are      
includible in gross income to the extent the payments exceed the amount         
determined by the application of the ratio of the "investment in the contract"  
to the total amount of the payments to be made after the Annuity Commencement   
Date (the "exclusion ratio").                                                   

i. When the total of amounts excluded from income by application of the     
exclusion ratio is equal to the investment in the contract as of the  
   Annuity Commencement Date, any additional payments (including surrenders)
will be entirely includible in gross income.                          

ii. If the annuity payments cease by reason of the death of the Annuitant and,
     as of the date of death, the amount of annuity payments excluded from gross
income by the exclusion ratio does not exceed the investment in the   
     contract as of the Annuity Commencement Date, then the remaining portion of
     unrecovered investment shall be allowed as a deduction for the last taxable
year of the Annuitant.                                                

iii. Generally, nonperiodic amounts received or deemed received after the     
 Annuity Commencement Date are not entitled to any exclusion ratio and
     shall be fully includible in gross income. However, upon a full surrender
after such date, only the excess of the amount received (after any  
      surrender charge) over the remaining "investment in the contract" shall be
      includible in gross income (except to the extent that the aggregation rule
referred to in the next subparagraph c. may apply).                 

c. AGGREGATION OF TWO OR MORE ANNUITY CONTRACTS.                        

Contracts issued after October 21, 1988 by the same insurer (or affiliated      
insurer) to the same Contract Owner within the same calendar year (other than   
certain contracts held in connection with a tax-qualified retirement            
arrangement) will be treated as one annuity Contract for the purpose of         
determining the taxation of distributions prior to the Annuity Commencement     
Date. An annuity contract received in a tax-free exchange for another annuity   
contract or life insurance contract may be treated as a new Contract for this   
purpose. Hartford believes that for any annuity subject to such aggregation, the
values under the Contracts and the investment in the contracts will be added    
together to determine the taxation under subparagraph 2.a., above, of amounts   
received or deemed received prior to the Annuity Commencement Date. Withdrawals 
will first be treated as withdrawals of income until all of the income from all 
such Contracts is withdrawn. As of the date of this Prospectus, there are no    
regulations interpreting this provision.                                        

d. 10% PENALTY TAX -- APPLICABLE TO CERTAIN WITHDRAWALS AND ANNUITY     
PAYMENTS.                                                         

i. If any amount is received or deemed received on the Contract (before or  
    after the Annuity Commencement Date), the Code applies a penalty tax equal
 to ten percent of the portion of the amount includible in gross income,
unless an exception applies.                                          

ii. The 10% penalty tax will not apply to the following distributions         
(exceptions vary based upon the precise plan involved):               

 1. Distributions made on or after the date the recipient has attained the
age of 59 1/2.                                                    

2. Distributions made on or after the death of the holder or where the  
holder is not an individual, the death of the primary annuitant.  

3. Distributions attributable to a recipient's becoming disabled.

                                                                              31
HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY                                                 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

   4. A distribution that is part of a scheduled series of substantially equal
    periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) for the life (or
life expectancy) of the recipient (or the joint lives or life     
expectancies of the recipient and the recipient's designated      
Beneficiary).                                                     

 5. Distributions of amounts which are allocable to the "investment in the
contract" prior to August 14, 1982 (see next subparagraph e.).    

e. SPECIAL PROVISIONS AFFECTING CONTRACTS OBTAINED THROUGH A TAX-FREE   
      EXCHANGE OF OTHER ANNUITY OR LIFE INSURANCE CONTRACTS PURCHASED PRIOR TO
AUGUST 14, 1982.                                                  

If the Contract was obtained by a tax-free exchange of a life insurance or      
annuity Contract purchased prior to August 14, 1982, then any amount received or
deemed received prior to the Annuity Commencement Date shall be deemed to come  
(1) first from the amount of the "investment in the contract" prior to August   
14, 1982 ("pre-8/14/82 investment") carried over from the prior Contract,       
(2) then from the portion of the "income on the contract" (carried over to, as  
well as accumulating in, the successor Contract) that is attributable to such   
pre-8/14/82 investment, (3) then from the remaining "income on the contract" and
(4) last from the remaining "investment in the contract." As a result, to the   
extent that such amount received or deemed received does not exceed such        
pre-8/14/82 investment, such amount is not includible in gross income. In       
addition, to the extent that such amount received or deemed received does not   
exceed the sum of (a) such pre-8/14/82 investment and (b) the "income on the    
contract" attributable thereto, such amount is not subject to the 10% penalty   
tax. In all other respects, amounts received or deemed received from such post- 
exchange Contracts are generally subject to the rules described in this         
subparagraph 3.                                                                 

f. REQUIRED DISTRIBUTIONS.                                              

i.Death of Contract Owner or Primary Annuitant                              
  Subject to the alternative election or spouse beneficiary provisions in ii
or iii below:                                                           

   1. If any Contract Owner dies on or after the Annuity Commencement Date and
  before the entire interest in the Contract has been distributed, the
 remaining portion of such interest shall be distributed at least as
      rapidly as under the method of distribution being used as of the date of
such death;                                                       

2. If any Contract Owner dies before the Annuity Commencement Date, the 
      entire interest in the Contract will be distributed within 5 years after
such death; and                                                   

    3. If the Contract Owner is not an individual, then for purposes of 1. or 2.
     above, the primary annuitant under the Contract shall be treated as the
      Contract Owner, and any change in the primary annuitant shall be treated
as the death of the Contract Owner. The primary annuitant is the  
     individual, the events in the life of whom are of primary importance in
affecting the timing or amount of the payout under the Contract.  

ii.Alternative Election to Satisfy Distribution Requirements                  
   If any portion of the interest of a Contract Owner described in i. above is
   payable to or for the benefit of a designated beneficiary, such beneficiary
    may elect to have the portion distributed over a period that does not extend
    beyond the life or life expectancy of the beneficiary. Distributions must be
 made and payments must begin within a year of the Contract Owner's death.

iii.Spouse Beneficiary                                                        
     If any portion of the interest of a Contract Owner is payable to or for the
    benefit of his or her spouse, and the Annuitant or Contingent Annuitant is
    living, such spouse shall be treated as the Contract Owner of such portion
    for purposes of section i. above. This spousal contract continuation shall
apply only once for this contract.                                    

3. DIVERSIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.                                            

The Code requires that investments supporting your contract be adequately       
diversified. Code Section 817 provides that a variable annuity contract will not
be treated as an annuity contract for any period during which the investments   
made by the separate account or underlying fund are not adequately diversified. 
If a contract is not treated as an annuity contract, the contract owner will be 
subject to income tax on annual increases in cash value.                        

The Treasury Department's diversification regulations require, among other      
things, that:                                                                   

- no more than 55% of the value of the total assets of the segregated asset     
account underlying a variable contract is represented by any one investment,

- no more than 70% is represented by any two investments,                       

- no more than 80% is represented by any three investments, and                 

- no more than 90% is represented by any four investments.                      

In determining whether the diversification standards are met, all securities of 
the same issuer, all interests in the same real property project, and all       
interests in the same commodity are each treated as a single investment. In the 
case of government securities, each government agency or instrumentality is     
treated as a separate issuer.                                                   

A separate account must be in compliance with the diversification standards on  
the last day of each calendar quarter or within 30 days after the quarter ends. 
If an insurance company inadvertently fails to meet the diversification         
requirements, the company may still comply within a reasonable period and avoid 
the taxation of contract income on an ongoing basis. However, either the company
or the contract owner must agree to pay the tax due for the period during which 
the diversification requirements were not met.

                                                 HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We monitor the diversification of investments in the separate accounts and test 
for diversification as required by the Code. We intend to administer all        
contracts subject to the diversification requirements in a manner that will     
maintain adequate diversification.                                              

4. OWNERSHIP OF THE ASSETS IN THE SEPARATE ACCOUNT.                         

In order for a variable annuity contract to qualify for tax deferral, assets in 
the separate accounts supporting the contract must be considered to be owned by 
the insurance company and not by the contract owner. It is unclear under what   
circumstances an investor is considered to have enough control over the assets  
in the separate account to be considered the owner of the assets for tax        
purposes.                                                                       

The IRS has issued several rulings discussing investor control. These rulings   
say that certain incidents of ownership by the contract owner, such as the      
ability to select and control investments in a separate account, will cause the 
contract owner to be treated as the owner of the assets for tax purposes.       

In its explanation of the diversification regulations, the Treasury Department  
recognized that the temporary regulations "do not provide guidance concerning   
the circumstances in which investor control of the investments of a segregated  
asset account may cause the investor, rather than the insurance company, to be  
treated as the owner of the assets in the account." The explanation further     
indicates that "the temporary regulations provide that in appropriate cases a   
segregated asset account may include multiple sub-accounts, but do not specify  
the extent to which policyholders may direct their investments to particular    
sub-accounts without being treated as the owners of the underlying assets.      
Guidance on this and other issues will be provided in regulations or revenue    
rulings under Section 817(d), relating to the definition of variable contract." 

The final regulations issued under Section 817 did not provide guidance         
regarding investor control, and as of the date of this prospectus, guidance has 
yet to be issued. We do not know if additional guidance will be issued. If      
guidance is issued, we do not know if it will have a retroactive effect.        

Due to the lack of specific guidance on investor control, there is some         
uncertainty about when a contract owner is considered the owner of the assets   
for tax purposes. We reserve the right to modify the contract, as necessary, to 
prevent you from being considered the owner of assets in the separate account.  

D. FEDERAL INCOME TAX WITHHOLDING                                               

Any portion of a distribution that is current taxable income to the Contract    
Owner will be subject to federal income tax withholding and reporting under the 
Code. Generally, however, a Contract Owner may elect not to have income taxes   
withheld or to have income taxes withheld at a different rate by filing a       
completed election form with us. Election forms will be provided at the time    
distributions are requested.                                                    

E. GENERAL PROVISIONS AFFECTING QUALIFIED RETIREMENT PLANS                      

The Contract may be used for a number of qualified retirement plans. If the     
Contract is being purchased with respect to some form of qualified retirement   
plan, please refer to Appendix I for information relative to the types of plans 
for which it may be used and the general explanation of the tax features of such
plans.                                                                          

F. ANNUITY PURCHASES BY NONRESIDENT ALIENS AND FOREIGN CORPORATIONS             

The discussion above provides general information regarding U.S. federal income 
tax consequences to annuity purchasers that are U.S. citizens or residents.     
Purchasers that are not U.S. citizens or residents will generally be subject to 
U.S. federal income tax and withholding on annuity distributions at a 30% rate, 
unless a lower treaty rate applies. In addition, purchasers may be subject to   
state premium tax, other state and/or municipal taxes, and taxes that may be    
imposed by the purchaser's country of citizenship or residence. Prospective     
purchasers are advised to consult with a qualified tax adviser regarding U.S.,  
state, and foreign taxation with respect to an annuity purchase.                

G. GENERATION-SKIPPING TRANSFERS                                                

Under certain circumstances, the Internal Revenue Code may impose a "generation 
skipping transfer tax" when all or part of an annuity is transferred to, or a   
death benefit is paid to, an individual two or more generations younger than the
owner. Federal tax law may require us to deduct the tax from your contract, or  
from any applicable payment, and pay it directly to the Internal Revenue        
Service.

APPENDIX I -- INFORMATION REGARDING TAX-QUALIFIED RETIREMENT PLANS 

This summary does not attempt to provide more than general information about the
federal income tax rules associated with use of a Contract by a tax-qualified   
retirement plan. Because of the complexity of the federal tax rules, owners,    
participants and beneficiaries are encouraged to consult their own tax advisers 
as to specific tax consequences.                                                

The federal tax rules applicable to owners of Contracts under tax-qualified     
retirement plans vary according to the type of plan as well as the terms and    
conditions of the plan itself. Contract owners, plan participants and           
beneficiaries are cautioned that the rights and benefits of any person may be   
controlled by the terms and conditions of the tax-qualified retirement plan     
itself, regardless of the terms and conditions of a Contract. We are not bound  
by the terms and conditions of such plans to the extent such terms conflict with
a Contract, unless we specifically consent to be bound.                         

Some tax-qualified retirement plans are subject to distribution and other       
requirements that are not incorporated into our administrative procedures.      
Contract owners, participants and beneficiaries are responsible for determining 
that contributions, distributions and other transactions comply with applicable 
law. Tax penalties may apply to transactions with respect to tax-qualified      
retirement plans if applicable federal income tax rules and restrictions are not
carefully observed.                                                             

We do not currently offer the Contracts in connection with all of the types of  
tax-qualified retirement plans discussed below and may not offer the Contracts  
for all types of tax-qualified retirement plans in the future.                  

1. TAX-QUALIFIED PENSION OR PROFIT-SHARING PLANS -- Eligible employers can      
establish certain tax-qualified pension and profit-sharing plans under section  
401 of the Code. Rules under section 401(k) of the Code govern certain "cash or 
deferred arrangements" under such plans. Rules under section 408(k) govern      
"simplified employee pensions". Tax-qualified pension and profit-sharing plans  
are subject to limitations on the amount that may be contributed, the persons   
who may be eligible to participate and the time when distributions must         
commence. Employers intending to use the Contracts in connection with           
tax-qualified pension or profit-sharing plans should seek competent tax and     
other legal advice.                                                             

2. TAX SHELTERED ANNUITIES UNDER SECTION 403(b) -- Public schools and certain   
types of charitable, educational and scientific organizations, as specified in  
section 501(c)(3) of the Code, can purchase tax-sheltered annuity contracts for 
their employees. Tax-deferred contributions can be made to tax-sheltered annuity
contracts under section 403(b) of the Code, subject to certain limitations.     
Generally, such contributions may not exceed the lesser of $10,500 (indexed) or 
20% of the employee's "includible compensation" for such employee's most recent 
full year of employment, subject to other adjustments. Special provisions under 
the Code may allow some employees to elect a different overall limitation.      

Tax-sheltered annuity programs under section 403(b) are subject to A PROHIBITION
AGAINST DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE CONTRACT ATTRIBUTABLE TO CONTRIBUTIONS MADE      
PURSUANT TO A SALARY REDUCTION AGREEMENT, unless such distribution is made:     

- after the participating employee attains age 59 1/2;                          

- upon separation from service;                                                 

- upon death or disability; or                                                  

- in the case of hardship (and in the case of hardship, any income attributable 
to such contributions may not be distributed).                              

Generally, the above restrictions do not apply to distributions attributable to 
cash values or other amounts held under a section 403(b) contract as of December
31, 1988.                                                                       

3. DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS UNDER SECTION 457 -- A governmental employer or a
tax-exempt employer other than a governmental unit can establish a Deferred     
Compensation Plan under section 457 of the Code. For these purposes, a          
"governmental employer" is a State, a political subdivision of a State, or an   
agency or an instrumentality of a State or political subdivision of a State.    
Employees and independent contractors performing services for a governmental or 
tax-exempt employer can elect to have contributions made to a Deferred          
Compensation Plan of their employer in accordance with the employer's plan and  
section 457 of the Code.                                                        

Deferred Compensation Plans that meet the requirements of section 457(b) of the 
Code are called "eligible" Deferred Compensation Plans. Section 457(b) limits   
the amount of contributions that can be made to an eligible Deferred            
Compensation Plan on behalf of a participant. Generally, the limitation on      
contributions is 33 1/3% of a participant's includible compensation or, for     
2001, $8,500 (indexed), whichever is less. The plan may provide for additional  
"catch-up" contributions during the three taxable years ending before the year  
in which the participant attains normal retirement age.                         

All of the assets and income of an eligible Deferred Compensation Plan of a     
governmental employer must be held in trust for the exclusive benefit of        
participants and their beneficiaries. For this purpose, custodial accounts and  
certain annuity contracts are treated as trusts. The requirement of a trust does
not apply to amounts under a Deferred Compensation Plan of a tax-exempt         
(non-governmental) employer. In addition, the requirement of a trust does not   
apply to amounts under a Deferred Compensation Plan of a governmental employer  
if the Deferred Compensation Plan is not an eligible plan within the meaning of 
section 457(b) of the Code. In the absence of such a trust, amounts under the   
plan will be subject to the claims of the employer's general creditors.

HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY                                                 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In general, distributions from an eligible Deferred Compensation Plan are       
prohibited under section 457 of the Code unless made after the participating    
employee:                                                                       

- attains age 70 1/2,                                                           

- separates from service,                                                       

- dies, or                                                                      

- suffers an unforeseeable financial emergency as defined in the Code.          

Under present federal tax law, amounts accumulated in a Deferred Compensation   
Plan under section 457 of the Code cannot be transferred or rolled over on a    
tax-deferred basis except for certain transfers to other Deferred Compensation  
Plans under section 457 in limited cases.                                       

4. INDIVIDUAL RETIREMENT ANNUITIES ("IRAS") UNDER SECTION 408                   

TRADITIONAL IRAs -- Eligible individuals can establish individual retirement    
programs under section 408 of the Code through the purchase of an IRA. Section  
408 imposes limits with respect to IRAs, including limits on the amount that may
be contributed to an IRA, the amount of such contributions that may be deducted 
from taxable income, the persons who may be eligible to contribute to an IRA,   
and the time when distributions commence from an IRA. Distributions from certain
tax-qualified retirement plans may be "rolled-over" to an IRA on a tax- deferred
basis.                                                                          

SIMPLE IRAs -- Eligible employees may establish SIMPLE IRAs in connection with a
SIMPLE IRA plan of an employer under section 408(p) of the Code. Special        
rollover rules apply to SIMPLE IRAs. Amounts can be rolled over from one SIMPLE 
IRA to another SIMPLE IRA. However, amounts can be rolled over from a SIMPLE IRA
to a Traditional IRA only after two years have expired since the employee first 
commenced participation in the employer's SIMPLE IRA plan. Amounts cannot be    
rolled over to a SIMPLE IRA from a qualified plan or a Traditional IRA. Hartford
is a non-designated financial institution for purposes of the SIMPLE IRA rules. 

ROTH IRAs -- Eligible individuals may establish Roth IRAs under section 408A of 
the Code. Contributions to a Roth IRA are not deductible. Subject to special    
limitations, a Traditional IRA may be converted into a Roth IRA or a            
distribution from a Traditional IRA may be rolled over to a Roth IRA. However, a
conversion or a rollover from a Traditional IRA to a Roth IRA is not excludable 
from gross income. If certain conditions are met, qualified distributions from a
Roth IRA are tax-free.                                                          

INFORMATION ABOUT DEATH BENEFITS AND IRAs -- IRAs generally may not invest in   
life insurance contracts. However, an annuity that is used as an IRA may provide
for a death benefit that equals the greater of the premiums paid and the        
annuity's cash value. The Contract offers an Optional Death Benefit and an      
Earnings Protection Benefit. The Optional Death Benefit and the Earnings        
Protection Benefit may exceed the greater of the Contract Value and total       
Premium Payments less prior surrenders. WE HAVE FILED THE CONTRACT WITH THE     
OPTIONAL DEATH BENEFIT AND THE EARNINGS PROTECTION BENEFIT WITH THE INTERNAL    
REVENUE SERVICE FOR APPROVAL FOR USE AS AN IRA. NO ASSURANCE IS GIVEN THAT THESE
BENEFITS MEET THE QUALIFICATION REQUIREMENTS FOR AN IRA. Although we regard the 
Optional Death Benefit and the Earnings Protection Benefit as investment        
protection features that should not have an adverse tax effect, it is possible  
that the IRS could take a contrary position regarding tax-qualification or      
resulting in certain deemed distributions and penalty taxes. You should consult 
a qualified tax adviser if you are considering adding the Optional Death Benefit
or the Earnings Protection Benefit to your Contract if it is an IRA.            

5. FEDERAL TAX PENALTIES AND WITHHOLDING -- Distributions from tax-qualified    
retirement plans are generally taxed as ordinary income under section 72 of the 
Code. Under these rules, a portion of each distribution may be excludable from  
income. The excludable amount is the portion of the distribution that bears the 
same ratio as the after-tax contributions bear to the expected return.          

(a) PENALTY TAX ON EARLY DISTRIBUTIONS Section 72(t) of the Code imposes an     
    additional penalty tax equal to 10% of the taxable portion of a distribution
 from certain tax-qualified retirement plans. However, the 10% penalty tax
does not apply to a distributions that is:                              

- Made on or after the date on which the employee reaches age 59 1/2;           

- Made to a beneficiary (or to the estate of the employee) on or after the death
of the employee;                                                            

- Attributable to the employee's becoming disabled (as defined in the Code);    

- Part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently
than annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the employee or the
joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the employee and his or her     
designated beneficiary;                                                     

- Except in the case of an IRA, made to an employee after separation from       
service after reaching age 55; or                                           

- Not greater than the amount allowable as a deduction to the employee for      
eligible medical expenses during the taxable year.                          

IN ADDITION, THE 10% PENALTY TAX DOES NOT APPLY TO A DISTRIBUTION FROM AN IRA   
THAT IS:                                                                        

- Made after separation from employment to an unemployed IRA owner for health   
insurance premiums, if certain conditions are met;                          

- Not in excess of the amount of certain qualifying higher education expenses,  
as defined by section 72(t)(7) of the Code; or                              

- A qualified first-time homebuyer distribution meeting the requirements        
specified at section 72(t)(8) of the Code.                                  

If you are a participant in a SIMPLE IRA plan, you should be aware that the 10% 
penalty tax is increased to 25% with respect

to non-exempt early distributions made from your SIMPLE IRA during the first two
years following the date you first commenced participation in any SIMPLE IRA    
plan of your employer.                                                          

(b) MINIMUM DISTRIBUTION PENALTY TAX If the amount distributed is less than the 
   minimum required distribution for the year, the Participant is subject to a
50% penalty tax on the amount that was not properly distributed.        

An individual's interest in a tax-qualified retirement plan generally must be   
distributed, or begin to be distributed, not later than the Required Beginning  
Date. Generally, the Required Beginning Date is April 1 of the calendar year    
following the later of:                                                         

- the calendar year in which the individual attains age 70 1/2; or              

- the calendar year in which the individual retires from service with the       
employer sponsoring the plan.                                               

The Required Beginning Date for an individual who is a five (5) percent owner   
(as defined in the Code), or who is the owner of an IRA, is April 1 of the      
calendar year following the calendar year in which the individual attains age   
70 1/2.                                                                         

The entire interest of the Participant must be distributed beginning no later   
than the Required Beginning Date over:                                          

- the life of the Participant or the lives of the Participant and the           
Participant's designated beneficiary; or                                    

- over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the Participant or  
 the joint life expectancy of the Participant and the Participant's designated
beneficiary.                                                                

Each annual distribution must equal or exceed a "minimum distribution amount"   
which is determined by dividing the account balance by the applicable life      
expectancy. This account balance is generally based upon the account value as of
the close of business on the last day of the previous calendar year. In         
addition, minimum distribution incidental benefit rules may require a larger    
annual distribution.                                                            

If an individual dies before reaching his or her Required Beginning Date, the   
individual's entire interest must generally be distributed within five years of 
the individual's death. However, this rule will be deemed satisfied, if         
distributions begin before the close of the calendar year following the         
individual's death to a designated beneficiary and distribution is over the life
of such designated beneficiary (or over a period not extending beyond the life  
expectancy of the beneficiary). If the beneficiary is the individual's surviving
spouse, distributions may be delayed until the individual would have attained   
age 70 1/2.                                                                     

If an individual dies after reaching his or her Required Beginning Date or after
distributions have commenced, the individual's interest must generally be       
distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution in effect at
the time of the individual's death.                                             

On January 17, 2001, the Internal Revenue Service published a new set of        
proposed regulations in the Federal Register relating to minimum required       
distributions. The discussion above does not take these new proposed regulations
into account. Please consult with your tax or legal adviser with any questions  
regarding the new proposed regulations.                                         

(c) WITHHOLDING In general, regular wage withholding rules apply to             
distributions from IRAs and plans described in section 457 of the Code. 
 Periodic distributions from other tax-qualified retirement plans that are
made for a specified period of 10 or more years or for the life or life 
 expectancy of the participant (or the joint lives or life expectancies of
    the participant and beneficiary) are generally subject to federal income tax
   withholding as if the recipient were married claiming three exemptions. The
recipient of periodic distributions may generally elect not to have     
 withholding apply or to have income taxes withheld at a different rate by
providing a completed election form.                                    

Mandatory federal income tax withholding at a flat rate of 20% will generally   
apply to other distributions from section 401 or 403(b) tax-qualified retirement
plans unless such distributions are:                                            

- the non-taxable portion of the distribution;                                  

- required minimum distributions; or                                            

- direct transfer distributions.                                                

Direct transfer distributions are direct payments to an IRA or to another       
eligible retirement plan under Code section 401(a)(31).                         

Certain states require withholding of state taxes when federal income tax is    
withheld.

prior to the Surrender. To determine the new Interest Accumulation Value, that  
total is then subtracted from the Interest Accumulation Value prior to the

EARNINGS PROTECTION BENEFIT EXAMPLES                                            
EXAMPLE 1                                                                       
Assume that:                                                                    

- You elected the Earnings Protection Benefit when you purchased your Contract, 

- You made a single Premium Payment of $100,000,                                

- On your fifth Contract anniversary, your Contract Value was $150,000,         

- On the day after your fifth Contract Anniversary, you made a partial Surrender
of $40,000,                                                                 

- On the day we calculate the Death Benefit, your Contract Value was $140,000,  

- The Contract Value on the date we calculate the Death Benefit plus 40% of the 
Contract gain was the greatest of the three death benefit calculations.     

ADJUSTMENT FOR PARTIAL SURRENDERS                                               

To calculate the Earnings Protection Benefit, we make an adjustment for partial 
Surrenders if the amount of a Surrender is greater than the Contract gain in the
Contract immediately prior to the Surrender. To determine if the partial        
Surrender is greater than the Contract gain:                                    

- Add the amount of the partial Surrender ($40,000) to                          

- The Contract Value on the date the Earnings Protection Benefit is added to    
your Contract ($100,000),                                                   

- Add Premium Payments made after the Earnings Protection Benefit is added to   
your Contract before you make the partial Surrender ($0),                   

- Subtract the Contract Value on the Valuation Day immediately before you make  
the partial Surrender ($150,000),                                           

- Subtract the sum of any prior adjustments for all prior partial Surrenders    
made after the Earnings Protection Benefit is added to your Contract ($0),  

Which equals -$10,000 which is less than zero, so there is no adjustment for the
partial Surrender in this case.                                                 

CALCULATION OF CONTRACT GAIN                                                    

So Hartford would calculate the Contract gain as follows:                       

- Contract Value on the date we receive proof of death ($140,000),              

- Subtract the Contract Value on the date the Earnings Protection Benefit was   
added to your Contract ($100,000),                                          

- Add any adjustments for partial Surrenders ($0),                              

So the Contract gain equals $40,000.                                            

CALCULATION OF EARNINGS PROTECTION BENEFIT CAP                                  

To determine if the cap applies:                                                

- Hartford calculates the Contract Value on the date the Earnings Protection    
Benefit was added to your Contract ($100,000),                              

- plus Premium Payments made since that date ($0),                              

- minus Premium Payments made in the 12 months prior to death ($0),             

- minus any adjustments for partial Surrenders ($0),                            

Which equals $100,000. The cap is 200% of $100,000 which is $200,000.           

DEATH BENEFIT WITH EARNINGS PROTECTION BENEFIT                                  

In this situation the cap does not apply, so Hartford takes 40% of $40,000 or   
$16,000 and adds that to the Contract Value on the date we receive proof of     
death and the total Death Benefit with the Earnings Protection Benefit is       
$156,000.

- On the day after your fifth Contract Anniversary, you made a partial Surrender
of $60,000,                                                                 

- On the day we calculate the Death Benefit, your Contract Value was $120,000,  

- The Contract Value on the date we calculate the Death Benefit plus 40% of the 
Contract gain was the greatest of the three death benefit calculations.     

ADJUSTMENT FOR PARTIAL SURRENDERS                                               

To calculate the Earnings Protection Benefit, we make an adjustment for partial 
Surrenders if the amount of a Surrender is greater than the Contract gain in the
Contract immediately prior to the Surrender. To determine if the partial        
Surrender is greater than the Contract gain:                                    

- Add the amount of the partial Surrender ($60,000) to                          

- The Contract Value on the date the Earnings Protection Benefit is added to    
your Contract ($100,000),                                                   

- Add Premium Payments made after the Earnings Protection Benefit is added to   
your Contract before you make the partial Surrender ($0),                   

- Subtract the Contract Value on the Valuation Day immediately before you make  
the partial Surrender ($150,000),                                           

- Subtract the sum of any prior adjustments for all prior partial Surrenders    
made after the Earnings Protection Benefit is added to your Contract ($0),  

Which equals +$10,000 which is greater than zero, so there is a $10,000         
adjustment for the partial Surrender in this case.                              

CALCULATION OF CONTRACT GAIN                                                    

So Hartford would calculate the Contract gain as follows:                       

- Contract Value on the date we receive proof of death ($120,000),              

- Subtract the Contract Value on the date the Earnings Protection Benefit was   
added to your Contract ($100,000),                                          

- Add any adjustments for partial Surrenders ($10,000),                         

So the Contract gain equals $30,000.                                            

CALCULATION OF EARNINGS PROTECTION BENEFIT CAP                                  

To determine if the cap applies:                                                

- Hartford calculates the Contract Value on the date the Earnings Protection    
Benefit was added to your Contract ($100,000),                              

- plus Premium Payments made since that date ($0),                              

- minus Premium Payments made in the 12 months prior to death ($0),             

- minus any adjustments for partial Surrenders ($10,000),                       

Which equals $90,000. The cap is 200% of $90,000 which is $180,000.             

DEATH BENEFIT WITH EARNINGS PROTECTION BENEFIT                                  

In this situation the cap does not apply, so Hartford takes 40% of $30,000 or   
$12,000 and adds that to the Contract Value on the date we receive proof of     
death and the total Death Benefit with the Earnings Protection Benefit is       
$132,000.

underlying fund shares held in each of the Sub-Accounts.                        

INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS 

The audited financial statements and financial statement schedules included in  
this registration statement have been audited by Arthur Andersen LLP,

NON-PARTICIPATING 

The Contract is non-participating and we pay no dividends.                      

MISSTATEMENT OF AGE OR SEX 

If an Annuitant's age or sex was misstated on the Contract, any Contract        
payments or benefits will be determined using the correct age and sex. If we    
have overpaid Annuity Payouts, an adjustment, including interest on the amount  
of the overpayment, will be

made to the next Annuity Payout or Payouts. If we have underpaid due to a       
misstatement of age or sex, we will credit the next Annuity Payout with the     
amount we underpaid and credit interest.                                        

PRINCIPAL UNDERWRITER 

Hartford Securities Distribution Company, Inc. ("HSD") serves as Principal      
Underwriter for the securities issued with respect to the Separate Account. HSD 
is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities  
Exchange Act of 1934 as a Broker-Dealer and is a member of the National         
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. HSD is an affiliate of ours. Both HSD   
and Hartford are ultimately controlled by The Hartford Financial Services Group,
Inc. The principal business address of HSD is the same as ours.                 

Hartford currently pays HSD underwriting commissions for its role as Principal  
Underwriter of all variable annuities associated with this Separate Account. For
the past three years, the aggregate dollar amount of underwriting commissions   
paid to HSD in its role as Principal Underwriter has been: 2000: $58,800,624;   
1999: $76,623,142; and 1998: $46,531,128.                                       

 PERFORMANCE RELATED INFORMATION

The Separate Account may advertise certain performance-related information      
concerning the Sub-Accounts. Performance information about a Sub-Account is     
based on the Sub-Account's past performance only and is no indication of future 
performance.                                                                    

TOTAL RETURN FOR ALL SUB-ACCOUNTS 

When a Sub-Account advertises its standardized total return, it will usually be 
calculated from the date of the inception of the Sub-Account for one, five and  
ten year periods or some other relevant periods if the Sub-Account has not been 
in existence for at least ten years. Total return is measured by comparing the  
value of an investment in the Sub-Account at the beginning of the relevant      
period to the value of the investment at the end of the period. To calculate    
standardized total return, Hartford uses a hypothetical initial premium payment 
of $1,000.00 and deducts for the mortality and risk expense charge, the highest 
possible contingent deferred charge, any applicable administrative charge and   
the Annual Maintenance Fee.                                                     

                                                                     n
The formula Hartford uses to calculate standardized total return is P(1+T) =    
ERV. In this calculation, "P" represents a hypothetical initial premium         
payment of $1,000.00, "T" represents the average annual total return, "n"       
represents the number of years and "ERV" represents the redeemable value at     
the end of the period.                                                          

4 

P-->49752nd "Page" of 108TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 52nd
In addition to the standardized total return, the Sub-Account may advertise a   
non-standardized total return. These figures will usually be calculated from the
date of inception of the underlying fund for one, five and ten year periods or  
other relevant periods. Non-standardized total return is measured in the same   
manner as the standardized total return described above, except that the        
contingent deferred sales charge and the Annual Maintenance Fee are not         
deducted. Therefore, non-standardized total return for a Sub-Account is higher  
than standardized total return for a Sub-Account.                               

YIELD FOR SUB-ACCOUNTS 

If applicable, the Sub-Accounts may advertise yield in addition to total return.
At any time in the future, yields may be higher or lower than past yields and   
past performance is no indication of future performance.                        

The standardized yield will be computed for periods beginning with the inception
of the Sub-Account in the following manner. The net investment income per       
Accumulation Unit earned during a one-month period is divided by the            
Accumulation Unit Value on the last day of the period. This figure reflects     
deductions for the mortality and expense risk charge, any applicable            
administrative charge and the Annual Maintenance Fee.                           

                                                             6
The formula Hartford uses to calculate yield is: YIELD = 2[(a-b/cd +1)  -1].    
In this calculation, "a" represents the net investment income earned during the 
period by the underlying fund, "b" represents the expenses accrued for the      
period, "c" represents the average daily number of Accumulation Units           
outstanding during the period and "d" represents the maximum offering price per 
Accumulation Unit on the last day of the period.                                

MONEY MARKET SUB-ACCOUNTS 

A money market fund Sub-Account may advertise yield and effective yield. Yield  
and effective yield figures reflect the deductions for the Contract, which      
include the mortality and expense risk charge, any applicable administrative    
charge and the Annual Maintenance Fee. At any time in the future, current and   
effective yields may be higher or lower than past yields and past performance is
no indication of future performance.                                            

Current yield of a money market fund Sub-Account is calculated for a seven-day  
period or the "base period" without taking into consideration any realized or   
unrealized gains or losses on shares of the underlying fund. The first step in  
determining yield is to compute the base period return. Hartford takes a        
hypothetical account with a balance of one Accumulation Unit of the Sub-Account 
and calculates the net change in its value from the beginning of the base period
to the end of the base period. Hartford then subtracts an amount equal to the   
total deductions for the Contract and then divides that number by the value     
of the account at the beginning of the base period. The result is               

5 

P-->49753rd "Page" of 108TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 53rd
the base period return or "BPR". Once the base period return is calculated,     
Hartford then multiplies it by 365/7 to compute the current yield. Current      
yield is calculated to the nearest hundredth of one percent.                    

The formula for this calculation is YIELD = BPR X (365/7), where BPR = (A-B)/C. 
"A" is equal to the net change in value of a hypothetical account with a balance
of one Accumulation Unit of the Sub-Account from the beginning of the base      
period to the end of the base period. "B" is equal to the amount that Hartford  
deducts for mortality and expense risk charge, any applicable administrative    
charge and the Annual Maintenance Fee. "C" represents the value of the          
Sub-Account at the beginning of the base period.                                

Effective yield is also calculated using the base period return. The            
effective yield is calculated by adding 1 to the base period return and         
raising that result to a power equal to 365 divided by 7 and subtracting        
1 from the result. The calculation Hartford uses is:                            
           365/7
EFFECTIVE YIELD = [(BASE PERIOD RETURN + 1)     ] - 1.                          

ADDITIONAL MATERIALS 

We may provide information on various topics to Contract Owners and prospective 
Contract Owners in advertising, sales literature or other materials. These      
topics may include the relationship between sectors of the economy and the      
economy as a whole and its effect on various securities markets, investment     
strategies and techniques (such as value investing, dollar cost averaging and   
asset allocation), the advantages and disadvantages of investing in tax-deferred
and taxable instruments, customer profiles and hypothetical purchase scenarios, 
financial management and tax and retirement planning, and other investment      
alternatives, including comparisons between the Contracts and the               
characteristics of and market for any alternatives.                             

PERFORMANCE COMPARISONS 

Each Sub-Account may from time to time include in advertisements the ranking of 
its performance figures compared with performance figures of other annuity      
contract's sub-accounts with the same investment objectives which are created by
Lipper Analytical Services, Morningstar, Inc. or other recognized ranking       
services.                                                                       

Hartford may also compare the performance of the Sub-Accounts against certain   
widely acknowledged outside standards or indices for stock and bond market      
performance, such as:                                                           

|X|  The Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Stock Price Index (the "S&P 500") is a 
stock market index that includes common stocks of 500 companies from  
     several industrial sectors representing a significant portion of the market
value of all stocks publicly

traded in the United States, most of which are traded on the New York 
Stock Exchange. Stocks in the S&P 500 are weighted according to       
  their market capitalization (the number of shares outstanding multiplied
by the stock's current price).                                        

|X|  The Nasdaq Composite Index measures all Nasdaq domestic and non-U.S. based 
    common stocks listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. The Index is market-value
weighted. This means that each company's security affects the Index in
proportion to its market value. The market value, the last sale price 
multiplied by total shares outstanding, is calculated throughout the  
 trading day, and is related to the total value of the Index. The Nasdaq
  Composite includes over 5,000 companies. On February 5, 1971, the Nasdaq
Composite Index began with a base of 100.00.                          

|X|  The Morgan Stanley Capital International EAFE Index (the "EAFE Index") of  
major markets in Europe, Australia and the Far East is a benchmark of 
international stock performance. The EAFE Index is "capitalization    
   weighted," which means that a company whose securities have a high market
    value will contribute proportionately more to the EAFE Index's performance
results than a company whose securities have a lower market value.    

|X|  The Lehman Brothers High Yield Corporate Index is a broad-based            
 market-value-weighted index that tracks the total return performance of
   non-investment grade, fixed-rate, publicly placed, dollar denominated and
nonconvertible debt registered with the SEC.                          

|X|  The Lehman Brothers Government/Corporate Bond Index is a broad based       
    unmanaged, market-value-weighted index of all debt obligations of the U.S.
Treasury and U.S. Government agencies (excluding mortgage-backed      
    securities) and all publicly-issued fixed-rate, nonconvertible, investment
grade domestic corporate debt.

TO HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY                                              
PUTNAM CAPITAL MANAGER TRUST SEPARATE ACCOUNT AND TO THE                        
OWNERS OF UNITS OF INTEREST THEREIN:                                          

We have audited the accompanying statements of assets and liabilities of        
Hartford Life Insurance Company Putnam Capital Manager Trust Separate Account   
(American Government Income, Asia Pacific Growth, Capital Appreciation,         
Diversified Income, The George Putnam Fund of Boston, Global Asset Allocation,  
Global Growth, Growth and Income, Growth Opportunities, Health Sciences, High   
Yield, Income, International Growth, International Growth and Income,           
International New Opportunities, Investors, Money Market, New Opportunities, New
Value, OTC & Emerging Growth, Research, Small Cap Value, Technology, Utilities  
Growth and Income, Vista, Voyager and Voyager II sub-accounts) (collectively,   
the Account), as of December 31, 2000, and the related statements of operations 
for the periods presented in the year then ended and the statements of changes  
in net assets for the periods presented in the two years then ended. These      
financial statements are the responsibility of the Account's management. Our    
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on  
our audits.                                                                     

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free  
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit    
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement       
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our     
opinion.                                                                        

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in   
all material respects, the financial position of the Account as of December 31,
2000, and the results of their operations and the changes in their net assets   
for the periods presented in conformity with accounting principles generally    
accepted in the United States.

PUTNAM CAPITAL MANAGER TRUST SEPARATE ACCOUNT                                 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY                                                 
NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                                   
DECEMBER 31, 2000 
1.  ORGANIZATION:                                                             

 Putnam Capital Manager Trust Separate Account (the Account) is a separate
   investment account within Hartford Life Insurance Company (the Company) and
 is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a unit
   investment trust under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Both
    the Company and the Account are subject to supervision and regulation by the
    Department of Insurance of the State of Connecticut and the SEC. The Account
 invests deposits by variable annuity contractowners of the Company in the
various mutual funds (the Funds) as directed by the contractowners.     

2.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES:                                          

The following is a summary of significant accounting policies of the    
Account, which are in accordance with generally accepted accounting     
principles in the investment company industry:                          

a) SECURITY TRANSACTIONS--Security transactions are recorded on the trade 
date (date the order to buy or sell is executed). Realized gains and
     losses on the sales of securities are computed on the basis of identified
      cost of the fund shares sold. Dividend and capital gains income is accrued
as of the ex-dividend date. Capital gains income represents those   
   dividends from the Funds which are characterized as capital gains under
tax regulations.                                                    

 b) SECURITY VALUATION--The investments in shares of the Funds are valued at
  the closing net asset value per share as determined by the appropriate
Fund as of December 31, 2000.                                       

   c) UNIT TRANSACTIONS--Unit transactions are executed based on the unit values
  calculated at the close of the business day. All unit transactions are
executed at fair value.                                             

  d) SECURITY CLASS--Putnam Variable Trust consists of a series of funds, each
     of which is represented by a separate series of class IA shares and class
IB shares.                                                          

   Class IA shares are offered at net asset value and are not subject to a
distribution fee. Class IA 40% are for Company employees only.      

Class IB shares are offered at net asset value and pay an ongoing   
distribution fee.                                                   

e) FEDERAL INCOME TAXES--The operations of the Account form a part of, and
     are taxed with, the total operations of the Company, which is taxed as an
    insurance company under the Internal Revenue Code. Under current law, no
  federal income taxes are payable with respect to the operations of the
Account.                                                            

f) USE OF ESTIMATES--The preparation of financial statements in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States  
 requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
      reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial
 statements and the reported amounts of income and expenses during the
period. Operating results in the future could vary from the amounts 
derived from management's estimates.                                

3.  ADMINISTRATION OF THE ACCOUNT AND RELATED CHARGES:                        

a) MORTALITY AND EXPENSE UNDERTAKINGS--The Company, as issuer of variable 
   annuity contracts, provides the mortality and expense undertakings and,
      with respect to the Account, receives a maximum annual fee of 1.50% of the
Account's average daily net assets.                                 

b) DEDUCTION OF OTHER FEES--Annual maintenance fees are deducted through  
      termination of units of interest from applicable contractowners' accounts,
     in accordance with the terms of the contracts. In addition, certain other
      charges may apply based on the characteristics of the underlying contract.
      These charges are reflected in surrenders for benefit payments and fees on
the accompanying statements of changes in net assets.               

 c) COST OF INSURANCE--In accordance with terms of the policies, the Company
     assesses deductions for costs of insurance charges to cover the Company's
   anticipated mortality costs. Because a policy's account value and death
   benefit may vary from month to month, the cost of insurance charges may

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS
----------------------------------------------------

To Hartford Life Insurance Company:                                             

We have audited the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets of Hartford Life   
Insurance Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the    
related Consolidated Statements of Income, Changes in Stockholder's Equity and  
Cash Flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2000.   
These Consolidated Financial Statements and the schedules referred to below are 
the responsibility of Hartford Life Insurance Company's management. Our         
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and       
schedules based on our audits.                                                  

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free  
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit    
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement       
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our     
opinion.                                                                        

In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements referred to above present 
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Hartford Life       
Insurance Company and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, and the    
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in 
the period ended December 31, 2000 in conformity with accounting principles     
generally accepted in the United States.                                        

Our audits were made for the purpose of forming an opinion on the basic         
financial statements taken as a whole. The schedules listed in the Index to     
Consolidated Financial Statements and Schedules are presented for the purpose of
complying with the Securities and Exchange Commission's rules and are not part  
of the basic financial statements. These schedules have been subjected to the   
auditing procedures applied in the audits of the basic financial statements and,
in our opinion, fairly state in all material respects the financial data        
required to be set forth therein in relation to the basic financial statements  
taken as a whole.                                                               

Hartford, Connecticut

  In 1999, the Company's parent, Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company, recaptured an
   in force block of individual life insurance previously ceded to the Company. This        
   commutation resulted in a reduction in the Company's assets of $666, consisting of $556  
   of invested assets, $99 of deferred policy acquisition costs and $11 of other assets.    
   Liabilities decreased $650, consisting of $543 of other policyholder funds, $60 of future
   policy benefits and $47 of other liabilities. As a result, the Company recognized an     
   after-tax loss relating to this transaction of $16.                                      

  In 1998, due to the recapture of an in force block of business previously ceded to MBL    
   Life Assurance Co. of New Jersey, reinsurance recoverables of $4,753 were exchanged for  
   the fair value of assets comprised of $4,310 in policy loans and $443 in other net       
   assets.

HARTFORD LIFE INSURANCE COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES 
NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS                                      
(DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED)      

----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

1. ORGANIZATION AND DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS                                     

These Consolidated Financial Statements include Hartford Life Insurance Company 
and its wholly-owned subsidiaries ("Hartford Life Insurance Company" or the     
"Company"), Hartford Life and Annuity Insurance Company ("HLAI"), Hartford      
International Life Reassurance Corporation ("HLRe") and Servus Life Insurance   
Company, formerly Royal Life Insurance Company of America. The Company is a     
wholly-owned subsidiary of Hartford Life and Accident Insurance Company ("HLA"),
a wholly-owned subsidiary of Hartford Life, Inc. ("Hartford Life"). Hartford    
Life is a direct subsidiary of Hartford Fire Insurance Company ("Hartford       
Fire"), a direct subsidiary of The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. ("The
Hartford"). In November 1998, Hartford Life Insurance Company transferred in the
form of a dividend, Hartford Financial Services, LLC and its subsidiaries to    
HLA.                                                                            

Pursuant to an initial public offering (the "IPO") on May 22, 1997, Hartford    
Life sold to the public 26 million shares of Class A Common Stock at $28.25 per 
share and received proceeds, net of offering expenses, of $687. The 26 million  
shares sold in the IPO represented approximately 18.6% of the equity ownership  
in Hartford Life. On June 27, 2000, The Hartford acquired all of the outstanding
common shares of Hartford Life not already owned by The Hartford (The Hartford  
Acquisition). As a result of The Hartford Acquisition, Hartford Life became a   
direct subsidiary of Hartford Fire.                                             

Along with its parent, HLA, the Company is a leading financial services and     
insurance group which provides (a) investment products, such as individual      
variable annuities and fixed market value adjusted annuities, mutual funds and  
retirement plan services for savings and retirement needs; (b) individual life  
insurance for income protection and estate planning; (c) group benefits products
such as group life and group disability insurance that is directly written by   
the Company and is substantially ceded to its parent, HLA, and (d) corporate    
owned life insurance.                                                           

2. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES                                   
(a) BASIS OF PRESENTATION                                                       

These Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared on the basis of accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States, which differ materially from
the statutory accounting practices prescribed by various insurance regulatory   
authorities. All material intercompany transactions and balances between        
Hartford Life Insurance Company and its subsidiaries have been eliminated.      

The preparation of financial statements, in conformity with accounting          
principles generally accepted in the United States, requires management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and        
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of  
the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses      
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.  
The most significant estimates include those used in determining deferred policy
acquisition costs and the liability for future policy benefits and other        
policyholder funds. Although some variability is inherent in these estimates,   
management believes the amounts provided are adequate.                          

Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year financial information to 
conform to the current year presentation.                                       

(b) ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS                                        

Effective January 1, 2000, Hartford Life Insurance Company adopted Statement of 
Position (SOP) No. 98-7, "Accounting for Insurance and Reinsurance Contracts    
That Do Not Transfer Insurance Risk". This SOP provides guidance on the method  
of accounting for insurance and reinsurance contracts that do not transfer      
insurance risk, defined in the SOP as the deposit method. Adoption of this SOP  
did not have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results  
of operations.                                                                  

In December 1999, the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission issued    
Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 101, "Revenue Recognition in Financial      
Statements". SAB 101 provides that if registrants have not applied the          
accounting therein, they should implement the SAB and report a change in        
accounting principle. SAB 101, as subsequently amended, became effective for the
Company in the fourth quarter of 2000. The adoption of SAB 101 did not have a   
material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.  

Effective January 1, 1999, Hartford Life Insurance Company adopted SOP No. 98-1,
"Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for        
Internal Use". This SOP provides guidance on accounting for costs of internal   
use software and in determining whether software is for internal use. The SOP   
defines internal use software as software that is acquired, internally          
developed, or modified solely to meet internal needs and identifies stages of   
software development and accounting for the related costs incurred during the   
stages. Adoption of this SOP did not have a material impact on the Company's    
financial condition or results of operations.                                   

Effective January 1, 1999, Hartford Life Insurance Company adopted SOP No. 97-3,
"Accounting by Insurance and Other Enterprises for Insurance-Related            
Assessments". This SOP addresses accounting by insurance and other enterprises  
for assessments related to insurance activities

including recognition, measurement and disclosure of guaranty fund or other     
assessments. Adoption of this SOP did not have a material impact on the         
Company's financial condition or results of operations.                         

(c) FUTURE ADOPTION OF NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS                                 

In October 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued         
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 140, "Accounting for     
Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of              
Liabilities -- a Replacement of FASB Statement No. 125". SFAS No. 140 revises   
the criteria for accounting for certain transfers of financial assets and the   
reporting and disclosure requirements for collateral arrangements.              
Implementation of the accounting provisions of SFAS No. 140 is not expected to  
have a material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of       
operations.                                                                     

In July 2000, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) reached consensus on Issue  
No. 99-20, "Recognition of Interest Income and Impairment on Certain            
Investments". This pronouncement requires investors in certain asset-backed     
securities to record changes in their estimated yield on a prospective basis and
to evaluate these securities for an other-than-temporary decline in value. This 
consensus is effective for financial statements with fiscal quarters beginning  
after March 15, 2001. Adoption of EITF No. 99-20 is not expected to have a      
material impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations.  

In June 2000, the FASB issued SFAS No. 138, "Accounting for Certain Derivative  
Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities", which amended SFAS No. 133,        
"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities". SFAS No. 133    
established accounting and reporting requirements for derivative instruments,   
including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts. SFAS No.  
133 requires, among other things, that all derivatives be carried on the balance
sheet at fair value. SFAS No. 133 also specifies hedge accounting criteria under
which a derivative can qualify for special accounting. SFAS No. 138 amended SFAS
No. 133 so that for interest rate hedges, a company may designate as the hedged 
risk the risk of changes only in a benchmark interest rate. Also, credit risk is
newly defined as the company-specific spread over the benchmark interest rate   
and may be hedged separately from, or in combination with, the benchmark        
interest rate. Initial application of SFAS No. 133, as amended, for Hartford    
Life Insurance Company began January 1, 2001. Implementation of SFAS No. 133, as
amended, is expected to result in a cumulative transition adjustment charge of  
$3 after-tax. However, the FASB's Derivative Implementation Group continues to  
deliberate on multiple issues, the resolution of which could have a significant 
impact on the Company's expectations.                                           

(d) REVENUE RECOGNITION                                                         

Fee income for investment and universal life-type contracts consists of policy  
charges for policy administration, cost of insurance charges and surrender      
charges assessed against policyholders' account balances and are recognized in  
the period in which services are provided. Premiums for traditional life        
insurance are recognized as revenues when due from policyholders. Retrospective 
and contingent commissions and other related expenses are incurred and recorded 
in the same period that the retrospective premiums are recorded or other        
contract provisions are met.                                                    

(e) DIVIDENDS TO POLICYHOLDERS                                                  

Policyholder dividends are accrued using an estimate of the amount to be paid   
based on underlying contractual obligations under participating policies and    
applicable state laws. If limitations exist on the amount of net income from    
participating life insurance contracts that may be distributed to stockholders, 
the policyholders' share of net income on those contracts that cannot be        
distributed is excluded from stockholder's equity by a charge to operations and 
a credit to a liability.                                                        

Participating life insurance in force accounted for 18%, 24% and 25% as of      
December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, of total life insurance in      
force. Dividends to policyholders were $67, $104 and $329 for the years ended   
December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. There were no additional amounts
of income allocated to participating policyholders.                             

(f) INVESTMENTS                                                                 

Hartford Life Insurance Company's investments in both fixed maturities, which   
include bonds, redeemable preferred stock and commercial paper, and equity      
securities, which include common and non-redeemable preferred stocks, are       
classified as "available for sale" in accordance with SFAS No. 115, "Accounting 
for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities". Accordingly, these      
securities are carried at fair value with the after-tax difference from cost    
reflected in stockholder's equity as a component of accumulated other           
comprehensive income. Policy loans are carried at outstanding balance which     
approximates fair value. Other invested assets primarily consist of partnership 
investments, which are accounted for by the equity method, and mortgage loans,  
whereby the carrying value approximates fair value.                             

Net realized capital gains (losses) on security transactions associated with the
Company's immediate participation guaranteed contracts are recorded and         
effectively offset by amounts owed to policyholders and were $(9), $2 and $8 for
the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Under the terms 
of the contracts, the realized gains and losses will be credited to             
policyholders in future years as they are entitled to receive them. Net realized
capital gains and losses, excluding those related to immediate participation    
guaranteed contracts, are reported as a component of revenue and are determined 
on a specific identification basis.                                             

The Company's accounting policy for impairment requires recognition of an other 
than temporary impairment charge on a security if it is determined that the     
Company is unable to recover all amounts due under the contractual obligations  
of the security. In addition, for securities                                    

F-7 

P-->49793rd "Page" of 108TOC1stPreviousNext↓BottomJust 93rd
expected to be sold, an other than temporary impairment charge is recognized if 
the Company does not expect the fair value of a security to recover to cost or  
amortized cost prior to the expected date of sale. Once an impairment charge has
been recorded, the Company then continues to review the other than temporarily  
impaired securities for appropriate valuation on an ongoing basis.              

(g) DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS                                                      

HEDGE ACCOUNTING -- Hartford Life Insurance Company uses a variety of derivative
instruments, including swaps, caps, floors, forwards and exchange traded futures
and options in compliance with Company policy and in order to achieve one of    
three Company approved objectives: to hedge risk arising from interest rate,    
price or currency exchange rate volatility; to manage liquidity; or to control  
transaction costs. The Company is considered an end user of derivative          
instruments and as such does not make a market or trade in these instruments for
the express purpose of earning trading profits. Hartford Life Insurance         
Company's accounting for derivative instruments used to manage risk is in       
accordance with the concepts established in SFAS No. 80, "Accounting for Futures
Contracts", SFAS No. 52, "Foreign Currency Translation", American Institute of  
Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Issue Paper No. 86-2, "Accounting for      
Options" and various Emerging Issues Task Force pronouncements. Written options 
are used, in all cases in conjunction with other assets and derivatives, as part
of the Company's asset and liability management strategy. Derivative instruments
are carried at values consistent with the asset or liability being hedged.      
Derivative instruments used to hedge fixed maturities or equity securities are  
carried at fair value with the after-tax difference from cost reflected in      
stockholder's equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income.  
Derivative instruments used to hedge other invested assets or liabilities are   
carried at cost. For a discussion of SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative   
Instruments and Hedging Activities", issued in June 1998, see (c) Future        
Adoption of New Accounting Standards. Initial application of SFAS No. 133, as   
amended, for Hartford Life Insurance Company began in the first quarter of 2001.

Derivative instruments must be designated at inception as a hedge and measured  
for effectiveness both at inception and on an ongoing basis. Hartford Life      
Insurance Company's correlation threshold for hedge designation is 80% to 120%. 
If correlation, which is assessed monthly or quarterly and measured based on a  
rolling three month average, falls outside the 80% to 120% range, hedge         
accounting will be terminated. Derivative instruments used to create a synthetic
asset must meet synthetic accounting criteria, including designation at         
inception and consistency of terms between the synthetic and the instrument     
being replicated. Consistent with industry practice, synthetic instruments are  
accounted for like the financial instrument they are intended to replicate.     
Derivative instruments which fail to meet risk management criteria are marked to
market with the impact reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income.      

FUTURES -- Gains or losses on financial futures contracts entered into in       
anticipation of the investment of future receipt of product cash flows are      
deferred and, at the time of the ultimate investment purchase, reflected as an  
adjustment to the cost basis of the purchased asset. Gains or losses on futures 
used in invested asset risk management are deferred and adjusted into the cost  
basis of the hedged asset when the contract futures are closed, except for      
futures used in duration hedging, which are deferred and basis adjusted on a    
quarterly basis. The basis adjustments are amortized into net investment income 
over the remaining asset life.                                                  

FORWARD COMMITMENTS -- Open forward commitment contracts are marked to market   
through stockholder's equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive  
income. Such contracts are accounted for at settlement by recording the purchase
of the specified securities at the previously committed price. Gains or losses  
resulting from the termination of forward commitment contracts are recognized   
immediately in the Consolidated Statements of Income as a component of net      
investment income.                                                              

OPTIONS -- The cost of options entered into as part of a risk management        
strategy are basis adjusted to the underlying asset or liability and amortized  
over the remaining life of the option. Gains or losses on expiration or         
termination are adjusted into the basis of the underlying asset or liability and
amortized over the remaining asset life.                                        

INTEREST RATE SWAPS -- Interest rate swaps involve the periodic exchange of     
payments without the exchange of underlying principal or notional amounts. Net  
receipts or payments are accrued and recognized over the life of the swap       
agreement as an adjustment to investment income. Should the swap be terminated, 
the gain or loss is adjusted into the basis of the asset or liability and       
amortized over the remaining life. Should the hedged asset be sold or liability 
terminated without terminating the swap position, any swap gains or losses are  
immediately recognized in earnings. Interest rate swaps purchased in            
anticipation of an asset purchase (anticipatory transaction) are recognized     
consistent with the underlying asset components such that the settlement        
component is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income while the      
change in market value is recognized as an unrealized capital gain or loss.     

INTEREST RATE CAPS AND FLOORS -- Premiums paid on purchased cap or floor        
agreements and the premium received on issued cap or floor agreements (used for 
risk management) are adjusted into the basis of the applicable asset or         
liability and amortized over the asset life or liability life. Gains or losses  
on termination of such positions are adjusted into the basis of the asset or    
liability and amortized over the remaining asset or liability life. Net payments
are recognized as an adjustment to income or basis adjusted and amortized       
depending on the specific hedge strategy.                                       

FORWARD EXCHANGE AND CURRENCY SWAPS CONTRACTS -- Forward exchange contracts and 
foreign currency swaps

are accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 52. Changes in the spot rate of   
instruments designated as hedges of the net investment in a foreign subsidiary  
are reflected in stockholder's equity as a component of accumulated other       
comprehensive income.                                                           

(h) SEPARATE ACCOUNTS                                                           

Hartford Life Insurance Company maintains separate account assets and           
liabilities which are reported at fair value. Separate account assets are       
segregated from other investments, and investment income and gains and losses   
accrue directly to the policyholders. Separate accounts reflect two categories  
of risk assumption: non-guaranteed separate accounts, wherein the policyholder  
assumes substantially all the investment risk and rewards, and guaranteed       
separate accounts, wherein the Company contractually guarantees either a minimum
return or account value to the policyholder.                                    

(i) DEFERRED POLICY ACQUISITION COSTS                                           

Policy acquisition costs, which include commissions and certain other expenses  
associated with acquiring business, are deferred and amortized over the         
estimated lives of the contracts, usually 20 years. Generally, acquisition costs
are deferred and amortized using the retrospective deposit method. Under the    
retrospective deposit method, acquisition costs are amortized in proportion to  
the present value of expected gross profits from investment, mortality and      
expense margins and surrender charges. Actual gross profits can vary from       
management's estimates, resulting in increases or decreases in the rate of      
amortization. Management periodically reviews these estimates and evaluates the 
recoverability of the deferred acquisition cost asset. When appropriate,        
management revises its assumptions on the estimated gross profits of these      
contracts and the cumulative amortization for the books of business are         
re-estimated and adjusted by a cumulative charge or credit to income.           

Acquisition costs and their related deferral are included in the Company's      
insurance expenses and other as follows:

(j) FUTURE POLICY BENEFITS                                                      
Liabilities for future policy benefits are computed by the net level premium    
method using interest rate assumptions varying from 3% to 11% and withdrawal and
mortality assumptions appropriate at the time the policies were issued.         

(k) OTHER POLICYHOLDER FUNDS                                                    
Other policyholder funds include reserves for investment contracts without life 
contingencies, corporate owned life insurance and universal life insurance      
contracts. Of the amounts included in other policyholder funds, $14.9 billion   
and $16.0 billion for the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, 
represent policyholder obligations.                                             
The liability for policy benefits for universal life-type contracts is equal to 
the balance that accrues to the benefit of policyholders, including credited    
interest, amounts that have been assessed to compensate the Company for services
to be performed over future periods, and any amounts previously assessed against
policyholders that are refundable on termination of the contract. For investment
contracts, policyholder liabilities are equal to the accumulated policy account 
values, which consist of an accumulation of deposit payments plus credited      
interest, less withdrawals and amounts assessed through the end of the period.

The amortized cost and estimated fair value of fixed maturity investments as of 
December 31, 2000 by estimated maturity year are shown below. Expected          
maturities differ from contractual maturities due to call or prepayment         
provisions. Asset backed securities, including mortgage backed securities and   
collateralized mortgage obligations, are distributed to maturity year based on  
the Company's estimates of the rate of future prepayments of principal over the 
remaining lives of the securities. These estimates are developed using

(g) CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK                                                
The Company is not exposed to any concentration of credit risk in fixed         
maturities of a single issuer greater than 10% of stockholder's equity.         

(h) DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS                                                      

Hartford Life Insurance Company utilizes a variety of derivative instruments,   
including swaps, caps, floors, forwards and exchange traded futures and options,
in compliance with Company policy and in order to achieve one of three Company  
approved objectives: to hedge risk arising from interest rate, price or currency
exchange rate volatility; to manage liquidity; or, to control transactions      
costs. The Company utilizes derivative instruments to manage market risk through
four principal risk management strategies: hedging anticipated transactions,    
hedging liability instruments, hedging invested assets and hedging portfolios of
assets and/or liabilities. The Company is considered an end user of derivative  
instruments and, as such, does not make a market or trade in these instruments  
for the express purpose of earning trading profits.                             

The Company maintains a derivatives counterparty exposure policy which          
establishes market based credit limits, favors long-term financial stability and
creditworthiness, and typically requires credit enhancement/credit risk reducing
agreements. Credit risk is measured as the amount owed to the Company based on  
current market conditions and potential payment obligations between the Company 
and its counterparties. Credit exposures are generally quantified weekly and    
netted, and collateral is pledged to or held by the Company to the extent the   
current value of derivatives exceed exposure policy thresholds.                 

The Company's derivative program is monitored by an internal compliance unit and
is reviewed by senior management. Notional amounts, which represent the basis   
upon which pay or receive amounts are calculated and are not reflective of      
credit risk, pertaining to derivative financial instruments (excluding the      
Company's guaranteed separate account derivative investments, see Note 5),      
totaled $3.7 billion and $5.5 billion ($3.0 billion and $3.9 billion related to 
the Company's investments and $661 and $1.6 billion related to Company's        
liabilities) as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.                    

The tables below provide a summary of derivative instruments held by Hartford   
Life Insurance Company as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, segregated by major    
investment and liability category:

    (1) As of December 31, 2000 and 1999, 100% of the notional futures contracts
mature within one year.                                                         

(2) As of December 31, 2000, no foreign currency swaps mature within one
year. As of December 31, 1999, approximately 28% of foreign currency swaps were 
scheduled to mature within one year. In years 2007 to 2009, 80% of the notional 
value will mature.                                                              

  (3) Deferred gains and losses on anticipatory transactions are included in
the carrying value of fixed maturities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. At   
the time of the ultimate purchase, they are reflected as a basis adjustment to  
the purchased asset. As of December 31, 2000, the Company had $0.2 of net       
deferred gains for futures contracts. The Company expects the anticipatory      
transaction to occur in the first quarter of 2001 and the entire $0.2 of net    
deferred gains will be amortized into income as a hedge of a forecasted         
transaction. As of December 31, 1999, the Company had $1.4 of net deferred      
losses for futures contracts and interest rate swaps which were basis adjusted  
in 2000.

At December 31, 2000, Hartford Life Insurance Company had accepted collateral   
consisting primarily of U.S. Government securities with a fair value of $252.   
While the Company is permitted by contract to sell or repledge the collateral   
accepted, none of the collateral has been sold or repledged at December 31,
2000. As of December 31, 2000, all collateral accepted was held in separate     
custodial accounts.                                                             

4. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS                                          

SFAS No. 107 "Disclosure about Fair Value of Financial Instruments", requires   
disclosure of fair value information of financial instruments. For certain      
financial instruments where quoted market prices are not available, other       
independent valuation techniques and assumptions are used. Because considerable 
judgment is used, these estimates are not necessarily indicative of amounts that
could be realized in a current market exchange. SFAS No. 107 excludes certain   
financial instruments from disclosure, including insurance contracts other than 
financial guarantees and investment contracts. Hartford Life Insurance Company  
uses the following methods and assumptions in estimating the fair value of each 
class of financial instrument.                                                  

Fair value for fixed maturities and marketable equity securities approximates   
those quotations published by applicable stock exchanges or received from other 
reliable sources.                                                               

For policy loans, carrying amounts approximate fair value.                      

Fair value of other investments, which primarily consist of partnership         
investments, is based on external market valuations from partnership management.
Other investments also include mortgage loans, whereby the carrying value       
approximates fair value.                                                        

Other policyholder funds fair value information is determined by estimating     
future cash flows, discounted at the current market rate.                       

The fair value of derivative financial instruments, including swaps, caps,      
floors, futures, options and forward commitments, is determined using a pricing 
model which is similar to external valuation models. Derivative instruments are 
reported below as a component of other investments.                             

The carrying amount and fair values of Hartford Life Insurance Company's        
financial instruments as of December 31, 2000 and 1999 were as follows:

Hartford Life Insurance Company maintained separate account assets and          
liabilities totaling $113.7 billion and $110.4 billion as of December 31, 2000  
and 1999, respectively, which are reported at fair value. Separate account      
assets, which are segregated from other investments, reflect two categories of  
risk assumption: non-guaranteed separate accounts totaling $104.1 billion and   
$101.7 billion as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, wherein the      
policyholder assumes substantially all the investment risks and rewards, and    
guaranteed separate accounts totaling $9.6 and $8.7 billion as of December 31,
2000 and 1999, respectively, wherein Hartford Life Insurance Company            
contractually guarantees either a minimum return or account value to the        
policyholder. Included in non-guaranteed separate account

assets were policy loans totaling $697 and $860 as of December 31, 2000 and     
1999, respectively. Net investment income (including net realized capital gains 
and losses) and interest credited to policyholders on separate account assets   
are not reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Income.                     

Separate account management fees and other revenues were $1.3 billion, $1.1     
billion, and $908 in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. The guaranteed separate 
accounts include fixed market value adjusted (MVA) individual annuities and     
modified guaranteed life insurance. The average credited interest rate on these 
contracts was 6.6% and 6.5% as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The 
assets that support these liabilities were comprised of $9.4 billion and $8.7   
billion in fixed maturities as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively, and 
$0.2 billion of other invested assets as of December 31, 2000. The portfolios   
are segregated from other investments and are managed to minimize liquidity and 
interest rate risk. In order to minimize the risk of disintermediation          
associated with early withdrawals, fixed MVA annuity and modified guaranteed    
life insurance contracts carry a graded surrender charge as well as a market    
value adjustment. Additional investment risk is hedged using a variety of       
derivatives which totaled $3 and $(96) in carrying value and $3.5 billion and   
$2.0 billion in notional amounts as of December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.

6. STATUTORY RESULTS

                                 For the years ended December 31,  
                               ------------------------------------
                                2000           1999           1998

Statutory net income           $  283         $  151         $  211

Statutory capital and surplus  $1,972         $1,905         $1,676
                               ------------------------------------

A significant percentage of the consolidated statutory surplus is permanently   
reinvested or is subject to various state regulatory restrictions which limit   
the payment of dividends without prior approval. The total amount of statutory  
dividends which may be paid by the insurance subsidiaries of the Company in     
2001, without prior regulatory approval, is estimated to be $303.               

Hartford Life Insurance Company and its domestic insurance subsidiaries prepare 
their statutory financial statements in accordance with accounting practices    
prescribed by the applicable state of domicile. Prescribed statutory accounting 
practices include publications of the National Association of Insurance         
Commissioners (NAIC), as well as state laws, regulations and general            
administrative rules.                                                           

The NAIC adopted the Codification of Statutory Accounting Principles            
(Codification) in March 1998. The effective date for the statutory accounting   
guidance is January 1, 2001. Each of Hartford Life Insurance Company's          
domiciliary states has adopted Codification and the Company has made the        
necessary changes in its statutory reporting required for implementation. The   
Company has determined that the overall impact of applying the new guidance will
result in a one-time statutory cumulative transition benefit of approximately   
$50 in statutory surplus.                                                       

7. STOCK COMPENSATION PLANS                                                     

Hartford Life's employees are included in The Hartford 2000 Incentive Stock Plan
and The Hartford Employee Stock Purchase Plan. Prior to The Hartford            
Acquisition, eligible employees of Hartford Life were included in Hartford      
Life's stock based compensation plans, the 1997 Hartford Life, Inc. Incentive   
Stock Plan and the Hartford Life, Inc. Employee Stock Purchase Plan. As a result
of the The Hartford Acquisition, all eligible participants of Hartford Life's   
stock based compensation plans were converted to The Hartford's stock based     
compensation plans. For the year ended December 31, 2000, Hartford Life         
Insurance Company's compensation expense related to The Hartford's two stock    
based compensation plans and Hartford Life's two stock based compensation plans 
was not material to Hartford Life Insurance Company's results of operations. For
the years ended December 31, 1999 and 1998, Hartford Life Insurance Company's   
compensation expense related to Hartford Life's two stock based compensation    
plans was not material.                                                         

8. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT AND SAVINGS PLANS                                     
(a) PENSION PLANS                                                               

Hartford Life's employees are included in The Hartford's non-contributory       
defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance       
benefit plans. Defined benefit pension expense, allocated by The Hartford to    
Hartford Life Insurance Company, was $5 in 2000, $6 in both 1999 and 1998.      
Postretirement health care and life insurance benefits expense, allocated by The
Hartford, was not material to the results of operations for 2000, 1999 and 1998.

(b) INVESTMENT AND SAVINGS PLAN                                                 

Substantially all Hartford Life's U.S. employees are eligible to participate in 
The Hartford's Investment and Savings Plan. The cost to Hartford Life Insurance 
Company for this plan was approximately $5 in 2000 and $4 in both 1999 and 1998.

9. REINSURANCE                                                                  

Hartford Life Insurance Company cedes insurance to other insurers in order to   
limit its maximum losses. Such transfer does not relieve Hartford Life Insurance
Company of its primary liability and, as such, failure of reinsurers to honor   
their

obligations could result in losses to Hartford Life Insurance Company. Hartford 
Life Insurance Company reduces this risk by evaluating the financial condition  
of reinsurers and monitoring for possible concentrations of credit risk. As of  
December 31, 2000, Hartford Life Insurance Company had no significant           
concentrations of credit risk related to reinsurance.                           

The Company records a receivable for reinsured benefits paid and the portion of 
insurance liabilities that are reinsured. The cost of reinsurance related to    
long-duration contracts is accounted for over the life of the underlying        
reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for  
the underlying policies. Reinsurance recoveries on ceded reinsurance contracts  
recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Income were $578, $397 and $300 for
the years ended December 31, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Hartford Life   
Insurance Company also assumes insurance from other insurers.                   

The effect of reinsurance on fee income, earned premiums and other is summarized
as follows:

Hartford Life Insurance Company maintains certain reinsurance agreements with   
HLA, whereby the Company cedes both group life and group accident and health    
risk. Under these treaties, the Company ceded group life premium of $101, $119  
and $132 in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively, and accident and health premium  
of $429, $430 and $379, respectively, to HLA.                                   

Pursuant to a reinsurance agreement dating back to 1992, the Company assumed    
100% of certain blocks of individual life insurance from HLA. Under this        
reinsurance agreement Hartford Life Insurance Company assumed $9 and $13 of     
premium from HLA in 1999 and 1998, respectively. On December 1, 1999, HLA       
recaptured this in force block of individual life insurance previously ceded to 
the Company. This commutation resulted in a reduction in the Company's assets of
$666, consisting of $556 of invested assets, $99 of deferred policy acquisition 
costs and $11 of other assets. Liabilities decreased $650, consisting of $543 of
other policyholder funds, $60 of future policy benefits and $47 of other        
liabilities. As a result, the Company recognized an after-tax loss relating to  
this transaction of $16.                                                        

In 1998, Hartford Life recaptured an in force block of Corporate Owned Life     
Insurance (COLI) business previously ceded to MBL Assurance Co. of New Jersey   
(MBL Life). The transaction was consummated through an assignment of a          
reinsurance arrangement between Hartford Life Insurance Company and MBL Life to 
a Hartford Life Insurance Company subsidiary. Hartford Life Insurance Company   
originally assumed the life insurance block in 1992 from Mutual Benefit Life,   
which was placed in court-supervised rehabilitation in 1991, and reinsured a    
portion of those policies back to MBL Life. This recapture was effective        
January 1, 1998 and resulted in a decrease in ceded premiums and other          
considerations of $163 in 1998. Additionally, this transaction resulted in a    
decrease in reinsurance recoverables of $4.8 billion, which was exchanged for   
the fair value of assets comprised of $4.3 billion in policy loans and $443 in  
other net assets.                                                               

10. INCOME TAX                                                                  

Hartford Life and The Hartford have entered into a tax sharing agreement under  
which each member in the consolidated U.S. federal income tax return will make  
payments between them such that, with respect to any period, the amount of taxes
to be paid by the Company, subject to certain adjustments, generally will be    
determined as though the Company were filing separate federal, state and local  
income tax returns.                                                             

As long as The Hartford continues to own at least 80% of the combined voting    
power of the value of the outstanding capital stock of the Company, the Company 
will be included in The Hartford's consolidated federal income tax return. The  
life insurance companies filed a separate consolidated federal income tax return
for 1999 and 1998. The Company's effective tax rate was 28% in 2000 and 35% in  
both 1999 and 1998, respectively.                                               

Income tax expense (benefit) is as follows:

Hartford Life Insurance Company had a current tax receivable of $96 and $56 as  
of December 31, 2000 and 1999, respectively.                                    

Prior to the Tax Reform Act of 1984, the Life Insurance Company Income Tax Act  
of 1959 permitted the deferral from taxation of a portion of statutory income   
under certain circumstances. In these situations, the deferred income was       
accumulated in a "Policyholders' Surplus Account" and, based on current tax law,
will be taxable in the future only under conditions which management considers  
to be remote; therefore, no federal income taxes have been provided on the      
balance in this account, which for tax return purposes was $104 as of December
31, 2000.                                                                       

11. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS                                                  

Transactions of the Company with its affiliates relate principally to tax       
settlements, reinsurance, insurance coverage, rental and service fees, payment  
of dividends and capital contributions. In addition, certain affiliated         
insurance companies purchased group annuity contracts from the Company to fund  
pension costs and claim annuities to settle casualty claims. Substantially all  
general insurance expenses related to the Company, including rent and employee  
benefit plan expenses, are initially paid by The Hartford. Direct expenses are  
allocated to the Company using specific identification, and indirect expenses   
are allocated using other applicable methods. Indirect expenses include those   
for corporate areas which, depending on type, are allocated based on either a   
percentage of direct expenses or on utilization. Indirect expenses allocated to 
the Company by The Hartford were $56 in 2000 and $47 in both 1999 and 1998.     

12. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES                                      
(a) LITIGATION                                                                  

Hartford Life Insurance Company is involved or may become involved in various   
legal actions, in the normal course of its business, in which claims for alleged
economic and punitive damages have been or may be asserted. Some of the pending 
litigation has been filed as purported class actions and some actions have been 
filed in certain jurisdictions that permit punitive damage awards that are      
disproportionate to the actual damages incurred. Although there can be no       
assurances, at the present time, the Company does not anticipate that the       
ultimate liability arising from potential, pending or threatened legal actions, 
after consideration of provisions made for estimated losses and costs of        
defense, will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or      
operating results of the Company.                                               

(b) LEASES                                                                      

The rent paid to Hartford Fire for space occupied by the Company was $14, $9 and
$7 in 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively. Future minimum rental commitments are  
as follows:

The principal executive offices of Hartford Life Insurance Company, together    
with its parent, are located in Simsbury, Connecticut. Rental expense is        
recognized on a level basis over the term of the primary sublease for the       
facility located in Simsbury, Connecticut, which expires on December 31, 2009,  
and amounted to approximately $10 in 2000 and $9 in both 1999 and 1998.         

(c) TAX MATTERS                                                                 

Hartford Life's federal income tax returns are routinely audited by the Internal
Revenue Service (IRS). Hartford Life's 1996-1997 federal income tax returns are 
currently under audit by the IRS. Management believes that adequate provision   
has been made in the financial statements for any potential assessments that may
result from tax examinations and other tax related matters for all open tax     
years.                                                                          

During the second quarter of 2000, Hartford Life reached a settlement with the  
IRS with respect to certain tax matters for the 1993-1995 tax years. This       
settlement resulted in a $24 tax benefit recorded in the Company's second       
quarter results of operations. This same matter is currently under review with  
the IRS for the 1996-1997 tax years.                                            

(d) UNFUNDED COMMITMENTS                                                        

At December 31, 2000, Hartford Life Insurance Company has outstanding           
commitments to fund limited partnership investments totaling $182. These capital
commitments can be called by the partnerships during the five-year commitment   
period to fund working capital needs or the purchase of new investments. If the 
commitment period expires and the commitment has not been fully funded, Hartford
Life Insurance Company is not required to fund the remaining unfunded           
commitment.                                                                     

13. SEGMENT INFORMATION                                                         

Hartford Life Insurance Company is organized into three reportable operating    
segments which include Investment Products, Individual Life and Corporate Owned 
Life Insurance (COLI). Investment Products offers individual fixed and variable 
annuities, retirement plan services and other investment products. Individual   
Life sells a variety of life insurance products, including variable life,       
universal life, interest sensitive whole life and term life insurance. COLI     
primarily offers variable products used by employers to fund non-qualified      
benefits or other post-employment benefit obligations as well as leveraged COLI.
The Company includes in "Other" corporate items not directly allocable to any of
its reportable operating segments, as well as certain group benefit products    
including group life and group disability insurance that is directly written by 
the Company and is substantially ceded to its parent, HLA.                      

The accounting policies of the reportable operating segments are the same as    
those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 2.    
Hartford Life Insurance Company evaluates performance of its segments based on  
revenues, net income and the segment's return on allocated capital. The Company 
charges direct operating expenses to the appropriate segment and allocates the  
majority of indirect expenses to the segments based on an intercompany expense  
arrangement. Intersegment revenues are not significant and primarily occur      
between corporate and the operating segments. These amounts include interest    
income on allocated surplus and the allocation of net realized capital gains and
losses through net investment income utilizing the duration of the segment's    
investment portfolios. The Company's revenues are primarily derived from        
customers within the United States. The Company's long-lived assets primarily   
consist of deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred tax assets from within
the United States. The following tables present summarized financial information
concerning the Company's segments as well as the Company's revenues by product.

On January 25, 2001, The Hartford, through the Hartford Life entities, agreed to
acquire the U.S. individual life insurance, annuity and mutual fund business of 
Fortis, Inc. (operating as Fortis Financial Group and referred to as "Fortis")  
for $1.12 billion in cash. The acquisition will be effected through several     
reinsurance agreements with subsidiaries of Fortis and the purchase of 100% of  
the stock of Fortis Advisors, Inc. and Fortis Investors, Inc., wholly-owned     
subsidiaries of Fortis. The Fortis transaction, which is subject to insurance   
regulatory approval and other customary conditions, is expected to be completed 
in the second quarter of 2001. The acquisition will be accounted for as a       
purchase transaction. The acquisition is being financed through capital         
contributions of $1.2 billion from Hartford Life, Inc.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.

	U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA)
The U.S. Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) became law in March 2010 and is effective as of July 1, 2014. The law is enforced by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS).
 
Under the provisions of FATCA, insurers may need to obtain withholding certificates (IRS Forms W-8 or W-9) from their business partners. Typically, a W-8 is provided by non-U.S. entities and a W-9 is provided by U.S. entities. Business partners conducting business with The Hartford may request copies of these completed forms from taxcompliance2@thehartford.com.
 
Additionally, copies of blank IRS forms (W-8 and W-9) and further information can be found on the IRS website.
