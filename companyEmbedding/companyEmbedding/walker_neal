About       Neil Walker Autographed Memorabilia & Collectibles
Neil Walker is a second baseman for the New York Mets. Debuting in the 2009 season, Walker has improved with each at bat for the Mets.

On the verge of a major breakout moment, now is the time to invest in Neil Walker autographed memorabilia. An autographed Neil Walker photo adds MLB excitement to an office wall while a Walker signed baseball adds MLB hype to a man cave collection.

Sure to gain value over time, now is the best time to purchase these one of a kind collectibles.
