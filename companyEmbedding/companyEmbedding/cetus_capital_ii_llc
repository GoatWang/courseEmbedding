Investment Strategies



Private EquitySpotlightPortfolioSpecial SituationsPerforming Credit




Littlejohn’s investment platform is focused on our integrated core strategies—private equity and credit. Each strategy employs the same disciplined investment philosophy, and we seek to capitalize on the related synergies. This approach is particularly powerful in the middle market.

Private Equity
investments that Littlejohn targets range from solid performing
middle market companies, to complicated corporate carve-outs, to
businesses facing operating difficulties, inadequate capital
resources or an inability to drive growth.  Littlejohn focuses
on a limited number of situations and looks to develop a strong
partnership with management to drive a step-change in growth,
performance, and enterprise value.
Special Situations
that the Fund will consider include leveraged loans, second lien
debt, mezzanine debt, high yield bonds, equities, and related
securities, and obligations of leveraged or financially distressed
companies and/or other special situations. A key element of the
Firm's investment strategy with respect to Distressed Investments
is to become active in the restructuring process in order to drive
increases in enterprise value for all company stakeholders.
Performing
Credit  investments are generally investments
in secured term loan obligations of non-investment grade corporate
borrowers.  These investments are in loans to borrowers not
experiencing financial distress that are rated and sourced by
Littlejohn in the broadly syndicated loan market. 
Investments focus on generating income while avoiding credit
losses.

Our StoryInvestment Strategies








Our Story



Building ValueLeadership




Littlejohn utilizes its unique culture and capabilities to make transformative equity and debt investments in a broad range of middle market companies. We complement this effort through our investments in the performing credit of large corporate borrowers.

The Firm is a private equity and
special situations investor focused on investing in companies
through all economic cycles.  The Firm has a long track record
of successfully investing in the middle market where it can help
management teams to drive meaningful improvements in strategy,
growth, and operations.
Littlejohn has always invested
exclusively in middle market companies, which it defines as
businesses, with revenues typically between $100M and $800M. 
The companies we invest in are all facing the opportunities and
challenges of significant change, and we partner with management to
transform these businesses.  Our approach includes:

Expand All | Collapse All

Transforming good companies into great companies












Littlejohn has extensive experience
in partnering with management teams who are leading companies with
solid performance at the time of the transaction. We work with
management to drive a step-change in sustainable growth and
operating performance through both organic initiatives and
strategic acquisitions.








Carving out divisions of large corporations












Littlejohn has acquired many
operating divisions from some of the world's most well-known
multinational corporations.  We have deep experience in
managing an efficient and confidential acquisition process,
negotiating and performing appropriate transition arrangements, and
executing the carve-out to minimize disruption for the parent while
maximizing the potential of the newly independent
business. 








Operational and financial restructurings












Littlejohn has a unique perspective
on companies dealing with financial and operational distress. 
We have deep experience dealing with the complicated and often
contentious, multi-party financial restructuring process.
 Given our experience in building long term value at our
companies, however, we focus beyond short-sighted recovery actions
in order to rebuild corporate momentum and maximize enterprise
value for the benefit of all stakeholders.








Rescue financings












Littlejohn's primary goal in
structured capital transactions is to deliver a solution that
provides business owners and management with the liquidity, time,
and capital for success.  In these situations, however,
Littlejohn looks to bring more to the table than capital.  Our
culture and experience in working closely with management teams to
drive long-term commercial and operational success differentiates
us from many players in structured capital investments.








Distressed securities investing












Littlejohn takes positions in the
securities of stressed and distressed middle market
companies.  We do this with an eye toward taking a leadership
role in working with management and all other stakeholders to craft
a financial solution that provides adequate "runway" for long term
strategic recovery and growth.








Performing credit investing












Littlejohn makes investments in performing debt instruments,
principally syndicated leveraged loans of corporate
borrowers.  Through active portfolio management, we seek to
generate attractive risk adjusted returns through a combination of
current income, capital appreciation and preservation of
principal.

   Hedge Funds-News  Cetus Capital II Reports New Position in Luxfer Holdings    Published on November 20, 2013 at 11:35 am by  
                                Andrei Braghis
                                  in Hedge Funds,News                 Cetus Capital II, LLC has reported opening a position in Luxfer Holdings PLC (ADR) (NYSE:LXFR). In a recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Cetus Capital revealed the acquisition of 874,133 shares, which represent 6.5% of Luxfer Holdings’s common stock .  Another hedge fund that likes Luxfer Holdings is Marathon Asset Management, run by Bruce J. Richards and Louis Hanover. In the latest 13F filing with the SEC, Marathon also disclosed a new position in Luxfer Holdings. The fund acquired 2.1 million shares with a reported value of $31.7 million. Jonathan Savitz‘s Greywolf Capital Management is also confident in the financial performance of Luxfer, having reported in the most recent 13F filing no change to the fund’s investment in the company. Greywolf Capital holds 1.3 million shares with reportedly worth $21.5 million. Eric Edidin and Josh Lobel‘s Archer Capital Management have also taken their chances and opened a new position. The fund reported owning 751K shares valued at a little over $12 million. A manufacturer of gas containment cylinders, Luxfer Holdings’ shares have been in an uptrend, rising 42 % in 2013 to a current price of $17.9. The stock has a trailing Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio of 12.82 and pays a dividend of $0.4 per share, which represents a yield of 2.2%. The company recently announced financial results for the third quarter of 2013. Luxfer Holdings registered net revenues of $9.3 million, a 7.9% year over year decline, and earnings per American Depositary Share of $0.33 failing to meet the expected $0.35 per share. Nevertheless, the stock is still highly regarded by analysts, who recommend it mainly as a Strong Buy. The share prices are expected to rise, with experts having set a mean target of $20.25.
