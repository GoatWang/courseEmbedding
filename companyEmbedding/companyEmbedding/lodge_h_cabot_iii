 PREFACE H The Life and Times of Akhnatori'" was first published in 1910, and went through two or three edi tions; bu t at length it passed out of print, and the few copies which remained in the market were sold at five and six tin1es the book's original price. This continued demand has led to the present re-issue, in which the material has been brought up-to-date and considerable additions have been made, though it has been thought best to leave the text on the whole in its original form. Great excavations are now being conducted by the Egypt Exploration Society upon the site of Akhnaton's sacred city; and so important is this work, and so widely should its aims be known, that on this account also the re-publication of this volume may serve a useful purpose. Those who chance to have their interest aroused by it should communicate with the Secretary of the Society, 13, Tavistock Square, London, W.C. 1, who will be glad to supply information as to these excavatiTable of Contents CONTENTS; PREFACE 13; I-THE PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS OF; AKHNATON; 1 INTRODUCTION; 2 THE ANCESTORS OF AKHNATON; 3 THE GODS OF EGYPT; 4 THE DEMIGODS AND SPIRITS-THE PRIESTHOODS ; 5 THUTMOSIS IV AND MUTEMUA; 6 YUAA AND TUAU •; 7 AMENOPHIS III AND HIS COURT ; n-THE BIRTH AND EARLY YEARS OF; AKHNATON; 1 THE BIRTH OF AKHNATON; 2 THE RISE OF ATON; 3 THE POWER OF QUEEN TIY; 4 AKHNATON'S MARRBGES •; 5 THE ACCESSION OF AKHNATON; 6 THE FIRST YEARS OF AKHNATON'S REIGN; 7 THE NEW ART; 8 THE NEW RELIGION DEVELOPS; 9 THE NATURE OF THE NEW RELIGION; III-AKHNATON FOUNDS A NEW CITY; 1 THE BREAK WITH THE PRIESTHOOD OF AMON-RA; 2 AKHNATON SELECTS THE SITE OF HIS CITY; 3 THE FIRST FOUNDATION INSCRIPTION; 4 THE SECOND FOUNDATION INSCRIPTION; 5 THE DEPARTURE FROM THEBES; 6 THE AGE OF AKHNATON •; vii; 1; :;; 8; 15; 17; 20; 28; 36; 38; 42; 45; 50; 53; 58; 67,; 73; 77; 80; 82; 87; 90; 94; viii CONTENTS; Y'V,-AKHNATON FORMULATES THE RELIGION; OF ATON; tVV' '''
