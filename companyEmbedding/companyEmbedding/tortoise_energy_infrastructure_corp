Tortoise MLP & Pipeline Fund 
Tortoise Select Opportunity Fund

 
Before investing in the fund, investors should consider their investment goals, time horizons and risk tolerance. The fund’s investment objective, risks, charges and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The summary and statutory prospectus contains this and other important information about the fund. Copies of the fund’s prospectus may be obtained by calling 855-TCA-FUND (855-822-3863) or visiting www.tortoiseadvisors.com. Read it carefully before investing.
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible.
The Morningstar Rating™ for funds, or "star rating", is calculated for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history without adjustment for sales load. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive five stars, the next 22.5% receive four stars, the next 35% receive three stars, the next 22.5% receive two stars, and the bottom 10% receive one star. The Overall Morningstar Rating™ for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-year, five-year and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating™ metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36 - 59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60 - 119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. As of 3/31/2017, TORTX/TORIX was rated against the following number of Energy Limited Partnership funds over the following periods: 76 and 31 for the three-year and five-year time period. TORTX/TORIX received four stars and five stars for those periods, respectively. This rating is specific to TORTX/TORIX and does not apply to other share classes of the fund. Past performance is no guarantee of future results.

Tortoise Capital Advisors is an investment manager specializing in listed energy investments. Tortoise is considered a pioneer in managing portfolios of master limited partnership (MLP) securities and other energy companies for individual, institutional and closed-end fund investors. For additional information, please call 855-TCA-FUND (855-822-3863) or email info@tortoiseadvisors.com.
Diversification does not assure a profit or protect against a loss in a declining market.
Before investing in the funds, investors should consider their investment goals, time horizons and risk tolerance. The funds’ investment objective, risks, charges and expenses must be considered carefully before investing. The statutory prospectuses and the summary prospectuses (click here) contain this and other important information about the funds. Copies of the funds’ prospectus may be obtained by calling 855-TCA-FUND. Read it carefully before investing.
Mutual fund investing involves risk. Principal loss is possible. The funds are non-diversified, meaning they may concentrate their assets in fewer individual holdings than a diversified fund. Therefore, the funds are more exposed to individual stock volatility than diversified funds. Investing in specific sectors such as North American energy may involve greater risk and volatility than less concentrated investments. Risks include, but are not limited to, risks associated with energy investments, including upstream energy companies, midstream companies, downstream companies, energy company beneficiaries, MLPs, MLP affiliates, commodity price volatility, supply and demand, regulatory, environmental, operating, capital markets, terrorism, natural disaster and climate change risks. The tax benefits received by an investor investing in the funds differ from that of a direct investment in an MLP by an investor. The value of the funds' investments in an MLP will depend largely on the MLP's treatment as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes. If the MLP is deemed to be a corporation then its income would be subject to federal taxation, reducing the amount of cash available for distribution to the funds which could result in a reduction of the funds' values. Investments in foreign companies involve risk not ordinarily associated with investments in securities and instruments of U.S. issuers, including risks related to political, social and economic developments abroad, differences between U.S. and foreign regulatory and accounting requirements, tax risk and market practices, as well as fluctuations in foreign currencies. The funds invest in large, small and mid-cap companies, which involve additional risks such as limited liquidity and greater volatility than larger companies. Investments in debt securities typically decrease in value when interest rates rise. This risk is usually greater for longer-term debt securities. Investment in lower-rated and non-rated securities presents a greater risk of loss to principal and interest than higher-rated securities. The funds may also write call options which may limit the funds' abilities to profit from increases in the market value of a security, but cause it to retain the risk of loss should the price of the security decline. Some funds may invest in other derivatives including options, futures and swap agreements, which can be highly volatile, illiquid and difficult to value, and changes in the value of a derivative held by the funds may not correlate with the underlying instrument or the fund's other investments and can include additional risks such as liquidity risk, leverage risk and counterparty risk that are possibly greater than risks associated with investing directly in the underlying investments. Some funds may engage in short sales and in doing so are subject to the risk that they may not always be able to borrow a security, or close out a short position at a particular time or at an acceptable price.
Nothing on this website should be considered a solicitation to buy or an offer to sell any shares of the fund in any jurisdiction where the offer or solicitation would be unlawful under the securities laws of such jurisdiction.
Nothing contained in this communication constitutes tax, legal or investment advice. Investors must consult their tax adviser or legal counsel for advice and information concerning their particular situation.

Reminder - Tortoise Energy Infrastructure Fund (TYG) Goes Ex-Dividend Soon
Looking at the universe of stocks we cover at Dividend Channel, on 2/18/15, Tortoise Energy Infrastructure Fund will trade ex-dividend, for its quarterly dividend of $0.64, payable on 2/27/15. As a percentage of TYG's recent stock price of $44.30, this dividend works out to approximately 1.44%, so look for shares of Tortoise Energy Infrastructure Fund to trade 1.44% lower — all else being equal — when TYG shares open for trading on 2/18/15.

Tortoise Energy Infrastructure Fund Is Oversold
The DividendRank formula at Dividend Channel ranks a coverage universe of thousands of dividend stocks, according to a proprietary formula designed to identify those stocks that combine two important characteristics — strong fundamentals and a valuation that looks inexpensive. Tortoise Energy Infrastructure Fund presently has a stellar rank, in the top 10% of the coverage universe, which suggests it is among the top most "interesting" ideas that merit further research by investors.

P/E Ratio (TTM) The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, a key valuation measure, is calculated by dividing the stock's most recent closing price by the sum of the diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for the trailing 12 month period.  Earnings Per Share (TTM) A company's net income for the trailing twelve month period expressed as a dollar amount per fully diluted shares outstanding. Market Capitalization Reflects the total market value of a company. Market Cap is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the stock's price. For companies with multiple common share classes, market capitalization includes both classes. Shares Outstanding Number of shares that are currently held by investors, including restricted shares owned by the company's officers and insiders as well as those held by the public. Public Float The number of shares in the hands of public investors and available to trade. To calculate, start with total shares outstanding and subtract the number of restricted shares. Restricted stock typically is that issued to company insiders with limits on when it may be traded. Dividend Yield A company's dividend expressed as a percentage of its current stock price.

Money Flow Uptick/Downtick Ratio Money flow measures the relative buying and selling pressure on a stock, based on the value of trades made on an "uptick" in price and the value of trades made on a "downtick" in price. The up/down ratio is calculated by dividing the value of uptick trades by the value of downtick trades. Net money flow is the value of uptick trades minus the value of downtick trades. Our calculations are based on comprehensive, delayed quotes.      Stock Money Flow    Uptick/Downtick Trade Ratio  0 2    1.19      Net Money Flow ()  168,017    Money flow gives a snapshot of relative buying and selling pressure in a stock.

FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.
