    I love Kennametal, but there are too many issues with this app to note.  The app obviously has not been updated in awhile and needs to be overhauled to run with the latest iOS version(s).  Most notably, the search function either does not return any results (no confirmation of items found or not found), or returns an error with a "try again" button.  This is while searching for items known to be in the catalogs.  Please update!
  



Why even call this an app???

    I can't even get this "app" to load on my iPad. It says it's downloading catalog list and that it may take a few minutes...well how about a few hours, 8+, and it still has not downloaded. I usually don't rate a lot of applications but this one is a SERIOUS PIECE O'CRAP!!!

    Data Dumps
  


The Freebase API will be completely shut-down on Aug 31 2016. This page provides access to the last available data dump. Read more.
Data Dumps are a downloadable version of the data in Freebase. They constitute a snapshot of the data stored in Freebase and the Schema that structures it, and are provided under the same CC-BY license. The Freebase/Wikidata mappings are provided under the CC0 license.

Freebase Triples


This dataset contains every fact currently in Freebase.

Total triples: 1.9 billion
Updated: Weekly
Data Format: N-Triples RDF
License: CC-BY

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.


RDF

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:

creation_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
creator
deletion_timestamp (Unix epoch time in milliseconds)
deletor
subject (MID)
predicate (MID)
object (MID/Literal)

Freebase/Wikidata Mappings


The data has been created based on the Wikidata-Dump of October 28, 2013, and contains only those links that have at least two common Wikipedia-Links and not a single disagreeing Wikipedia-Link. Furthermore, the lines are sorted by the number of common Wikipedia-Links (although in Turtle this does not really matter).

COMPANY NEWS

                    KENNAMETAL TO BUY EXTRUDE HONE FOR ABOUT $137 MILLION                
Kennametal, which makes metal-cutting and highway construction equipment, agreed to acquire Extrude Hone for about $137 million to add a line of tools that smooth and polish metal. The purchase is part of Kennametal's plan to expand by adding specialized services and equipment to offer its customers. Extrude is based in Irwin, Pa., and has plants in the United States, Germany and Ireland. Separately, Kennametal, which is based in Latrobe, Pa., said net income for the quarter ended Dec. 31 more than doubled, to $28.2 million, or 74 cents a share, and sales rose 21 percent, to $556 million.










COMPANY NEWS

                    KENNAMETAL AGREES TO BUY TOOL UNITS FROM MILACRON                
Kennametal, an industrial tool maker, agreed to buy Milacron's Indian and European metal-cutting tool units for about $170 million to increase sales to European automakers. The units, Widia and Werko, have sales of about $240 million a year, Milacron said in a statement. Shares of Milacron fell 36 cents, to $12.99; Kennametal fell 69 cents, to $39.95. Kennametal, based in Latrobe, Pa., plans to sell $100 million to $150 million in stock and will issue debt and borrow to pay for the acquisition. Milacron, based in Cincinnati, will use the proceeds to pay down debt, which was $586 million at the end of March, said a spokesman, Al Beaupre. The company will post a gain of $10 million to $12 million, or 30 cents to 36 cents a share.










COMPANY NEWS

                    KENNAMETAL TO ELIMINATE AT LEAST 200 ADDITIONAL JOBS                
Kennametal Inc., a maker of industrial tools and equipment, said yesterday that it would cut additional jobs and take a restructuring charge, warning that falling sales would hurt profit in its fourth-quarter. Kennametal, based in Latrobe, Pa., said it would eliminate 200 to 250 salaried jobs, mostly in North America, where a slowdown in manufacturing has affected sales. The company, which has about 13,000 employees, said the reductions represented 6 percent to 8 percent of its salaried work force. The company will take a fourth-quarter charge of $4 million to $6 million for the restructuring, which is expected to save about $10 million to $15 million annually. The announcement follows several months of layoffs and attrition that resulted in the elimination of 500 jobs.










COMPANY NEWS

                    KENNAMETAL TO BUY REMAINDER OF JLK DIRECT DISTRIBUTION                
Kennametal, a maker of industrial tools and equipment, agreed to buy the remaining shares of another toolmaker, JLK Direct Distribution, for $37.6 million, a 31 percent increase to Kennametal's prior offer. Kennametal, which owns about 83 percent of JLK, said it would pay $8.75 a share in cash for each of the 4.3 million JLK shares it did not already own. The bid is 40 percent more than JLK's closing price Friday of $6.25. Kennametal, based in Latrobe, Pa., said in July that it would pay $6.70 a share for JLK. Shares of JLK rose $2.38, or 38 percent, to $8.63. JLK, also based in Latrobe, makes metalworking tools. It had sales of $499.3 million in the year ended June 30. Kennametal had sales of about $1.85 billion in the year ended in June.










COMPANY NEWS

                    ITT FLUID TECHNOLOGY TO BUY MARINE PRODUCTS MAKER                
The ITT Fluid Technology Corporation, the world's largest pump producer, agreed yesterday to buy the marine products maker Rule Industries from Kennametal Inc. for an undisclosed amount. Rule Industries, a unit of Kennametal's Greenfield Industries subsidiary, makes marine and accessory products for the recreational and small commercial boat markets. Rule has annual sales of about $25 million, while ITT Industries of White Plains, the parent of ITT Fluid Technology, had 1997 sales of $8.6 billion.











                    Kennametal to Buy Greenfield, the Top Maker of Drill Bits                
Kennametal Inc. said yesterday that it would buy Greenfield Industries for about $623 million plus the assumption of debt, adding the No. 1 maker of drill bits to its line of industrial metalworking tools. Kennametal said it would pay $38 a share for Greenfield's common stock, an 18 percent premium over the closing price of $32.1875 on Friday. It also will assume about $320 million of debt and convertible preferred securities.











                    Investigation Of Iraqi Ties                
Kennametal's technology management achievements have been overshadowed in the last year by some highly publicized Congressional investigations of American companies with business ties to Iraq. The investigations, based partly on sworn testimony by a former Kennametal lawyer, are examining whether the company illegally exported products used in Iraq's military and nuclear buildup and later violated President Bush's 1990 ban on dealings with Iraq.











                    Kennametal Finds the Right Tools                
Kennametal Inc., a leading producer of metalworking and mining tools, quietly spent the 1980's investing heavily in new technology to reverse a market slide and stave off powerful foreign competitors. By last year, that strategy had propelled it into the ranks of the nation's 500 largest companies, with net income of $21 million and revenue of $618 million. And a more visible sign of success, Kennametal's stylish new $25 million research and development center, opened next to the company's headquarters on the rural outskirts of this small city, an hour's drive east of Pittsburgh.
