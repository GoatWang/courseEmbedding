MacGuire, Cheswick & Tuttle Investment Counsel, LLC is an SEC registered investment advisor dedicated to assisting individuals and families in the management of their wealth. The three partners, Kevin A. MacGuire, Susan Cheswick Brewer and David P. Tuttle, are responsible for every client relationship and bring to bear diverse and highly experienced business backgrounds with, in the aggregate, over 70 years of achievement in managing investment portfolios through the up and down cycles of the economy and capital markets. Our success is primarily determined by enabling clients in making decisions consistent with their long term objectives and values and then implementing those decisions on their behalf.

We engage our clients as partners in a long term discussion about wealth management objectives and strategies to address their near and long term financial goals. These conversations are informed by our understanding of each client's evolving income tax, gifting, estate planning, philanthropic and stock option strategies.

We engage with clients to gain an understanding of their family's overall financial situation and to help them define their investment objectives.
We provide them with alternative paths to achieving those objectives.
We assist them in articulating an appropriate investment policy that will balance their financial objectives with their risk tolerances:


Their investment policy will specify an asset allocation that may include equities (domestic and international), fixed income (taxable and tax exempt), alternative investments, hard assets, and cash reserves.

Clients with multiple family portfolios (ie: personal, joint, retirement, trust, partnership and eleemosynary accounts) will have a specific investment policy for each portfolio.


In this process we become informed of our client's income tax, gifting, estate planning, philanthropic and stock options strategies which we assist them in managing.


We manage the implementation of the investment policy through the construction of separately managed portfolios and the selection of individual securities and other assets:


Our equity selection is primarily focused on large growing companies with strong managements and sound financial conditions.

Our fixed income selection generally focuses on high quality debt instruments that will provide stability and reliable income for the portfolios.


We periodically review all of the above with clients to better understand their evolving financial objectives and risk tolerances, assure that we are implementing the investment policy to their satisfaction, make any necessary adjustments, discuss the progress of their various planning strategies, and advise them of any changes we believe may be appropriate in light of changes in tax laws or other considerations.


      
 


Other Money MattersX

 
Money affects nearly everything.

Your portfolio doesn't exist in isolation from your life. It's the motor that drives many of your decisions. And those decisions raise questions.

Money affects nearly everything.

Your portfolio doesn't exist in isolation from your life. It's the motor that drives many of your decisions. And those decisions raise questions. Here are a few examples of the issues we address with clients who seek our advice:


Who is the right attorney to help you with estate planning?

What is the best strategy for an inheritance?

How do you create a budget after a divorce?

What should you do about long term health planning?

Does your tax return raise any flags?

How do you manage charitable donations?

How should you pay for an unanticipated expense?

How do you impart the right values to children raised with wealth?



As a result of trust and open dialogue, our relationships develop organically - as opposed to being “managed” - and they last for many years, sometimes for generations.

What are analysts saying about Abbott Laboratories stock?

Here are some recent quotes from research analysts about Abbott Laboratories stock: 
1. According to Zacks Investment Research, "For the majority of last one month, Abbott is trading above the broader Medical Products industry. We are optimistic about the company’s strong and consistent EPD and Medical Devices performance in the last reported first quarter. Overall, the company stands to benefit from the ongoing integration and synergy achievement of St. Jude. We are also looking forward to the company’s plans to focus on selling portfolio in core therapeutic areas. Recently, Abbott received CE mark for its TactiCath Sensor and Confirm Rx ICM products which is quite encouraging. The company also launched science-based nutrition drinks for better recovery from surgeries. On the flip side, Abbott’s sluggish pediatric business in China continues to hamper growth. Management is also concerned about the on-going economic problem in Venezuela that is expected to remain unresolved in the coming quarters." (6/21/2017)
2. Jefferies Group LLC analysts commented, "Investment summary: We are reiterating our Overweight rating for CORI and we are raising our PT by $2 to $12 following the positive donepezil patch bioequivalence results. Progress in the development of a proprietary pipeline is key, in our opinion, to the performance of the shares. Successful development of patch formulations of donepezil (Aricept) and/or memantine (Namenda) should position the company well to more-effectively monetize the transdermal drug delivery platform, in our opinion. Retention of meaningful commercialization rights could enable the company to turn the corner and pursue other opportunities more broadly, in our opinion. Corplex donepezil pilot study shows bioequivalence. Management reported that the Corplex donepezil pilot study met the FDA statistical criteria for bioequivalence. We note, too, that the patch was well-tolerated, with good skin and GI tolerability." (5/12/2017)

Analyst Ratings
Consensus Ratings for Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) (How are Consensus Ratings Calculated?) MarketBeat calculates consensus ratings using the most recent rating from each brokerage that has rated a stock within the last twelve months. Since brokers often use different ratings systems, each rating is normalized to a standardized rating score of 1 (sell), 2 (hold), 3 (buy) or 4 (strong buy). Consensus ratings scores are calculated using the mean average of the number of normalized sell, hold, buy and strong buy ratings. Each stock's consensus rating is derived from its calculated consensus ratings score (0-1.5 = Sell, 1.5-2.5 = Hold, 2.5-3.5 = Buy, >3.5 = Strong Buy). MarketBeat's consensus price targets are a mean average of the most recent available price targets set by each analyst that has set a price target for the stock in the last twelve months.MarketBeat will no longer include ratings and price target data in its consensus calculation if a broker drops coverage and MarketBeat has received a report that coverage was dropped. Ratings from certain research firms that issue ratings using purely quantitative methods (such as Zacks, Vetr and ValuEngine) are not included in consensus calculations. MarketBeat's consensus ratings and consensus price targets may differ from those calculated by other firms due to differences in methodology and available data.Ratings Breakdown: 3 Hold Ratings, 11 Buy RatingsConsensus Rating:Buy (Score: 2.79)Consensus Price Target: $52.77 (3.82% upside)

MacGuire, Cheswick & Tuttle Investment Counsel, LLC is an SEC registered investment advisor dedicated to assisting individuals and families in the management of their wealth. The three partners, Kevin A. MacGuire, Susan Cheswick Brewer and David P. Tuttle, are responsible for every client relationship and bring to bear diverse and highly experienced business backgrounds with, in the aggregate, over 70 years of achievement in managing investment portfolios through the up and down cycles of the economy and capital markets. Our success is primarily determined by enabling clients in making decisions consistent with their long term objectives and values and then implementing those decisions on their behalf.

We engage our clients as partners in a long term discussion about wealth management objectives and strategies to address their near and long term financial goals. These conversations are informed by our understanding of each client's evolving income tax, gifting, estate planning, philanthropic and stock option strategies.

We engage with clients to gain an understanding of their family's overall financial situation and to help them define their investment objectives.
We provide them with alternative paths to achieving those objectives.
We assist them in articulating an appropriate investment policy that will balance their financial objectives with their risk tolerances:


Their investment policy will specify an asset allocation that may include equities (domestic and international), fixed income (taxable and tax exempt), alternative investments, hard assets, and cash reserves.

Clients with multiple family portfolios (ie: personal, joint, retirement, trust, partnership and eleemosynary accounts) will have a specific investment policy for each portfolio.


In this process we become informed of our client's income tax, gifting, estate planning, philanthropic and stock options strategies which we assist them in managing.


We manage the implementation of the investment policy through the construction of separately managed portfolios and the selection of individual securities and other assets:


Our equity selection is primarily focused on large growing companies with strong managements and sound financial conditions.

Our fixed income selection generally focuses on high quality debt instruments that will provide stability and reliable income for the portfolios.


We periodically review all of the above with clients to better understand their evolving financial objectives and risk tolerances, assure that we are implementing the investment policy to their satisfaction, make any necessary adjustments, discuss the progress of their various planning strategies, and advise them of any changes we believe may be appropriate in light of changes in tax laws or other considerations.

Money affects nearly everything.

Your portfolio doesn't exist in isolation from your life. It's the motor that drives many of your decisions. And those decisions raise questions.

Money affects nearly everything.

Your portfolio doesn't exist in isolation from your life. It's the motor that drives many of your decisions. And those decisions raise questions. Here are a few examples of the issues we address with clients who seek our advice:


Who is the right attorney to help you with estate planning?

What is the best strategy for an inheritance?

How do you create a budget after a divorce?

What should you do about long term health planning?

Does your tax return raise any flags?

How do you manage charitable donations?

How should you pay for an unanticipated expense?

How do you impart the right values to children raised with wealth?



As a result of trust and open dialogue, our relationships develop organically - as opposed to being “managed” - and they last for many years, sometimes for generations.
