Why invest in precious metals


Portfolio diversifier - Gold and silver have historically shown low correlation to traditional asset classes 
Historical store of value 


What our gold team is seeing


We are likely in the early stages of the current gold bull market, driven by a global push to a negative interest rate policy, currency volatility and a high level of cross-asset class correlation. 
Gold and silver equities are trading at attractive valuations – companies have reduced their operating costs, while equity valuations are still at historic lows relative to the price of gold
The average 24 month return of gold equities following the market bottom of the last 7 bear markets was 117%.

The recent rally has the hallmarks of a trend...
Current bear market has matched historical bear market precedents in both duration and magnitude and is bouncing off bottom of +35 year channel.

Our Businesses
As one of the world’s leading global precious metals investors, our long-term commitment to precious metals is both a key competitive advantage and a strategic priority. This is balanced with the objective of building our diversified suite of alternative investment products to sustainable scale. The two-pronged strategy of building a global precious metals franchise, augmented by a diversified alternative investment fund business, better enables us to provide consistent shareholder returns over the long term and through various economic cycles. Over time, it is our belief that our two-pronged strategy will also position us well to take advantage of the continued global shift from conventional investments to alternative investment strategies.
We operate through three primary lines of business:

Exchange Listed Products
Alternative Asset Management
Private Resource Investments

 

Exchange-Listed Products
Sprott manages a suite of exchange-listed products including the Sprott Physical Trusts and sector-focused ETFs. All of Sprott’s exchange-listed products are listed on the NYSE Arca and the Sprott Physical Trusts are also listed on the TSX.

Alternative Asset Management
Sprott’s actively managed strategies are managed by Sprott Asset Management. Our products are designed to address specific investor needs in two core categories: Alternative Equity and Alternative Income.
Alternative Equity
Sprott’s alternative equity platform is designed to provide core equity exposure with an emphasis on capital preservation and superior risk-adjusted returns. This is achieved through a concentrated portfolio of large-cap North American equities, broadly diversified by sector. 
Alternative Income 
Sprott has developed a diverse platform of alternative income strategies designed to provide a unique source of income to complement core portfolios. The strategies exhibit low volatility, low correlation to most asset classes, and low to no sensitivity to interest rates. In addition, they offer higher return potential than traditional fixed income investments. As a result, investors benefit from improved risk adjusted returns.

Private Resource Investments
With a long-history as natural resource investing experts, Sprott offers investors a range of resource-focused strategies in publicly-listed and private LP formats. These strategies are managed by Sprott’s private resource teams in Toronto, Calgary, Carlsbad and Seoul.

The approach is focused on collaboration and partnership; the team works in concert with management, optimizing the financing package to best suit the particular needs of the company. Since September 2010, the team has originated and managed over 40 debt investments totalling $1.3 billion.

What are Listed Agriculture Investments?
The listed agriculture sector includes companies involved in the production, processing, transporting, trading and marketing of soft commodities such as grains, meat, fish and forestry products, as well as those that supply products and services (including seeds, fertilizers, crop nutrients, agricultural equipment and water) to the agricultural industry. 

Why Invest in Listed Agriculture?
In today’s uncertain markets, listed agriculture assets can provide long-term growth potential and portfolio diversification to help investors reach their financial goals. Global population growth, increasing standards of living and scarcity of arable land are going to be the main drivers of growth for decades to come.
Agriculture as an Investment Opportunity
Demand Growth
It is estimated that world food production will need to increase between 60% to 90% by 2050 to meet the expected food demand.

Overall population growth - world’s population is estimated to reach 9 billion by 2050
Increasing standard of living will continue to increase food consumption in countries with large populations
Dietary shifts to higher protein foods such as meat require significantly more agricultural products

Growing Constraints

Slowing yield growth rates
Utilization rate of arable land is now at nearly 100% (with an exception of Sub-Saharan Africa)
Land loss caused by erosion, pollution and topsoil loss
Extreme weather creating both droughts and floods in key crop areas
Water scarcity – shrinking fresh water supply is coupled with increased demand (especially for protein crops)

Investment Objective
The investment objective of the Fund is to provide capital appreciation by investing primarily in a diversified portfolio of the shares of companies operating in the agribusiness sector including, but not limited to, global companies involved in the production, processing, transporting, trading and marketing of soft commodities such as grains, meat, fish, and forestry products, as well as those that supply products and services (including seeds, fertilizers, crop nutrients, agricultural equipment and water) to the agricultural industry.
Investment Strategy
The Fund targets the agribusiness theme by investing in listed stocks that derive at least 50% of their gross income or net profits, directly or indirectly, from the production, processing and distribution of agricultural products, packaged foods and meats, as well as the business operators and suppliers of equipment and materials. Agribusiness companies also include agriculture-related companies organized as real estate investment trusts (REITs) and master limited partnerships (MLPs). This approach enables investors to profit from the agriculture asset class, while offering the liquidity and convenience of a conventional investment fund.
