When it comes to supporting the entrepreneurial spirit, there's a time to be cautious and there's a time to be, well, not so cautious.  Because if there's one thing we've come to believe, it's this: You can't change the world by always saying "no."
Which is why, for more than 25 years, Canaan Partners has been working with entrepreneurs in the technology and healthcare fields to achieve one simple goal: Improve the way we live our lives.
Step one is to forge a meaningful relationship.  A tall order, to be sure, but one we've become quite adept at achieving.  (Let's just say we're in touch with our inner matchmaker.) And while our approach may be somewhat unconventional, there's no denying the results. In fact, such startups as Virsto, Kabam, and Advanced BioHealing were all brought to life with a little Canaan-style care and seeding.
In short, we'll do whatever it takes to bring your vision to life – even if we're just early investors.  We'll become involved at the board level to offer meaningful connections and experience.  We'll lend a hand with team building, strategy, and customer expansion. We'll even brag about you to our friends and loved ones.
And because it's a collaborative partnership, you'll have access to our entire team as you need it.  It's your vision.  We just want to make it a success.

They say that nothing succeeds like success.  We humbly agree.  Take, for example, some our over-achieving seed companies.  Kabam, Virsto, SOASTA, Cardlytics are all category leaders.  And that’s just for starters.  We also have three of the top 20 hits in healthcare in the past decade.  Combine that with the fact that we have 26 years of experience, $3.5B under management and $600M in fresh capital that we recently raised in Fund IX and one thing becomes clear.  We kind of have a knack for this.

Say hello to the Canaan Crew. Partners, from all over the world, dedicated to changing lives. One radical idea at a time.
At Canaan, our senior operating team is comprised of seasoned professionals.  Former co-founders, CEOs, inventors, doctors, scientists, engineers, and quant jocks who love sharing their insights, experience and connections with entrepreneurs who need them.  In other words, there’s a pretty good chance they were the inspiration for the old adage, “It’s not what you know, it’s who you know.”

About Canaan Partners
Focus on what matters most. People
Canaan Partners is a global venture capital firm that invests in people with visionary ideas.  The kind that not only result in new and valuable technology, but game-changing healthcare startups as well.
We were early investors in some of the world's leading technology companies, including PrimeSense, SuccessFactors and Lending Club and healthcare stars like Cerexa, Chimerix and Advanced BioHealing.
All of which makes one thing perfectly clear. When people are your priority, good things happen.










A History of Success









































































 Technology
Our Technology Team has a long history of working with entrepreneurs who defy convention, radically changing business models and technology in the process.
In our own portfolio, we watched marketplaces evolve from CommerceOne to Lending Club. We saw dating go from Match (the first paid subscription service) to Zoosk, where big data and the social graph were added to the love potion.  And we saw Madison Avenue change with the first internet ad network with DoubleClick to the largest video ad network with Tremor Video.  Our team loves collaborating with those driven to create the future or dramatically improve how something is done today.

 Healthcare
Working with entrepreneurs who are driven to impact medicine puts us in our zone. Whether they're looking for new ways to treat disease, inventing new medical devices, or seeking to improve outcomes in clinical care, they inspire us to do our very best. Which is why we've made it our business to know exactly the best way to help them.
We can open doors with corporates, find management talent, and collaborate on how to attract investor syndicates. Plus, we can support start-ups through the regulatory and clinical hurdles.
It's this kind of expertise that has enabled us to back some of the most successful ventures in healthcare, including Advanced BioHealing, BiPar Sciences, and Elevation Pharmaceuticals.

 Israel
After nearly a decade of investing experience in Israel, we brought in our former CEO of Business Layers, Izhar Shay, who led investments in early-stage high tech startups, including such companies as PrimeSense, LiveU and N-trig. Canaan Partners Israel focuses on the SaaS/Enterprise, Mobile Computing, and Internet Infrastructure sectors. Izhar Shay also created Startup Stadium, an online community of more than 35,200 people that's designed to connect all of Israel's entrepreneurs. It allows them to share ideas and foster technical innovation.

Immigration Reform
 | Canaan




































Sometimes Success Is A Foreign Concept













"Like so many other company founders who are immigrants, I feel lucky to have been given the chance to establish and fund companies in the United States. And I stand in support of every effort to make the success of others who follow the same path less about luck, and more about opportunity."
-Deepak Kamra




At Canaan, we believe that there are two things driving U.S. economic growth and job creation:  Venture-backed startup companies and immigration.  In fact, since 1990, 25% of venture-financed companies in the U.S. have been founded by immigrant entrepreneurs.
In Canaan’s portfolio alone, nearly one quarter of our U.S. startups have at least one foreign-born national as a member of their founding team.  They’re entrepreneurs with roots in 5 different continents.  From such countries as Bulgaria, Canada, China, Denmark, Ecuador, Egypt, France, Germany, Hungary, Iran, India, Israel, Lebanon, Russia, South Africa, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Turkey, and the United Kingdom.
We’re strong supporters of Immigration Reform and we look forward to funding future immigrant entrepreneurs.
