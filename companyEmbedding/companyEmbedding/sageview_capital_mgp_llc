Our Approach

Sageview provides growth capital to small and mid-sized companies in the technology, financial services, and business services sectors. We combine active ownership, industry experience and a partnership approach to drive long-term value for our portfolio companies and investors.READ MORE



Working with Sageview


“We were looking for a capital partner that was different from the other firms we had interacted with, and Sageview’s approach stood out.  They have been engaged in nearly every aspect of our business – strategic discussions, executive hires, financial planning and monitoring, operational efficiency, board composition to name a few – and have constructively supported our growth initiatives.  They are an important part of Avalara’s success.”Scott McFarlane, CEO, Avalara
“Sageview has brought practical, straight-forward thinking to help grow GoPro and take it to the next level.  They know when to be deeply involved and when to apply a deft touch, and have been committed partners since day one.”Nick Woodman, CEO, GoPro
“We’ve worked with many investors over the years and what makes Sageview unique is their approach beyond economics. Their principals make a significant personal investment both financially and intellectually and care deeply about driving the best outcome for all. Their exceptional knowledge of our business to its core, experience and perspective is helping us grow and evolve into one of the dominant and most innovative brands in the wealth counseling business.”Joe Duran, CEO, United Capital
“We chose to partner with Sageview because of their ability to help us grow our business, and their engaged approach was evident from day 1. They helped us map the investments we need to scale the business, then helped us achieve that scale by introducing us to potential Fortune 500 customers.”Prashanth Palakurthi, CEO, Reflexis
“Sageview invested in EverBank in the depth of the financial crisis in 2008.  Making an investment at that time is a testament to the work they put in to understand the business and the management team and our vision for growth.  Since then we have grown from a $6 billion institution to nearly $20 billion today.  Along the way, we have benefited from Sageview’s years of investment experience and board leadership.”Rob Clements, CEO, EverBank
“The team at Sageview has taken a leadership role on the Exaro board from day one, working seamlessly with  management and our other investors.  They have been instrumental in helping us think through various strategic opportunities by combining a rigorous analytical approach and nuanced understanding of the E&P business with the benefit of years of experience as business owners.”Chris Beato, CEO, Exaro
“I joined Cadence when it was started in large part due to Sageview’s involvement. They bring more than capital to the table – they are part of the team and  have an invaluable network.  They have deep experience and expertise and have been tremendously supportive of our management team.  It is valuable for me to have Sageview as a sounding board – it helps me make better decisions. It’s a strong partnership.”Paul Murphy, CEO, CadencePrev

Our Approach

Sageview provides growth capital to small and mid-sized companies in the technology, financial services, and business services sectors. We combine active ownership, industry experience and a partnership approach to drive long-term value for our portfolio companies and investors.READ MORE



Working with Sageview


“We were looking for a capital partner that was different from the other firms we had interacted with, and Sageview’s approach stood out.  They have been engaged in nearly every aspect of our business – strategic discussions, executive hires, financial planning and monitoring, operational efficiency, board composition to name a few – and have constructively supported our growth initiatives.  They are an important part of Avalara’s success.”Scott McFarlane, CEO, Avalara
“Sageview has brought practical, straight-forward thinking to help grow GoPro and take it to the next level.  They know when to be deeply involved and when to apply a deft touch, and have been committed partners since day one.”Nick Woodman, CEO, GoPro
“We’ve worked with many investors over the years and what makes Sageview unique is their approach beyond economics. Their principals make a significant personal investment both financially and intellectually and care deeply about driving the best outcome for all. Their exceptional knowledge of our business to its core, experience and perspective is helping us grow and evolve into one of the dominant and most innovative brands in the wealth counseling business.”Joe Duran, CEO, United Capital
“We chose to partner with Sageview because of their ability to help us grow our business, and their engaged approach was evident from day 1. They helped us map the investments we need to scale the business, then helped us achieve that scale by introducing us to potential Fortune 500 customers.”Prashanth Palakurthi, CEO, Reflexis
“Sageview invested in EverBank in the depth of the financial crisis in 2008.  Making an investment at that time is a testament to the work they put in to understand the business and the management team and our vision for growth.  Since then we have grown from a $6 billion institution to nearly $20 billion today.  Along the way, we have benefited from Sageview’s years of investment experience and board leadership.”Rob Clements, CEO, EverBank
“The team at Sageview has taken a leadership role on the Exaro board from day one, working seamlessly with  management and our other investors.  They have been instrumental in helping us think through various strategic opportunities by combining a rigorous analytical approach and nuanced understanding of the E&P business with the benefit of years of experience as business owners.”Chris Beato, CEO, Exaro
“I joined Cadence when it was started in large part due to Sageview’s involvement. They bring more than capital to the table – they are part of the team and  have an invaluable network.  They have deep experience and expertise and have been tremendously supportive of our management team.  It is valuable for me to have Sageview as a sounding board – it helps me make better decisions. It’s a strong partnership.”Paul Murphy, CEO, CadencePrev

Strategy

Strategy
Sageview’s investment efforts are focused on three primary sectors: technology, financial services, and business services.
Focus on Select Growth Industries
Sageview’s investment efforts are focused on three primary sectors: technology, financial services, and business services. These industries are characterized by above-GDP growth trends and a large number of small and mid-sized companies, creating a robust opportunity set in which attractive investment returns can be achieved without the use of excessive financial leverage.  Sageview’s investment team has deep industry experience and a strong track record in these verticals.
Proactive and Proprietary Sourcing
Sageview focuses primarily on minority investments and other opportunities where governance or structure often fall outside the mandates of traditional private equity and venture capital funds. Sageview’s extensive global relationship network is a valuable sourcing engine, and the majority of our investments are proprietary in nature, with Sageview as the lead or only investor and a member of the Board of Directors.
Asymmetric Risk-Return
Sageview pursues a rigorous underwriting approach that prioritizes capital preservation and risk-mitigation, while maintaining attractive upside optionality.  Sources of downside protection might include recurring cash flow, tangible asset values, structural protections, hedging, or other means.  By investing in equity and equity like securities, Sageview maintains exposure to upside performance.
Active Approach to Ownership
Sageview targets a portfolio of 15-20 total investments, enabling the firm to concentrate efforts on opportunities where Sageview’s capital, expertise and active involvement can have a meaningful impact on value creation.   Sageview looks to partner with founders and management teams who have a demonstrated track record of success, a clear strategy for value creation, and incentives that are aligned with those of other shareholders.
Opportunistic Investing in Public Markets
Sageview opportunistically invests in public companies and special situations, consistent with the firm’s history and experience.  Our focus is primarily on situations where we can be an engaged, impactful anchor shareholder to small and mid-cap public companies.
