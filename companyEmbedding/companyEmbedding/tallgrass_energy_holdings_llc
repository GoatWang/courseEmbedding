Rockies Express Pipeline (REX)

            Rockies Express Pipeline (REX) is one of the United States’ largest pipelines and is transforming into the nation’s northernmost bi-directional natural gas header system. With 42- and 36-inch diameter lines, REX taps major supply basins in the Rocky Mountain and Appalachian regions and serves energy markets across a vast segment of North America. The completion of the REX Zone 3 Capacity Enhancement project that went in service in January 2017 marked the culmination of a series of projects to convert Zone 3 to bi-directional flow and enabled the pipeline to flow up to 4.4 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas in Zone 3. West-to-east long-haul capacity on REX is 1.8 billion cubic feet per day. REX is a joint venture of Tallgrass Energy Partners (50 percent membership interest), Tallgrass Development, LP (25 percent membership interest) and Phillips 66 (25 percent membership interest). A wholly owned subsidiary of TEP operates the pipeline.  
            REX, which became fully operational in 2009, stretches about 1,700 miles from northwestern Colorado and Wyoming to eastern Ohio and, through numerous interstate pipeline interconnects, provides shippers optionality to many major demand centers and large end-users.
To answer the call for more takeaway capacity from the Marcellus and Utica shale plays in the Appalachian basin, in 2014 REX put into service its Seneca Lateral, making REX Zone 3 bi-directional. In 2015, REX completed its Zone 3 East-to-West project, expanding the Zone 3 bi-directional capability from Monroe County Ohio to Moultrie, Ill. This expansion tripled REX’s Zone 3 east-to-west capacity, giving producers a much-needed outlet for getting their gas to Midwest consumer markets such as Chicago and Detroit, as well as to the Southeast and Gulf Coast areas.
With the completion of the Zone 3 Capacity Enhancement project, REX Zone 3 has the capacity to move 2.6 billion cubic feet of natural gas a day from east-to-west and 1.8 billion cubic feet a day from west-to-east. For local distribution companies, industrial customers, power plants, and third-party pipelines, the bi-directional flow and enhancements mean access to abundant natural gas sources in both the Rockies and Appalachian basins. As the country’s northernmost bi-directional header system, REX will play a crucial role in transforming the nation’s natural gas infrastructure, providing access to emerging U.S. markets as well as access to current high-demand centers, power demand, LNG markets and Mexico.

Tallgrass Energy Announces Plan To File A Registration Statement For Interests In The General Partner Of Tallgrass Energy Partners, LP






Business Wire




Jan 28, 2015 5:18 PM EST













 




























































  Tallgrass GP Holdings, LLC ("GP Holdings"), a privately held limited liability company that currently owns the general partners of Tallgrass Development, LP and Tallgrass Energy Partners, LP (NYSE: TEP), today announced that it intends to file a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") for an initial public offering of equity interests in a newly formed entity that is expected to own, directly or indirectly, all of TEP's incentive distribution rights, TEP's general partner interest, and a certain number of common units representing limited partner interests in TEP.  This announcement shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities. Any offer, solicitations of offers to buy, or any sales of securities will only be made in accordance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 or an exemption therefrom. This announcement is being issued pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 135 under the Securities Act of 1933.   Cautionary Note Concerning Forward-Looking Statements   Disclosures in this press release contain "forward-looking statements." All statements, other than statements of historical facts, included in this press release that address activities, events or developments that management expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in the future are forward-looking statements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, forward-looking statements contained in this press release specifically include the expectations of plans, strategies, and objectives, including guidance regarding the timing of filing of a registration statement for an initial public offering and whether a registration statement will ever be filed, whether a public offering will ultimately occur, and the assets to be held by the newly-formed entity. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from projected results, anticipated results or other expectations expressed in this press release, including, without limitation, due to the fact that GP Holdings' business plans and strategy may change as circumstances warrant, securities may not ultimately be offered, GP Holdings may not be able to raise the planned amount of capital even if the offering of securities is completed, the planned assets to be owned by the newly-formed entity may change and GP Holdings may not be able to complete the proposed actions on the timetable indicated. Accordingly, investors should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results. GP Holdings has based these forward-looking statements on current expectations and assumptions about future events. Such statements are subject to a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of GP Holdings, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those implied or expressed by the forward-looking statements. These include risks set forth in reports filed by TEP with the SEC. Any forward-looking statement applies only as of the date on which such statement is made and GP Holdings does not intend to correct or update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.

FAQ


Is Bing Ads right for me?

Is Bing Ads right for my business?
All types of businesses find value and success with Bing Ads. Whether you're focused on local calls and foot traffic, or want to drive traffic to your website from across the country or around the world. Bing Ads has solutions for you.
I already appear in search results for free. Why should I pay for advertising?
Your current customers may search for your business by name, aiming it easy to find you in search results. But customers you've yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldn't necessarily bring up your business in search results. Advertising next to relevant Bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach.
What is the difference between SEO and SEM? Which one is right for me?
Search engine optimization (SEO) is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results. You cannot pay to improve your website ranking on Bing or Yahoo, thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or "organic" search results.

	Clicks from SEO are free. But SEO also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control.

	Search engine marketing (SEM) is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid (or "organic") search results. These paid ads are purchased through Bing Ads.

	You pay for SEM clicks. But SEM gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay. And you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results.

	You don't have to choose between SEO and SEM. You can do both!
If my time is limited, should I still try Bing ads?
Yes! Call a Bing Ads specialist at 877-635-3561*and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free. We’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success. We’re here to help.




About Bing Ads

Where does my ad appear?
Your ads could appear on the top or to the right of Bing, Yahoo, and MSN search results. And you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions, times or days of the week, and even demographics.
What determines my ad position?
Bing Ads is a pay-per-click (PPC) advertising system. You bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad. Because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads, we auction those spaces. You are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want. So if you bid on the keyword "shoe", you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on "shoe." You determine how much you are willing to bid.
	Your ad position is based on several things, including:
	
How closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched (relevance).
How your bid compares to other bids in the Bing Ads auction.
How strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked (click-through rate).

	The stronger you are in these areas, the better your chances of winning the top ad position.




How to use Bing Ads

How can I use Bing Ads to drive more people to my website?
Here are some tips to get better results:
	
Review your budget and bid strategy. If your ad keeps pausing, your budget limit may be set too low. Competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more clicks to your website.
Expand your targeting, both for location and for devices (computer, mobile and tablet).
Make sure your ads and website are relevant to the keywords you bid on. Would someone searching your terms expect to see and ad for your business?


How can I keep my costs down?
While your first instinct may be to lower your budget, first try lowering your maximum bids. Yes, this could mean fewer customers visit your site. But if you increase your quality score and build ads with a strong performance history, you may be able to win a good ad position with a lower bid. That would lower your cost=per-click and help stretch your budget.
How do I know if Bing Ads is working?
View a wide range of performance trends in your account to quickly see key stats: ad clicks, the number of times your ad appeared (impressions), spend, average cost-per-click, click-through rate, average ad position, cost per acquisition, and conversions. You can also run performance reports to get insights into how well your campaigns are doing.
Can I run more than one ad?
Yes! In fact, we encourage it. Only one ad will show at a time but running multiple ads lets you test different approaches to see what's working best with your target customers. Frequently, businesses try out different ads for specific products or pages.




Getting started with Bing Ads

How do I get started?
Sign up for Bing Ads
Which keywords should I choose?
You have a few options to help choose your keywords. First you'll want to think of the terms one of your customers might use to search for your products and offerings. Those search terms are a great starting point. Then you can use tools right in your account to find more keywords. Within Bing Ads, click Campaigns on the top of the page. Click the Keywords tab, and then click Add Keywords. This will let you:
	
Search for new keywords based on one you enter.
Search a website for keywords.
Search your destination URLs for keywords.


How can I write a good ad?
Here are a few tips that can help make your ad stand out.
	
Keep your ads relevant. One way to improve relevance is to use your customer's most popular search terms in your ad titles and txt.
Describe what sets your product apart.
Use your customers' language. Use words and writing tone that are likely to attract your typical customer.
Be specific. This clearer and more specific your offering, the better. For example, rather than "big discount," specify and exact percentage, such as "50 percent off."
Give customers a reason to click your ad right now. Offer a specific call to action, such as encouraging customers to request a brochure or consultation, download a free e-book, subscribe to a newsletter, or take advantage of a limited-time discount.
