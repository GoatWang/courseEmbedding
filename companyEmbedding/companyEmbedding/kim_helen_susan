Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/25/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

The Amazon.com Textbooks Store




	
Are you tired of paying a small fortune for your textbooks every year? Wouldn’t you rather buy cheap college textbooks and have more money to buy that great pair of skinny jeans, eat out more often instead of heating up a frozen pizza, or just have a little more spending money? When you come to Amazon.com, you can save money by buying cheap new and used textbooks and by renting textbooks for college. You can also trade your used textbooks for an Amazon Gift Card, whether you bought your books from us or not. By being a smart shopper and saving money on textbooks at Amazon.com, you’ll have more cash for the things in life that can’t be learned from a textbook.

The Amazon Textbooks Store allows you to shop online and buy all your textbooks without ever leaving the comfort of your couch. We offer a variety of new, used, rental, and eTextbooks. Don’t worry about selection, we’ve got your textbook needs covered for any subject from biology, chemistry, and nursing to accounting, arts, and engineering. Once you’re finished with your textbooks you can trade them in at Amazon.com and get up to 80% of their value in an Amazon Gift Card.   

Shop the Amazon Textbooks Store and save up to 90% on textbook rentals, up to 90% on used textbooks, and up to 50% on new textbooks. You can also enjoy Free Two-Day Shipping on millions of items, including cheap college textbooks, when you join Prime Student. Get your textbooks delivered to your door and save both time and money by shopping at Amazon.com. So go ahead and treat yourself to that designer purse or new video game, you can since you’ve saved so much on your textbooks.

eTextbook Studying Features
Learn about eTextbook features that help you study smarter, not harder.












We know there are things you would rather be doing than studying, so we built X-Ray for Textbooks to help you save time. With X-Ray for Textbooks, get everything you need with a single tap, including definitions, related pages in your eTextbook, and even relevant content from other sources like Wikipedia and YouTube. X-Ray for Textbooks is available on Fire tablets and the free Kindle Reading App for iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac on select eTextbooks. To access X-Ray for Textbooks, bring up the control bar within an eTextbook by tapping at the top or bottom of your screen.  You can find the X-Ray for Textbooks button at the top of the control screen.

Just carrying around a yellow highlighter? How about pink, blue, orange, and yellow? Multi-color highlights are available on Fire tablets, iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. Tap a word and hold–the digital highlighting tool will pop up and you can adjust the highlighted text and highlight color. You can categorize and save all your highlights in Notebook and even turn them into flashcards with the click of a button; go to Notebook and click on the Flashcards button to create flashcards from your highlights. We store all your highlights at kindle.amazon.com so you can reference them even after you return the eTextbook.














Studying for exams? Notebook for eTextbooks displays all of your notes, colored highlights, saved images and bookmarks in one place. With Notebook you can mark and filter your most important concepts to study when it's test time–you can even export them to email and Evernote on Fire tablets. It's like a digital scrapbook for your studies. Notebook is available on Fire HD tablets and the free Kindle Reading App for iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. On iOS and Android devices, tap the top or bottom of the screen from within the eTextbook to bring up the controls to access Notebook. On PC/Mac, the Notebook icon is on the left side of the Kindle Reading app.














Just finished a chapter and need to review key terms and definitions? Flashcards allow you to quickly brush up on all the terms, concepts, and definitions in each chapter with a simple, easy to use interface. Flashcards are available on iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac from within the eTextbook. Click on the flashcards icon to make your own flashcards. Or, you can auto-generate Flashcards from your notes and highlights and X-Ray terms if your eTextbook includes X-Ray for eTextbooks.














Have a tablet and a laptop? With eTextbooks, you can read your content on all your devices with the free Kindle Reading App. eTextbooks are currently supported on Fire tablets, iPad, iPhone, Android, PC, and Mac. eTextbooks give you access to your content however you want, whenever you need it. Kindle's Whispersync technology also synchronizes the furthest page you read, your bookmarks, and annotations across your devices so you can pick up where you left off.














You can save money and space in your bag with eTextbooks. Read across your devices and save time studying the concepts you need to learn with interactive features such as Keyword Search and X-Ray for Textbooks. Quickly create and manage your notes and highlights and access them anytime in the Amazon cloud.














Carry less around campus this semester. Take your entire library with you wherever you go, without having to lug around all of your physical textbooks. You can also access all of your eTextbooks, notes, and bookmarks wherever you go, whether it's on your Fire tablet, iPad, iPhone, Android device, PC, or Mac with the free Kindle Reading App.














With the swipe of a finger, quickly and efficiently navigate through pages and chapters of eTextbooks. Swift navigation is available on Android and iOS tablets. Tap the top or bottom of your tablet screen from inside the eTextbook to access swift navigation. On iPads, you have the option of swiping through all the pages from a grid like the one shown above.








The Amazon.com eTextbooks Store




Are you tired of paying a small fortune for your textbooks every year? Well, you can save up to 80% off the print list price when you rent and up to 60% off the print list price when you buy eTextbooks. Renting eTextbooks couldn’t be easier.

Experience the BeenVerified Difference
See what people like you are saying about BeenVerified







Natasha, Oklahoma
Nursing Student
"My daughter recently went out for soccer. I decided it would be a good idea to run another player’s father through BeenVerified. Turns out this guy had been charged with indecent exposure and was on parole."


Maryann, New Jersey
Analyst
"I used BeenVerified to check into a guy that I had met online. It turns out he had lied to me about where he lived and his family. Needless to say, thanks to BV I severed contact with him and have not heard from him since. Thank you BV!"


Bob M, New Jersey
Retired Detective
"I am retired and have a ministry helping the dying and sick. I found a son and the mother was dying of cancer. She held on waiting for her son who had not been in touch for years."


Rhonda, Missouri
Caring Mom
"I'm a single mother dating online and I use BeenVerified to help protect my family!"









More Testimonials





From the Press
Gizmodo.com
"It found my photos on Flickr, my Amazon wishlist, my public Foursquare records, Vimeo, Picassa, and Stumbleupon accounts. It grabbed approximately twelve bajillion photos of me (with many, many false positives) and even more web links."


From the Press
U.S. News & World Report
"BeenVerified easily and inexpensively provides access to public records information through its website and several mobile phone applications. No longer are large corporations the only ones who can afford background checks."


From the Press
NBC 6 Miami
"Instant information… Court documents, mortgage deeds, criminal records right in the palm of your hand."

What Makes Us Different?
Property Data + People Data
Our reports include the traditional info you’d expect to find about a property (ownership, deeds, tax info, etc.), but we dig deeper and offer background records on people too.
Find criminal background records on owners, registered sex offenders in the neighborhood, and more.










The Extras We Include, for FREE


Run criminal background checks on previous owners, their associates, or the neighbors. Get to know the whole story.



Know your new neighborhood by seeing sex offender information, which may include names, addresses, and criminal convictions.



Easy to use reporting. Just enter an address, a name, or even a phone number and we will give you all the information we have.
