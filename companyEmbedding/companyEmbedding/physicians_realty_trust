FlashRatings' Principles

          1. FlashRatings' mission is to provide you - the investor - with as much honest and professional research on your investments as possible.
        

          2. We believe it's much better to get a multitude of credible opinions on an investment than to arbitrarily follow any single advisor - be it your banker, a friend, or a TV pundit.
        

          3. FlashRatings does NOT provide advice. Our job is to accurately and objectively report on analysts' credible research and opinions. The only advice FlashRatings will ever give you is to absorb as much fundamental research and different opinions as possible and make your own decisions!
         

          4. FlashRatings favors covering analysts with proven track records, but will cover all analysts as long as their research is honest and professional.

CAREERS




 Because we're healthcare experts first, we see healthcare real estate from the inside out.



Physicians Realty Trust (NYSE:DOC) is a self-managed healthcare real estate investment trust that acquires, owns and manages healthcare properties that are leased to physicians, hospitals and healthcare delivery systems and other healthcare providers. Our properties are typically on a campus with a hospital or strategically located and affiliated with a hospital or physician organization.
Now is an exciting time in the transformation of the U.S. healthcare market, and more specifically the U.S. healthcare real estate market. DOC was formed to invest capital in real estate required by physicians, hospitals and other healthcare providers to deliver medical care and treatment and to integrate their services in response to the demands of patients, payers and government policy. The result? Higher quality of care at a lower price.
Our management team includes healthcare professionals with more than 50 years of experience in healthcare executive management, policy, law, and finance, as well as experience with real estate acquisitions, development and property management. Coupled with our significant public healthcare REIT experience, we’ve developed relationships and access to physicians, hospitals and healthcare delivery system decision makers. We merge our health care and real estate knowledge to quickly identify and assess opportunities that add value for investors and capital resources to our physician, hospital and provider clients.
Through our healthcare specific knowledge, we earn the trust of physicians, hospitals, and other health care providers by helping them better serve their patients, partners and payers. In turn, our investments in these providers deliver reliable dividends and stock price appreciation for our investors.

 Because we're healthcare experts first, we see healthcare real estate from the inside out.



Physicians Realty Trust (NYSE:DOC) is a self-managed healthcare real estate investment trust that acquires, owns and manages healthcare properties that are leased to physicians, hospitals and healthcare delivery systems and other healthcare providers. Our properties are typically on a campus with a hospital or strategically located and affiliated with a hospital or physician organization.
Now is an exciting time in the transformation of the U.S. healthcare market, and more specifically the U.S. healthcare real estate market. DOC was formed to invest capital in real estate required by physicians, hospitals and other healthcare providers to deliver medical care and treatment and to integrate their services in response to the demands of patients, payers and government policy. The result? Higher quality of care at a lower price.
Our management team includes healthcare professionals with more than 50 years of experience in healthcare executive management, policy, law, and finance, as well as experience with real estate acquisitions, development and property management. Coupled with our significant public healthcare REIT experience, we’ve developed relationships and access to physicians, hospitals and healthcare delivery system decision makers. We merge our health care and real estate knowledge to quickly identify and assess opportunities that add value for investors and capital resources to our physician, hospital and provider clients.
Through our healthcare specific knowledge, we earn the trust of physicians, hospitals, and other health care providers by helping them better serve their patients, partners and payers. In turn, our investments in these providers deliver reliable dividends and stock price appreciation for our investors.

Physicians Realty Trust: A High-Dividend Stock With Tremendous Upside Potential
This high-paying young REIT could deliver market-beating performance for decades to come.











                Matthew Frankel
            

                (TMFMathGuy)



            
            Dec 4, 2015 at 10:18AM
            
            





Physicians Realty Trust (NYSE:DOC) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) specializing in healthcare real estate. Not only does this relative newcomer pay an impressive 5.6% dividend yield, but the company has potential to deliver market-beating total returns if its early performance is any indication of the future. Here's what you need to know about Physicians Realty Trust, and how it stands out from the competition.
About Physicans Realty Trust Physicians Realty Trust is a REIT that invests in healthcare properties. The company currently owns 146 properties in 25 states representing 5.4 million square feet of leasable space, mostly in the eastern half of the U.S. The vast majority (84%) of the portfolio consists of medical office buildings, with a small, but significant amount of hospital properties as well. A relatively new REIT, Physicians Realty Trust completed its IPO in July 2013, and has grown tremendously in the short amount of time since then.
Why should you invest in healthcare real estate? Simply put, it is a near-certainty that demand for healthcare facilities will grow during the coming decades. According to forecasts from the U.S. Census Bureau, national healthcare expenditures will increase by 67% over the next decade.

Image source: Physicians Realty Trust. 
This is due to a combination of catalysts, such as the Affordable Care Act, which has provided accessible healthcare for millions of previously uninsured people, as well as the aging U.S. population. In fact, the 65-and-over population is expected to double by the year 2060, and the 75-plus and 85-plus age groups are projected to grow at an even faster rate.






Image source: Physicians Realty Trust.
Ambitious growth, but a smart balance sheet Since completing its IPO a little over two years ago, Physicans Realty Trust has grown rapidly, with total investments rising from $124 million to $1.5 billion in just over two years, including $740 million in new acquisitions this year alone.
Impressively, the company has achieved this level of growth while maintaining a conservative balance sheet. Through five follow-on equity offerings, management has been able to finance most of its acquisitions without taking on an excessive level of debt. In fact, the company's fixed charge coverage ratio of 6.2 times is more conservative than many of its healthcare REIT peers. In other words, the company earns $6.20 for every dollar in fixed charges (such as interest) that it is obligated to pay. For comparison, Welltower (NYSE:HCN), one of the sector leaders, has a fixed charge coverage ratio of 3.5 times.
The strategy is simple, yet effective. Physicians Realty Trust looks to capitalize on its existing relationships with physicians and hospitals in order to buy off-market properties that could produce the best possible long-term returns for its investors. By targeting properties in the $10 million to $50 million range, there is little competition for the best deals from the larger healthcare REITs.





A limited history -- but so far, so good I've mentioned that Physicians Realty Trust is relatively new, especially compared to some of the Healthcare REIT heavyweights – many of which have impressive records. For example, Welltower has delivered an average 15.6% annual total return since its 1970 IPO, a remarkable level of performance to sustain for over three decades. So, if you want time-tested performance, Physicians Realty Trust is probably not the best choice for you.
However, the early results look promising. Since its IPO, Physicians Realty Trust has outperformed the SNL U.S. Healthcare REIT Index by more than 60% -- achieved through a combination of the smart and unique acquisition strategy and an impressive 96% occupancy rate. For comparison, here's a look at Physicians Realty Trust's performance compared with some of its peers.


A word about valuation and the competition It's tough to compare Physicians Realty Trust to its competition from a valuation perspective, simply because a rapidly growing company doesn't have the earnings consistency that decades-old, established companies do.
For example, when looking at Physicians Realty Trust's normalized funds from operations (or FFO, the REIT version of "earnings") over the past four quarters, we arrive at a price-to-FFO ratio of 19.3, which is admittedly on the high side of peers.





However, when you consider the fact that the company's normalized FFO has grown by 53% over the past year alone, the higher valuation could easily be justified. In fact, by extrapolating the most recent quarter's normalized FFO ($0.26) over a year, we arrive at a much more attractive P/FFO of 15.6. Based on 2015's third quarter, here's how Physicians Realty Trust stacks up to some of its peers.

As you can see, Physicians Realty Trust is indeed valued at a premium to peers. Bear in mind, however, that while REITs are usually not valued as growth stocks, Physicians Realty Trust is growing rapidly, in terms of both assets and earnings, and this should be taken into account when examining its valuation.
The Foolish bottom line Physicians Realty Trust is an ambitious new player in an area of real estate that looks quite promising over the coming decades. If the company can continue to use its relationships with physicians and hospitals to create value for shareholders, this REIT could potentially evolve into one of the sector leaders -- and make its investors lots of money along the way.
