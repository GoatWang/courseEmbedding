July 18 (UPI) -- The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory has received a $93 million contract to continue its engineering and research work with the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, the Department of Defense announced Monday.
The work will go toward specialized engineering, research and development requirements for the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Services include planning, strategic analysis, studies of air-delivered and ground-based nuclear weapons capabilities, and command-and-control communications.
The program will be performed in Laurel, Md., and is expected to be completed by June 10, 2024. Air Force 2017 operations and maintenance funds in the amount of $1 million are being allocated for the contract.
The Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory is a 280-acre defense and space research facility and is the nation's largest University Affiliated Research Center.
Laboratory is dedicated to 12 different areas of study, including air and missile defense, weapons guidance systems, cyber operations, and civil and military space programs. Johns Hopkins APL was founded in 1942 to aid wartime research and development.
The lab does extensive work for the Department of Defense and other sponsors, and technology developed at the center is transferred for defense, contractor, and commercial civilian use.
The Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center out of Kirtland Air Force Base, N.M., is responsible for all nuclear weapons and material within the Air Force. It has over 1,900 personnel at sites worldwide to support the Air Forces nuclear weapons material and systems.
It is split into four divisions that manage air-delivered warheads, ground-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, associated command-and-control and nuclear technology.
The U.S. Air Force has operational control of the the U.S. ground-based nuclear ballistic missiles and air-delivered bombs and missiles, including the Minuteman III ICBMs that form the backbone of the U.S. nuclear arsenal.

July 18 (UPI) -- The Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory has received a $93 million contract to continue its engineering and research work with the Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center, the Department of Defense announced Monday.
The work will go toward specialized engineering, research and development requirements for the U.S. nuclear arsenal. Services include planning, strategic analysis, studies of air-delivered and ground-based nuclear weapons capabilities, and command-and-control communications.
The program will be performed in Laurel, Md., and is expected to be completed by June 10, 2024. Air Force 2017 operations and maintenance funds in the amount of $1 million are being allocated for the contract.
The Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory is a 280-acre defense and space research facility and is the nation's largest University Affiliated Research Center.
Laboratory is dedicated to 12 different areas of study, including air and missile defense, weapons guidance systems, cyber operations, and civil and military space programs. Johns Hopkins APL was founded in 1942 to aid wartime research and development.
The lab does extensive work for the Department of Defense and other sponsors, and technology developed at the center is transferred for defense, contractor, and commercial civilian use.
The Air Force Nuclear Weapons Center out of Kirtland Air Force Base, N.M., is responsible for all nuclear weapons and material within the Air Force. It has over 1,900 personnel at sites worldwide to support the Air Forces nuclear weapons material and systems.
It is split into four divisions that manage air-delivered warheads, ground-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, associated command-and-control and nuclear technology.
The U.S. Air Force has operational control of the the U.S. ground-based nuclear ballistic missiles and air-delivered bombs and missiles, including the Minuteman III ICBMs that form the backbone of the U.S. nuclear arsenal.

Johns Hopkins researchers report evidence that the natural ability of zebrafish to regenerate retinal tissue in their eyes can be accelerated by controlling the fishes' immune systems.
The new findings may one day advance efforts to combat degenerative eye disease damage in humans, the scientists say, because evolution likely conserved this mechanism of regenerative potential in other animals. A report on their experiments was published in April in Proceedings of The National Academy of Sciences.


  "Humans have an evolutionary block on our ability to regenerate certain tissues. But humans still have the genetic machinery needed to regenerate retinal tissue, if we can activate and control it."

      Jeffrey Mumm
Associate professor of opthalmology

"At the cellular level, zebrafish and human eyes are remarkably similar," said Jeffrey Mumm, associate professor of ophthalmology at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.
Both human and zebrafish eyes contain Müller glia, an "inducible" stem cell type that gives zebrafish their remarkable regenerative abilities. The researchers say they found evidence that microglia, a cell type found in most vertebrae innate immune systems, affect the Müller glia's regenerative response and can be harnessed to accelerate the growth of new tissue in the retina.
For the study, researchers created a model of the human degenerative retinal disease retinitis pigmentosa in zebrafish by incorporating a gene for a specialized enzyme into the rod cells of the fish retina. The enzyme has the novel ability to convert a chemical (metronidazole) into a toxin, allowing researchers to selectively kill the cells expressing it.
After initiating photoreceptor loss in the fish retinas, the researchers monitored the immune system's response by tracking the activity of three types of fluorescently labeled immune cells in and around the eye: neutrophils, microglia, and peripheral macrophages. They were able to follow the activity of the immune cells using time-lapse 3-D microscopy imaging of fish retinas.
They found that neutrophils, the type of immune cells that are typically the first responders to tissue injury, were largely unresponsive to photoreceptor death. They also observed that the peripheral macrophages sensed the injury but were unable to penetrate the blood-retinal barrier to access the dying cells.

Microglia were the only cells the researchers saw that were able to both respond to the injury and reach the injured cells.
"We could see the peripheral macrophages wanted to do something, but could not gain access," Mumm said. "Neutrophils didn't even detect that something had happened, but the microglia were at the right place at the right time."
Building on that evidence, the researchers conducted tests in zebrafish with the specialized enzyme incorporated into both rod cells and microglial cells, removing both cell types to ask what role microglia play during regeneration. They found that when microglia were also lost, Müller glia showed almost no regenerative activity after three days of recovery, compared with approximately 75 percent regeneration in the control population.
The researchers hope that by harnessing the ability to improve regeneration in zebrafish, they can better understand how to induce regeneration in human eyes, which share many of the same mechanisms for controlling regenerative potential. In the future, the researchers hope to improve their imaging techniques to build a more comprehensive understanding of how immune cells impact the regeneration process.
"Humans have an evolutionary block on our ability to regenerate certain tissues," Mumm said. "But humans still have the genetic machinery needed to regenerate retinal tissue, if we can activate and control it."
Funding for this research came from the National Eye Institute and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences.
Note: The value of Luminomics' products could be impacted by the outcome of this study. Mumm is a founder of Luminomics, and his spouse, Meera Saxena, owns shares of Luminomics' stock. This arrangement has been reviewed and approved by Johns Hopkins University in accordance with its conflict of interest policies.

Johns Hopkins helps launch “vertical” accelerator focused on health and fitness innovations
By Jesse SchwartzPublished: July 19th, 2017 

Johns Hopkins University and a team of partner organizations are launching a start-up accelerator focused on health and fitness technologies.
The M-1 Ventures accelerator is a 16-week program is intended to take advantage of Maryland’s renowned strengths in health and medicine. The partners behind the new program include the University of Maryland, Under Armour’s venture investment firm Plank Industries, Brown Advisory and the Abell Foundation.
“I see all these accelerators out there, and they’re cool, but particularly when it comes from an investor’s standpoint I think what a lot of these companies need is a vertical accelerator,” says Paul Singh, an angel investor who will lead M-1 Ventures.
A vertical accelerator focuses on a particular market sector — for M1-ventures, that area is health and fitness.
The program is open to companies from across the country that are beyond the idea stage, with a product for sale and revenues. Participants will receive $25,000 in funding, legal and accounting services, access to mentors and co-working space in the Johns Hopkins start-up hub FastForward East.
MI-Ventures will launch on September 5th and will conclude with a Demo Day in December, where start-ups will be able to engage with potential investors and partners.

			Johns Hopkins, Microsoft to develop technology to improve patient safety in the ICU
	

Project will connect medical devices in effort to reduce preventable harm

The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and Microsoft have announced plans to work together to redesign the way medical devices in an intensive care unit talk to each other.
The two organizations plan to develop a health IT solution that collects data from different monitoring equipment and identifies key trends aimed at preventing injuries and complications that can result from medical care.
The idea stems from the Johns Hopkins Armstrong Institute for Patient Safety and Quality's research on checklists to reduce infections and its pilot program called Project Emerge, which uses technology to restructure a hospital's workflow in an effort to eliminate the most common causes of preventable harm and promote better patient outcomes. While most efforts to improve safety focus on one harm, Project Emerge seeks to eliminate all harms, including medical complications such as blood clots and pneumonia, as well as emotional harms like a lack of respect and dignity.
"Today's intensive care patient room contains anywhere from 50 to 100 pieces of medical equipment developed by different manufacturers that rarely talk to one another," says Peter Pronovost, senior vice president of patient safety and quality for Johns Hopkins Medicine and director of the Armstrong Institute. "We are excited to collaborate with Microsoft to bring interoperability to these medical devices, to fully realize the benefits of technology and provide better care to our patients and their families. By combining teamwork with technology designed to meet patients' and clinicians' needs, we can make care safer, less expensive, and more joyful."
Four million patients are admitted to ICUs in the U.S. each year, and between 210,000 and 400,000 patients die annually from a potentially preventable complication, making medical errors the third leading cause of death, behind heart disease and cancer.
In collaboration with Microsoft, Johns Hopkins plans to revamp Project Emerge to better serve patients in intensive care environments. Johns Hopkins will supply the clinical expertise for the build, while Microsoft will provide advanced technologies, including Azure cloud platform and services, as well as software development expertise. Using Azure, the improved solution will collect and integrate information from several modern devices and provide critical analytics, computing, database, mobility, networking, storage, and Web functions. The final product will allow physicians to see trends in a patient's care in one centralized location and let them access critical patient information from any hospital-approved, Windows device. Pilot projects are estimated to begin in 2016.
"Johns Hopkins and Microsoft share a common vision of providing better care to more people," says Michael Robinson, vice president of U.S. health and life sciences at Microsoft. "Through our joint work, Johns Hopkins and Microsoft will empower health professionals with easy-to-consume, data-driven insights, allowing them to focus more on patients and less on technology and process."
This initiative is one of several collaborations between the two organizations designed to foster innovative, health-based technologies. Earlier this year, Microsoft became a sponsor of FastForward, Johns Hopkins' new business incubator designed to accelerate product development for health IT startup companies. Johns Hopkins also recently joined Microsoft's Partner Network, which provides enhanced services to the university.
"Collaborating with Microsoft on multiple fronts will provide mutually beneficial opportunities that can change the face of the health information technology landscape," says Christy Wyskiel, senior advisor to the president of The Johns Hopkins University and head of Johns Hopkins Technology Ventures. "I look forward to harnessing these opportunities and seeing many positive outcomes from our relationship."
The initial build of Project Emerge was funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. The Armstrong Institute, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory, and the University of California, San Francisco, collaborated on the project to develop and test the initial prototype.

With Institutional Collaborations On Consumer Products
The Johns Hopkins Medicine name MAY NOT be used: with activities involving companies or organizations if the activities might be viewed as endorsement of a commercial product or imply approval of a private company. The Johns Hopkins Medicine name or brandmarks MAY NOT be used: in connection with any promotional materials developed and/or used by non-Hopkins entities or any activities that are not officially approved by Johns Hopkins or one of its hospitals, departments, schools, or institutions. The Johns Hopkins Medicine name MAY NOT be used: on consumer products, their packaging or packaging inserts. Inappropriate use exampleBackground: Johns Hopkins Medicine entered into a business arrangement with Advanced Cosmetic Solutions Inc. (ACS) under which the institution advised the company on human testing of its cosmetic products and permitted the company to cite the arrangement in a statement on the product and packaging. The arrangement provided for Johns Hopkins Medicine to be paid for consulting, receive ACS stock, and appoint a representative to the company's board of directors. The Johns Hopkins Medicine name was prominently displayed in retail sales displays and in ads for the products.Analysis: Concern arose regarding the appropriateness of the way the Johns Hopkins name was used as well as the institutional conflict of interest generated by owning stock while providing consultation on clinical testing.Decision: Johns Hopkins Medicine divested itself of the stock, declined a seat on the ACS board, and revised the permitted name uses in the contract with ACS.
