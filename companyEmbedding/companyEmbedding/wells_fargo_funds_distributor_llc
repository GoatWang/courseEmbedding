Request a Consultation  What is a mutual fund? A mutual fund pools investors’ money to purchase stocks, bonds, other securities and cash. An investor can buy shares of a mutual fund, which is professionally managed according to investment objectives stated in the fund’s prospectus. Unlike traditional mutual funds, asset allocation and target date funds primarily invest in other mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to gain exposure to a wide variety of asset classes. These funds are well-diversified and, under normal market conditions, follow a target asset allocation based upon the fund’s investment objectives.  Typically, target date funds are sold by date, such as a 2025 fund. The farther away the date is, the greater the risks the fund usually takes.
 There is no assurance a mutual fund, including target date and asset allocation funds, or ETFs, will meet their investment objectives, or that an investor will have sufficient money in retirement investing in a target date fund.  The principal value of an investment in a mutual fund or ETF is not guaranteed at any time, including, for a target date fund, at its target date.   Options involve risk and are not suitable for all investors.  Before opening an option position, a person must receive a copy of “Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options.”  This is available from the Options Clearing Corporation or any listed options exchange.  You should read it carefully before investing.   Brokerage products and services are offered through Wells Fargo Advisors. Wells Fargo Advisors is a trade name used by Wells Fargo Clearing Services, LLC and Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network, LLC, Members SIPC, separate registered broker-dealers and non-bank affiliates of Wells Fargo & Company and is intended only for United States residents. WellsTrade® brokerage accounts are offered through WFCS.   Investment and Insurance Products:  Are Not insured by the FDIC or any other federal government agency Are Not deposits of or guaranteed by a Bank May Lose Value   1115-02268

Wells Fargo Utilities And High Income Fund (AMEX:ERH)Intraday Stock Chart

      *This fund makes distributions in accordance with a managed distribution 
      plan that provides for the declaration of monthly distributions to 
      common shareholders of the fund at an annual minimum fixed rate of 9% 
      based on the fund’s average monthly net asset value (NAV) per share over 
      the prior 12 months. Under the managed distribution plan, monthly 
      distributions may be sourced from income, paid-in capital, and/or 
      capital gains, if any. The fund’s distributions in any period may be 
      more or less than the net return earned by the fund on its investments 
      and therefore should not be used as a measure of performance or confused 
      with yield or income. Distributions in excess of fund 
      returns will cause the fund’s NAV to decline. Investors should not draw 
      any conclusions about the fund’s investment performance from the amount 
      of its distribution or from the terms of its managed distribution plan.
    

      The Wells Fargo Income Opportunities Fund is a closed-end high-yield 
      bond fund. The fund’s investment objective is to seek a high level of 
      current income. The fund may, as a secondary objective, seek capital 
      appreciation to the extent it is consistent with its investment 
      objective.
    

      The Wells Fargo Multi-Sector Income Fund is a closed-end income fund. 
      The fund’s investment objective is to seek a high level of current 
      income consistent with limiting its overall exposure to domestic 
      interest-rate risk.
    

      The Wells Fargo Utilities and High Income Fund is a closed-end equity 
      and high-yield bond fund. The fund’s investment objective is to seek a 
      high level of current income and moderate capital growth, with an 
      emphasis on providing tax-advantaged dividend income.
    

      The final determination of the source of all distributions is subject to 
      change and is made after year-end. Each fund will send shareholders a 
      Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell shareholders how to 
      report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.
    

      For more information on Wells Fargo’s closed-end funds, please visit 
      our website.
    

These closed-end funds are no longer engaged in initial public 
      offerings, and shares are only available through broker/dealers on the 
      secondary market. Unlike an open-end mutual fund, a closed-end fund 
      offers a fixed number of shares for sale. After the initial public 
      offering, shares are bought and sold through broker/dealers in the 
      secondary marketplace, and the market price of the shares is determined 
      by supply and demand, not by NAV, and is often lower than the NAV. A 
      closed-end fund is not required to buy its shares back from investors 
      upon request.
    

      High-yield, lower-rated bonds may contain more risk due to the increased 
      possibility of default. Foreign investments may contain more risk due to 
      the inherent risks associated with changing political climates, foreign 
      market instability, and foreign currency fluctuations. Risks of 
      international investing are magnified in emerging or developing markets. 
      Funds that concentrate their investments in a single industry or sector 
      may face increased risk of price fluctuation over more diversified funds 
      due to adverse developments within that industry or sector. Small- and 
      mid-cap securities may be subject to special risks associated with 
      narrower product lines and limited financial resources compared with 
      their large-cap counterparts. When interest rates rise, the value of 
      debt securities tends to fall. When interest rates decline, interest 
      that a fund is able to earn on its investments in debt securities may 
      also decline, but the value of those securities may increase. Changes in 
      market conditions and government policies may lead to periods of 
      heightened volatility in the debt securities market and reduced 
      liquidity for certain fund investments. Interest-rate changes and their 
      impact on the funds and their NAVs can be sudden and unpredictable.
    

      The use of leverage results in certain risks, including, among others, 
      the likelihood of greater volatility of the NAV and the market price of 
      common shares. Derivatives involve additional risks, including 
      interest-rate risk, credit risk, the risk of improper valuation, and the 
      risk of noncorrelation to the relevant instruments they are designed to 
      hedge or to closely track. There are numerous risks associated with 
      transactions in options on securities. Illiquid securities may be 
      subject to wide fluctuations in market value and may be difficult to 
      sell.

      management businesses of Wells Fargo & Company. Wells Fargo Funds

      *This fund makes distributions in accordance with a managed distribution 
      plan that provides for the declaration of monthly distributions to 
      common shareholders of the fund at an annual minimum fixed rate of 9% 
      based on the fund’s average monthly net asset value (NAV) per share over 
      the prior 12 months. Under the managed distribution plan, monthly 
      distributions may be sourced from income, paid-in capital, and/or 
      capital gains, if any. The fund’s distributions in any period may be 
      more or less than the net return earned by the fund on its investments 
      and therefore should not be used as a measure of performance or confused 
      with yield or income. Distributions in excess of fund 
      returns will cause the fund’s NAV to decline. Investors should not draw 
      any conclusions about the fund’s investment performance from the amount 
      of its distribution or from the terms of its managed distribution plan.
    

      The Wells Fargo Income Opportunities Fund is a closed-end high-yield 
      bond fund. The fund’s investment objective is to seek a high level of 
      current income. The fund may, as a secondary objective, seek capital 
      appreciation to the extent it is consistent with its investment 
      objective.
    

      The Wells Fargo Multi-Sector Income Fund is a closed-end income fund. 
      The fund’s investment objective is to seek a high level of current 
      income consistent with limiting its overall exposure to domestic 
      interest-rate risk.
    

      The Wells Fargo Utilities and High Income Fund is a closed-end equity 
      and high-yield bond fund. The fund’s investment objective is to seek a 
      high level of current income and moderate capital growth, with an 
      emphasis on providing tax-advantaged dividend income.
    

      The final determination of the source of all distributions is subject to 
      change and is made after year-end. Each fund will send shareholders a 
      Form 1099-DIV for the calendar year that will tell shareholders how to 
      report these distributions for federal income tax purposes.
    

      For more information on Wells Fargo’s closed-end funds, please visit 
      our website.
    

These closed-end funds are no longer engaged in initial public 
      offerings, and shares are only available through broker/dealers on the 
      secondary market. Unlike an open-end mutual fund, a closed-end fund 
      offers a fixed number of shares for sale. After the initial public 
      offering, shares are bought and sold through broker/dealers in the 
      secondary marketplace, and the market price of the shares is determined 
      by supply and demand, not by NAV, and is often lower than the NAV. A 
      closed-end fund is not required to buy its shares back from investors 
      upon request.
    

      High-yield, lower-rated bonds may contain more risk due to the increased 
      possibility of default. Foreign investments may contain more risk due to 
      the inherent risks associated with changing political climates, foreign 
      market instability, and foreign currency fluctuations. Risks of 
      international investing are magnified in emerging or developing markets. 
      Funds that concentrate their investments in a single industry or sector 
      may face increased risk of price fluctuation over more diversified funds 
      due to adverse developments within that industry or sector. Small- and 
      mid-cap securities may be subject to special risks associated with 
      narrower product lines and limited financial resources compared with 
      their large-cap counterparts. When interest rates rise, the value of 
      debt securities tends to fall. When interest rates decline, interest 
      that a fund is able to earn on its investments in debt securities may 
      also decline, but the value of those securities may increase. Changes in 
      market conditions and government policies may lead to periods of 
      heightened volatility in the debt securities market and reduced 
      liquidity for certain fund investments. Interest-rate changes and their 
      impact on the funds and their NAVs can be sudden and unpredictable.
    

      The use of leverage results in certain risks, including, among others, 
      the likelihood of greater volatility of the NAV and the market price of 
      common shares. Derivatives involve additional risks, including 
      interest-rate risk, credit risk, the risk of improper valuation, and the 
      risk of noncorrelation to the relevant instruments they are designed to 
      hedge or to closely track. There are numerous risks associated with 
      transactions in options on securities. Illiquid securities may be 
      subject to wide fluctuations in market value and may be difficult to 
      sell.

Composite Score:





                        BuyerZone.com, LLC has received 3.68 out of 5 stars based on 6 Customer Reviews and a BBB Rating of A+.
                        






                            Comprised of 67% BBB Rating and 33% Customer Review Rating.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating represents the customer's opinion of the business. The Customer Review
                            Rating percentages are based on the total number of positive, neutral, and negative reviews posted.
                        

                            The BBB letter grade represents the BBB's opinion of how the business is likely to interact with its customers.
                            The BBB grade is based on BBB file information about the business.
                            In some cases, a business' grade may be lowered if the BBB does not have sufficient
                            information about the business despite BBB's requests for that information from the business.
                        

                            The BBB Customer Review Rating plus the BBB Rating is not a guarantee of a business'
                            reliability or performance. BBB recommends that consumers consider a business'
                            BBB Rating and Customer Review Rating in addition to all other available information
                            about the business.
