People's United CEO Granted $3.4 Million Pay Package in '14 - Hartford Courant




























































Business 



People's United CEO Granted $3.4 Million Pay Package in 2014



Kenneth R. GosselinContact ReporterProperty Line

People's United CEO Takes Home $3.4 Million in '14.




The president and chief executive of People's United Financial Inc. took home a compensation package of $3.4 million in 2014, down slightly from $3.6 million the previous year, a shareholder filing shows.In addition, Jack Barnes, who has led the Bridgeport-based parent of People's United Bank since 2010, also received stock options and shares of restricted stock currently worth $1.5 million. The actual worth of the award will depend on the value of the shares when the options are exercised and shares of restricted stock vest.The largest portion of Barnes' 2014 compensation package was $1.2 million in value realized from previously granted stock.Barnes' cash incentive payment, which combines short- and long-term executive incentive programs tied to performance goals, was $1 million, down from $1.3 million.In 2013, Barnes received a 20 percent increase above the previous year.In 2014, Barnes' salary rose 3 percent, to $995,000. All other compensation, which included use of a company-owned plane and contributions to retirement plans, rose 11 percent, to $233,000.Barnes did not exercise any stock options in 2014.The proxy, filed with federal securities regulators Tuesday, stated the bank reaped the benefits of "deep customer relationships, product breadth and ongoing strategic initiatives." Those benefits produced increased earnings per share, plus strong loan and deposit growth.

"Despite persistently low interest rates and a challenging economic environment, we performed well during 2014," the proxy stated.Barnes' compensation package came in a year in which People's United shares rose 1 percent, to $15.18. The stock is trading well below the offering price of $20 a share in the bank's 2007 "second step" conversion.A $100 investment in the bank's shares at the time of the conversion was worth $73.05 at the end of 2014, assuming all dividends were reinvested.At the close of trading Wednesday, the shares were valued at $15.08, down 12 cents.The Courant calculates compensation as the sum of salary, bonus, value exercised from stock options and vested stock awards, plus other forms of direct pay, such as incentive payments and personal use of corporate aircraft.These are the 2014 compensation packages for other top executive officers:■Galan G. Daukas, wealth management chief: $685,380, plus $621,000 in options and restricted shares.■Lee C. Powlus, chief administrative officer, $1.2 million, plus $477,000 in options and restricted shares.■Jeffrey J. Tengel, commercial banking chief: $1.3 million, plus $537,000 in options and restricted shares.■Kirk W. Walters, chief financial officer: $2.2 million, plus $760,000 in options and restricted shares.
