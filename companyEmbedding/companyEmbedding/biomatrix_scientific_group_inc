         			  			   (Majority-Owned Susidiary of BMSN) 			  			Regen BioPharma, Inc., a subsidiary of Bio-Matrix Scientific Group, Inc. (OTCBB: BMSN) 			is a biotechnology company focused on identifying undervalued regenerative medicine applications 			in the stem cell space and rapidly advancing these technologies through pre-clinical andPhase I/ II clinical trials. 			   			    "Our business model is to acquire and form companies around 			undervalued assets identified froma highly focused analysis of issued 			patents in regenerative medicinethat have demonstrated proof of concept"       Dr. Ichim is one of the leading authorities in the 			world on stem cell biology.  "A STEM CELL INCUBATOR COMPANY"  With an emphasis on stem cell regenerative medicine  			  			     Our Business Model | Regen BioPharma 			                                Regen BioPharma has assessed over 20,000 stem cell related issued patents, narrowed down to 2000 patents with commercial applicability, and further identified 30 patents available for licensing. The company seeks to inlicense, take the product to, and through clinical safety and efficacy "signal" and spin out technologies.  			      Our Approach | Regen BioPharma               			      REGEN BIOPHARMA AVOIDS WASTE OF "ONE PRODUCT/ONE INFRASTRUCTURE" APPROACH       In the "Conventional Model", stem cell companies are started with one basic technology, infrastructure is developed around that                       technology, then if the technology fails, significant resources are lost that have been used in the product-specific development 			  			             Conventional Model   			             Regen BioPharma Model    			  			     Operational Plan 			   Month 1-2: Assembly of Team: Regen intends to assemble a team of world-class leaders in the spheres of Technology, Intellectual Property assessment, valuation and Clinical development. Regen will seek to compile a team of Physician-Scientists with experience in the area of clinical trials for regenerative medicine/stem cell products, Regulatory experts who have successfully taken products through the FDA and corresponding agencies internationally, and Biotech Entrepreneurs who have track records of excellence in business formation and value optimization. -DONE 			  Month 1-4: Inlicensing of Intellectual Property: The Company having already assessed over 20,000 issued patents and havingcompiled a shortlist of 30 targets; Regen will seek to execute licensing deals on an initial core of 3 technologies. Regen focuses onissued patents that have already passed preclinical studies but are not under clinical development. -DONE 			  Month 3-6: Interaction with Regulatory Agencies: Regen intends to develop data packages for each of the technologies andinitiate interaction with Regulatory Agencies such as the FDA for initiation of trials.-DONE 			  Month 6-18: Clinical Implementation: Regen intends to launch clinical trials with world-leading institutions to obtain human safety data and "signal" of therapeutic efficacy.  NEXT UP 			  Month 18-24: Exit: It is intended that technologies "incubated" by Regen will be spun off either as separate companies, or sold to Large Pharma companies seeking to enhance their therapeutic pipeline. 			         "At present there exists a wealth of intellectual property that is 'collecting dust' in the corridors of Academia. Given the field of regenerative medicine and stem cell therapy is so young, and the business models are fuzzy at best in terms of valuation, we see this space as a unique opportunity for acceleration of clinical development/value optimization," said Bio-Matrix Chairman & CEO David Koos about its Regen BioPharma. "Valuations for stem cell companies that have passed the threshold of clinical safety, with signals of efficacy are astronomical. The $1.8 billion Mesoblast-Cephalon deal, as well as recent financings of private companies with as little as 3 patient data such as Promethera ($31 million) or Allocure with 16 patients ($23 million), is testimony to the extremely high valuations that are characteristic of this space." 			   			       Regen BioPharma Pipeline  			  HemaXellerate I™ FDA FILING [Regen BioPharma filed an Investigational New Drug (IND) Application on February 5th, 2013.  Regen BioPharma has received approval from the FDA for the clinical protocol and the product manufacturing information for HemaXellerate I.  On May 9, 2014 Regen BioPharma submitted clarification on animal safety studies that the FDA requested with review anticipated within 30 days.] HemaXellerate I is a cellular therapy designed to heal damaged bone marrow. HemaXellarate I utilizes a collection of cells harvested from the patient’s own adipose (fat) tissue to repair damaged bone marrow and stimulate production of blood cells . The initial application of HemaXellerate I will be the treatment of severe aplastic anemia, a rare and serious condition in which the bone marrow fails to make enough blood cells: red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. In practice, the physician is shipped a kit, which is used to collect adipose tissue. The tissue is sent to a processing facility, and a standardized cellular product is delivered in a ready-to-use manner for administration into the patient intravenously.  **The Company intends to seek Orphan Drug Designation under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983 from the US Food and Drug Administration for HemaXellerate I**   dCellVax™ [Regen BioPharma is currently in the preclinical stage of development for dCellVax and plans to file an Investigational New Drug Application in August 2014]  The dCellVax therapeutic product is based on extracting blood from patients, growing a specialized type of immune cell from the blood called the "dendritic cell" and then subsequently genetically modifying the dendritic cell to become resistant to cancer's immune suppressive activity. It is known that cancer modifies the immune system by producing proteins which result in immune suppression. One such protein which cancer stimulates is an enzyme, indolamine 2,3 deoxygenase (IDO), which cancer turns on in dendritic cells. While dendritic cells are usually immune stimulators, dendritic cells found in cancer patients suppress the immune system as a result of expressing IDO.  The dCellVax therapeutic product uses patents that Regen BioPharma has in-licensed from Dr. Wei-Ping Min coupled with patents in-licensed from Benitec BioPharma.  By utilizing methods covered in both of these patents Regen BioPharma hopes to develop an immune-based, non-toxic cancer treatment initially targeting breast cancer.  HemaXellerate II™ [Regen BioPharma is currently in the preclinical stage of development for HemaXellerate II]  HemaXellerate II is intended to be a universal donor endothelial cell based therapeutic and is intended to be manufactured by obtaining cells from a part of the placenta called the “vascular lobules”. The cells are processed and utilized for the purpose of stimulating bone marrow hematopoetic stem cell repair and proliferation. The mechanism of action for HemaXellerate II is similar to HemaXellerate I whereby the harvested and processed cells would produce growth factors which would mediate the therapeutic effects of the product.  			      Managent Team | Regen BioPharma 			   David R. Koos, PhD, DBA Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  David Koos is the Founder, Chairman & CEO of Entest BioMedical Inc.

His clinical research is focused on using siRNA to inhibit disease modalities, including cancer and organ rejection. He earned graduate and medical degrees from Nanchang University Medical School and the Ph.D. degree from Kyushu University.   David James Graham White, M.D., Ph.D. Dr. White is a member of the Surgery and Immunology faculty of The Schulic School of Medicine, University of Western Ontario. He is one of the leading experts on using regenerative medicine transplant procedures to treat pancreatic conditions, including diabetes. He is also the Chief Scientific Officer of Sernova Corp and was formerly a Therapeutic Area Head for Novartis. He received the B.Sc. degree from the University of Surrey and the M.D. and Ph.D. degrees from Cambridge University.   David A. Suhy, PhD Dr Suhy has a long-term interest in development of shRNA based therapeutics to treat human diseases. He is in the unique position of seeing of directing the research of a RNAi-based therapeutic from its earliest inception until it reaches clinical trials. Development of a shRNA therapeutic against the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) was initiated at Avocel in 2003. Financial constraints caused the company to shutter research operations in 2006.Upon raising venture capital, Tacere Therapeutics acquired the rights to the HCV family of drugs and brought back Dr. Suhy to head the program. Partnered with Pfizer shortly thereafter, this drug is their first foray into gene therapy-based approaches and is the first shRNA program partnered with a large pharma. Given Pfizer’s lack of experience in both areas, Dr. Suhy has played a pivotal role in its development as Tacere has continued to lead the research efforts for advancement of this product into the clinic and has stood side-by-side with Pfizer through all of the regulatory agency meetings.  			  			   			    Current Business Partners | Regen BioPharma                                                                                                                                                                     News and Recent Press Releases:       05/12/2014 12:30 Regen Biopharma, a Majority Owned Subsidiary of Bio-Matrix Scientific Group, Provides Update on HemaXellerate I(TM) IND... 03/06/2014 14:53 Bio-Matrix Scientific Group Inc.

2016
December 16, 2016 SOURCE: PR NEWSWIRERegen BioPharma, Inc., (OTCBB: RGBP) and (PINK: RGBP) announced today identification of a series of compounds that have been identified by biochemical testing which interact with the Company's newly identified immune checkpoint NR2F6. This is the first of a series of steps in developing small molecules which the Company plans to use as a basis for creating "a checkpoint inhibitor pill." Previously, the Company reported that the use of gene silencing of NR2F6 leads to induction of cancer stem cell differentiation, a process that renders malignant cancer cells benign.DOWNLOAD>>>​December 15, 2016 SOURCE: PR NEWSWIRERegen BioPharma Inc. (OTCQB: RGBP), (OTCQB: RGBPP) announced today the filing of a [provisional/nonprovisional] utility patent application with the United States Patents and Trademark Office covering NR2F6-silenced CAR T cells. While previous work demonstrated that methodologies developed by Regen and covered under its issued patent #9,091,696 are useful in stimulation of T cell activity, the current patent further modifies T cells to express molecules that act as a localized "danger signal" to the immune system. CAR T cells are T Cells (T lymphocytes ) which are genetically engineered to produce chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) on their surface. CARs are proteins that allow the T cells to recognize an antigen on targeted tumor cells.DOWNLOAD>>>October 31, 2016 SOURCE: PR NEWSWIRE Regen BioPharma Inc. (OTCQB: RGBP), (OTCQB: RGBPP) today announced its strategy for developing its novel NR2F6 small molecule modulators.

Beginning in March 2016, 5 patients with chemotherapy-induced bone marrow suppression were treated with HemaXellerate and initial 1 month follow up data were provided. Pan Am Cancer Treatment Center has now provided 3 and 6 month follow up data in these same patients. The primary endpoint of the study is safety and the secondary endpoint is effectiveness. Pan Am Cancer Treatment Center has been granted a non-exclusive license to test HemaXellerate in a first-in-human proof of concept study.DOWNLOAD>>>October 19, 2016 SOURCE: PR NEWSWIRE Entest BioMedical's (OTCPINK: ENTB) wholly owned subsidiary Zander Therapeutics, Inc. announced the filing of a patent application covering composition of matter and methods of use related to molecules identified in their small molecule program that activate and inhibit NR2F6 ('Small Molecule Modulators of NR2F6 Activity for Animals').DOWNLOAD>>>September 29, 2016 SOURCE: PR NEWSWIRE Regen BioPharma Inc.

					Full Description



Bio-Matrix Scientific Group, Inc., incorporated on October 6, 1998, through its subsidiary, Regen BioPharma, Inc. (Regen), is focused on the development of regenerative medical applications. The Company focuses on licensing from other entities up to the point of the completion of Phase I and or Phase II clinical trials, after which it intends to sell or license those developed applications or, alternatively, advance the application further to Phase III clinical trials. Its products and services include HemaXellarate I, HemaXellerate II, dCell Vax, NR2F6, Tcellvax and Small Molecules.HemaXellarate IThe Company is focused on the development of HemaXellerate I, a cellular therapy designed to heal damaged bone marrow. HemaXellerate I is a patient-specific composition of cells that have been demonstrated to repair damaged bone marrow and stimulate production of blood cells based on previous animal studies. The initial application of HemaXellerate I will be the treatment of severe aplastic anemia, which is characterized by immune-mediated bone marrow hypoplasia (underdevelopment or incomplete development of a tissue) and pancytopenia (reduction in the number of blood cells and platelets).HemaXellerate IIHemaXellerate II is a version of HemaXellerate. HemaXellerate II is intended to be a universal donor endothelial cell-based therapeutic and is intended to be manufactured by obtaining cells from a part of the placenta called the vascular lobules. The cells are processed and utilized for the purpose of stimulating bone marrow hematopoetic stem cell repair and proliferation. The mechanism of action for HemaXellerate II is similar to HemaXellerate I whereby the harvested and processed cells would produce growth factors, which would mediate the therapeutic effects of the product.dCell VaxdCellVax is intended to be a therapy whereby dendritic cells of the cancer patient are harvested from the body. These cells are treated with plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) that has the ability to block the dendritic cell from expressing indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and subsequently reimplanted in the cancer patient.TcellvaxTcellvax is intended to be an autologous cellular product comprising NR2F6 gene-silenced peripheral blood mononuclear cells. It has been demonstrated that mice genetically deficient for NR2F6 are capable of immunologically rejecting tumors.Small MoleculesThe Company identifies small molecules via a high throughput screening program. This program inhibit NR2F6 leading to immune cell activation for oncology applications.

Bio-Matrix Scientific Group Inc. (BMSN.OB)'s Subsidiary, Regen BioPharma  Announces dCellVax Breast Cancer Immunotherapeutic Product

9/25/2013 9:13:36 AM







SAN DIEGO, CA--(Marketwired - September 25, 2013) -   Bio-Matrix Scientific Group Inc. (OTCQB: BMSN) announced today that its Regen BioPharma subsidiary is currently developing research plans for its breast cancer immunotherapeutic product, dCellVax. This cell therapy is based on patent # 8,389,708 obtained from Dr. Wei-Ping Min of the University of Western Ontario as well as an international patent portfolio licensed from Benitech Biopharma Ltd. 

The dCellVax therapeutic product is based on extracting blood from patients, growing a specialized type of immune cell from the blood called the "dendritic cell" and then subsequently genetically modifying the dendritic cell to become resistant to cancer's immune suppressive activity. It is known that cancer modifies the immune system by producing proteins which result in immune suppression. One such protein which cancer stimulates is an enzyme, indolamine 2,3 deoxygenase (IDO), which cancer turns on in dendritic cells. While dendritic cells are usually immune stimulators, dendritic cells found in cancer patients suppress the immune system as a result of expressing IDO.

Researchers at the University of Western Ontario, led by Dr. Wei-Ping Min, have demonstrated that using a genetic blockade of IDO in dendritic cells makes them resistant to the effects of cancer, and allows them to stimulate potent immune responses against tumors. The use of these modified dendritic cells has been previously demonstrated and published in peer-reviewed journals in the melanoma and breast cancer mouse models(1),(2).

Regen is currently working with the contract research organization (CRO) bioRASI LLC together with Dr. Wei-Ping Min's group at manufacturing human dCellVax. Additionally, the recruitment of David Suhy, PhD from Benitec's subsidiary Tacera to Regen's Scientific Advisory Board will provide in-house clinical translation experience in the area of genetic based therapies. Dr. Suhy was essential in the development of the gene-based hepatitis drug in collaboration with Pfizer. 

Regen identified the following milestones in the anticipated further development of dCellVax:

a) Generation of human dCellVax: 2 months 
b) In vitro demonstration of dCellVax efficacy: 1 month 
c) FDA-requested toxicology: 4 months 
d) IND submission: 1 month 

Regen BioPharma's Chairman & CEO David Koos commented "I am excited to see the progress our company is making. Currently in our pipeline we have two products under development, HemaXellerate (a treatment for aplastic anemia) and now dCellVax (a cancer immuno-therapeutic). I believe these two areas represent a solid foundation for our company."

(OTCQB: BMSN), is a biotechnology company focused on identifying undervalued regenerative medicine applications in the stem cell space and rapidly advancing these technologies through pre-clinical and Phase I/ II clinical trials.

$BMSN NEWS!!!  Quote:SOURCE: Bio-Matrix Scientific Group, Inc.  January 24, 2013 14:53 ET  Regen BioPharma Peer-Reviewed Publication Provides Preclinical Support for HemaXellerate™ Bone Marrow Failure Product  Bio-Matrix Subsidiary's Publication Is Scientific Basis for IND Submission Currently in Preparation  SAN DIEGO, CA--(Marketwire - Jan 24, 2013) - Regen BioPharma, a wholly owned subsidiary of Bio-Matrix Scientific Group Inc. (PINKSHEETS: BMSN), announced today publication in a peer reviewed medical journal the scientific basis for its HemaXellerate™ bone marrow failure product. The manuscript is available at http://www.translational-medicine.com/content/pdf/1479-5876-10-231.pdf. The publication is an overview of the Investigational New Drug (IND) application that the company plans to file for initiating clinical trials.  HemaXellerate™ is a cell therapy product developed by Regen BioPharma that uses fat derived from the patient as a source of "healing cells" to stimulate bone marrow production of blood cells. These "healing cells" are termed "endothelial cells" and are a critical component of the blood production machinery of the bone marrow that is damaged in patients with bone marrow failure.  Intellectual property covering the HemaXellerate™ product include US Provisional Patent applications 61/648898 - Acceleration of Hematopoietic Reconstitution by Placental Endothelial and Endothelial Progenitor Cells and 61/670791 - Treatment of Hematopoietic Disorders filed by Regen, as well as an option to exclusively license issued US Patent #6,821,513.  Currently, the only way to stimulate production of blood from bone marrow is through administration of growth factors. The overall market for growth factors is $18 billion per year. Unfortunately, growth factors require repeated administration, are expensive, and in many patients are ineffective.  "Treatments available today for patients with insufficient bone marrow function are a 'band-aid' solution that require repeated administration and do not address the underlying cause of bone marrow failure," said David Koos, Chairman and CEO of Bio-Matrix, and a co-author of the publication. "We believe that HemaXellerate™ offers the possibility to actually heal damage that has occurred to the bone marrow and thus more naturally treat the core of cause of bone marrow inactivity."  The publication contained data obtained from independent laboratories supporting the use of HemaXellerate™ as an alternative to growth factor therapy and was a co-authored by stem cell pioneers Dr. Amit Patel from University of Utah, and Dr. Michael Murphy from Indiana University. Additionally, the paper was co-authored by companies working in the field of stem cells including Cook Biotechnology and Medistem, Inc.  Regen BioPharma's first indication of HemaXellerate™ will be patients with aplastic anemia who are drug resistant and not eligible for bone marrow transplantation. Demonstration of efficacy in this patient population is anticipated to lead the way for entry into the $18 billion hematopoietic growth factor market which includes conditions such as anemia, thrombocytopenia, and chemotherapy associated leukopenia.
