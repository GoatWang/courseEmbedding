			Ms. Glabe has served since 2011 as the Lead Managing Director for MasterMind Advisory Board ("MasterMind"), a corporation offering advisory services to CEOs and business entrepreneurs. Prior to founding MasterMind in 2011, Ms. Glabe served as a senior executive with Allstate Insurance Company and served as a member of the board of directors of Allstate Life Insurance Company. From 1974 to 2009, she served in various executive positions at Allstate Insurance Company and its affiliates.

Ms. Glabe is a director of FIRST Insurance Funding Corp., Great Lakes Advisors, Wayne Hummer Investments, and The Chicago Trust Company.
Ms. Glabe's work at MasterMind and Allstate gives her in-depth experience managing and providing leadership at sophisticated nationwide organizations in highly regulated businesses, and building and developing new businesses, each of which is critical to the Company. Her knowledge of the insurance industry gives her insight into an area which, through the Company's insurance premium financing business, impacts a substantial and growing portion of the Company's business. In addition, her experience in leadership provides Ms. Glabe with knowledge of the issues faced by large and complex businesses in the financial services industry. As a result of her financial experience, Ms. Glabe qualifies as a financial expert for purposes of rules governing audit committees. Ms. Glabe's experience as a current director of FIRST Insurance Funding Corp. and the boards associated with Wintrust Wealth Management gives her valuable insight to the Company's non-banking operations.
