Surgery Center
[ Preparing for Surgery ][ Language Assistance Notice ][ Patient Satisfaction Form ]
The Congress Orthopaedic Surgery Center, located in Pasadena, is dedicated to providing excellence in orthopaedic, musculoskeletal care in a customer-focused, service oriented environment. Our surgery center is a state-of-the-art, Medicare (CMS) certified, and AAAHC accredited ambulatory surgery provider designed exclusively for outpatient procedures.
Our board certified surgeons and anesthesiologists are supported by a carefully selected and collaborative team of professionals. Our registered nurses and technicians are specially trained in surgical and recovery care. We specialize in same-day surgical procedures that allow our patients to recover at home instead of overnight in the hospital. Personalized care begins the moment a patient enters and continues beyond departure.
Here are some of the outpatient surgeries currently performed at our Surgery Center:
Sport injuries (knee arthroscopies, ACL tears, Achilles tendon tears)
Shoulder injuries (rotator cuff repairs, labral tears and impingement syndrome)
Fracture repair of hand, arm, leg and foot
Foot surgery (bunion, hammer toes, ankle arthroscopy)
Hip surgeries (arthroscopy, labral repairs)
Spine injuries (single level discectomy, laminectomy, cervical fusion: overnight stay)
Hand surgeries (carpal tunnel syndrome, trigger fingers, tendonligament repair)
Pain management (facet block, selected nerve root block, epidural injections)
Our passion is to continuously improve services and positive outcomes. Staying up-to-date with new research, new products and new techniques which may improve present procedures. We provide an atmosphere of compassion and minimize patient or family anxiety. All patients receive the highest quality care from both medical and non-clinical personnel.

            Laser-assisted in situ Keratomileusis, or LASIK as it is more commonly known, allows those with defective vision to improve their natural eyesight, without the use of corrective lenses. It is commonly referred to as laser vision correction or laser eye surgery.LASIK procedures have helped more than 11 million people in America as of 2011. With more than a decade of success to back up the safety and results offered by LASIK, it should definitely be a consideration for anyone who wears glasses or contacts.

        	Top
        	Cost of LASIKHealth insurance typically does not cover LASIK surgery, making it a fairly expensive out-of-pocket expense. Before deciding on a particular provider, be sure to find out all the pricing details.Find the hidden fees: When getting a price quote, one of the most common issues is a double bill. Keep in mind, most providers quote the cost of a single eye. Don’t be surprised if the total cost is twice the original quote.
                                    Forget about discount service: While many providers advertise deep discounts on LASIK surgery, there are a couple of issues with actually getting that price. First of all, most people will not qualify for the deep discount. Those with astigmatism, or who are farsighted rarely enjoy discount pricing. Of course, with vision at stake, deep discounts don’t always inspire confidence.
                                    What are you buying?: The type of surgery also plays an important role in pricing. Laser based procedures are the most expensive, followed closely by Wavefront LASIK with Femtosecond Laser Flap. LASIK with a bladed Microkeratome is the least expensive option, but it may not be available for all candidates.
                                    Types of surgeryThere are more than ten different types of laser vision correction, and LASIK is only one of them. Different types of laser surgery work best with different visual issues, though LASIK is the most common.What are the top three recommended surgeries?: LASIK tops the list, but some facilities might also recommend PRK or LASEK. Both of these alternatives use laser surgery to correct mild to moderate nearsightedness, farsightedness and/or astigmatism.
                                    Why choose laser?: There are other types of surgery, that do not use laser vision correction. They might include a small incision to insert an implant or replace a lens. Unless needed, these surgeries tend to have longer recovery times and a higher incidence of complications.
                                    What makes laser the best option?: Advances in laser technology allow surgeons to map the procedure ahead of time and operate with pinpoint precision. Most procedures are outpatient, so patients leave the same day.
                                    Determining eligibilityBefore going through any of the other challenges related to LASIK, be sure to find out about eligibility. Those with extreme nearsightedness, substantial astigmatism, dry eyes and a variety of other corneal diseases and eye conditions can affect eligibility.Eligible prescriptions: If every prescription requires a different level of corrective lenses, LASIK is probably not a good idea. In order to be eligible, a patient needs to have a stable prescription for at least two years.
                                    Nearsighted vs. farsighted: which one is better for LASIK?: LASIK can correct both nearsighted and farsighted visual issues, but it may not be ideal for every situation. Extreme issues on either side may result in a variety of issues, including the need for refinements or repeat procedures.
                                    Is LASIK best for astigmatism?: LASIK can correct astigmatism, but there may be instances where an implant or alternative laser surgery will offer better results. Be sure to discuss all of the options with a surgeon before settling on LASIK.
                                    Choosing a surgeonWhoever performs the procedure can be as important as the type of procedure chosen to address specific visual acuity issues. When choosing a surgeon, be sure to find one with a good bedside manner, ease when answering questions and extensive experience in their field.Getting comfortable with a doctor: Before trusting a doctor, many patients need to meet with them several times. After all, there is no such thing as minor eye surgery. A small mistake could leave a patient paying in lost vision forever. A good bedside manner can help the patient relax and experience the most trouble free recovery possible.
                                    Easy answers for difficult questions: When a surgeon offers cookie cutter answers that don’t really address underlying concerns, they may not be the right doctor. After all, sometimes the news isn’t great, and they need to offer bad news. When that happens, patients want clear and concise information that gets to the heart of the issues.
                                    Look for experience: With a new procedure, patients might be interested in going with a new doctor, but nothing is a substitute for experience. When choosing a surgeon, be sure to look for someone who has performed thousands of successful procedures.
                                    Financing optionsPaying for LASIK can be challenging, as procedures start in the low $3,000 range and extend upwards depending on the severity of the visual issues. If refinements are needed, the price will continue to skyrocket. This leaves patients struggling to put together enough money to cover the out-of-pocket costs.What about insurance?: Most insurance companies cover glasses or contact lenses, but not LASIK surgery. Be sure to seek pre-authorization and find out what – if any – contribution the insurance company will make.
                                    Do they offer financing?: Many surgical centers offering laser vision correction offer financing options, depending on the patients credit history. They may require a substantial down payment though, so be sure to get all the details before the day of scheduled surgery.
                                    What about refinements?: Who pays if the first procedure doesn’t offer complete results? The best facilities pay at least a portion of the cost involved in any refinement procedures, depending on the original projected results.
                                    Recovery processWithout proper post-surgical care, patients could leave with vision that is worse than when they started. Putting in eye-drops, resting eyes for recommended time frames and making follow-up visits can be the difference between success and failure.Putting in eye drops: Eye drops are a part of the routine care following LASIK. Putting them in without help can be difficult. Be sure to line up assistance with some of these tasks, before scheduling surgery.
                                    Take some time off work: Recovery times can vary, depending on the procedure. Even when a doctor clears a patient for immediate return to work, staring at a computer screen for hours each day, may not be the best way to recover from eye surgery.
                                    Make the follow-ups: Before leaving after surgery, set up all follow-up appointments, and be sure ask about warning signs for which you should make emergency visits. Scheduling transportation in advance can help ensure that patients miss no appointments.
