Cyanotech Names Thomas F. Chen as a Director


KAILUA KONA, Hawaii (June 8, 2011) —  Thomas F. Chen of Lake Forest, Illinois has been elected as a Director  by the Board of Directors of Cyanotech Corporation (Nasdaq Capital  Market: CYAN).  Mr. Chen was determined under Nasdaq rules to be an  independent Director of the Board, which is now comprised of five  independent directors and two management directors.
                “Thomas contributes  extensive line management and operating experience to Cyanotech,  together with keen knowledge of the nutrition market,” said Michael A.  Davis, Chairman of the Board of Cyanotech. “His international experience  is a bonus and we look forward to benefiting from his business savvy  and expertise as we seek to build on Cyanotech’s position as a world  leader in microalgae-based products for human health and nutrition.”
Mr. Chen has over 31 years  of senior executive experience with leading pharmaceutical, nutritional  product and hospital device companies. From 2006 to 2010, he was  President of the International Nutrition Division of Abbott  Laboratories, the worldwide leader in medical nutrition products. Chen  led Abbott’s rapid expansion of its pediatric and medical nutrition  products in the international arena since its establishment as a  standalone division in 2005. Its pediatric nutrition products also hold a  leadership position in key markets around the globe.  Additionally,  Chen spearheaded Abbott’s entry and expansion into emerging markets  including China and other key countries in Asia and Latin America.
Previously, Chen was  appointed Vice President of Abbott’s Asia, Pacific and Africa region  responsible for managing the pharmaceutical, hospital devices and  nutritional businesses in 1998.  Prior to joining Abbott in 1988, Chen  held various management positions with American Cyanamid Company (merged  with American Home Products in 1994). 
From 2004 to 2007, he also  served on the board of the Clara Abbott Foundation, a non-profit  organization that provides educational and financial assistance to  families. In addition he served on the advisory board of Abbott’s Asia  Leadership and Cultural Network, an organization that promotes cultural  awareness and diversity. Chen holds an M.B.A. degree from University of  Indiana in Bloomington, Indiana and a bachelor’s degree in Commerce from  National Cheng Chi University in Taipei, Taiwan.

Investing Insights



Technical Events
PROVIDED BY Recognia AS OF 07/28/2017
Methodology
RECOGNIA METHODOLOGY
Bullish and Bearish Events of the Day provide long/short trading ideas by identifying U.S. stocks that have recently formed a bullish or bearish classic chart pattern. Patterns must have taken at least 35 days to form, which draws out the more significant patterns for intermediate or long-term trend direction. The list is then filtered to include stocks with a minimum $3.00 for bullish and $5.00 for bearish close price; and, a minimum 50,000 trading volume. Most recent patterns are listed first. Patterns on the same date are sorted using Recognia's proprietary quantitative algorithm to draw strong companies to the top, and if further sorting is required (for stocks with the same quantitative analysis result) it is done by trading volume to draw highest volume stocks to the top.

When you think that the  White House couldn’t screw up again, then the unthinkable happens

Donald Trump Junior has put his father and all the white house in quite a pickle, as I have posted several documents on  my Thomas F Cheng Facebook page, and of course what the New York Times has brought to light, and most of all the presidents son is not denying, that there actually was a collusion between himself and a  Russian lawyer that works for the government.

Grounds for impeachment?  if it were a Democrat president I can guarantee you he Would have been already impeached, But like Watergate this procedure will take my personal opinion up to a couple years if not more. 
 But let’s go back a little, and ask ourselves if Donald Trump Junior claims that he is crystal clear, why is it that he never rushed to the FBI immediately letting them know that somebody had contacted him offering him what they did?  Why did he not contact any federal officials in any way whatsoever?  And if it was Donald Trump Junior himself that brought this on the White House, why is it that we have the president of the United States of America studies claiming that this is a witch hunt on the on the media?
 This is a tsunami that just hit the Oval Office!!

Donald Trump to meet with Vladimir Putin today.

Donald Trump to meet with his best friend ever behind closed doors in just a few hours from now.
Along with them will be only two translators and the American translator is under oath that anything that said in the meeting is to be revealed in any way whatsoever. That makes perfect sense!
What will be on the agenda? I can speculate if you want: Trump will offer to remove all sanctions on Russia, will reveal without knowing some of our countries most classified secrets and in exchange he will get absolutely nothing LOL.

It is clear at this time that Pres. Putin is completely in control of the meeting, all his demands will be taken down and executed, and most probably the United States even if they have any demands of their own will be as usual ignored by the ex-Soviet Union KGB officer.
Vladimir Putin wants this meeting so that he can lay down his authority on Donald Trump. I myself find it very hard to understand why it Donald Trump wants to protect this country, but at the same time will sit down with Vladimir Putin and refuse to point his finger and accusing him of leaving the hacking during the 2016 elections.
I know for a fact that nothing will be said or done, if you consider that no sanctions have been given since that hacking attack, no action has been taken no action will ever be taken.
Best friends forever Donnie and Vlad!

Trump’s approval rating plummets after Senate releases health care bill

President Donald Trump’s approval rating plummeted over the weekend as controversy continues to swirl around Senate Republican’s revised health care bill.
Just 38 percent of Americans now say they approve of the job the president is doing in office, a drop of four points in just three days, according to the latest Gallup survey released on Sunday.

Trump’s disapproval also increased by three points up to 57 percent.
After sinking as low as 37 percent a few weeks ago, Trump’s numbers bounced back last week, reaching as high as 42 percent approval — a near month-long high for the president
However, the president’s approval rating began to dive again following the backlash that erupted after Senate Republicans released their revised Obamacare replacement bill.
Not only has the bill faced harsh criticism from Democratic lawmakers, but top Republicans in the Senate including Rand Paul, Ted Cruz and Mike Lee all revealed in a joint statement they were “not ready to vote for this bill.”

“There’s no way we should be voting on this next week. No way,” Republican Sen. Ron Johnson said on Sunday. “I have a hard time believing Wisconsin constituents or even myself will have enough time to properly evaluate this, for me to vote for a motion to proceed. So I’ve been encouraging leadership, the White House, anybody I can talk to for quite some time, let’s not rush this process. Let’s have the integrity to show the American people what it is, show them the truth.”
The president, however, says he remains confident health care reform will get done, and soon.
“I don’t think they’re that far off. Famous last words, right? But I think we’re going to get there,” Trump said in an interview Sunday on FOX News’ “Fox & Friends.”

Trump and Twitter what a circus act

Now don’t get me wrong, I love Twitter, I have my own account under my Thomas F Cheng name as you can see. I have a bunch of social media accounts on all the platforms, it is a matter of fact I love Social Media more than my job or any other activity. However I have never made a complete fool of my self by posting total stupidity. However I can’t talk for everyone and most of all for the President of this great nation of ours.
Every time that the man takes to Twitter he makes a true fool of himself, even more than he actually is. Now he’s tweeting that he’s the victim of an investigation that see’s him in the center of it all. Why worry if you’re clean? The investigators will prove that you have nothing to do with foul-play, so chill, don’t get mad.
Well the word is, he is going to fire the special prosecutor Robert Mueller, that his days are counted and that should actually take place this week. How will that look for Trump after that he fires the man investigating him? Well, with the rest of the world and the large majority of the Americans it would look terrible and would prove in all points his guilt. But to him and the avid trash that supports him it was the right thing to do LOL!
Lets stay on top of this and see where it goes!

What is Comey going to say today?

Well, it’s pretty sure what he is going to state in his live testimony and it seems that the president could get roasted and this time pretty badly. But this is America, so anything could happen really. With the GOP that has the lead in both house and senate you never know.
However, because the whole world is watching and the US wants to keep some and I state some credibility, then maybe whatever is said today, they should act on it and if Trump and his buddies have put there nose where they shouldn’t have then that is Obstruction of Justice and they all need to be removed and punished.
Follow me also on theThomas F chang Facebook page as I’ll be posting during todays show

Donald trumps international tour

He bowed to the Saudi’s, will not physically  but morally he definitely did, of course when there is a $110 billion deal going down his friends say who wouldn’t right?
Then he heads off to Israel and talks about about the Saudi, then he heads off to Palestine and told bad about the Jews, then he goes to Europe at the G7 Summit and basically doesn’t confirm any climate deal and leaves all the European leaders thinking: With this guy I want anyone with us? To the point where the German Chancellor, stated that from now on Europe will have to make its own decisions without the United States and maybe we should look towards Canada as a future ally.
We all saw what Pope Francis thoughts on our gracious president, he couldn’t wait to get the man out of the building LOL!
Then he comes back, like he has always done being viciously attacks the Free Press, but this time like no other time, even if the people that he chose to be in his cabinet are telling him to stop, he continues on a daily basis to unconstitutionally the press TV networks and reporters.
Let’s talk about statistics: Is solid ground all three months ago that sold the president with a 51% approval is now down to 29%, something you telling me many of his fans are abandoning him, and only the foolish are actually still there supporting this man in my personal opinion.
What about Russia-Gate? Why is the White House so quiet about all this? Why are they not saying a word to the press about this? What do they have to hide, or better still how much do they have to hide that we have no idea about? My only hope is that the special prosecutor will not only find the responsible of this treason, but will find in first person the direct involvement of our presidents and he will be impeached immediately.

Impeachment of Trump and his circus when?

Many say that it’s not a matter of “if” but rather “when” will Donald Trump be impeached. Federal investigations bring up every day new facts that the Trump administration was deeply involved in relations with Russia and the hacking that took place during the elections.
A lot of my friends say that Thomas F Cheng (me) could get himself in a lot of trouble for saying certain things, then prove me worng, tell me what I’m saying that is not the truth?… The most wonderful thing about this country is that you can speak your mind as long as you don’t insult someone and thats what I’m doing!!

So yes! He will be impeached as this is the same way Watergate went, who was around back then knows that there is no way out of this, Trump knows and knew the whole time what was going on and that the elections like he stated many times “were rigged” but to his benefit!

What happened with the harsh words Trump used against all Muslims?

The reason why this man won the elections, is because his whole campaign was based on hatred, his whole campaign was based on getting rid of Muslims in the United States and therefore every single ignorant rednecks in the country gave him their vote. The rural parts of the country, that was not a single trailer park where he didn’t win. I am Thomas F Cheng I stand by my words.
This man wanted to block any Muslim from entering the country and then yesterday he sat beside the King of Saudi Arabia, okay, there was $110 billion deal that went down as well so I guess he has to bite his tongue. What happened about cleaning out the swamp, what happened about the wall, what about changing completely and repealing Obama care? One would say that Obama care repealing is right around the corner, but even then you would be wrong, they are delaying it because they know That it will never pass the Senate.

So, besides the hard-core Donald Trump stands that are deaf and blind, the remaining 50% of them that actually gave Donald trump their vote on not really that happy with him, and every day that goes by all the mountain of lies that he said during his campaign all the BS that he filled their minds with never came true at all.
Expect a lot more, expect him to bow down and not follow up in any way whatsoever with what he promised all the trailer trash of this country, That fell for his liesAnd now I’ll pay a dear price just like we all are, just like them but didn’t want this person at the Oval Office.

Was the FBI director getting too close?… YOU’RE FIRED!

Like I stated months ago on the Thomas F Cheng, Trump would have fired Comey, it wasn’t a matter of “IF” but better still “WHEN”. The former FBI director was praised just a few months ago, when he helped Trump win the election, when he came out only 11 days before the elections, stating that he was looking into the Hilary Clinton email scandal once again.
But in the past month, he was investigating the connections between the Russian government and the Trump crew, that go the Donnie a little nervous? Is there something that the Prez didn’t want the FBI to discover? Just look at who he has fired since he made office… I don’t need to put the puzzle together, anyone that actually has a little bit of brain can actually put that together and see whats going on here!

Who’s next on the list?

Bernie Sanders states that the new HC bill will not pass the senate

The new bill, a bill that helps insurance companies get rid of you if you get sick! A bill that will bring back pre-existing cause, so lets say that you’re diabetic and you were before signing up for your health insurance plan, now the company can drop you as soon as the plan is law. Then we have the the new borns, as soon as they’re born, the insurance companies can deny all care in the first 6 months of that son or daughter of yours.
I could go on for days with this BS, this is what the British have called, “The Bill of Evil”. Basically what we have here is that the very rich are the ONLY ones that will have full coverage and the insurance companies will make around 550 Billion a year in savings. So once again, the fools that voted for Trump, will now find themselves in the middle of this…
…Well, if you consider that 71% of veterans voted for him, now their going to close all VA’s and have you put on a health insurance bill, where you’ll pay just like the rest of us. Then the 67% of senior citizens that also voted for the Orange Man. They’ll see themselves rejected from hospitals for old age sickness, that BTW is also in the bill.
So at the end of the day we all lose out, but most of all the idiots that voted him in will pay the biggest price!
Our only hope is like Bernie Sanders said, that to stop this horrible reality at the Senate. They need all Democrats and 5 Republicans to stop it, it seems that they have the numbers, but not a lot will change and all that they’ll do is take it back to the table, make a few pathetic adjustments and then re-propose it again for the next 3 and a half years!
