            What is a Bulletin?












                A Bulletin is the largest standard-sized billboard that delivers maximum exposure to vehicular traffic on expressways, highways and primary arteries. Typically 14 feet high and 48 feet wide, a bulletin provides 672 square feet of space for your ad. Bulletins offer unparalleled visibility.

Large-format advertising structures located on major highways, expressways and primary arteries
Visible to drivers, commuters and long distance travelers
Command your audience’s attention with creative three-dimensional designs, moving parts and extensions












                        Features & Specs








                        Prime Location



Permanent Bulletins often point travelers to the nearest exit for restaurants, lodging and fuel.



Permanent Bulletins remain in high density locations for maximum advantage. They build familiarity with your brand, so customers will think of you when making purchasing decisions. With our Permanent Bulletin package, your ad remains at one fixed location throughout the duration of your campaign (usually one to 12 months).




                        3D Billboard Extensions







Extend your creative into the next dimension with custom 3D extensions.



                            Take your billboard design to the next level by adding three-dimensional embellishments. Lamar Advertising produces custom 3D objects at its printing facility in Baton Rouge. Share your ideas with a Lamar rep, and they will guide you through every step of the process.




                        Amplified Design



Plywood and adhesive vinyl extensions transformed this Bulletin into a larger-than-life drill.



                            Boost the impact of your ad with an extension or “cutout” that goes beyond the rectangular space of the billboard. Add creative extensions up to 5 feet at the top, 2 feet at the side and one foot at the bottom. Extensions are available in the following formats: inflatables, mold making, steel, wood, foam and fiberglass.




                        Cover More Ground



A Rotary Bulletin package gives you a geographic and demographic advantage: you'll cover more ground and reach more people.



                            Reach more people and refresh your audience by periodically moving your advertisement. With our Rotary Bulletin package, we move your advertisement from one Bulletin location to another at stated intervals (usually every 60 to 90 days) within a particular market.










        Spec Sheets
Specs vary by market. Please contact your local Lamar office for availability and specifications.

"I used billboards as part of my advertising plan during my first year of taking over the business I saw a business increase of 10%. With continued use of the billboards the second year business increased 25% to 30%."


                                    Kelly Daniel

"We asked anyone and everyone how they heard about us. So hearing the many of those that came in say, 'we saw your billboards' was like music to our ears. I’d recommend to anyone to purchase billboards as it is a very effective marketing means."


                                    Arriana Beattie

"After commissioning several studies of our market area, the results came back each time showing outdoor media having a greater effect on our customers than we would have ever thought possible. We’ve increased our outdoor exposure five fold!"

"I have noticed a significant increase in my sales since I have started using billboard signs.Customers and other businesses ask me about my signs daily."

"Lamar’s outdoor campaigns have been a huge asset in helping us get our message out. We often ask our visitors and member, 'How did you hear about this?' The answer was always, 'the billboard'."


                                    Sabrina Stamper

"I can't think of any other form of media these days that has the impact of outdoor marketing because every other outlet such as TV, radio and online marketing has become over saturated with options. It certainly has been for us, thanks Lamar!"


                                    Mitch Hedlund

LAMAR MEDIA CORP/DE - 10-K - 19980330 - BUSINESS





ITEM 1.  BUSINESS




GENERAL



Lamar is one of the largest and most experienced owners and operators of
outdoor advertising structures in the United States. It conducts a business
that has operated under the Lamar name since 1902.  As of December 31, 1997,
the Company operated approximately 43,000 outdoor advertising displays in 24
states and, after giving effect to the Company's acquisitions of Ragan Outdoor
and Derby Outdoor in January 1998 and Pioneer Outdoor in February 1998, the
Company operated approximately 47,000 outdoor advertising displays in 26
states.  The Company provides a full array of poster and bulletin displays in
59 of the markets in which it currently operates.  In its remaining markets,
the Company operates high-profile bulletin displays along interstate and other
major highways.  The Company also operates the largest logo sign business in
the United States. Logo signs are erected pursuant to state-awarded franchises
on public rights-of-way near highway exits and deliver brand name information
on available gas, food, lodging and camping services.  The Company currently
operates logo sign franchises in 18 of the 22 states that have a privatized
logo sign program.  As of December 31, 1997, the Company maintained over 22,300
logo sign structures containing over 68,600 logo advertising displays.  In
addition, the Company operates the tourism signage franchises in four states
and the province of Ontario, Canada.  The Company has also expanded into the
transit advertising business through the operation of displays on bus shelters,
bus benches and buses in 13 of its primary markets, three markets in the state
of South Carolina, one market in Utah, and one market in the state of Georgia.


The Company's strategy is to be the leading provider of outdoor advertising in
each of the markets it serves, with a historical emphasis on providing a full
range of outdoor advertising services in middle markets.  Important elements of
the Company's strategy are its decentralized management structure and its focus
on providing high quality local sales and service. In order to be more
responsive to local market demands, the Company offers a full complement of
outdoor advertising services coupled with local production facilities,
management and account executives through its local offices.  Local advertising
constituted approximately 80% of the Company's outdoor advertising net revenues
in 1997, which management believes is higher than the industry average. While
maintaining its local focus, the Company seeks to expand its operations within
existing and contiguous markets. The Company also pursues expansion
opportunities, including acquisitions, in additional markets.  In the logo sign
business, the Company's strategy is to maintain its position as the largest
operator of logo signs

in the U.S. by expanding through the addition of state logo franchises as they
are awarded and through possible acquisitions. The Company may also pursue
expansion opportunities in transit and other out-of-home media that the Company
believes will enable it to leverage its management skills and market position.

BUSINESS STRATEGY




OUTDOOR ADVERTISING



The Company's overall business strategy is to be the leading provider of
outdoor advertising in the markets it serves, with a historical emphasis on
providing a full range of outdoor advertising services in middle markets.  This
strategy includes the following elements:



OPERATING STRATEGY:



HIGH QUALITY LOCAL SALES AND SERVICE.  The Company identifies and closely
monitors the needs of its customers and seeks to provide them with quality
advertising products at a lower cost than competitive media. The Company
believes it has a reputation for providing excellent customer service and
quality outdoor advertising space and displays.


At December 31, 1997, the Company's 231-person sales force was supported by 53
full-service offices. In markets with such offices, the Company has recruited
and trained a skilled sales force, placing an emphasis on market research and
use of artistic creativity. Each salesperson is compensated under a
performance-based compensation system and supervised by a sales manager
executing a coordinated marketing plan. Art departments assist local customers
in the development and production of creative, effective advertisements. The
Company believes repeat sales are evidence that the Company delivers quality
products and services.


CENTRALIZED CONTROL/DECENTRALIZED MANAGEMENT.  Management believes that, in 51
of the 64 markets in which the Company operated at December 31, 1997, the
Company is the only outdoor advertising company offering a full complement of
outdoor advertising services coupled with local production facilities,
management and account executives.  Local offices operate in defined geographic
areas and function essentially as independent business units, consistent with
senior management's philosophy that a decentralized organization is more
responsive to particular local market demands.


The Company maintains centralized accounting and financial control over its
local operations, but local managers are responsible for the day-to-day
operations in each local market and are compensated according to that market's
financial performance. Each local manager reports to one of six regional
managers who in turn report to the Company's Chief Executive Officer.
Management believes empowering local management and sales personnel to respond
to market conditions has been a major factor in the Company's success.


EFFECTIVE INVENTORY MANAGEMENT.  The Company believes that the local presence
of sales personnel contributes to the Company's ability to increase occupancy
rates by attracting and servicing local customers. Additionally, a national
sales office at corporate headquarters allows the Company to package inventory
effectively to take advantage of national advertising campaigns in the
Company's markets. The Company's inventory is managed by state-of-the-art
mapping, charting and accounting software.

MIDDLE MARKET FOCUS.  The Company's leading position in 54 of the 64 outdoor
advertising markets in which the Company operated at December 31, 1997 is a
result of a successful operating strategy dedicated to growth and acquisitions
primarily within the target range of markets having a population ranking
between 50 and 250.  Management believes that operating in these markets
provides certain advantages, including the benefits of a diverse and reliable
mix of local advertisers, geographic diversification and an ability to package
inventory effectively.


EFFECTIVE USE OF TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES.  The Company seeks to capitalize on
technological advances that enhance its productivity and increase its ability
to effectively respond to its customers' needs.  The Company's continued
investment in equipment and technology provides for greater ongoing benefits in
the areas of sales, production and operations.



GROWTH STRATEGY:



INTERNAL GROWTH.  Within its existing markets, the Company enhances revenue and
cash flow growth by employing highly targeted local marketing efforts to
improve display occupancy rates and by selectively increasing advertising
rates.  This strategy is facilitated through its local sales and service
offices, which allow management to respond quickly to the demands of its local
customer base. In addition, the Company routinely invests in upgrading its
existing structures and constructing new display faces in order to provide
quality service to its current customers and to attract new advertisers.


ACQUISITIONS.  Aggressive internal growth is enhanced by focused strategic
acquisitions, resulting in increased operating efficiencies, greater geographic
diversification and increased market penetration.  The Company has demonstrated
its ability to grow successfully through acquisitions, having completed over
106 acquisitions since 1983, 24 of which were completed in 1997.  In addition
to acquiring positions in new markets, the Company purchases smaller outdoor
advertising properties within existing or contiguous markets. Acquisitions
offer opportunities for inter-market cross-selling and the opportunity to
centralize and combine accounting and administrative functions, thereby
achieving economies of scale.  In addition, the Company leverages its
reputation for high quality local sales and service by taking advantage of
opportunities to acquire high-profile bulletin displays that may become
available in larger markets.  The Company believes that there will be future
opportunities for implementing the Company's acquisition strategy given the
industry's fragmentation and current consolidation trends.


During 1997, the Company increased the number of outdoor advertising displays
it operates by approximately 47% by completing 24 strategic acquisitions.
Certain of the Company's principal acquisitions are described below:



PENN ADVERTISING, INC.



On April 1, 1997, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of
Penn Advertising, Inc. ("Penn") for a cash purchase price of approximately
$167.0 million.  Pursuant to the Penn acquisition, the Company acquired a total
of 8,500 outdoor advertising displays throughout the states of Maryland, New
York and Pennsylvania.  On June 3, 1997, the Company sold approximately 1,450
of these displays in Baltimore, Maryland to Universal Outdoor, Inc. for a cash
purchase price of approximately $46.5 million.  The acquisition of Penn
expanded the Company's presence in Pennsylvania and gave the Company an entry
into New York.



MCWHORTER ADVERTISING, INC.



On May 15, 1997, the Company acquired all of the outstanding stock of McWhorter
Advertising, Inc. ("McWhorter") for a cash purchase price of $8.5 million.
Pursuant to the McWhorter acquisition, the Company acquired approximately 1,050
displays in West Virginia.

HEADRICK OUTDOOR, INC.



On June 4, 1997, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of
Headrick Outdoor, Inc. for a cash purchase price of $76.6 million.

Simultaneously with the Headrick acquisition, the Company sold approximately 9%
of the outdoor advertising displays acquired from Headrick for $6.0 million in
cash.  The Headrick acquisition added approximately 3,200 bulletins in ten
southeastern and midwestern states.



NATIONAL ADVERTISING COMPANY



On August 15, 1997, the Company acquired from Outdoor Systems, Inc. ("OSI"),
for a cash purchase price of approximately $116.0 million (excluding
approximately $2.0 million in capitalized costs), certain outdoor advertising
assets that OSI had acquired from National Advertising Company, a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing Company (the "3M
Acquisition").  Pursuant to the 3M Acquisition, the Company acquired
approximately 1,745 bulletin displays in the following ten markets:  Phoenix,
Arizona; Sacramento, California; Denver, Colorado; Atlanta, Georgia;
Louisville, Kentucky; New Orleans, Louisiana; Detroit and Grand Rapids,
Michigan; Kansas City, Missouri; and Houston, Texas.  The acquisition marked
the Company's entry into the states of Arizona, California and Michigan and its
expansion into the 50 largest U.S. markets.



RECENT ACQUISITIONS



In January and February of 1998, the Company acquired Ragan Outdoor, Derby
Outdoor and Pioneer Outdoor for an aggregate cash purchase price of
approximately $50.2 million.  In the Ragan acquisition, the Company acquired
approximately 1,492 outdoor advertising displays in Rockford, Illinois, Cedar
Rapids, Iowa and Quad Cities, Illinois-Iowa.  In the Derby acquisition, the
Company acquired approximately 455 displays Rapid City, South Dakota, and in the
Pioneer acquisition the Company acquired approximately 2,350 outdoor advertising
displays in two additional markets in Missouri.  These acquisitions extended the
Company's operations into the states of Iowa and South Dakota.


In addition, in March 1998 the Company signed a definitive agreement to
purchase the outdoor advertising assets of Northwest Outdoor Advertising,
L.L.C. ("Northwest") for a cash purchase price of approximately $68.5 million.
Northwest operates approximately 4,000 displays out of four primary offices
located in Spokane, Washington, Boise, Idaho, Casper, Wyoming and Billings,
Montana.  The acquisition, which the Company expects to complete in April 1998,
is subject to receipt of regulatory clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 and satisfaction of other customary closing
conditions.  Until such conditions are met, there can be no assurance that the
acquisition will be completed as contemplated.



LOGO SIGNS



The Company entered the business of logo sign advertising in 1988. The Company
is now the largest provider of logo sign services in the United States,
operating 18 of the 22 privatized state logo sign franchises. The Company's
strategy is to continue to be the leading logo sign provider in the country.
The Company also operates the tourism signing franchises in four states and the
province of Ontario, Canada.


Adopting many of the decentralized operational strategies of the outdoor
advertising division, the Company's logo sign division maintains contacts and
local sales offices in each of the states in which it operates. Relationships
with customers are developed and maintained at the state level; accounting, MIS
and certain administrative functions are centralized at the Company's
headquarters.


As the industry leader, the Company has gained significant operating experience
and compiled a database of information it believes is unequalled in this
industry. The Company shares its knowledge and database information with state
highway departments initiating new logo sign programs, and believes this
interaction provides significant advantages when seeking new logo sign
franchises.


6





The Company believes its market-leading position in the logo sign industry will
continue to increase as additional states privatize their logo sign programs
and recognize the track record and core competency of the Company in building
and servicing logo sign programs. The Company plans to pursue additional logo
sign franchises, through both new franchise awards and, possibly, the
acquisition of other logo sign franchise operators. Logo sign opportunities
arise periodically, both from states initiating new logo sign programs and
states converting from government owned and operated programs to privately
owned and operated programs. Furthermore, the Company plans to pursue
additional tourism signing programs in Canada and is seeking to expand into
other state-authorized signage programs, such as those involving directional
signs providing tourist information.



TRANSIT AND OTHER



The Company has recently expanded into the transit advertising business through
the operation of displays on bus shelters, benches and buses in 13 of its
outdoor advertising markets, three markets throughout the state of South
Carolina, one market in Utah and one market in the state of Georgia.   The
Company plans to continue pursuing transit advertising opportunities that arise
in its primary markets and to expand into other markets.


With the growth in wireless communication, particularly the buildout of
personal communications services systems following the recent FCC allocation of
radio spectrum, the Company is exploring ways to realize additional revenue by
contracting with communications providers for use of the Company's billboard
structures to attach transmission and reception devices. The Company has
agreements with four of the largest potential wireless communication service
providers regarding possible future use of its billboards.



COMPANY OPERATIONS




OUTDOOR ADVERTISING




SALES AND SERVICE:



The Company conducts its outdoor advertising operations through local offices
in each of the 64 markets in which the Company operated at December 31, 1997.
Local offices operate in defined geographic areas and function essentially as
independent business units, consistent with senior management's philosophy that
a decentralized organization is more responsive to particular local market
demands and provides greater incentives to employees. The Company's management
policy is one of centralized accounting and financial control coupled with
decentralized sales and production. Local managers in 53 of the Company's
markets are responsible for the day-to-day operations of their office and are
compensated according to the Company's financial performance in that market.
Each local manager reports to one of six regional managers who in turn report
to the Company's Chief Executive Officer.



INVENTORY:



The Company operates the following types of outdoor advertising displays:


BULLETINS generally are 14 feet high and 48 feet wide (672 square feet) and
consist of panels on which advertising copy is displayed. The advertising copy
is either handpainted onto the panels at the Company's facilities in accordance
with design specifications supplied by the advertiser and attached to the
outdoor advertising structure, or printed with computer-generated graphics on a
single sheet of vinyl that is "wrapped" around the structure. On occasion, to
attract more attention, some of the panels may extend beyond the linear edges
of the display face and may include three- dimensional embellishments. Because
of their greater impact and higher cost, bulletins are usually located on major
highways.


7





STANDARDIZED POSTERS generally are 12 feet high by 25 feet wide (300 square
feet) and are the most common type of billboard. Advertising copy for these
posters consists of lithographed or silk-screened paper sheets supplied by the
advertiser that are pasted and applied like wallpaper to the face of the
display, or single sheets of vinyl with computer-generated advertising copy
that are wrapped around the structure. Standardized posters are concentrated on
major traffic arteries.


JUNIOR POSTERS usually are 6 feet high by 12 feet wide (72 square feet).
Displays are prepared and mounted in the same manner as standardized posters,
except that vinyl sheets are not typically used on junior posters. Most junior
posters, because of their smaller size, are concentrated on city streets and
target pedestrian traffic.


For the year ended December 31, 1997, approximately 61% of the Company's
outdoor advertising net revenues were derived from bulletin sales and 39% from
poster sales. The Company regularly donates unoccupied display space for use by
charitable and civic organizations.


The physical structures are owned by the Company and are built on locations the
Company either owns or leases. In each local office one employee typically
performs site leasing activities for the markets served by that office. See
Item 2.  -- "Properties."


Bulletin space is generally sold as individually selected displays, usually
located on an interstate highway or other main road, for the duration of the
advertising contract. Bulletins may also be sold as part of a rotary plan where
advertising copy is periodically rotated from one location to another within a
particular market. Poster space is generally sold in packages called
"showings," which comprise a given number of displays in a market area. Posters
provide advertisers with access either to a specified percentage of the general
population or to a specific targeted audience. Displays making up a showing are
placed in well-traveled areas and are distributed so as to reach a wide
audience in a particular market.  Bulletin space is generally sold for 12 month
periods.  Poster space averages between 30 and 90 days.



PRODUCTION:



The Company's local production staffs in 53 of its markets perform the full
range of activities required to create and install outdoor advertising.
Production work includes creating the advertising copy design and layout,
painting the design or coordinating its printing and installing the designs on
displays. The Company provides its production services to local advertisers and
to advertisers that are not represented by advertising agencies, since national
advertisers represented by advertising agencies often use preprinted designs
that require only installation. The Company's creative and production personnel
typically develop new designs or adopt copy from other media for use on
billboards. The Company's artists also often assist in the development of
marketing presentations, demonstrations and strategies to attract new
advertisers.


With the increased use of vinyl and pre-printed advertising copy furnished to
the outdoor advertising company by the advertiser or its agency, outdoor
advertising companies require less labor-intensive production work. In
addition, increased use of vinyl and preprinted copy is also attracting more
customers to the outdoor advertising medium. The Company believes that this
trend over time will reduce operating expenses associated with production
activities.



CATEGORIES OF BUSINESS:



The following table sets forth the top ten categories of business from which
the Company derived its outdoor advertising revenues for 1997 and the
respective percentages of such revenue. These business categories accounted for
approximately 73% of the Company's total outdoor advertising net revenues in
the year ended December 31, 1997. No one advertiser accounted for more than
3.0% of the Company's total outdoor advertising net revenues in that period.

Beginning in 1992, the leading tobacco companies substantially reduced their
domestic advertising expenditures in response to societal and governmental
pressure and other factors. Because tobacco advertisers tend to occupy displays
in highly desirable locations, the Company historically has been able to
attract substitute advertising for space which has become unoccupied as a
result of reduced tobacco product advertisements, and management believes that
the Company will continue to be able to attract such substitute advertising
should tobacco advertisers further reduce their spending in the future.  Recent
developments in litigation involving the tobacco industry may result in the
elimination of tobacco advertising altogether.  See "Regulation" below and Item

7. - "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results
of Operations -- Risks Affecting Future Operating Results -- Potential
Elimination or Reduction in Tobacco Advertising."



LOGO SIGNS



The Company is the largest provider of logo sign services in the United States
and operates over 22,300 logo sign structures containing over 68,600 logo
advertising displays. The Company has been awarded exclusive franchises to
erect and operate logo signs in the states of Florida, Georgia, Michigan,
Minnesota, Mississippi, Nebraska, New Jersey, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Carolina,
Texas, Utah and Virginia, and through a 66.7% owned partnership in the state of
Missouri.  In addition, the Company has acquired the logo sign franchises in
Kansas, Kentucky, Nevada and Tennessee.  The Company also operates the tourism
signing franchises for the states of Kentucky, Michigan, Nebraska and Ohio as
well as for the province of Ontario, Canada.


State logo sign franchises represent the exclusive contract right to erect and
operate logo signs within a state. The term of the contracts vary, but
generally range from ten to twenty years, including renewal terms. The logo
sign contracts generally provide for termination by the state prior to the end
of the term of the franchise, in most cases with compensation to be paid to the
Company. Typically, at the end of the term of the franchise, ownership of the
structures is transferred to the state without compensation to the Company.
None of the Company's logo sign franchises terminate in the next two years and
three are subject to renewal during that period. The Company expects to be able
to compete effectively for retention of franchises when their terms expire.


The Company also designs and produces logo sign plates for customers throughout
the country, including for use in states which have not yet privatized their
logo sign programs.



EMPLOYEES



The Company employed approximately 1,200 persons at December 31, 1997.  Of
these, 66 were engaged in overall management and general administration at the
Company's management headquarters and the remainder were employed in the
Company's operating offices.  Of these, approximately 231 were direct sales and
marketing personnel.


9





The Company has five local offices covered by collective bargaining agreements,
consisting of painters, billposters and construction personnel. The Company
believes that its relations with its employees, including its 53 unionized
employees, are good, and the Company has never experienced a strike or other
labor dispute.


The Company believes its employee retention record evidences its good employee
relations. The Company offers most employees a range of benefits including a
profit sharing/401(k) plan and life, health and dental insurance.



COMPETITION




OUTDOOR ADVERTISING



The Company competes in each of its markets with other outdoor advertisers as
well as other media, including broadcast and cable television, radio, print
media and direct mail marketers. In addition, the Company also competes with a
wide variety of out-of-home media, including advertising in shopping centers,
malls, airports, stadiums, movie theaters and supermarkets, as well as on
taxis, trains and buses. Advertisers compare relative costs of available media
and cost-per- thousand impressions, particularly when delivering a message to
customers with distinct demographic characteristics. In competing with other
media, outdoor advertising relies on its relative cost efficiency and its
ability to reach a broad segment of the population in a specific market or to
target a particular geographic area or population with a particular set of
demographic characteristics within that market.


The outdoor advertising industry is highly fragmented, consisting of several
large outdoor advertising and media companies with operations in multiple
markets as well as smaller and local companies operating a limited number of
structures in single or a few local markets. Although some consolidation has
occurred over the past few years, according to the Outdoor Advertising
Association of America ("OAAA") there are approximately 600 companies in the
outdoor advertising industry operating approximately 396,000 billboard
displays. In several of its markets, the Company encounters direct competition
from other major outdoor media companies, including Outdoor Systems, Inc. and
Clear Channel Communications, Inc. (formerly Eller Media) both of which have a
larger national network and may have greater total resources than the Company.
The Company believes that its strong emphasis on sales and customer service and
its position as a major provider of advertising services in each of its primary
markets enables it to compete effectively with the other outdoor advertising
companies, as well as other media, within those markets.



LOGO SIGNS



The Company faces competition in obtaining new logo sign franchises and in
bidding for renewals of expiring franchises.  The Company faces competition
from two other national providers of logo signs in seeking logo franchises. In
addition, local companies within each of the states that solicit bids will
compete against the Company in the open-bid process.  Competition from these
sources is also encountered at the end of each contract period. The Company
believes its operations model, which includes local sales offices,
comprehensive databases of information and strategic alliances and its
knowledge of the industry, should provide a competitive advantage in pursuing
future franchises.


In marketing logo signs to advertisers, the Company competes with other forms
of out-of-home advertising. The Company believes, however, that logo sign
advertising offers an effective, low-cost directional advertising service,
which makes it attractive to potential advertisers.


10






REGULATION



Outdoor advertising is subject to governmental regulation at the federal, state
and local levels. Federal law, principally the Highway Beautification Act of
1965 (the "HBA") regulates outdoor advertising on federally aided primary and
interstate highways. The HBA requires, as a condition to federal highway
assistance, states to restrict billboards on such highways to commercial and
industrial areas, and requires certain additional size, spacing and other
limitations. All states have passed state billboard control statutes and
regulations at least as restrictive as the federal requirements, including
removal at the owner's expense and without compensation of any illegal signs on
such highways. The Company believes that the number of its billboards that may
be subject to removal as illegal is immaterial. No state in which the Company
operates has banned billboards, but some have adopted standards more
restrictive than the federal requirements. Municipal and county governments
generally also have sign controls as part of their zoning laws. Some local
governments prohibit construction of new billboards and some allow new
construction only to replace existing structures, although most allow
construction of billboards subject to restrictions on zones, size, spacing and
height.


Federal law does not require removal of existing lawful billboards, but does
require payment of compensation if a state or political subdivision compels the
removal of a lawful billboard along a federally aided primary or interstate
highway. State governments have purchased and removed legal billboards for
beautification in the past, using federal funding for transportation
enhancement programs, and may do so in the future. Governmental authorities
from time to time use the power of eminent domain to remove billboards. Thus
far, the Company has been able to obtain satisfactory compensation for any of
its billboards purchased or removed as a result of governmental action,
although there is no assurance that this will continue to be the case in the
future. Local governments do not generally purchase billboards for
beautification, but some have attempted to force removal of legal but
nonconforming billboards (billboards which conformed with applicable zoning
regulations when built but which do not conform to current zoning regulations)
after a period of years under a concept called "amortization," by which the
governmental body asserts that just compensation is earned by continued
operation over time. Although there is some question as to the legality of
amortization under federal and many state laws, amortization has been upheld in
some instances.  The Company generally has been successful in negotiating
settlements with applicable localities for billboards required to be removed.
Restrictive regulations also limit the Company's ability to rebuild or replace
nonconforming billboards.


To date, however, regulations in the Company's markets have not materially
adversely affected its operations. However, the outdoor advertising industry is
heavily regulated and at various times and in various markets can be expected
to be subject to varying degrees of regulatory pressure affecting the operation
of advertising displays. Accordingly, although the Company's experience to date
is that the regulatory environment can be managed, no assurance can be given
that existing or future laws or regulations will not materially and adversely
affect the Company.


Approximately 9% of the Company's outdoor advertising net revenues and 8% of
consolidated net revenues in 1997 came from the tobacco products industry,
compared to 10% of outdoor advertising net revenues for fiscal 1996, 9% for
fiscal 1995, 7% for fiscal 1994 and 1993 and 12% for fiscal 1992.
Manufacturers of tobacco products, principally cigarettes, were historically
major users of outdoor advertising displays. Beginning in 1992, the leading
tobacco companies substantially reduced their domestic advertising expenditures
in response to societal and governmental pressures and other factors.  There
can be no assurance that the tobacco industry will not further reduce
advertising expenditures in the future either voluntarily or as a result of
governmental regulation or as to what effect any such reduction may have on the
Company.


11





In June 1997 several of the major tobacco companies in the United States and
numerous state attorneys general reached agreement on a proposed settlement of
litigation between such parties.  The terms of this proposed settlement include
a ban on all outdoor advertising of tobacco products commencing nine months
after finalization of the settlement.  The settlement, however, is subject to
numerous conditions, the most notable of which is the enactment of legislation
by the federal government.  Such legislation is still pending before Congress.
At this time, it is uncertain when a definitive settlement will be reached, if
at all, or what the terms of any such settlement will be.  An elimination or
reduction in billboard advertising by the tobacco industry could cause an
immediate reduction in the Company's outdoor advertising revenues and may
simultaneously increase the Company's available inventory.  An increase in
available inventory could result in the Company reducing its rates or limiting
its ability to raise rates for some period of time.  If the tobacco litigation
settlement were to be finalized in its current form and if the Company were
unable to replace revenues from tobacco advertising with revenues from other
sources, such settlement could have a material adverse effect on the Company's
results of operations.  While the Company believes that it would be able to
replace a substantial portion of revenues from tobacco advertising that would
be eliminated due to such a settlement with revenues from other sources, any
replacement of tobacco advertising may take time and require a reduction in
advertising rates.


In addition, the states of Florida, Mississippi and Texas have entered into
separate settlements of litigation with the tobacco industry.  None of these
settlements is conditioned on federal government approval.  The Florida and
Mississippi settlements provided for the elimination of all outdoor advertising
of tobacco products by February 1998 in such states and at such time all of the
Company's tobacco billboards were removed.  The Texas settlement requires the
elimination of all outdoor advertising of tobacco products by June 1998.  The
Company operates 4,253 outdoor advertising displays in seven markets in Florida
and approximately $1.8 million of its approximately $19.2 million in net
revenues in Florida during 1997 were attributable to tobacco advertising.  In
addition, the Company operates 2,532 outdoor advertising displays in three
markets in Mississippi and approximately $.8 million of its approximately $10.6
million in net revenues in Mississippi during 1997 were attributable to tobacco
advertising. The Company operates approximately 3,300 outdoor advertising
displays in six markets in Texas and approximately $.8 million of its
approximately $11.0 million in net revenues in Texas during 1997 were
attributable to tobacco advertising.  Further, the settlement of
tobacco-related claims and litigation in other jurisdictions may also adversely
affect outdoor advertising revenues.

Lamar Media Corp. entered into a Third Restatement Agreement with Lamar Advertising Company certain of Lamar Media’s subsidiaries as Guarantors, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as Administrative Agent and the Lenders named therein, under which the parties agreed to amend and restate Lamar Media’s existing senior credit facility. Pursuant to the Amended Senior Credit Agreement, all outstanding term A loans under the Existing Credit Agreement are repaid in full and all existing revolving commitments under the Existing Credit Agreement are terminated. The Amended Senior Credit Agreement establishes in favor of Lamar Media (i) a new $450 million aggregate principal amount senior secured Revolving Credit Commitment, which will mature on May 15, 2022, (ii) a new $450 million Term A Loan facility, which will mature on May 15, 2022, and (iii) an incremental facility pursuant to which Lamar Media may incur additional term loan tranches or increase its revolving credit facility subject to pro forma compliance with the Secured Debt Ratio (as defined below) financial maintenance covenant. The Amended Senior Credit Agreement also makes certain other changes to the Existing Credit Agreement. Lamar Media borrowed all $450 million in Term A Loans on May 15, 2017. The net loan proceeds, together with borrowings under the revolving portion of the senior credit facility and cash on hand, were used to repay all outstanding amounts under the Existing Credit Agreement. For each Borrowing of Term A Loans, Lamar Media can elect whether such Term A Loans bear interest at (i) the Adjusted Base Rate plus (a) 0.75%, or (b) 0.50% at any time that the Total Debt Ratio is less than 3.25 to 1 as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter for which Lamar Media has delivered financial statements, or (ii) the Adjusted LIBO Rate plus (a) 1.75%, or (b) 1.50% at any time that the Total Debt Ratio is less than 3.25 to 1 as of the last day of the most recently ended fiscal quarter for which Lamar Media has delivered financial statements. In addition, under the Amended Senior Credit Agreement, Lamar Media is required to maintain a Secured Debt Ratio no higher than 3.00 to 1, where “Secured Debt Ratio” is defined as follows: as of any date, the ratio of (i) all Indebtedness of Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media and the Restricted Subsidiaries (determined on a consolidated basis without duplication in accordance with GAAP) on such date that is secured by any liens on any assets of Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media or any Restricted Subsidiary, minus the lesser of (a) $150,000,000 and (b) the aggregate amount of unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of Lamar Advertising, Lamar Media and the Restricted Subsidiaries, determined on a consolidated basis in accordance with GAAP as of such date, to (ii) EBITDA for the period of four consecutive quarters ending on or most recently ended prior to such date for which financial statements are available or were required to be delivered under the Amended Senior Credit Agreement.
