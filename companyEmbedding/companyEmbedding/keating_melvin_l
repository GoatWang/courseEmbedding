               [SatNews] Once this satellite is launched it will provide enhanced services to four continents. Space Systems/Loral (SS/L), a major provider of commercial satellites, today announced that the SES-4 satellite that it designed and built for SES (Euronext Paris and Luxembourg Stock Exchange: SESG) has arrived at the Baikonur Space Center in Kazakhstan, where it will be launched aboard an ILS Proton Breeze M vehicle provided by International Launch Services (ILS). "With SES-4 at launch base, we will soon be ready to provide enhanced services to customers on four continents," said Martin Halliwell, Chief Technology Officer of SES. "We are very happy with our close collaborative relationship with Space Systems/Loral and look forward to a successful launch." SES-4, which will be the largest, most powerful satellite in the SES fleet, is designed to expand and enhance the company's ability to provide Fixed Satellite Services (FSS) to the Americas, Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. The spacecraft is a state-of-the-art, hybrid C- and Ku-band satellite that will replace NSS-7 at 338 degrees East longitude. "This satellite is a reflection of the commitment to quality and performance that SES and Space Systems/Loral share," said John Celli, president of Space Systems/Loral. "We are very pleased that SES-4 is now at launch base and we are continuing to work together on the next satellite to be added to the SES fleet, SES-5." SES-4 is a 20-kilowatt satellite with 52 C-band and 72 Ku-band transponders. It has C-band beams serving the eastern hemisphere of Europe and Africa, full coverage of the Americas, and a global beam to support mobile and maritime customers. Four high-power, regional Ku-band beams will provide service to Europe, the Middle East, West Africa, North America, and South America with extensive channel switching capability between C- and Ku-band transponders for enhanced connectivity. This new satellite is based on the highly reliable Space Systems/Loral 1300 platform and designed to deliver services for 15 years or more.

MagnaChip Semiconductor Corp. and Engaged Capital reach settlement


May 27, 2016
By Eamon Murphy










MagnaChip Semiconductor Corporation entered into a settlement agreement with Engaged Capital, LLC. Under the terms of the agreement, Camillo Martino and Melvin L. Keating will join the company as observers of the board of directors. Based in Korea, MagnaChip makes semiconductor products for high-volume consumer applications.
PRESS RELEASE
SEOUL, South Korea and SAN JOSE, Calif., May 27, 2016 /PRNewswire/ — MagnaChip Semiconductor Corporation (“MagnaChip” or the “Company”) (NYSE: MX), a Korea-based designer and manufacturer of analog and mixed-signal semiconductor products, announced today that it has entered into a Settlement Agreement with Engaged Capital, LLC (“Engaged Capital”).  Under the terms of the agreement, Camillo Martino and Melvin L. Keating will immediately join the Company as observers of the Company’s Board of Directors (the “Board”).  In addition, the Company will nominate Mr. Martino for election to the Board at the Company’s 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, together with six of MagnaChip’s incumbent directors, who will stand for reelection.  Immediately after the 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Board will appoint Mr. Keating as a director. Both Messrs. Martino and Keating will serve on the Board’s Strategic Review Committee upon becoming members of the Board. 





“We welcome the addition of Camillo and Mel to the MagnaChip board.  MagnaChip’s business continues to strengthen and over the last year, we have materially reduced operating costs and improved fab utilization.  The board looks forward to leveraging both Camillo and Mel’s combined experience managing semiconductor businesses as we work to continue to enhance the value of MagnaChip for our shareholders,” stated Doug Norby, Chairman of the Board of MagnaChip Corporation.







“We were pleased to have been able to continue the constructive interaction we have enjoyed with the MagnaChip Board over the last year in adding Camillo and Mel as directors.  As strong shareholder advocates and experienced semiconductor executives and dealmakers, we have confidence Camillio and Mel will work effectively with the rest of the board to optimize the value of MagnaChip for shareholders,” said Glenn W. Welling, Founder and CIO of Engaged Capital.
After the appointment of Mr. Keating to the Board following the 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, the Board will be comprised of eight directors, each of whom is elected annually, and the Company agreed not to increase the size of the Board beyond ten directors during the term of the Settlement Agreement.  The Company will present its director nominees in its definitive proxy materials, which will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in due course.  Pursuant to the Settlement Agreement, Engaged Capital has agreed to withdraw its notice of intent to nominate directors at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, to vote all of its shares in favor of the Company’s nominees and, so long as Institutional Shareholder Services concurs, in favor of the Board’s recommendation related to certain ordinary business presented at the 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders. Engaged Capital has also agreed to a customary standstill provision. 





MagnaChip’s 2016 Annual Meeting of Stockholders has not yet been scheduled. MagnaChip stockholders are not required to take any action at this time.
