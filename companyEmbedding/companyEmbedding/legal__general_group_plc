History[edit]
1836 to 2000[edit]
Legal & General was formed by Sergeant John Adams and five other lawyers in June 1836 in a Chancery Lane coffee shop.[4] Originally called the New Law Life Assurance Society, the society was restricted to those in the legal profession. The name was changed to Legal & General Life Assurance Society to reflect that policies were available to the general public but with share ownership restricted to those in the legal profession. The group expanded in the UK and soon began to acquire overseas life assurance companies, purchasing a pensions business from the Metropolitan Life Assurance Company of New York in the 1930s.[4]
The society became a wholly owned division of Legal & General Group plc in the 1970s.[5] It bought Government Employee Life Insurance from GEICO in the USA (renamed Banner Life) and the Dutch branch of Unlike Assurance Group and also set up business in France during the 1980s.[5]




The former Legal & General logo






Entrance to Legal & General's offices, Furze Hill, Kingswood


In the 1940s the main office of Legal & General was moved from Temple Bar House in the City of London to a remodelled former girls' school in leafy Kingswood, Surrey, save for some top management functions which remained in London. The girls' school (St. Monica's), which formed the basis for the site, was attended by the novelist Vera Brittain, mother of the politician Shirley Williams.[6] The Kingswood site, which included sports fields, a park, a large and luxurious swimming pool, a canteen and a simulacrum of an English pub, among other facilities, was expanded in the 1950s and again in the 1980s.[7] In 2015, it was announced that the headquarters would close "potentially before 2025".[8][9] In fact, after a period of uncertainty for the staff at Kingswood,[10] it was announced that the site would shut much earlier, in 2018.[11]
The previous Legal & General logo incorporates the image of the Temple Bar (which is still used in the logo of the company's social and athletic committee), and the founding date. The umbrella logo used today was introduced by former Chief Press Officer Gordon Macdonald in June 1984. Between 1991 and 1994, Legal and General sponsored the Regional Weather Forecasts for the ITV network and in 1999, Legal & General announced plans, which never came to fruition, to merge its business with National Westminster Bank to form the first 'bancassurance' company in the UK.[12]
2000 to present[edit]
The company sold the Legal & General Bank and Legal & General Mortgage Services to Northern Rock in 2003[13] and sold its stake in Gresham Insurance, its joint venture with Barclays Bank, to Barclays in 2005.[14]
In 2008 Legal & General bought Suffolk Life, a provider of Self Invested Pension products,[15] sold Suffolk Life in 2016 and also outsourced its IT development areas to TCS (Tata Consultancy Services).[16] The company formed a joint venture with two Indian public sector banks, Bank of Baroda and Andhra Bank to launch IndiaFirst Life Insurance Company in India in 2009[17] and outsourced some IT areas to IBM in October 2010.[18]
In 2014, the company formed Legal & General Reinsurance, a Bermudian-based reinsurance company. Legal & General Re completed its maiden external transaction in the Dutch market in cooperation with Hannover Re in December 2015.[19] Legal & General has expanded its operations in the last five years, taking over Lucida Life in 2013 and acquiring the £3 billion UK annuity portfolio of Aegon in 2016. Since 2014, the company has sought out better returns on its annuity and shareholder funds by committing to invest £15 billion in UK infrastructure projects such as urban regeneration, housing, clean energy and small business finance. This has involved the group partnering with many financial organisations, including the Dutch pension fund, PGGM and Pemberton Asset Management.
Operations[edit]
The company offers a wide range of products for individuals and corporate businesses. Its investment management is the UK’s largest investment manager of UK pension fund assets and has a growing US business, based in Chicago, Illinois. Legal & General’s core business focuses upon helping companies provide pension benefits for employees. As well as being one of the UK’s largest providers of auto-enrolled pension pensions, with over 2.2 million customers, the group also helps companies with defined benefit pension schemes meet their liabilities through investment strategies and even taking over the liability to pay company pensions.
Legal & General’s life insurance business is the UK’s largest, providing cover for both individuals and companies. The group is seeking to expand its life insurance businesses in the US and India.
Legal & General is planning to help provide solutions for the UK’s housing shortage through its investments in building new homes to buy and to rent. The company’s range of construction initiatives, includes establishing a pioneering high-tech modular housing factory in Yorkshire.
Senior management[edit]
In the 1970s and early 1980s, Ron Peet, a socially-conscious actuary, was CEO of Legal & General, having previously headed its Australian operation.[20] Peet helped the campaign for Thalidomide children, Legal & General then owning a large bloc of shares (3.5 million) in Distillers.[21][22]
Dr Nigel Wilson (the previous CFO) became Group Chief Executive on 30 June 2012.[23] He succeeded Tim Breedon, who had been CEO since 1 January 2006 and who was paid an annual salary of £770,000.[24]
Other senior management include Jeff Davies (Group Chief Financial Officer), Mark Zinkula (CEO of Legal & General Investment Management, the investment management arm of the firm) and Kerrigan Procter, (CEO of the group’s retirement business). Together with Nigel Wilson they form Legal & General's executive board.[25]

History[edit]
1836 to 2000[edit]
Legal & General was formed by Sergeant John Adams and five other lawyers in June 1836 in a Chancery Lane coffee shop.[4] Originally called the New Law Life Assurance Society, the society was restricted to those in the legal profession. The name was changed to Legal & General Life Assurance Society to reflect that policies were available to the general public but with share ownership restricted to those in the legal profession. The group expanded in the UK and soon began to acquire overseas life assurance companies, purchasing a pensions business from the Metropolitan Life Assurance Company of New York in the 1930s.[4]
The society became a wholly owned division of Legal & General Group plc in the 1970s.[5] It bought Government Employee Life Insurance from GEICO in the USA (renamed Banner Life) and the Dutch branch of Unlike Assurance Group and also set up business in France during the 1980s.[5]

In the 1940s the main office of Legal & General was moved from Temple Bar House in the City of London to a remodelled former girls' school in leafy Kingswood, Surrey, save for some top management functions which remained in London. The girls' school (St. Monica's), which formed the basis for the site, was attended by the novelist Vera Brittain, mother of the politician Shirley Williams.[6] The Kingswood site, which included sports fields, a park, a large and luxurious swimming pool, a canteen and a simulacrum of an English pub, among other facilities, was expanded in the 1950s and again in the 1980s.[7] In 2015, it was announced that the headquarters would close "potentially before 2025".[8][9] In fact, after a period of uncertainty for the staff at Kingswood,[10] it was announced that the site would shut much earlier, in 2018.[11]
The previous Legal & General logo incorporates the image of the Temple Bar (which is still used in the logo of the company's social and athletic committee), and the founding date. The umbrella logo used today was introduced by former Chief Press Officer Gordon Macdonald in June 1984. Between 1991 and 1994, Legal and General sponsored the Regional Weather Forecasts for the ITV network and in 1999, Legal & General announced plans, which never came to fruition, to merge its business with National Westminster Bank to form the first 'bancassurance' company in the UK.[12]
2000 to present[edit]
The company sold the Legal & General Bank and Legal & General Mortgage Services to Northern Rock in 2003[13] and sold its stake in Gresham Insurance, its joint venture with Barclays Bank, to Barclays in 2005.[14]
In 2008 Legal & General bought Suffolk Life, a provider of Self Invested Pension products,[15] sold Suffolk Life in 2016 and also outsourced its IT development areas to TCS (Tata Consultancy Services).[16] The company formed a joint venture with two Indian public sector banks, Bank of Baroda and Andhra Bank to launch IndiaFirst Life Insurance Company in India in 2009[17] and outsourced some IT areas to IBM in October 2010.[18]
In 2014, the company formed Legal & General Reinsurance, a Bermudian-based reinsurance company. Legal & General Re completed its maiden external transaction in the Dutch market in cooperation with Hannover Re in December 2015.[19] Legal & General has expanded its operations in the last five years, taking over Lucida Life in 2013 and acquiring the £3 billion UK annuity portfolio of Aegon in 2016. Since 2014, the company has sought out better returns on its annuity and shareholder funds by committing to invest £15 billion in UK infrastructure projects such as urban regeneration, housing, clean energy and small business finance. This has involved the group partnering with many financial organisations, including the Dutch pension fund, PGGM and Pemberton Asset Management.
Operations[edit]
The company offers a wide range of products for individuals and corporate businesses. Its investment management is the UK’s largest investment manager of UK pension fund assets and has a growing US business, based in Chicago, Illinois. Legal & General’s core business focuses upon helping companies provide pension benefits for employees. As well as being one of the UK’s largest providers of auto-enrolled pension pensions, with over 2.2 million customers, the group also helps companies with defined benefit pension schemes meet their liabilities through investment strategies and even taking over the liability to pay company pensions.
Legal & General’s life insurance business is the UK’s largest, providing cover for both individuals and companies. The group is seeking to expand its life insurance businesses in the US and India.
Legal & General is planning to help provide solutions for the UK’s housing shortage through its investments in building new homes to buy and to rent. The company’s range of construction initiatives, includes establishing a pioneering high-tech modular housing factory in Yorkshire.
Senior management[edit]
In the 1970s and early 1980s, Ron Peet, a socially-conscious actuary, was CEO of Legal & General, having previously headed its Australian operation.[20] Peet helped the campaign for Thalidomide children, Legal & General then owning a large bloc of shares (3.5 million) in Distillers.[21][22]
Dr Nigel Wilson (the previous CFO) became Group Chief Executive on 30 June 2012.[23] He succeeded Tim Breedon, who had been CEO since 1 January 2006 and who was paid an annual salary of £770,000.[24]

The umbrella logo used today was introduced by former Chief Press Officer Gordon Macdonald in June 1984. Between 1991 and 1994, Legal and General sponsored the Regional Weather Forecasts for the ITV network and in 1999, Legal & General announced plans, which never came to fruition, to merge its business with National Westminster Bank to form the first 'bancassurance' company in the UK.[12]
2000 to present[edit]
The company sold the Legal & General Bank and Legal & General Mortgage Services to Northern Rock in 2003[13] and sold its stake in Gresham Insurance, its joint venture with Barclays Bank, to Barclays in 2005.[14]
In 2008 Legal & General bought Suffolk Life, a provider of Self Invested Pension products,[15] sold Suffolk Life in 2016 and also outsourced its IT development areas to TCS (Tata Consultancy Services).[16] The company formed a joint venture with two Indian public sector banks, Bank of Baroda and Andhra Bank to launch IndiaFirst Life Insurance Company in India in 2009[17] and outsourced some IT areas to IBM in October 2010.[18]
In 2014, the company formed Legal & General Reinsurance, a Bermudian-based reinsurance company. Legal & General Re completed its maiden external transaction in the Dutch market in cooperation with Hannover Re in December 2015.[19] Legal & General has expanded its operations in the last five years, taking over Lucida Life in 2013 and acquiring the £3 billion UK annuity portfolio of Aegon in 2016. Since 2014, the company has sought out better returns on its annuity and shareholder funds by committing to invest £15 billion in UK infrastructure projects such as urban regeneration, housing, clean energy and small business finance. This has involved the group partnering with many financial organisations, including the Dutch pension fund, PGGM and Pemberton Asset Management.
Operations[edit]
The company offers a wide range of products for individuals and corporate businesses. Its investment management is the UK’s largest investment manager of UK pension fund assets and has a growing US business, based in Chicago, Illinois. Legal & General’s core business focuses upon helping companies provide pension benefits for employees. As well as being one of the UK’s largest providers of auto-enrolled pension pensions, with over 2.2 million customers, the group also helps companies with defined benefit pension schemes meet their liabilities through investment strategies and even taking over the liability to pay company pensions.
Legal & General’s life insurance business is the UK’s largest, providing cover for both individuals and companies. The group is seeking to expand its life insurance businesses in the US and India.
Legal & General is planning to help provide solutions for the UK’s housing shortage through its investments in building new homes to buy and to rent. The company’s range of construction initiatives, includes establishing a pioneering high-tech modular housing factory in Yorkshire.
Senior management[edit]
In the 1970s and early 1980s, Ron Peet, a socially-conscious actuary, was CEO of Legal & General, having previously headed its Australian operation.[20] Peet helped the campaign for Thalidomide children, Legal & General then owning a large bloc of shares (3.5 million) in Distillers.[21][22]
Dr Nigel Wilson (the previous CFO) became Group Chief Executive on 30 June 2012.[23] He succeeded Tim Breedon, who had been CEO since 1 January 2006 and who was paid an annual salary of £770,000.[24]
Other senior management include Jeff Davies (Group Chief Financial Officer), Mark Zinkula (CEO of Legal & General Investment Management, the investment management arm of the firm) and Kerrigan Procter, (CEO of the group’s retirement business). Together with Nigel Wilson they form Legal & General's executive board.[25]

JV Partners Of Indiafirst Life Insurance Reported Exploring Strategic Options
Jun 12 17
JV partners of IndiaFirst Life Insurance Company Limited reportedly are exploring strategic options. ET NOW learns that a mega deal is brewing in IndiaFirst Life Insurance, which is a three-way joint venture between Bank of Baroda (BSE:532134), Legal & General Group Plc (LSE:LGEN) and Andhra Bank (BSE:532418). According to two sources familiar with the proposed transaction who spoke on the condition of anonymity, the JV partners are currently exploring multiple strategic options which could include either a potential partial stake sale or even a potential exit based on the progress of the discussions. "JV partners are considering various strategic options, but no plans have been finalised as yet by them. As part of preliminary negotiations, talks have been held with prospective suitors like Reliance Nippon Life Insurance Company Limited," said one of the two sources. "AMBIT Capital Private Limited has been roped in to advice on the strategic options suitable for each of the JV partners. For instance, Legal & General Group is reconsidering its emerging markets strategy and is believed to be eyeing an exit," added the second source cited above. Ambit Capital declined to comment on market speculation while IndiaFirst Life Insurance said, "IndiaFirst Life Insurance has had no discussions with any insurance company, nor has appointed any advisor for any such arrangement."

Group Protection.


For 85 years, we've been providing protection to companies who use us to protect their most valuable asset, their employees.
We know that every company is different, so as an employer you can rely on us to quickly and effectively set up and tailor a protection scheme that works for you. Plus, our award winning products and services combined with our passion for treating our customers fairly means you can trust us to deliver financial security to your employees when it really matters.


Our productsThe benefit

Group Life Assurance and Dependants' Pensions
A lump sum benefit that is normally paid tax free up to the lifetime allowance or as a dependants pension, or both when an insured employee dies in service.


Group Income Protection
It can replace lost income due to long term illness or injury. Where appropriate, we can provide early intervention and rehabilitation.


Group Critical Illness Cover
A tax free lump sum benefit for insured employees who suffer from an insured condition, and survive a set time period.


Flexible benefits
We offer a range of flexible protection benefits that can be designed to suit your budget and scheme set up, plus give employees the choice of selecting their own level of cover, within agreed limits.


Ill Health Early Retirement Benefit
Defined benefit pension schemes can face large and unexpected costs when a member retires early because of ill health. Our insurance policy helps businesses de-risk, budget and plan for this unpredictable liability.



Worklife Solutions
Whether you're switching your Group Protection scheme to us or it's your first scheme, it's important to appreciate the collection of benefits that you can take advantage of.
Our Worklife solutions provide a rewarding component to our proposition and enables you to provide your employees with much more.

History[edit]
1836 to 2000[edit]
Legal & General was formed by Sergeant John Adams and five other lawyers in June 1836 in a Chancery Lane coffee shop.[4] Originally called the New Law Life Assurance Society, the society was restricted to those in the legal profession. The name was changed to Legal & General Life Assurance Society to reflect that policies were available to the general public but with share ownership restricted to those in the legal profession. The group expanded in the UK and soon began to acquire overseas life assurance companies, purchasing a pensions business from the Metropolitan Life Assurance Company of New York in the 1930s.[4]
The society became a wholly owned division of Legal & General Group plc in the 1970s.[5] It bought Government Employee Life Insurance from GEICO in the USA (renamed Banner Life) and the Dutch branch of Unlike Assurance Group and also set up business in France during the 1980s.[5]

Entrance to Legal & General's offices, Furze Hill, Kingswood


In the 1940s the main office of Legal & General was moved from Temple Bar House in the City of London to a remodelled former girls' school in leafy Kingswood, Surrey, save for some top management functions which remained in London. The girls' school (St. Monica's), which formed the basis for the site, was attended by the novelist Vera Brittain, mother of the politician Shirley Williams.[6] The Kingswood site, which included sports fields, a park, a large and luxurious swimming pool, a canteen and a simulacrum of an English pub, among other facilities, was expanded in the 1950s and again in the 1980s.[7] In 2015, it was announced that the headquarters would close "potentially before 2025".[8][9] In fact, after a period of uncertainty for the staff at Kingswood,[10] it was announced that the site would shut much earlier, in 2018.[11]
The previous Legal & General logo incorporates the image of the Temple Bar (which is still used in the logo of the company's social and athletic committee), and the founding date. The umbrella logo used today was introduced by former Chief Press Officer Gordon Macdonald in June 1984. Between 1991 and 1994, Legal and General sponsored the Regional Weather Forecasts for the ITV network and in 1999, Legal & General announced plans, which never came to fruition, to merge its business with National Westminster Bank to form the first 'bancassurance' company in the UK.[12]
2000 to present[edit]
The company sold the Legal & General Bank and Legal & General Mortgage Services to Northern Rock in 2003[13] and sold its stake in Gresham Insurance, its joint venture with Barclays Bank, to Barclays in 2005.[14]
In 2008 Legal & General bought Suffolk Life, a provider of Self Invested Pension products,[15] sold Suffolk Life in 2016 and also outsourced its IT development areas to TCS (Tata Consultancy Services).[16] The company formed a joint venture with two Indian public sector banks, Bank of Baroda and Andhra Bank to launch IndiaFirst Life Insurance Company in India in 2009[17] and outsourced some IT areas to IBM in October 2010.[18]
In 2014, the company formed Legal & General Reinsurance, a Bermudian-based reinsurance company. Legal & General Re completed its maiden external transaction in the Dutch market in cooperation with Hannover Re in December 2015.[19] Legal & General has expanded its operations in the last five years, taking over Lucida Life in 2013 and acquiring the £3 billion UK annuity portfolio of Aegon in 2016. Since 2014, the company has sought out better returns on its annuity and shareholder funds by committing to invest £15 billion in UK infrastructure projects such as urban regeneration, housing, clean energy and small business finance. This has involved the group partnering with many financial organisations, including the Dutch pension fund, PGGM and Pemberton Asset Management.
Operations[edit]
The company offers a wide range of products for individuals and corporate businesses. Its investment management is the UK’s largest investment manager of UK pension fund assets and has a growing US business, based in Chicago, Illinois. Legal & General’s core business focuses upon helping companies provide pension benefits for employees. As well as being one of the UK’s largest providers of auto-enrolled pension pensions, with over 2.2 million customers, the group also helps companies with defined benefit pension schemes meet their liabilities through investment strategies and even taking over the liability to pay company pensions.
Legal & General’s life insurance business is the UK’s largest, providing cover for both individuals and companies. The group is seeking to expand its life insurance businesses in the US and India.
Legal & General is planning to help provide solutions for the UK’s housing shortage through its investments in building new homes to buy and to rent. The company’s range of construction initiatives, includes establishing a pioneering high-tech modular housing factory in Yorkshire.
Senior management[edit]
In the 1970s and early 1980s, Ron Peet, a socially-conscious actuary, was CEO of Legal & General, having previously headed its Australian operation.[20] Peet helped the campaign for Thalidomide children, Legal & General then owning a large bloc of shares (3.5 million) in Distillers.[21][22]
Dr Nigel Wilson (the previous CFO) became Group Chief Executive on 30 June 2012.[23] He succeeded Tim Breedon, who had been CEO since 1 January 2006 and who was paid an annual salary of £770,000.[24]
Other senior management include Jeff Davies (Group Chief Financial Officer), Mark Zinkula (CEO of Legal & General Investment Management, the investment management arm of the firm) and Kerrigan Procter, (CEO of the group’s retirement business). Together with Nigel Wilson they form Legal & General's executive board.[25]

The group expanded in the UK and soon began to acquire overseas life assurance companies, purchasing a pensions business from the Metropolitan Life Assurance Company of New York in the 1930s.[4]
The society became a wholly owned division of Legal & General Group plc in the 1970s.[5] It bought Government Employee Life Insurance from GEICO in the USA (renamed Banner Life) and the Dutch branch of Unlike Assurance Group and also set up business in France during the 1980s.[5]

Entrance to Legal & General's offices, Furze Hill, Kingswood


In the 1940s the main office of Legal & General was moved from Temple Bar House in the City of London to a remodelled former girls' school in leafy Kingswood, Surrey, save for some top management functions which remained in London. The girls' school (St. Monica's), which formed the basis for the site, was attended by the novelist Vera Brittain, mother of the politician Shirley Williams.[6] The Kingswood site, which included sports fields, a park, a large and luxurious swimming pool, a canteen and a simulacrum of an English pub, among other facilities, was expanded in the 1950s and again in the 1980s.[7] In 2015, it was announced that the headquarters would close "potentially before 2025".[8][9] In fact, after a period of uncertainty for the staff at Kingswood,[10] it was announced that the site would shut much earlier, in 2018.[11]
The previous Legal & General logo incorporates the image of the Temple Bar (which is still used in the logo of the company's social and athletic committee), and the founding date. The umbrella logo used today was introduced by former Chief Press Officer Gordon Macdonald in June 1984. Between 1991 and 1994, Legal and General sponsored the Regional Weather Forecasts for the ITV network and in 1999, Legal & General announced plans, which never came to fruition, to merge its business with National Westminster Bank to form the first 'bancassurance' company in the UK.[12]
2000 to present[edit]
The company sold the Legal & General Bank and Legal & General Mortgage Services to Northern Rock in 2003[13] and sold its stake in Gresham Insurance, its joint venture with Barclays Bank, to Barclays in 2005.[14]
In 2008 Legal & General bought Suffolk Life, a provider of Self Invested Pension products,[15] sold Suffolk Life in 2016 and also outsourced its IT development areas to TCS (Tata Consultancy Services).[16] The company formed a joint venture with two Indian public sector banks, Bank of Baroda and Andhra Bank to launch IndiaFirst Life Insurance Company in India in 2009[17] and outsourced some IT areas to IBM in October 2010.[18]
In 2014, the company formed Legal & General Reinsurance, a Bermudian-based reinsurance company. Legal & General Re completed its maiden external transaction in the Dutch market in cooperation with Hannover Re in December 2015.[19] Legal & General has expanded its operations in the last five years, taking over Lucida Life in 2013 and acquiring the £3 billion UK annuity portfolio of Aegon in 2016. Since 2014, the company has sought out better returns on its annuity and shareholder funds by committing to invest £15 billion in UK infrastructure projects such as urban regeneration, housing, clean energy and small business finance. This has involved the group partnering with many financial organisations, including the Dutch pension fund, PGGM and Pemberton Asset Management.
Operations[edit]
The company offers a wide range of products for individuals and corporate businesses. Its investment management is the UK’s largest investment manager of UK pension fund assets and has a growing US business, based in Chicago, Illinois. Legal & General’s core business focuses upon helping companies provide pension benefits for employees. As well as being one of the UK’s largest providers of auto-enrolled pension pensions, with over 2.2 million customers, the group also helps companies with defined benefit pension schemes meet their liabilities through investment strategies and even taking over the liability to pay company pensions.
Legal & General’s life insurance business is the UK’s largest, providing cover for both individuals and companies. The group is seeking to expand its life insurance businesses in the US and India.
Legal & General is planning to help provide solutions for the UK’s housing shortage through its investments in building new homes to buy and to rent. The company’s range of construction initiatives, includes establishing a pioneering high-tech modular housing factory in Yorkshire.
Senior management[edit]
In the 1970s and early 1980s, Ron Peet, a socially-conscious actuary, was CEO of Legal & General, having previously headed its Australian operation.[20] Peet helped the campaign for Thalidomide children, Legal & General then owning a large bloc of shares (3.5 million) in Distillers.[21][22]
Dr Nigel Wilson (the previous CFO) became Group Chief Executive on 30 June 2012.[23] He succeeded Tim Breedon, who had been CEO since 1 January 2006 and who was paid an annual salary of £770,000.[24]
Other senior management include Jeff Davies (Group Chief Financial Officer), Mark Zinkula (CEO of Legal & General Investment Management, the investment management arm of the firm) and Kerrigan Procter, (CEO of the group’s retirement business). Together with Nigel Wilson they form Legal & General's executive board.[25]

History[edit]
1836 to 2000[edit]
Legal & General was formed by Sergeant John Adams and five other lawyers in June 1836 in a Chancery Lane coffee shop.[4] Originally called the New Law Life Assurance Society, the society was restricted to those in the legal profession. The name was changed to Legal & General Life Assurance Society to reflect that policies were available to the general public but with share ownership restricted to those in the legal profession. The group expanded in the UK and soon began to acquire overseas life assurance companies, purchasing a pensions business from the Metropolitan Life Assurance Company of New York in the 1930s.[4]
The society became a wholly owned division of Legal & General Group plc in the 1970s.[5] It bought Government Employee Life Insurance from GEICO in the USA (renamed Banner Life) and the Dutch branch of Unlike Assurance Group and also set up business in France during the 1980s.[5]




The former Legal & General logo






Entrance to Legal & General's offices, Furze Hill, Kingswood


In the 1940s the main office of Legal & General was moved from Temple Bar House in the City of London to a remodelled former girls' school in leafy Kingswood, Surrey, save for some top management functions which remained in London. The girls' school (St. Monica's), which formed the basis for the site, was attended by the novelist Vera Brittain, mother of the politician Shirley Williams.[6] The Kingswood site, which included sports fields, a park, a large and luxurious swimming pool, a canteen and a simulacrum of an English pub, among other facilities, was expanded in the 1950s and again in the 1980s.[7] In 2015, it was announced that the headquarters would close "potentially before 2025".[8][9] In fact, after a period of uncertainty for the staff at Kingswood,[10] it was announced that the site would shut much earlier, in 2018.[11]
The previous Legal & General logo incorporates the image of the Temple Bar (which is still used in the logo of the company's social and athletic committee), and the founding date. The umbrella logo used today was introduced by former Chief Press Officer Gordon Macdonald in June 1984. Between 1991 and 1994, Legal and General sponsored the Regional Weather Forecasts for the ITV network and in 1999, Legal & General announced plans, which never came to fruition, to merge its business with National Westminster Bank to form the first 'bancassurance' company in the UK.[12]
2000 to present[edit]
The company sold the Legal & General Bank and Legal & General Mortgage Services to Northern Rock in 2003[13] and sold its stake in Gresham Insurance, its joint venture with Barclays Bank, to Barclays in 2005.[14]
In 2008 Legal & General bought Suffolk Life, a provider of Self Invested Pension products,[15] sold Suffolk Life in 2016 and also outsourced its IT development areas to TCS (Tata Consultancy Services).[16] The company formed a joint venture with two Indian public sector banks, Bank of Baroda and Andhra Bank to launch IndiaFirst Life Insurance Company in India in 2009[17] and outsourced some IT areas to IBM in October 2010.[18]
In 2014, the company formed Legal & General Reinsurance, a Bermudian-based reinsurance company. Legal & General Re completed its maiden external transaction in the Dutch market in cooperation with Hannover Re in December 2015.[19] Legal & General has expanded its operations in the last five years, taking over Lucida Life in 2013 and acquiring the £3 billion UK annuity portfolio of Aegon in 2016. Since 2014, the company has sought out better returns on its annuity and shareholder funds by committing to invest £15 billion in UK infrastructure projects such as urban regeneration, housing, clean energy and small business finance. This has involved the group partnering with many financial organisations, including the Dutch pension fund, PGGM and Pemberton Asset Management.
Operations[edit]
The company offers a wide range of products for individuals and corporate businesses. Its investment management is the UK’s largest investment manager of UK pension fund assets and has a growing US business, based in Chicago, Illinois. Legal & General’s core business focuses upon helping companies provide pension benefits for employees. As well as being one of the UK’s largest providers of auto-enrolled pension pensions, with over 2.2 million customers, the group also helps companies with defined benefit pension schemes meet their liabilities through investment strategies and even taking over the liability to pay company pensions.
Legal & General’s life insurance business is the UK’s largest, providing cover for both individuals and companies. The group is seeking to expand its life insurance businesses in the US and India.
Legal & General is planning to help provide solutions for the UK’s housing shortage through its investments in building new homes to buy and to rent. The company’s range of construction initiatives, includes establishing a pioneering high-tech modular housing factory in Yorkshire.
Senior management[edit]
In the 1970s and early 1980s, Ron Peet, a socially-conscious actuary, was CEO of Legal & General, having previously headed its Australian operation.[20] Peet helped the campaign for Thalidomide children, Legal & General then owning a large bloc of shares (3.5 million) in Distillers.[21][22]
Dr Nigel Wilson (the previous CFO) became Group Chief Executive on 30 June 2012.[23] He succeeded Tim Breedon, who had been CEO since 1 January 2006 and who was paid an annual salary of £770,000.[24]
Other senior management include Jeff Davies (Group Chief Financial Officer), Mark Zinkula (CEO of Legal & General Investment Management, the investment management arm of the firm) and Kerrigan Procter, (CEO of the group’s retirement business). Together with Nigel Wilson they form Legal & General's executive board.[25]

The RDF data is serialized using the N-Triples format, encoded as UTF-8 text and compressed with Gzip.

If you're writing your own code to parse the RDF dumps its often more efficient to read directly from GZip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data.
<subject>  <predicate>  <object> .
Note: In Freebase, objects have MIDs that look like /m/012rkqx. In RDF those MIDs become m.012rkqx. Likewise, Freebase schema like /common/topic are written as common.topic.
The subject is the ID of a Freebase object. It can be a Freebase MID (ex. m.012rkqx) for topics and CVTs or a human-readable ID (ex. common.topic) for schema.
The predicate is always a human-readable ID for a Freebase property or a property from a standard RDF vocabulary like RDFS. Freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace.
The object field may contain a Freebase MID for an object or a human-readable ID for schema from Freebase or other RDF vocabularies. It may also include literal values like strings, booleans and numeric values.
Topic descriptions often contain newlines. In order to make each triple fit on one line, we have escaped newlines with "\n".
Freebase Deleted Triples
We also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from Freebase over time. This is a one-time dump through March 2013. In the future, we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples, but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so, and are only providing this one-time dump. 

The dump is distributed as a .tar.gz file (2.1Gb compressed, 7.7Gb uncompressed). It contains 63,036,271 deleted triples in 20 files (there is no particular meaning to the individual files, it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file).


Thanks to Chun How Tan and John Giannandrea for making this data release possible.

The data format is essentially CSV with one important caveat. The object field may contain any characters, including commas (as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of). However, all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas, so the data can still be parsed unambiguously.

The columns in the dataset are defined as:
