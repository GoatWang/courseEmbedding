Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) are sold only by prospectus. Investors should read the prospectus carefully before investing which contains a detailed explanation of the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses. Investors should consult their accounting, legal, or tax advisor.


* Information labeled “Fee-Based Account” provides information pertaining to units purchased through registered investment advisers, certified financial planners or registered broker-dealers who in each case either charge investor accounts periodic fees for brokerage services, financial planning, investment advisory or asset management services, or provide such services in connection with an investment account for which a comprehensive “wrap fee” charge is imposed. You should consult your financial advisor to determine whether you can benefit from these accounts and whether your unit purchases are eligible for this discount. To purchase units in these accounts, your financial advisor must purchase units designated with one of the Fee Account CUSIP numbers, if available. The amounts shown are different from what would be applicable for units purchased in other accounts (i.e. “Commission-Based Accounts”) not eligible for this discount.  See your prospectus and consult your financial advisor for more information about eligibility and applicability of the Fee-Based Account discount.

About Us























Who we are
                
Tompkins Financial Advisors is a boutique wealth management firm that offers a full suite of services. We take tremendous pride in our comprehensive approach to serving our clients’ best interests, a key factor in our 95+% client retention rate.
                


What we do
                
We work toward protecting your family's financial health for generations. No matter where you are, our team can help get you on the path to where you want to go. We specialize in our client relationships and strategies that yield lasting results.
                


How we do it
                
Our holistic approach to financial guidance starts with establishing a personal relationship. Once we understand your values and goals, we’ll tailor our recommendations so you can pursue your dreams.
                


What makes us different?
                
We believe in common sense investing, which combines “Right Kind, Right Reason” diversification with an effective risk management. We match each client's financial resources with their financial liabilities and goals, rather than simply trying to generate maximum investment return.
                
Our asset management services are available based on a stated fee schedule, ensuring you and your wealth advisor are focused on the same goal: to protect the long-term performance of your investment portfolio.

Our VisionOur Team 






 





Capturing Results Through Innovation and Discipline Through a structured and disciplined approach we will provide exclusivity and customized investment strategies for our clients.  We will be distinguishable by the personal relationships we build with our clients, truly listening to and understanding their financial goals and objectives.


Right around the midpoint in life, humans tend to learn that if you make a decision in an emotional state of mind, you have a great chance of making the wrong choice.  Among the most damaging emotions of all are greed and fear.


Fortunately, life experience serves you well and success is achieved in family and in business.  This wisdom brings financial rewards.  Sound decision making allows you to achieve substantial life goals and to surround yourself with friends and colleagues who have the same long-range vision.  


Yet when it comes to investing in the market, seasoned life veterans inadvertently join hands with an entire population that never learned the same lessons.  Unknowingly, their investments are commingled with approximately 85% of the marketplace who make investment decisions based on greed and fear.  This herd mentality drives the market impacting your holdings at this very moment…

Factoid of the Day


Tuesday, July 25, 2017






The Weather Company announced yesterday that it expects a total of 15 named storms and eight hurricanes (three will be major in scope) in the Atlantic this hurricane season. The 2017 season began on June 1. Its forecast matches the average amount of activity posted from 1995 through 2016 (15 named storms and eight hurricanes/three major in scope). Since 1980, there have been 32 hurricanes in the U.S. that produced damages in excess of $1 billion, according to the National Centers for Environmental Information and Bloomberg. The combined losses, adjusted for inflation, totaled $549.9 billion, with Katrina (2005) accounting for $156.3 billion of it.

A Skilled, Experienced Team
The Duckworth Haggerty Group works closely with individuals, families and institutions as they address the complex challenges of preserving, enhancing and managing their wealth.  We are driven by the strongly held belief that our purposeful effort—matched with our individual and collective skills—can help clients improve the quality of their lives.
Michael D. Duckworth and Jennifer Haggerty, our team's Private Wealth Advisors, are highly trained and dedicated to the delivery of innovative financial strategies and solutions often demanded by the intricacies of substantial wealth. With more than two decades of professional experience to draw upon, Michael and Jennifer focus on small numbers of ultra-high-net-worth clients so they can devote the necessary time and understanding to help them manage the financial responsibilities—including retirement and tax minimization strategies—that can accompany great wealth.
To be able to provide the personal attention and responsiveness they believe is required to support their practice, Michael and Jennifer work with our team's Merrill Lynch wealth management advisors and financial advisors, who can add insurance and investment analytics, and provide access to Bank of America's trust and estate planning services, to The Duckworth Haggerty Group's overall capabilities. This emphasis on teamwork helps us create a personalized financial strategy for each client, including in-depth analyses, tracking and a wide range of targeted reports to help clients understand where they are and where they may be headed.
Our approach is multidimensional and includes investment advice and guidance; risk management; retirement income planning services; wealth transfer, trust and estate planning services; and care coordination* for families with special needs, as well as access to Bank of America banking services. 

Private Banking and Investment Group
Private Banking and Investment Group provides tailored solutions to help meet the distinct needs of individuals and families with substantial wealth. Clients are served with a boutique-like approach by teams of rigorously trained and experienced advisors who are skilled in working with wealthy clients, their families and businesses. Clients can enjoy a caliber of resources and future-focused strategies that is typically reserved for the world's largest enterprises. The PBIG Accreditation Program identifies financial advisors who demonstrate the technical proficiency necessary to deliver exceptional service exclusively to ultra-high-net-worth individuals. The program assesses a team's business model and skill in the strategies and solutions that best address the needs of those clients. Advisors must pass an oral assessment process to become private wealth advisors.
Merrill Lynch
Merrill Lynch offers a broad range of brokerage, investment advisory and other services, including insurance and investment analytics and estate planning services. Our advisors are available to work closely with the clients' other trusted advisors, including accountants, attorneys and tax specialists. We can provide access to trust and lending services through Bank of America specialists.







We work with a select client base and go to great lengths to establish a deep connection to each client. Your client experience will be a function of outstanding financial advisors and access to a vast array of resources.
Michael D. Duckworth
        Managing Director—Wealth Management
        Private Wealth Advisor


We Focus on Building Relationships
The single most important determinant of your experience with us is the quality of the relationship we develop with you. You expect thoughtful, professional financial advice and guidance, and The Duckworth Haggerty Group is committed to delivering it. However, it is the information that flows
from the relationship—about you, your family, your goals, dreams and concerns—that allows us to offer value-added advice and guidance tailored specifically for you. 

We believe you deserve a well-thought-out, individualized wealth management strategy that is fundamentally based on what is important to you, your family and your collective financial future.
We help you develop, implement and review your strategy by leveraging the investment insights of Merrill Lynch and the banking convenience of Bank of America.
We emphasize asset allocation, risk-awareness and diversification in our disciplined investment process.
We review client investment portfolios to help ensure asset class exposure stays aligned with your long-term allocation strategy. 








Our wealth management process is driven by you.  Your vision of the future, your financial needs and life passions are critical ingredients.
Jennifer L. Haggerty
        Senior Vice President–Wealth Management
        Private Wealth Advisor


A Wealth Management Strategy Centered on You 
A thoughtful, customized wealth strategy does not come "off the shelf." It evolves from information that we learn about you and your family. We focus on the broad aspects of your financial life, from wealth accumulation, preservation and intergenerational transfers to philanthropic giving and legacy planning strategies.
Laying the foundation for an individualized strategy requires insight and discipline. It is a process that begins with gathering information about you so that your strategy and investments reflect your values. The process is dynamic and requires steadfast attention so that your strategy can change as your life changes.
Your investments are the power behind your wealth management strategy. How we help you structure your portfolios and manage your investments depends, to a large extent, on your goals, time horizon, tolerance for risk, liquidity needs, current and future needs for income, and your tax situation.
Also, as a client of the Private Banking and Investment Group, you join a select clientele of corporate executives, entrepreneurs, athletes and other successful individuals and families. You have access to a full range of resources and strategies, including those reserved for the world's largest financial institutions. 







We are sensitive to both the financial and emotional challenges of providing support for a loved one who has a special need or disability.
Michael D. Duckworth
        Managing Director—Wealth Management
        Private Wealth Advisor


Services for Families With Special Care Needs
The Duckworth Haggerty Group has experience helping high-net-worth families across the country address the issues involved in funding lifetime care and support for a child or other family member with special needs. We recognize that preserving the wealth you have accumulated is an important concern, and we can help you develop strategies designed to avoid well-intentioned but inappropriate actions that may adversely affect the long-term financial security of your family member with special needs.
We can also work with you and your family to integrate special needs concerns into your broader wealth management approach. Our aim is to offer a high-quality concierge service, acting as an intermediary between you and the services your wealth enables. Our services include:

Advice and guidance on allocating funds to provide for a client's current and future financial needs.
If appropriate, coordinating with clients' other professional advisors (including CPAs, attorneys and fiduciaries) and specialized resource providers (such as medical equipment vendors, rehabilitative health care professionals or payroll services).
Educating and assisting clients to make informed decisions on wealth preservation and legacy planning strategies.
Helping families determine eligibility for public benefits. 








As part of a remarkable financial services company that is distinguished by its people, thought leadership and global presence, we are dedicated to using these considerable capabilities for your benefit.

        Managing Director—Wealth Management
        Private Wealth Advisor

Insured Municipals Income Trust (IMIT0689)
	
		





Objective
The Insured Municipals Income Trust, a unit investment trust, invests in a portfolio of insured tax-exempt municipal bonds. The trust seeks to provide federal tax-exempt income* and to preserve capital.**
On the date of deposit, the bonds included in an Insured Municipals Income Trust have been rated at least A- by Standard & Poor's or rated at least A3 by Moody's Investors Service, Inc., or if not rated as of the date of deposit, are insured by a bond insurer rated at least A- by Standard & Poor's or rated at least A3 by Moody's. While no representation is made as to the insurer's ability to meet its commitments, this rating is due to the claims-paying ability of the insurers that provide coverage on the bonds in the trust's portfolio not on units of the trust. 
For further details as to the terms and limitations of the insurance, please consult a prospectus.




* A portion of your interest income may be subject to state or local taxes
** Due to the nature of municipal bonds, there is a risk that a bond may be called before maturity, potentially below the par value of the bond, and investors may be unable to reinvest their principal at the same rate of return.

1Estimated current return (ECR) is based on the estimated annual income as a percentage of the current price of the units. Estimated long-term return (ELTR) is calculated using a formula which (1) takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values, yields (which takes into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts) and estimated retirement of all the bonds in the trust and (2) takes into account the expenses and sales charge associated with each trust unit. There can be no assurance that either the estimated current return or ELTR will be realized in the future and an investor's units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
2The ELTR life represents the estimated life of the bonds in a Trust's portfolio determined for the purposes of calculating Estimated Long-Term Return.
3Estimated Annual Income Per Unit is as of close the most recent business day and is based on the estimated cash flows per unit. This amount will vary with changes in expenses, interest rates and the maturity, call or sale of bonds.
4Estimated Daily Rate of Accrual represents the annual interest from the securities within the portfolio divided by the number of days on which interest is calculated annually.
5Represents the principal amount of the underlying bonds per unit. Bonds may be sold to meet redemptions, to pay expenses, and in other limited circumstances. The sale of bonds will affect the principal amount of bonds included in the trust and as a result the principal amount of bonds per unit. There can be no assurance that a unitholder will receive this par value per unit in the future.


For Fixed-Income trusts, "S.F." indicates a sinking fund is established with respect to an issue of bonds.The trust portfolio is provided for informational purposes only and should not be deemed as a recommendation to buy or sell the individual securities shown above.



 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.
An investment in a trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.
The value of the bonds will generally fall if interest rates, in general, rise. Given the historically low interest rate environment in the U.S., risks associated with rising rates are heightened. The negative impact on fixed income securities from any interest rate increases could be swift and significant. No one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future.
A bond issuer may cease to be rated or its ratings may be downgraded. Such action may adversely effect the value of the bonds in the trust and the value of the units.
The insurance provides coverage for the bonds held by the trust, not on units of the trust.
Invesco and its representatives do not provide tax advice. Individuals should consult their personal tax advisors before making any tax-related investment decisions.
Please see the Information Supplement  for a discussion of situations in which the Trust may designate previously distributed interest income during the year as taxable net capital gain in order to satisfy certain of the annual distribution requirements for regulated investment companies.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specific securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D/C (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice. For more information on Standard and Poor's rating methodology, please visit www.standardandpoors.com and select "Understanding Ratings" under Rating Resources on the homepage or Moody's at www.moodys.com and select "Rating Methodologies" under Research and Ratings on the homepage.

1The S&P and Moody's ratings apply to the bonds held by the trust, and not the trust itself.   A Standard & Poor's credit rating is a current opinion of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation. This opinion of creditworthiness may take into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors, insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation.  Moody's municipal ratings are opinions of the investment quality of the issues and issues in the US municipal and tax-exempt markets. As such, these ratings incorporate Moody's assessment of the default probability and loss severity of these issuers and issues.

LIQUIDATION PRICE  Represents the value per unit that a unitholder would receive if the unitholder redeemed or sold units. This price is equal to the net asset value per unit plus any remaining organization costs and creation and development fee. This price reflects any remaining deferred sales charges payable in connection with a liquidation of units.
OFFER PRICE Represents the net asset value per unit plus any applicable organization costs and sales charges. This is the regular public offering price per unit paid to purchase units. This price is often subject to certain sales charge discounts described in a trust prospectus.

 Important Information About Benchmarks





About risk



There is no assurance that a unit investment trust will achieve its investment objective. An investment in this unit trust is subject to market risk, which is the possibility that the market values of securities owned by the trust will decline and that the value of trust units may therefore be less than what you paid for them. This trust is unmanaged. Accordingly, you can lose money investing in this trust.
An investment in a trust should be made with an understanding of the risks associated therewith, such as the inability of the issuer or an insurer to pay the principal of or interest on a bond when due, volatile interest rates, early call provisions and changes to the tax status of the bonds. As interest rates rise, bond prices fall.
The value of the bonds will generally fall if interest rates, in general, rise. Given the historically low interest rate environment in the U.S., risks associated with rising rates are heightened. The negative impact on fixed income securities from any interest rate increases could be swift and significant. No one can predict whether interest rates will rise or fall in the future.
A bond issuer may cease to be rated or its ratings may be downgraded. Such action may adversely effect the value of the bonds in the trust and the value of the units.
The insurance provides coverage for the bonds held by the trust, not on units of the trust.
Invesco and its representatives do not provide tax advice. Individuals should consult their personal tax advisors before making any tax-related investment decisions.
Please see the Information Supplement  for a discussion of situations in which the Trust may designate previously distributed interest income during the year as taxable net capital gain in order to satisfy certain of the annual distribution requirements for regulated investment companies.
A credit rating is an assessment provided by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization (NRSRO) of the creditworthiness of an issuer with respect to debt obligations, including specific securities, money market instruments or other debts. Ratings are measured on a scale that generally ranges from AAA/Aaa (highest) to D/C (lowest); ratings are subject to change without notice.

Investment returns and principal value will fluctuate and units, when redeemed, may be worth more or less than their original cost.
Returns are cumulative total returns (not annualized) unless labeled as average annual total returns. All returns reflect trust expenses as incurred and assume reinvestment of income and principal distributions, except for trusts that do not offer the option of reinvesting distributions into additional trust units. Please see the related trust prospectus for additional information. Returns do not reflect taxes.

In these cases, returns will not reflect a sales charge if a trust was not actually offered for sale to the public on the first day of the applicable period because units of the trust could not have been purchased by an investor at that time. These returns will show 'N/A' for With Sales Charge data
